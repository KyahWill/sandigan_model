				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As a general rule, questions of fact may not be raised in a petition for review.&nbsp; However, when the findings of the appellate court differ from those of the trial court, this Court may examine the evidence presented during the trial and resolve the factual matters raised.&nbsp; In the present case, the Court of Appeals clearly erred in appreciating the facts and should thus be reversed in the interest of substantial justice.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Case</b></center><br>Before this Court is a Petition for Review assailing the May 15, 1996 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 45722, which set aside the judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Manila.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of the National Capital Judicial Region, Branch 13, dated 13 January 1993 declaring plaintiff the lawful owner of the subject vehicle, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Intervenor-appellant is declared entitled to the ownership and possession of the vehicle.&nbsp; No costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>The reversed RTC Decision disposed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered declaring plaintiff the owner, and entitled to the possession of the motor vehicle subject of the order of seizure in this case.&nbsp; The complaint in intervention is dismissed.&nbsp; There is no pronouncement as to costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>Also challenged is the February 19, 1997 CA Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The Facts</b></center><br>In its Decision, the Court of Appeals narrated the facts of this case, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Plaintiff [herein petitioner] was the insurer of a motor vehicle with the following description, to wit: MAKE AND TYPE:&nbsp; 1987 4-dr Mitsubishi Pajero; MOTOR NO.:&nbsp; BR-5799; CHASSIS NO.:&nbsp; L-04-9GV-0034B; PLATE NO:&nbsp; UV-PJD-347.<br><br>"The Pajero, previously registered in the name of one Gerald Brimo, was carnapped on 5 June 1988 at the parking lot of Greenbelt, Makati.&nbsp; Brimo immediately reported the incident to police authorities, prompting anti-carnapping operatives to include the Pajero in its list of carnapped vehicles.<br><br>"Lt. Angelito Tan of the Constabulary Highway Patrol Group, in Bacolod City, received information that the Pajero was carnapped.<br><br>"Subsequently, Lt. Tan saw a Mitsubishi Pajero bearing plate no. CHG 608 traversing the streets of Bacolod City.&nbsp; Knowing that plate numbers starting with the letter series CHG come from Central Luzon, Lt. Tan became suspicious and traced the origin of said plate number.<br><br>"The record further shows that intervenor Eduardo Conde agreed to buy a Mitsubishi Pajero from one Gregorio Elardo thru a broker named Jose Villo.&nbsp; Elardo and Villo brought the vehicle and its pertinent documents to Conde, who had the engine chassis cleaned and stenciled.&nbsp; He found the same to be uniform.&nbsp; He also verified the chassis number and the registration papers of the vehicle with the chief of the LTO, Bacolod.&nbsp; Thereafter, Conde had the vehicle inspected by Capt. Alcantara of the Constabulary Highway Patrol Group of Bacolod.<br><br>"Satisfied that everything was in order, on 28 July 1988, a deed of sale of the vehicle was executed in favor of Conde by Elardo.<br><br>"On 4 August 1988, while Conde was in Manila, he was informed that the subject vehicle was seized in Bacolod on suspicion that it was the vehicle stolen from Brimo.&nbsp; Apparently, Lt. Tan's investigations into the mysterious Pajero seen in Bacolod led him to apprehend the vehicle.<br><br>"Thus, the intervenor left the next day for Bacolod and presented the vehicle's papers to the CHPG.&nbsp; The vehicle's release was ordered after the intervenor signed an undertaking that he would return the vehicle if and when required by the CHPG.<br><br>"On the advice of a friend, the intervenor later brought the vehicle's engine and chassis to Manila for macro-etching.<br><br>"Thus, on 10 August 1988, upon instructions of Lt. Ganzon of the PC's anti-carnapping unit, two soldiers conducted a macro-etching of the engine and chassis numbers in the following manner: wiping the engine and chassis, stenciling, placing chemicals on the chassis, making a third stencilling, all the while taking pictures of the procedure.<br><br>"Subsequently, there were no findings that the engine and chassis were tampered.&nbsp; The results were fed [to] a computer and after verifying that the engine was not carnapped, Lt. Ganzon issued a certification which stated "no record." Thereafter, the engine and chassis were returned to Bacolod.<br><br>"Be that as it may, on 12 August 1988, Lt. Tan arrested Gregorio Elardo, from whom intervenor bought this vehicle, on charges of carnapping.&nbsp; Intervenor was informed of the arrest.<br><br>"Lt. Tan also informed the intervenor that the motor vehicle clearance given him was irregular because of the spurious documentation presented in support of the application of said clearance, and that the plate no. CHG-608 was assigned to another vehicle owned by a Mr. Layug.<br><br>"In addition, Tan informed intervenor that the LTO certificate of registration (No. 1825725) issued to a certain Francisco Esguerra, allegedly the owner of the intervenor's Pajero, was likewise of dubious origin.&nbsp; On its face, it appears that the said certificate was issued by the Angeles City Office of the LTO.&nbsp; Upon proper verification, however, said certificate series was an issuance of the Manila East Office, while the motor vehicle registration receipt was issued for the use of LTO Legaspi.<br><br>"Thus, on 28 October 1988, the city court of Bacolod issued a warrant by virtue of which the subject Pajero was again seized and impounded by the Bacolod CHPG for the purpose of macro-etching.<br><br>"Intervenor Conde moved to have the warrant quashed.&nbsp; While hearings on the motion to quash were being held, Lt. Tan was designated legal custodian of the vehicle and was instructed not to move nor to use the same.<br><br>"Then, on 3 November, 1988, a certain Sgt. Agadulin of the PC-INP Crime Laboratory in Bacolod conducted further macro-etching of the engine and the chassis numbers of the subject vehicle. Present were Lt. Tan, Sgt. Agadulin, and the intervenor.<br><br>"After the macro-etching was finished, the intervenor requested [copies] of the stencils, which however were not given him because there was no court order.&nbsp; Intervenor thus secured one but the CHPG still did not release the vehicle.<br><br>"It was later learned that the report on the macro-etching stated that there were filings on the chassis number, such that the eighth digit, originally a "3", became a "5".<br><br>"In the meantime, plaintiff indemnified Brimo P571,000 for the value of his lost vehicle and was in turn subrogated to all the rights the latter had over the same.<br><br>"Subsequently, however, an order for the seizure of personal property was issued by the trial court in Manila, prompting Lt. Tan to recommend shipment of the Pajero to Manila. The sheriff's notice to deliver personal property was forwarded to defendant Bruan as group commander of the CHPG in Camp Crame.<br><br>"In addition, plaintiff moved to intervene in the proceedings before the Bacolod City court on the quashal of the search warrant.&nbsp; During the hearing of said motion, plaintiff never informed the city court that it had earlier filed a replevin case covering the subject vehicle and that a seizure order had already been issued therein.<br><br>"On 16 March 1989, Conde filed a complaint in intervention before the Manila trial court, alleging that he purchased his Pajero on the strength of a clearance from the CHPG in Bacolod.<br><br>"After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered the questioned decision dismissing the complaint in intervention, and declaring plaintiff the lawful owner of the vehicle, and as such entitled to the possession of the same."<br></blockquote><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></center><br><br>In reversing the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner failed to prove that the Pajero in question was the same vehicle carnapped from Brimo.&nbsp; It ruled:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"The court a quo made a mistaken appreciation of the burden of proof in civil cases, since the plaintiff, and not the defendant, is the party obliged to prove its affirmative allegation, to wit:&nbsp; that there were signs of filing and tampering [with] the chassis number of the intervenor's vehicle, allegedly the very same Pajero which was originally carnapped in Makati, thus proving the identity of the two disputably different vehicles as one and the same.<br><br>"It was not incumbent upon the intervenor at the first instance to prove that there was no filing, because the burden of proof was not on him.<br><br>"Apropos to this, we rule that such signs of filing and tampering were not proven by the plaintiff by the required quantum of evidence.<br><br>"To prove his theory, the plaintiff relied heavily on the expert testimony of Sgt. Agadulin, a government technician and an expert in the tampering, and insists on the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed.&nbsp; However, this presumption is merely disputable.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>"Thus, the official findings of Agadulin as an expert witness will not hold ground in the face of equally strong, or even stronger, evidence to the contrary.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br><br>"True, Conde's vehicle may have had dubious origins, as shown by its accompanying papers, but the same vehicle may not necessarily be the one owned by Brimo.&nbsp; Indeed, the rise in the number of carnapped vehicles over the years is a fact of which present courts take judicial notice, such that one cannot reasonably assume identity of stolen vehicles without thorough investigation.<br><br>"There being no identity between Brimo's and Conde's Pajeros, the petition for delivery of the subject Pajero to plaintiff, which is the subrogee of Brimo's rights over the stolen Pajero, must perforce fail."</blockquote><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Issues</b></center><br><br>Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in the following instances:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br><br>"x x x [W]hen it manifestly ignored the petitioner-plaintiff's overwhelming evidence that the Pajero in question [was] the same Pajero which was owned by Gerald H.

Edmundo Agadulin, who stated that Brimo's stolen vehicle and Intervenor Conde's Pajero were one and the same.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals disbelieved Agadulin's testimony, ratiocinating that it was contradicted by equally strong evidence.<br><br>That the two cars were one and the same was sufficiently established by Sergeant Agadulin, who conducted a macro-etching examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for the purpose of "determin[ing] the original engine and chassis numbers"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the vehicle in dispute.&nbsp; The Pajero claimed by Conde bore Chassis No. "L049GV-0054B"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which tallied with that appearing on his Certificate of Registration.&nbsp; After the macro-etching examination, however, Agadulin found that the said number had been tampered with, the original number being "L049GV-0034B." A subsequent verification with the records of the Constabulary Highway Patrol Group (CHPG) revealed that that number, "L049GV-0034B," was the identifying mark of Brimo's vehicle.<br><br>After conducting the examination, Sergeant Agadulin submitted a Physical Identification Report, with the following findings regarding the chassis number of Conde's Pajero:<br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presence of sign of filing and alteration on the 8<sup>th</sup> digit 5 which appeared to be originally 3.<br><br>2.&nbsp; The restored chassis number is L049GV-0034B."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>He testified as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Now will you please tell us what did you find in the engine number when you examined it? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">In the engine number I found out the presence of grinding.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"><center>x x x x x x x x x</center></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>And did you find any superimposition [o]n these numbers?</i></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Yes, sir.

In the absence of controverting evidence, his testimony is entitled to great weight and credence.<br><br>Contrast the foregoing with the undisputed fact that the recorded chassis number of Intervenor Conde's Pajero, L049GV-0054B, had been previously assigned to another vehicle.&nbsp; Union Motor Corporation had sold a Pajero with that chassis number to one Cheng Poe Kee on January 29, 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and the insurer of the vehicle issued a Certification dated June 16, 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> with the conformity of Cheng Poe Kee, that the said vehicle had not been stolen. Indeed, the sole authorized assembler of Mitsubishi vehicles in the Philippines, the Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corporation (PAMCOR), certified that a particular chassis number was issued only once; hence, there was no chance that two vehicles would have an identical chassis number.<br><br>Other circumstances point to the dubious character of Conde's title. <i>First</i>, Plate No. CHG 608, which intervenor's Pajero bore, had been assigned by the LTO to another vehicle. Upon the request of Lt. Angelito Tan of the CHPG, the Land Transportation Office Ancar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Unit certified that the said plate number had been issued on June 20, 1988 to a <i>Toyota Jitney</i> owned by one Valeriano Layug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and not to a Pajero owned by Conde.<br><br><i>Second</i>, Certificate of Registration No. 1825725 purportedly issued by the <i>Angeles City LTO</i> to Francisco Esguerra, the predecessor-in-interest of Intervenor Conde, is patently fraudulent on its face.&nbsp; The officer-in-charge of the LTO Property Administrative Division issued a Certification that the series of registration certificates, which included Esguerra's, had in fact been issued for the use of the <i>LTO Manila East Office</i>.<br><br>Significantly, Intervenor Conde has failed to rebut these documentary exhibits.&nbsp; Verily, Agadulin's testimony and the aforementioned documents indubitably show that Conde's purported ownership is a sham.&nbsp; More significantly, the Pajero is in plain fact the carnapped vehicle reported by Brimo. In ruling that Conde was "entitled to the ownership and possession of the vehicle," the Court of Appeals patently brushed aside Agadulin's credible testimony and the unrebutted documentary evidence, all of which clearly and absolutely negated Conde's title.<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Contrary Evidence<br> Considered by the CA</i><br><br>Disregarding the testimony of Agadulin, the CA held that his averments "will not hold ground in the face of equally strong, or even stronger, evidence, to the contrary."

This fact, however, did not prove intervenor's claim.&nbsp; The said July 4, 1988 Certification, signed by Captain Ernesto M. Alcantara and Delano Padilla of the Bacolod LTO, merely stated that "as per records of this Headquarters, the Motor Vehicle described hereunder is not included in the list of wanted/stolen/carnapped vehicles as of this date."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Verily, Conde's Pajero could not have been in the list of carnapped vehicles, because its chassis number at the time had already been tampered with, so as to reflect that of Cheng Poe Kee's automobile, which had not been stolen. Furthermore, neither the Bacolod LTO nor Captain Alcantara conducted any macro-etching examination to determine whether the chassis and the engine numbers had been tampered with.&nbsp; In any event, there was no showing that Delano and Alcantara had been trained to perform that procedure.<br><br>Moreover, the credibility of Captain Alcantara was challenged by Lt.

In other words, the examination merely showed there was no record that the vehicle bearing Chassis No. L049GV-0054B, had been stolen or carnapped.&nbsp; As earlier noted, that result should be expected, because the said chassis number pertained to Cheng Poe Kee's car which had not been reported stolen.&nbsp; In any event, the said document clearly stated that it was not valid as a "vehicle clearance."<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Alleged Admission of Tan<br> and Agadulin that the Chassis <br>Number was `L049GV-0054B'</i><br><br>The CA held that Tan and Agadulin had admitted that the chassis number of Conde's vehicle was "L049GV-0054B" even after the macro-etching examination This was clearly a misapprehension of fact.&nbsp; Nowhere did the two make such admission.&nbsp; Agadulin merely stated that the chassis number of Conde's Pajero, <i>before</i> the macro-etching examination, appeared to be "L049GV-0054B." After finding out that the number had been tampered with, he subsequently restored it and discovered that the original number was in fact "L049GV-0034B."

Conde declared that such examination had been conducted by other policemen who, however, never took the witness stand or submitted any stencil or any other proof of the examination.<br><br>Worse, the Registration Certificate of Conde's Pajero, indicating the chassis number "L04GPV-0054B," proves that the number had itself been the result of tampering even<i> before</i> the vehicle was taken to the CHPG.&nbsp; As noted earlier, that chassis number had been assigned by PAMCOR to a vehicle purchased by Cheng Poe Kee.<br><br>On the basis of the foregoing, it is clear that the CA misappreciated the evidence presented and relied on speculations and unfounded conclusions.&nbsp; The records unmistakably show that Conde's Pajero and Brimo's carnapped vehicle were one and the same.
