They were blessed with eight (8) children, namely, Elena, Maximino, Perpetua, Santiago, Adelaida, Miguel, Rafael, and Vicente, all surnamed Crucillo. </p> <p>Balbino A. Crucillo died intestate in 1909. Juana Aure died on November 19, 1949. Balbino A.

Crucillo were Adelaida Crucillo, Miguel Crucillo, and Rafael Crucillo. The other children above-named died, and were survived by their respective heirs, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>1.

Still another property covered by Tax Declaration No. 653 (Exh. ‘10’) is owned in common by Buenaventurada Sarmiento and Vicente Crucillo, whose share was acquired by Miguel Crucillo. </p> <p>Additionally, Primitiva Mendoza is in possession of an agricultural land in Pulong Munti and also in Niko, Mendez, Cavite, while Carlomagno Crucillo possesses an agricultural land at Sitio Maykiling, Mendez, Cavite, Miguel Crucillo is exclusively occupying an agricultural land at Pulong Munti and Ulo ng Bukal, and the remaining portion another agricultural land after the other portion thereof had been sold by Rafael Crucillo. </p></blockquote> <p align="center">xxx</p> <blockquote> <p>When the Court conducted an ocular inspection of the property in dispute, it observed that Dr. Carlomagno Crucillo had erected a building of strong materials, which he utilizes as his clinic, on the southern portion of said land fronting Gen. Luna St., that Adelaida Crucillo had constructed her residence, which is also of strong materials, on the northern portion of said land fronting Gen. Luna St.; that between the clinic of Dr. Carlomagno Crucillo and the residential house of Adelaida Crucillo is the ancestral house’, which is erected on that portion of the said land which Rafael Crucillo sold to the defendants-spouses; and that the Heirs of Elena Crucillo had constructed a house of strong materials on the northern portion of said land fronting Aure St., (of Exhs. ‘X’ and ‘Y’) The Court further observed that a hollow block party wall separates the respective portion occupied by the residential house of Adelaida, the ‘ancestral house’, and the clinic of Dr. Carlomagno Crucillo, Judging from their appearance and condition, the improvements erected by Adelaida Crucillo, Dr. Carlomagno Crucillo, and the Heirs of Elena Crucillo are not less than then (10) years old.” (<em>Decision, Court of First Instance; see Amended Record on Appeal</em>) </p></blockquote> <p>From the foregoing facts, it can be gleaned unerringly that the heirs of Balbino A. Crucillo agreed to orally partition subject estate among themselves, as evinced by their possession of the inherited premises, their construction of improvements thereon, and their having declared in their names for taxation purposes their respective shares. These are indications that the heirs of Balbino A. Crucillo agreed to divide subject estate among themselves, for why should they construct improvements thereon, pay the taxes therefor, and exercise other acts of ownership, if they did not firmly believe that the property was theirs. It is certainly foolhardy for petitioners to claim that no oral partition was made when their acts showed otherwise. Moreover, it is unbelievable that the possession of the heirs was by mere tolerance, judging from the introduction of improvements thereon and the length of time that such improvements have been in existence. Then too, after exercising acts of ownership over their respective portions of the contested estate, petitioners are estopped from denying or contesting the existence of an oral partition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p> <p>Anent the second and third issues -- whether there was a valid conveyance by Rafael Crucillo of the lot subject matter of the “Kasulatan Sa Ganap Na Bilihan” to the spouses Felix Noceda and Benita Gatpandan-Noceda, and whether the latter spouses acquired true and lawful ownership thereof, including the ancestral house standing thereon, the Court also rules in the affirmative. As the existence of the oral partition of the estate of Balbino A. Crucillo by his heirs has been well established, it stands to reason and conclude that Rafael Crucillo could validly convey his share therein to the spouses Felix Noceda and Benita Gatpandan-Noceda who then became the true and lawful owners thereof, including the ancestral house existing thereon. Petitioners have, therefore, no right to redeem the same property from the spouses Noceda because when the sale was made they were no longer co-owners thereof, the same having become the sole property of respondent Rafael Crucillo. </p> <p>As regards petitioners’ prayer for an award to them of actual and moral damages and attorney’s fees, the same is denied for want of proper basis in law and jurisprudence. </p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Resolution dated October 7, 1983 of the former Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) is AFFIRMED.</p> <p>No pronouncement as to costs.</p> <p>SO ORDERED. </p> <p><em>Melo</em>, (Chairman), <em>Vitug, Panganiban</em>, and <em>Gonzaga-Reyes</em>, JJ., concur. <br><br><br><br></p> <hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"> <p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Marcelino R.
