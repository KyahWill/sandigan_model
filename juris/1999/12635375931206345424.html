				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When self-defense is invoked, the accused must establish clearly and convincingly <i>all </i>of the following: 1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, 2) reasonable necessity for the means employed to prevent or repel it, and 3) no sufficient provocation on the part of the defendant. Having admitted responsibility for the killing, the accused has the burden of proving the foregoing elements. Self-defense collapses upon failure to discharge this burden.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>Ricardo Janairo appeals the December 12, 1996 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 49) of Puerto Princesa City, which convicted him of homicide and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>On November 13, 1992, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> was filed charging appellant with murder allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 24th day of October, 1992, in the afternoon, at the Palawan State College [PSC] Compound, Barangay Tiniguiban, Puerto Princesa City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with treachery and evident premeditation, with intent to kill and while armed with a deadly weapon, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and stab one Bencibeis<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Aguilar, thereby inflicting upon the latter [a stab] wound on the chest, which was the direct and immediate cause of his death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Upon his arraignment on November 27, 1992, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, Counsel <i>de Parte</i> Perfecto de los Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>praying for reinvestigation, insisting that the charge should be changed to homicide. During the pre-trial on January 11, 1992, the lower court denied this Motion. Subsequently, the assistant city prosecutor filed a Motion to downgrade the crime charged from murder to homicide. Noting the conformity of the wife of the deceased, the court <i>a quo</i> issued an Order amending the Information by crossing out the phrase "with treachery and evident premeditation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Arraigned again<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> on April 13, 1993, appellant pleaded "not guilty." Trial ensued. Thereafter, the lower court promulgated its assailed Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds that the [p]rosecution has proven Ricardo Janairo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of [h]omicide and sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA with all its accessory penalties and to pay the heirs of Bencibeis Aguilar actual damages in the amount of P39,789.26 and P50,000.00 as compensation for the death of Bencibeis Aguilar."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts<br><br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></u></b></center><br>In its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the prosecution presents its version of the facts of the case in this wise:<br><blockquote>"At about four o'clock in the afternoon of October 24, 1992[,] Bencebeis `Pakay' Aguilar was walking towards his house inside the PSC Compound, Puerto Princesa City. Ricardo Janairo was walking towards Aguilar. When the two met at a certain point near Aguilar's house, Janairo suddenly stabbed Aguilar with a blade and immediately ran away.<br><br>"Aguilar managed to walk to his house where he fell in front of the stairs. He was brought to the hospital in San Pedro but he [eventually] died of the mortal wounds he sustained. The blade entered through the anterior left chest penetrating the heart.<br><br>"Previous to said incident, the two men had figured in an altercation. Janairo had asked permission from Aguilar, who was the guard on duty at the PSC gate, if he could bring a tricycle inside the compound. The request was denied by the latter. An exchange of words followed and ended with Janairo making a threat: `Babalikan ka namin.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote><center><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b></center><br>On the other hand, the Appellant's Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> narrates the facts in the following manner:<br><blockquote>"The case arose out of an incident which transpired on October 24, 1992 while accused was on his way out of the PSC Compound, where the accused met Bencebeis Aguilar. Bencebeis Aguilar berated Ricardo Janairo by calling the latter `son of a bitch, you are a brat'.<br><br>"Mr. Aguilar, by his words and facial expression, was drunk[.] This triggered an altercation between the two. For as testified by witness Elma Denalo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October 24, 1992, while she and Dina Mediodia were passing by [the] PSC compound, they saw two persons having an altercation as their action and tone of their voice [showed]. Elma Denalo came to know that the bigger one was Pakay Aguilar and the small one Ricardo Janairo. They were having an altercation facing each other. When Elma Denalo and companion were more or less 1 1/2 meters near the two persons having an altercation, she saw the two grapple for the possession of the knife.<br><br>"Ricardo Janairo testified that Bencebeis Aguilar likewise stabbed him with a knife, but he was able to parry the same. Thereafter, they both grappled for the possession of the knife. Ricardo Janairo was holding the hand of Bencebeis Aguilar and the latter likewise. Thereafter, Ricardo Janairo fell on top of Mr. Bencebeis Aguilar. After [that], the former stood up as did the latter[.]<br><br>"It was when the two of them fell that Bencebeis Aguilar was wounded. And afterwards, Ricardo Janairo stood up. Bencebeis Aguilar did likewise[,] after which, the latter again stabbed the former.<br><br>"Fortunately, Ricardo Janairo was not hit[.] Bencebeis Aguilar was drunk, as per his acts, voice and physical appearance[.] Had Ricardo Janairo wanted to kill Bencebeis Aguilar, he could have done it while the latter was down on the ground. Ricardo Janairo ran away after the second stab because he was afraid to be wounded and, because he had no intention to kill Bencebeis Aguilar[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b></center><br>The lower court pointed out that the "more crucial issue is whether or not the stabbing was intentional." In convicting appellant, the trial court ratiocinated as follows:<br><blockquote>"Examining the evidence for both parties, the Court finds [the p]rosecution evidence to be the more credible. The occurrence of the fight is [actually] not inconsistent with [p]rosecution's version of the event, because it [was] not improbable that before Janairo was actually able to stab Aguilar, they had grappled for possession of the knife. At any rate, Aguilar must have put up some resistance, which constituted the fight witnessed by [d]efense witnesses. The more plausible flow of events then, was that, upon encountering each other along the path, both accused and victim had an exchange of words which led [the] accused to draw a knife and stab the victim after the scuffle. The testimony of the accused is evasive and inconsistent. At first, he testified that after he and Aguilar had fallen to the ground, Aguilar got up and tried to stab him again, prompting him to run away. He claimed that at the time he ran away, he did not know that Aguilar had been wounded. Yet, he later testified that when arrested by authorities, he protested because he `had no intention to kill' Aguilar which could only [im]ply that he knew that Aguilar had been wounded. In fact, he knew enough to recall that when he fell on top of Aguilar, the blade of the knife was facing towards Aguilar.<br><br>"The testimony of Elma Denaco, the only witness who claims to have seen Aguilar produce the knife which eventually killed him, ha[d] its share of improbabilities. By her own account, when she and her companion saw accused and Aguilar grappling for the knife, they ran away through the PSC gate. Apparently, they did not bother to report the violent incident to the police, or even to the security guards [at] the PSC gate where they passed going home. Then, when she learned that Janairo was accused of killing Aguilar, she immediately went to have her statement taken by Atty. Perfecto de los Reyes. She was told to return in December to have her statement taken. The witness provides no explanation for her apparent reluctance to report the incident to the police authorities, which would have been the more natural course of action, considering the violent and serious nature of the incident.<br><br>"Given the evasiveness and improbability contained in defense witness testimonies, [the p]rosecution has presented the clearer and more credible case. Between the [p]rosecution eye-witnesses who [were] disinterested and [did] not stand to gain or lose by Janairo's conviction, and the accused himself, it [was] the former who would probably give the more accurate version of the incident."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues:<br><blockquote>"The lower court erred:<br><ol type="1"><li> In holding that the accused stabbed the victim intentionally;<br><br></li><li> In not holding that the accused stabbed the victim in self-defense;<br><br></li><li> In upholding the validity of the proceedings, when at one point in time, the accused was assisted by a lawyer who was an American citizen;<br><br></li><li> In imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua upon the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The main issue is whether or not he proved the elements of self-defense.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The appeal is partially granted. The trial court correctly convicted appellant of homicide, but erred in sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br><center><b><u>Preliminary Issues:<br><i>Validity of Court Proceedings</i></u></b></center><br><b><i><i>The Information</i></i></b><br><br>After the arraignment on November 27, 1992, the Information was amended. The charge was "down grad[ed]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> from murder to homicide, and the phrase "with treachery and evident premeditation" was crossed out from the Information. Without questioning the amendment, appellant entered a plea of not guilty. Under Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, however, only formal amendments are allowed after the arraignment of the accused.<br><blockquote>"SEC. 14. <i>Amendment</i>. --- The information or complaint may be amended, in substance or form, without leave of court, at any time before the accused pleads; and thereafter and during the trial as to all matters of<i> form</i>, <i>by leave and at the discretion of the court, when the same can be done without prejudice to the rights of the accused</i>.<br><br>xxx xxx xxx" (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>By implication, amendments as to substance are precluded after the accused has entered a plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The amendment made here was undoubtedly a matter of substance, for the nature of the crime was altered from murder to homicide. Nonetheless, the Court sustains the validity of the proceedings.<br><br>Section 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, does not bar substantial amendments that are beneficial to the accused. Consistent with the constitutionally enshrined rights to be informed of the nature of charges and to be accorded due process, the rule aims to protect the accused from prejudicial machinations that change the game midstream.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In this case, the amendment benefited<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the appellant. The amendment did not prejudice him or deprive him of defenses available before the amendment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Moreover, appellant not merely consented to the amendment; in fact, he sought it. Indeed, the defense counsel had filed a Motion for Reinvestigation, praying that the charge of murder be changed to homicide. "Objection to the amendment of an information or complaint must be raised at the time the amendment is made[;] otherwise [appellant's] silence would be deemed consent on his part to the amendment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Right to Counsel</i></u></b><br><br>Appellant contends that he was deprived of his right to counsel, arguing that he was represented by Atty. de los Reyes, who was an American citizen with no authority from the Supreme Court to practice law. He was in fact prohibited by the court <i>a quo</i> from appearing before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We disagree. It should be noted that the appellant was present when the lower court issued its Order prohibiting Atty. de los Reyes from appearing before the court. Appellant, however, insisted on being represented by the said counsel. As pointed out by the Office of the Solicitor General, appellant "took full advantage of the one year gap between the hearing held on May 19, 1995 and the last hearing held on March 1, 1994, banking on the short memory of the court and the fact that: 1) at the time this case was heard on May 19, 1995, a new judge had been assigned to RTC Branch 49, Judge Panfilo Salva and, 2) Atty. Vigonte of the PAO was no longer the counsel assigned to this case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>More important, appellant was not prejudiced in any way by his own disregard of the court Order. In all stages of this case, he was represented by counsel either <i>de parte</i> or <i>de oficio</i>. When he was arraigned again under the Amended Information, he was assisted by <i>Counsel de Oficio</i> Atty. Reynaldo Vigonte. During the trial that followed, the said lawyer continued defending him. In any event, all the pieces of evidence presented by the defense were considered by the lower court.<br><br>Because the appellant was neither prejudiced nor deprived of his right to counsel, there is no basis to invalidate the proceedings below.<br><br><center><b><u>Main Issue:<br><br><i>Self-Defense</i></u></b></center><br>Invoking self-defense is admitting authorship of the killing. Hence, the burden of proof shifts to the accused, who must establish with clear and convincing evidence all of these elements of the justifying circumstance:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it, and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Herein appellant, however, failed to demonstrate the foregoing elements clearly and convincingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As the lower court observed, the testimonies of the defense witnesses were improbable, inconsistent and unworthy of belief.<br><br>Appellant presented Defense Witnesses Dina Mediodia and Elena Denaco to establish unlawful aggression on the part of Bencebeis Aguilar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Elena testified that she was with her first cousin Dina when she saw the appellant and the victim "grappling" for the knife that the victim had allegedly drawn after a heated discussion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> But this was contradicted by Dina, who clearly stated that after <i>they</i> saw the deceased draw a knife, <i>both of them</i> <i>immediately ran away</i> without knowing what transpired afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that these witnesses indeed saw the victim pull out a knife, this fact alone did not establish unlawful aggression, since the victim was not shown to have used the deadly weapon to attack the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Unlawful aggression refers to an attack or material aggression, an offensive act positively showing the intent of the aggressor to cause injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It presupposes an actual, sudden and unexpected attack, or an imminent danger thereof, not merely a threatening or an intimidating attitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> These, the two witnesses failed to demonstrate.<br><br>Moreover, the testimonies of these defense witnesses were far from convincing. They claimed that, after the incident, they executed a statement before Atty. de los Reyes because they wanted to help the appellant. Elena admitted, however, that despite their knowledge that a case had been filed before the fiscal, neither she nor Dina submitted any affidavit to help the appellant during the preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This was improbable, because Elena and appellant's family were neighbors at the time, and the latter's mother was a friend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Even the testimonies of Defense Witnesses Percival Lesias and Sylvio Bacaser did not help establish unlawful aggression. Lesias merely stated that he saw two individuals quarreling. Bacaser, on the other hand, testified that he saw two individuals who seemed to be "embracing each other," after which both fell down. Thereupon, the one with a smaller build stood up and ran away, while the one with a bigger build remained on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Neither testified that he had seen Bencebeis Aguilar attack appellant with a knife.<br><br>The only point clearly established by these four defense witnesses was that there was a scuffle. But our conclusion remains unaffected. As clarified by the court <i>a quo</i>, "Aguilar must have put up some resistance, which constituted the fight witnessed by the defense witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Appellant's testimony, on the other hand, was characterized by the trial court as "evasive and inconsistent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> During cross-examination, he testified that he did not drink during the christening of his nephew on that fateful day, October 24, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Later on, he retracted and admitted that he did drink during the celebration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He also stated that after he fell on top of the victim while struggling for the knife, both of them stood up and Aguilar tried to stab him again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> On cross-examination, he contradicted himself by testifying that the victim was still lying on the ground when the latter tried to stab him again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> His assertion -- that after he fell on top of the deceased, both of them stood up and Aguilar tried to stab him again -- was also belied by the testimony of Defense Witness Sylvio Bacaser who stated that the victim remained lying down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Moreover, his testimony was contrary to the evidence in this case. He tried in vain to show that he was threatened with a gun by the allegedly drunk Aguilar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> But his testimony was not corroborated by any witness; equally important, no gun was recovered from the crime scene. Likewise, the testimonies of Prosecution Witnesses Johanna dela Cruz, Ricardo dela Cruz, Estrella Aguilar and Crisostomo Arenio all clearly showed that the victim did not have a gun.<br><br>When the appellant was asked to demonstrate how he managed to parry and twist the knife towards the victim without injuring himself, his reenactment and subsequent testimony showed that the wound was in the stomach area; that is, the lower abdomen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He testified thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p>"ATTY.

Bilog, who conducted the autopsy on Aguilar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It was also unlikely that appellant, without sustaining any injury, managed to parry several knife attacks, and subsequently to wrest and twist the same towards the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Appellant's claim is further negated by his flight from the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In fact, he admitted that he had not even considered surrendering to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> If his claim of self-defense were true, he should have immediately reported the incident to the proper authorities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> instead of running around for an hour and then staying inside his parents' house while the authorities were already looking for him. Our jurisprudence has repeatedly taught that flight is an indication of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The inevitable conclusion from all the foregoing is that appellant stabbed the victim with the intention of killing him.<br><br>Indeed, "[a] plea of self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated, where it is not only uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence, but also extremely doubtful by itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The doubt engendered by the assertions of the appellant is amplified by his claim that he did not "intentionally" stab Aguilar. This vacillation invariably shows the weakness of his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> All in all, appellant failed to establish with clear and convincing evidence the existence of unlawful aggression. Without unlawful aggression, there can be no self-defense.<br><br><b><u><i>Accident</i></u></b><br><br>The appellant also maintained before the lower court that the stabbing of the victim was merely an accident; that is, it was not intentional. It must be stressed that the accused has the burden of proving the elements of this exempting circumstance. He <i>must</i> show the following with clear and convincing evidence: 1) he was performing a lawful act with due care, 2) the injury caused was by a mere accident, and 3) he had no fault or intention of causing the injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> None of these was supported by the evidence on record.
