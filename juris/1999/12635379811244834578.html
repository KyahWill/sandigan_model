It concluded that the accused conspired to kill the victim, appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery but ruled that the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation was absorbed by treachery.<br><br>Accused-appellants contend that:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT SINCE THE CONSPIRACY WAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY PROVEN BY THE PROSECUTION AMONG THE ACCUSED SILVERIANO BOTONA, NICOLAS BOTONA, JUNIOR LINGATONG and SOFRONIO BOTONA AND HIS SON, NICOLAS BOTONA SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED;<br><br></li><li> THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE TESTIMONIES OF BERNANDITO LUBREO, PRUDENCIO LUBREO, PRUDENCIO LEYROS AND DIOSDADO OPOSA CREATED UNMISTAKABLY GRAVE DOUBT AS TO THE CRIMINAL AUTHORSHIP OR LIABILITY OF ALL THE ACCUSED AND THEREFORE THE PROSECUTION HAS NOT PROVEN THE GUILT OF ALL THE ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br></li><li> THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ALL THE ACCUSED THERE BEING NOT AN IOTA OF EVIDENCE SHOWN THAT AN "ACT" WAS COMMITTED BY APPELLANTS SILVERIANO BOTONA AND NICOLAS BOTONA THAT THEY PERSONALLY CAUSED THE SIX <i>(6) MORTAL WOUNDS</i> WHICH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE DEATH OF THE VICTIM.</li></ol></blockquote>Let us tackle first the third assigned error. Appellants claim that there is no evidence to show an "act" of participation in the actual killing of the deceased.<br><br>The contention is untenable. That Julieto Oliver did not witness the actual killing of his father is of no moment. Well-settled is the rule that direct evidence of the commission of the crime is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusion and finding of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In the absence of direct evidence, circumstantial evidence may be resorted to. Circumstantial evidence suffices to convict, if:<br><blockquote>a) there is more than one circumstance;<br><br>b) the facts from where the inferences are derived are proven; and<br><br>c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote>In <i>People vs. Aaron Bionat</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>, the Court upheld the conviction of the accused notwithstanding the absence of an eyewitness. In the said case, the accused was positively identified as one of the persons who hog-tied and took away the victim, threatening to shoot the witness if she would cry or shout. The next day, the victim was found dead with stab wounds.<br><br>A judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence can be sustained only when the circumstances proved form an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the culprit. The circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with any other hypothesis except that of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In the case under consideration, the prosecution established the following chain of circumstances:<br><blockquote>1) The motive of the killing as testified on by Arsenia Botona, bereaved wife of the deceased, - that her own brothers Silveriano and Sofronio Botona begrudged them, especially her late husband, because of their inherited land which was plowed by the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>2) that on another occasion, Silveriano Botona stabbed her husband but was unhurt because her husband knelt before him;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>3) That on June 27, 1988, after eating supper, Julieto Botona, as instructed by his mother, went to Bitoon Poblacion to fetch his father, Bienvenido Oliver, whom he found playing cards called "bakarat" in the house of his Uncle "Veriano" (Silveriano); and that he was told by his father to "Wait for a while as we will just go home together";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>4) that all the accused were there in the house of Silveriano while the deceased was still playing cards; that when the deceased and Julieto Oliver went home, the four accused were no longer seen by Julieto;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>5) that it was at about 11:00 o'clock that evening, when Julieto Oliver and the deceased left the house of Silveriano Botona;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>6) that on their way home, the deceased, Bienvenido Oliver, was walking ahead of Julieto; that a person suddenly emerged from the roadside whom Julieto Oliver recognized as accused Silveriano Botona; that Silveriano Botona immediately hugged his father; that said accused called for assistance and another set of three <i>(3)</i> accused also emerged; that these persons were identified by Julieto Oliver to be Nicolas Botona, Junior Lingatong, and Sofronio Botona who all hugged his father;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>7) that Silveriano Botona was holding the "sundangay" or small sharp-pointed bolo when he hugged Bienvenido Oliver;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> that Julieto Oliver noticed the weapon because "it sparked through the light";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> that it was only three days before fullmoon at that time;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>8) that Julieto Oliver saw his Uncle Silveriano hold the shoulder of his father and push him to the ground;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>9) that Julieto Oliver did not witness what happened next because he ran away;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>10) that Julieto Oliver hid for "about or more than one minute"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> in the ricefield six - arms length away from where his father has fallen; that he proceeded under the house of Batoy Laplana where he hid for about three hours;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>11) that after a while, Julieto Oliver saw, from where he was hiding, the four accused in the pumpwell of the next house with Nicolas Botona pumping while the others were washing themselves;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and<br><br>12) that at about 4:00 a. m. the following dawn, Julieto Oliver went back to the place where he left his father and found him dead in the same spot where the four <i>(4)</i> accused intercepted his father; that he proceeded to their farm in Sitio Lobo and notified his mother that his father was already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote>From the aforementioned circumstances, it is decisively clear that the accused were identified by Julieto Oliver as the persons last seen with the victim on June 27, 1988, at around 11:00 p. m. and at 4:00 o'clock in the morning of the next day, the lifeless victim was found on the same spot where his deceased father was attacked by the four <i>(4)</i> accused. From the treacherous design in accosting the deceased, a land dispute as background motive, a previous attempt to take the life of the victim, and the other antecedent facts and circumstances aforestated, no conclusion can be drawn other than the guilt of appellants.<br><br>All told, the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution surmounted the constitutional presumption of innocence.<br><br>The gamut of evidence upon which the trial court based its judgment of conviction came mainly from the testimony of prosecution witness Julieto Oliver. It is thus imperative to delve into and scrutinize very well the credibility of said witness.<br><br>Worthy to be cited with approval is the following observation below on this vital witness for the People:<br><blockquote><i>"x x x the court finds his demeanor during the hearings and during the ocular inspection far from being coached and fabricated, hence, worthy of belief."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>Expounding on the issue of credibility of a witness, what the court said in the case of People vs. Soberano<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> comes to the fore, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>"The constant rule in our jurisdiction is that this Court will accord great respect to the factual conclusions drawn by the trial court, particularly on the matter of credibility of a witness since the trial judge had the opportunity-which is denied to appellate courts - to observe the behavior and demeanor of witnesses while testifying. The trial judge is thus able to form at first hand a judgment as to whether particular witnesses were telling the truth or not."</i></blockquote>A scrutiny of the candid and unwavering testimony of Julieto Oliver during the trial and ocular inspection shows beyond cavil the correctness and reliability of the findings and conclusion arrived at by the trial court.<br><br>As regards the affidavit of Julietio Oliver executed on July 4, 1988, which was not offered in evidence, the court, in disregarding the inconsistencies theorized upon by the defense, ruled that subject inconsistencies are minor and were fully explained by Julieto Oliver on the witness stand.<br><br>Understandably, the lower court must have been aware that discrepancies between the affidavit of a witness and his testimony in court do not necessarily discredit him because it is a matter of judicial notice and experience that affidavits taken <i>ex parte</i> are almost always incomplete and often inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In their attempt to impugn the prosecution's theory of conspiracy, appellants asseverate that it was impossible for conspiracy to have been hatched in the absence of proof to show how the murder weapon got into the picture. In so claiming, appellants relied on the testimony of Sofronio Botona that when he was invited by Silveriano to go with him, he saw no bolo or any weapon brought by his brother, nor by Nicolas, his nephew.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Appellants would like to impress upon the court that the murder weapon is indispensable to the existence of conspiracy.<br><br>Whether or not Sofronio saw the murder weapon is neither important nor decisive. The belated testimony of Sofronio who was not in good terms with Silveriano Botona because of the former's problem on his bond was never made the basis of the theory of conspiracy. It may have on some points corroborated the testimony of Julieto Oliver but lapses in the testimony of Sofronio do not in any way affect the untarnished and straightforward testimony of Julieto Oliver that he saw Silveriano holding the weapon when the latter and the three other accused ganged-up on his father.<br><br>For conspiracy to exist, proof of an actual planning of the perpetration of the crime is not a condition precedent. Time and again, this court ruled that it is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense, the accused had the same purpose and were united in its execution. Direct evidence of a previous actual agreement to commit a crime is not necessary. It may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated or inferred from the acts of the accused evincing a joint or common purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>In the case under scrutiny, the act of Silveriano Botona who suddenly appeared from the roadside, hugging the victim with the murder weapon in his hand, was complemented by the act of the three other accused ganging-up on the defenseless victim, when Silveriano called for their reinforcement. Verily, at the precise moment of execution of the crime, the accused acted in concert to accomplish a common objective - to take the life of Bienvenido Oliver.<br><br>This court is truly convinced of the findings by the trial court that conspiracy attended the perpetration of the crime. Consequently, the act of one is the act of all regardless of the degree of participation of each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> All the accused in the case are therefore equally liable for the death of Bienvenido Oliver.<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against person, employing means and methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the trial court ruled that: "The evidence of the people through Julieto Oliver was clear and unwavering - that the attack was sudden and unexpected where the victim was unable to defend himself. They all ganged-up the victim and thereafter pushed said victim to the ground."<br><br>Thus, the court <i>a quo</i> properly considered the qualifying circumstance of treachery, as the attack on the deceased was sudden, catching him unaware and giving him no opportunity to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Telling on the matter of aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation are the observations by the Solicitor General, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>"Finally it was an error for the trial court to hold that evident premeditation is absorbed in treachery (RTC Decision, p. 61). It is the direct proof of conspiracy that presupposes the existence of evident premeditation (People vs. Timbang, 74 PHIL 295 [1943]); however, when conspiracy is only implied as in the case at bar, evident premeditation may not be appreciated, in the absence of proof as to how and when the plan to kill the victim was hatched or what had elapsed before it was carried out (People vs. Custudio, 97 PHIL 698, 704 [1995]); The Revised Penal Code, Reyes, Vol. 1, 1993 Edition)"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></blockquote>The court adopts the aforesaid observations by the Solicitor General. Considering that the conspiracy in the present case is merely implied, evident premeditation must be clearly established, the elements of which are as follows:<br><blockquote>1) the time when the accused decided to commit the crime;<br><br>2) an overt act manifestly indicating that the accused had clung to his determination to commit the crime;<br><br>3) a sufficient lapse of time between the decision to commit the crime and the execution thereof to allow the accused to reflect on the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote>Absent reliable substantiation of the aforestated elements, evident premeditation can not aggravate the criminal liability of the accused. As no attempt was made to prove the requirements of evident premeditation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>, the same cannot be appreciated.<br><br>Appellants interposed alibi, the weakest of defenses. The court has patiently reiterated the requisites for alibi to prosper, that is, the accused was not at the <i>locus delicti</i> when the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The trial court found that the distance from the house of Silveriano Botona to the scene of the crime was only less than a kilometer and all the accused could hike such distance in less than thirty <i>(30)</i> minutes. Such being the case, the requirement of physical impossibility was not satisfied to exculpate appellants from the murder of the victim. Moreover, the accused were positively identified by Julieto Oliver as the persons who ganged-up his father at the scene of the crime. Against the said positive identification, alibi can not prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Anent the testimonies of Bernandito Lubreo, Prudencio Leyros, and Diosdado Oposa, not an iota of doubt was engendered by their testimonies on the culpability of the accused. That such testimonies remain unrebutted is of no moment. Nowhere in the testimony of Bernandino Lubreo can be detected any statement that points to the culpability of the alleged perpetrators, Marcial and Nicholas Gultian. Contrary to the claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> of appellants, the testimony of Bernandino Lubreo did not show the guilt of the Gultians.<br><br>There is merit in the Comment by the prosecutor that the testimonies of Prudencio Leyros and Diosdado Oposa appear contrary to ordinary human events. It should be noted that ordinarily, under the circumstances, nobody would wake up another for the sole purpose of telling the latter that they killed somebody, with a threat to kill the person so apprised if the matter told would be revealed to others.<br><br>Verily, the Gultians had nothing to gain by telling anybody about the crime. On the contrary, they would just risk its discovery.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal under consideration is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> and the appealed decision, dated April 27, 1994, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 31, Dapa, Surigao del Norte, in Criminal Case No. 115693 <b>AFFIRMED,</b> with the modification that the award of P10,000.00 for moral and exemplary damages is deleted for want of legal and factual basis.
