Joint trial of the three cases ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented the complainant and three other witnesses, namely: Dr. Maria Cyrilda Tallo, who examined complainant and found her to be a non-virgin;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Jovencia Asilo, the Municipal Civil Registrar of Panglao, Bohol, who identified complainant's birth record showing she was an illegitimate child born in Panglao, Bohol, on November 4, 1983;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Helen B. Ho, MSWD social worker of Panglao, Bohol, who assisted complainant in the preparation and filing of the complaints against the accused.<br><br>The testimony of Reyah is substantially as summarized by the appellee in its brief as follows:<br><blockquote>"Complainant testified that appellant is her stepfather, married to her mother Pedrita; she was raped by appellant several times but could only remember three specific dates; the first date fell on the second week of June 1993; she could recall this date because it was enrollment period,; on that day, about 6 o'clock in the morning, she was awakened when appellant approached her at the upper floor of their house; at that time, her one-year old half-brother Rizal was also at the upper floor, while her mother was downstairs in the kitchen preparing breakfast; her other half-brother Rogelio was at the house of appellant's mother; appellant, who was only wearing brief, removed her short pants and her panties, after which he, too, removed his brief, then placed himself on top of her and made a push and pull movement with his buttocks; he was able to penetrate his penis into her vagina slightly; although she felt pain as appellant forced his penis into her vagina, she did not cry for help because she was afraid of appellant who threatened that he would bring her two brothers with him to Cotabato (TSN, January 17, 1996, pp. 2-8).<br><br>Another date complainant remembered was August 3, 1994. She particularly remembered this date because it was the day after her brother Rogelio's birthday. About 6 o'clock in the morning, at the upper floor of their house, appellant, who was only wearing brief, as was his wont asked her to come near him to scratch his back. At that time, her mother was in the comfort room a short distance away from their house, while her brothers Rogelio and Rizal were also at the upper floor. Rogelio, a retardate, who could neither talk nor walk, was sleeping on a hammock. Rogelio was then 4 years old while Rizal was 1 year old. When she was already near appellant, the latter removed her panties, made her lie down and placed himself on top of her. Appellant removed his brief and made a push and pull movement with his buttocks. This time, appellant was able to penetrate his penis deeper into her vagina. But like before, she did not cry for help as she was afraid of appellant who threatened that he would bring her two brothers with him to Cotabato (TSN, January 17, 1996, pp. 9-13).<br><br>The third date was sometime in the third week of March 1995. She recalled this date because it was the last time appellant raped her. On that day, her mother, who was leaving for Tagbilaran City, fetched her from the house of her neighbor, May Manliguez, and asked her to take care of her brothers in their house. Appellant was in Tagbilaran City where he worked as a carpenter. However, about noon, appellant arrived home drunk. He then undressed complainant, removed her panties and proceeded to rape her. This time, appellant penetrated his penis deep into her vagina. She was then 11 years old (TSN, January 17, 1996, pp. 1416).<br><br>After this last rape incident, complainant finally sought help from Zenaida Milay who brought the matter to the attention of Helen B. Ho, a DSWD social worker. Helen B. Ho interviewed and accompanied complainant to the Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital where she was examined by Dr. Maria Cyrilda Tallo. Complainant was found to be a non-virgin. With the assistance of Helen B. Ho, complaints for rape against appellant were filed by herein complainant (TSN, January 30, 1996, pp. 2-5)." (pp. 4-7, Appellee's Brief, pp. 76-79, <i>Rollo</i>).</blockquote>Witness Helen Ballecer Ho testified that Reyah Lea Guivencan, accompanied by one Zenaida Milay, sought her help to file rape charges against the accused; she interviewed Reyah who informed her that she was sexually abused by the accused. Helen brought Reyah to the police station of Panglao, where Reyah's affidavit was taken and took her to the Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital where she was examined by Dra. Tallo, who issued a medico-legal certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Helen turned over Reyah to their child specialist in Tagbilaran City and was placed in the custody of the Regional Social Welfare Office in Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Jovencia Asilo, Municipal Civil Registrar identified Reyah's record of birth; she was the one who signed Reyah's birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> showing that Reyah's date of birth is November 4, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Dr. Ma. Cyrilda Tallo identified the medico-legal certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which she issued and testified that when she examined Reyah on May 25, 1995, she noted that there was no bleeding or laceration on her genitalia nor bruises in the surrounding area; internal examination showed that her hymen was no longer intact as she was able to insert 1-2 fingers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The accused denied all the charges against him. He stated that Reyah had been living with Anastacia Manliguis, the aunt of his wife, since the first week of January, 1995 until the last week of April, when she was asked by her mother to stay in the house as she, together with the accused, was going to Cebu. He admitted that Reyah was living in their house in August 1994 and in June 1993. The accused claimed that he was accused by Reyah of three counts of rape because Reyah is a carefree child ("lakwatcha"), used to climb trees, and was always reprimanded for her wrong-doing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On cross-examination, the accused testified that Reyah resented his scolding, and that her neighbor Zenaida Milay, a neighbor with whom she had a prior disagreement, and Carmencita Arcay, the grandmother of Reyah, were the persons who urged Reyah to file charges against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The defense presented Pedrita Bolatete, the mother of the victim, who corroborated Melanio's testimony that Reyah "always<b> </b>commit wrong and Melanio would punish her physically.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, she testified that Reyah was living in the family house on August 3, 1994 and in the second week of June, 1993; but was living with her aunt from January, 1995 up to the third week of March 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The court <i>a quo </i>found the accused guilty of three counts of rape:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of all the crimes of statutory rapes committed against the complaining witness on the 2nd week of June, 1993, on the 3rd of August, 1994 and on the 3rd week of March, 1995 punishable under Article 335, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 7659 and for which crimes the Court hereby sentences the accused Melanio Bolatete to DEATH for Crim. Case No. 9459; to DEATH likewise for Crim. Case No. 9460 and finally also to DEATH for Crim. -Case No. 9461 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 for each crime or a sum total of P150,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<br><br>The appellant submits the following assigned errors in his brief:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED AND PENALIZING HIM TO THE EXTENT OF DEATH WITHOUT APPARENTLY GIVING CREDIT TO HIS EVIDENCES;<br><br></li><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INCONSISTENCIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S WITNESSES WHICH IF GIVEN WEIGHT COULD HAVE EITHER EXONERATE(D) THE ACCUSED OR MITIGATE(D) THE PENALTY."</li></ol></blockquote>and discussed the same simultaneously.<br><br>In essence, accused-appellant claims that complainant led a carefree and happy-go lucky life and resented the "hard discipline" imposed by her stepfather; she concocted the accusations out of hatred. It is unbelievable that the accused succeeded in ravishing her despite the absence of serious threats or intimidation, and that the accused submitted to her step-father's wishes because she was afraid he would carry out his threat to take away her brothers.<br><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>Melanie was born on November 4, 1983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>. She was accordingly nine (9) years and seven (7) months old at the time of the first rape incident on June 1993, ten (10) years and eight (8) months old at the time of the second rape incident on August 3, 1994, and eleven (11) years and four (4) months old at the time of the third rape incident in March, 1995. She was clearly less than twelve years old at the time of the three rape incidents subject of her complaints.<br><br>Rape is defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Section 11, R.A. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>"ART. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed. </i>Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><ol type="1"><li> By using force or intimidation.<br><br></li><li> When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br></li><li> When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.</li></ol>The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion</i> <i>perpetua.</i></blockquote>This Court has held that if the woman is under 12 years of age, proof of force and consent becomes immaterial, not only because force is not an element of statutory rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> but the absence of free consent is presumed when the woman is below such age. The two elements of statutory rape are: 1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and 2) that the woman is below twelve years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Sexual congress with a girl under twelve (12) years old is always rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The testimony of the victim Reyah Lea is reproduced

When a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. And as long as the testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Well-entrenched is the doctrine which is founded on reason and experience that when the victim testifies that she has been raped, and her testimony is credible, such testimony may be the sole basis of conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We find no compelling reason to disturb the. trial court's reliance on the testimony of the complainant which impressed the court as straightforward and "bore the hallmarks of truth." Moreover, complainant withstood a punishing cross-examination without wavering or being caught in inconsistencies.<br><br>The trial court's assessment of a witness' credibility will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The defense attempts to discredit Reyah's testimony by showing that she had a cause for resentment toward the accused who used to scold her for her "carefree" ways. However, it defies belief that a twelve year old girl would fabricate a sordid tale of sexual abuse from her stepfather simply because she had been reproved or censured for her irresponsible ways as a child. The accused has adopted a self-serving illogical stance which cannot prevail over the categorical recital of facts contained in Reyah's testimony, which the trial court upheld. Reyah's testimony of the three incidents of rape recounted vivid details of the said incidents that could not have been concocted by a girl of tender age. The testimony of the complainant is consistent, clear and free of serious contradictions.<br><br>We therefore affirm the finding that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the three counts of rape as charged.<br><br>However, the penalty imposed should be modified. The first rape occurred in June 1993; the second on August 3., 1994; and the third in March 1995. Statutory rape as defined in Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetual </i>even after the amendment introduced by R.A. 7659, which took effect on December 31, 1993. Although it was established that the accused is the step-father of the victim, this qualifying circumstance was not alleged in the criminal complaints upon which the accused was arraigned. This omission bars conviction of rape in its qualified form which is punishable by death. Thus, in People vs. Garcia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> it was held:<br><blockquote>Now, it has long been the rule that qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the indictment. If the same are not pleaded but proved, they shall be considered only as aggravating circumstances, since the latter admit of proof even if not pleaded. Indeed, it would be a denial of the right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him. and, consequently, a denial of due process, if he is charged with simple rape and be convicted of its qualified form punishable with death, although the attendant circumstance qualifying the offense and resulting in capital punishment was not alleged in the indictment on which he was arraigned.<br><br>Recapitulating, the information filed against appellant charged only the felony of simple rape and no attendant qualifying circumstance, specifically that of his being supposedly a guardian of the victim, was alleged. On this additional consideration, he cannot, therefore, be, punished with the penalty of death even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that he is such a guardian. Neither can that fact be considered to aggravate his liability as the penalty for simple rape is - the single indivisible penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua." </i>(at p. 489)</blockquote>As regards the accused's pecuniary liabilities, the complainant is awarded PL50,000.00 as civil indemnity in addition to the P-50,000.00 awarded by the court as moral damages.<br><br>It has been the policy of the Court to outrightly award an amount not exceeding R50,000.00 to victims of rape upon indubitable showing of its commission; this is categorized as civil indemnity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In response to the rising incidence of heinous crimes against chastity, the Court laid down the rule that if the crime of rape is committed and effectively qualified by any of the circumstances under which the death penalty is authorized by law, the indemnity for the victim shall be increased to the amount of P75,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, if the death penalty is not imposable due to the deficiency in the allegations of the information against the accused, e.g., it was not alleged that the accused is the step-father of the victim, the increased amount of civil indemnity cannot be imposed.<br><br>As regards the award for moral damages, the requirement of proof of mental and physical suffering has been dispensed with; it has been recognized that the victim's injury is inherently concomitant with, and necessarily resulting from the odious crime of rape to warrant <i>per se </i>an award for moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Hence, the award of moral damages may be maintained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appealed judgment of the court <i>a quo is</i> <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the additional amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity to complainant Reyah Lea Guivencan for each count of rape in addition to the award of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages awarded by the court for each count of rape.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr. C.J., Romero, Bellossilo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo</i> and <i>Buena, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> p. 21, <i>Rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exhibit, "A".<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit, "E".<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit, "A".<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Tsn., February 13, 1996, pp. 14-22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibit, "E"<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><sup> </sup> Tsn., February 13, 1996, pp. 4-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><sup> </sup>Exhibit, "A"<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Tsn., February 16, 1996, pp. 6-8<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Tsn., September 6, 1996, pp. 3-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Tsn., August 13, 1996, pp. 7-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Tsn., August 21, 1996, pp. 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> at pp. 7-1 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Exhibit, "E".<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> R.A.
