				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The validity and legality of the appointment of respondent Conrado Quiaoit to the post of Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac by then President Fidel V. Ramos is assailed in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> on a pure question of law which prays for the reversal of the Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 20 October 1997, of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 63) of Tarlac, Tarlac, dismissing the petition for prohibition and/or injunction and <i>mandamus</i>, with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of injunction/temporary restraining order, instituted by herein petitioners.<br><br>The occurrence of a vacancy in the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac impelled the main contestants in this case, petitioner Oscar Bermudez and respondent Conrado Quiaoit, to take contrasting views on the proper interpretation of a provision in the 1987 Revised Administrative Code. Bermudez, the First Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac and Officer-In-Charge of the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, was a recommendee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of then Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona, Jr., for the position of Provincial Prosecutor. Quiaoit, on the other hand, would appear to have had the support of then Representative Jose Yap of the Second Legislative District of Tarlac.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On 30 June 1997, Quiaoit emerged the victor when he was appointed by President Ramos to the coveted office. Quiaoit received a certified xerox copy of his appointment and, on 21 July 1997, took his oath of office before Executive Judge Angel Parazo of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 65) of Tarlac, Tarlac. On 23 July 1997, Quiaoit assumed office and immediately informed the President, as well as the Secretary of Justice and the Civil Service Commission, of that assumption. Bermudez refused to vacate the Office of Provincial Prosecutor claiming that the original copy of Quiaoit's appointment had not yet been released by the Secretary of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Quiaoit, nonetheless, performed the functions and duties of the Office of Provincial Prosecutor by issuing office orders and memoranda, signing resolutions on preliminary investigations, and filing several informations before the courts. Quiaoit had since been regularly receiving the salary, RATA and other emoluments of the office.<br><br>On 17 September 1997, Bermudez and Quiaoit were summoned to Manila by Justice Secretary Guingona. The three met at the Department of Justice and, following the conference, Bermudez was ordered to wind up his cases until 15 October 1997 and to turn-over the contested office to Quiaoit the next day.<br><br>In his First Indorsement, dated 22 September 1997, for the Chief State prosecutor, Assistant Chief State Prosecutor Nilo Mariano transmitted the original copy of Quiaoit's appointment to the Regional State Prosecutor Carlos de Leon, Region III, at San Fernando, Pampanga. In turn, in his Second Indorsement, dated 02 October 1997, Regional State Prosecutor de Leon forwarded to Quiaoit said original copy of his appointment. On the basis of the transmittal letter of Regional State Prosecutor de Leon, Quiaoit, as directed, again so assumed office on 16 October 1997. On even date, Bermudez was detailed at the Office of the Regional State Prosecutor, Region III, in San Fernando, Pampanga.<br><br>In the meantime, on 10 October 1997, Bermudez together with his co-petitioners Arturo Llobrera and Claudio Dayaon, the Second Assistant Provincial Prosecutor and the Fourth Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Tarlac, respectively, filed with the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac, a petition for prohibition and/or injunction, and <i>mandamus</i>, with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of injunction/temporary restraining order, against herein respondents, challenging the appointment of Quiaoit primarily on the ground that the appointment lacks the recommendation of the Secretary of Justice prescribed under the Revised Administrative Code of 1987. After hearing, the trial court considered the petition submitted for resolution and, in due time, issued its now assailed order dismissing the petition. The subsequent move by petitioners to have the order reconsidered met with a denial.<br><br>Hence, the instant recourse.<br><br>The core issue for consideration is whether or not the absence of a recommendation of the Secretary of Justice to the President can be held fatal to the appointment of respondent Conrado Quiaoit. This question would, in turn, pivot on the proper understanding of the provision of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987 (Book IV, Title III, Chapter II, Section 9) to the effect that-<br><br>"All provincial and city prosecutors and their assistants shall be appointed by the President <b>upon the recommendation of the Secretary</b>."<br><br>Petitioners contend that an appointment of a provincial prosecutor mandatorily requires a prior recommendation of the Secretary of Justice endorsing the intended appointment citing, by analogy, the case of San Juan vs. CSC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> where the Court held:<br><blockquote>"x x x <b>The DBM may appoint only from the list of qualified recommendees nominated by the Governor</b>. If none is qualified, he must return the list of nominees to the Governor explaining why no one meets the legal requirements and ask for new recommendees who have the necessary eligibilities and qualifications.<br><br>The Provincial Budget Officer (PBO) is expected to synchronize his work with DBM."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Insisting on the application of San Juan, petitioners call attention to the tenor of Executive Order No. 112<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> -<br><blockquote>"Section 1. All budget officers of provinces, cities and municipalities shall be appointed henceforth by the Minister of Budget and Management <b>upon recommendation of the local chief executive concerned</b> x x x." -</blockquote>that, they claim, can be likened to the aforequoted provision of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987. Respondents argue differently.<br><br>The legislative intent is, of course, primordial. There is no hard-and-fast rule in ascertaining whether the language in a statute should be considered mandatory or directory, and the application of a ruling in one particular instance may not necessarily be apt in another<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for each must be determined on the basis of the specific law in issue and the peculiar circumstances attendant to it. More often than not, the problem, in the final analysis, is firmed up and addressed on a case-to-case basis. The nature, structure and aim of the law itself is often resorted to in looking at the legislative intent. Generally, it is said that if no consequential rights or liabilities depend on it and no injury can result from ignoring it, and that the purpose of the legislature can be accomplished in a manner other than that prescribed when substantially the same results can be obtained, then the statute should be regarded merely as directory, rather than as mandatory, in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>An "appointment" to a public office is the unequivocal act of designating or selecting by one having the authority therefor of an individual to discharge and perform the duties and functions of an office or trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The appointment is deemed complete once the last act required of the appointing authority has been complied with and its acceptance thereafter by the appointee in order to render it effective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Appointment necessarily calls for an exercise of discretion on the part of the appointing authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> reiterated in Flores vs. Drilon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this Court has held:<br><blockquote>"The power to appoint is, in essence, discretionary. The appointing power has the right of choice which he may exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself who is best qualified among those who have the necessary qualifications and eligibilities. It is a prerogative of the appointing power x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, it may rightly be said that the right of choice is the heart of the power to appoint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the exercise of the power of appointment, discretion is an integral part thereof.<br><br>When the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> or the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> clothes the President with the power to appoint a subordinate officer, such conferment must be understood as necessarily carrying with it an ample discretion of whom to appoint. It should be here pertinent to state that the President is the head of government whose authority includes the power of control over all "executive departments, bureaus and offices." Control means the authority of an empowered officer to alter or modify, or even nullify or set aside, what a subordinate officer has done in the performance of his duties, as well as to substitute the judgment of the latter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as and when the former deems it to be appropriate. Expressed in another way, the President has the power to assume <b>directly</b> the functions of an executive department, bureau and office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It can accordingly be inferred therefrom that the President can interfere in the exercise of discretion of officials under him or altogether ignore their recommendations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>It is the considered view of the Court, given the above disquisition, that the phrase "<i>upon recommendation of the Secretary</i>," found in Section 9, Chapter II, Title III, Book IV, of the Revised Administrative Code, should be interpreted, as it is normally so understood, to be a mere advise, exhortation or indorsement, which is essentially persuasive in character and not binding or obligatory upon the party to whom it is made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The recommendation is here nothing really more than advisory in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The President, being the head of the Executive Department, could very well disregard or do away with the action of the departments, bureaus or offices even in the exercise of discretionary authority, and in so opting, he cannot be said as having acted beyond the scope of his authority.<br><br>The doctrine in San Juan, relied upon by petitioners, is tangential. While the tenor of the legal provision in Executive Order No. 112 has some similarity with the provision in the 1987 Administrative Code in question, it is to be pointed out, however, that <b>San Juan</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in construing the law, has distinctively given stress to the constitutional mandate on local autonomy; thus:<br><blockquote>"The issue before the Court is not limited to the validity of the appointment of one Provincial Budget Officer. The tug of war between the Secretary of Budget and Management and the Governor of the premier province of Rizal over a seemingly innocuous position involves the application of a most important constitutional policy and principle, that of local autonomy. We have to obey the clear mandate on local autonomy. Where a law is capable of two interpretations, one in favor of centralized power in Malacañang and the other beneficial to local autonomy, the scales must be weighed in favor of autonomy.<br><br><center>"x x x x x x x x x</center><br>"When the Civil Service Commission interpreted the recommending power of the Provincial Governor as purely directory, it went against the letter and spirit of the constitutional provisions on local autonomy. If the DBM Secretary jealously hoards the entirety of budgetary powers and ignores the right of local governments to develop self-reliance and resoluteness in the handling of their own funds, the goal of meaningful local autonomy is frustrated and set back."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>The Court there has explained that the President merely exercises general supervision over local government units and local officials;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> hence, in the appointment of a Provincial Budget Officer, the executive department, through the Secretary of Budget and Management, indeed had to share the questioned power with the local government.<br><br>In the instant case, the recommendation of the Secretary of Justice and the appointment of the President are acts of the Executive Department itself, and there is no sharing of power to speak of, the latter being deemed for all intents and purposes as being merely an extension of the personality of the President.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED. No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Panganiban, Purisima,</i> and <i>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup> Per Judge Arsenio P.

Bermudez to the position being the most qualified candidate based on the foregoing criteria. We are greatly concerned and disturbed therefore when that Office has appointed Atty.
