				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Unsubstantiated accusations or baseless conclusions of the employer are insufficient legal justifications to dismiss an employee. The employer must prove by substantial evidence the facts and incidents upon which loss of confidence or breach of trust is based. Mere allegations, even if supported by <i>pro forma </i>and <i>generalized</i> affidavits, are not sufficient evidence to justify the dismissal of an employee.<br><br>The Case<br><br>The Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> before us seeks to set aside the Decision dated February 19, 1997, promulgated by the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC CA No. 011082-96, which reversed that of the labor arbiter granting petitioner's Complaint for illegal dismissal. In his Decision dated May 17, 1996, Labor Arbiter Dominador B. Saludares disposed as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby entered in favor of the complainant and against the respondent, ordering the latter, as follows:<br><ol type="1"><li> To pay the sum of P8,000.00 as one (1) month separation pay of the complainant in lieu of reinstatement;<br><br></li><li> To pay the sum of P92,000.00 as back wages of complainant from June 16, 1995 up to this writing;<br><br></li><li> To pay complainant moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00; and<br><br></li><li> To pay attorney's fees in the sum of P15,000.00."</li></ol></blockquote>Reversing the above disposition, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> ruled:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE, and the instant case is hereby dismissed for lack of merit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated September 19, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>Respondent Commission narrates the facts in this wise:<sup> </sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><blockquote>"[Petitioner] started working with the [private] respondent during the latter part of April 1994. Shortly thereafter, she was appointed as [f]inance [m]anager of the [private] respondent and her tasks [included], among others, xxx custody of and disbursement of company funds.<br><br>"On June 9, 1995, [petitioner] claims that she was summoned by Ms. Ma. Angela Celeridad, the company's [v]ice-[p]resident, who informed her that management had decided to terminate her employment. Hence, she was told either to resign or face dismissal. Later that day at around 7:00 o'clock in the evening, [petitioner] alleged that the [p]resident of the company, Johnny P. Lee, announced that her employment was already terminated. On June 23, 1995, [petitioner] lodged her complaint against the company for illegal dismissal.<br><br>"[Private] [r]espondent, however, paints a different scenario of the circumstances surrounding [petitioner]'s cessation from her employment. [Private] [r]espondent denies having dismissed the [petitioner] as no memorandum or letter of dismissal was issued to the [petitioner]. [Private] [r]espondent asserts that on May 20, 1995, it received a complaint from several of its marketing and sales agents accusing [petitioner] of committing deliberate delays in the payment of their commission in violation of company policy. They alleged that she refused to release their commissions despite payment of the price of the properties they ha[d] brokered unless she [was] given a certain amount [as her cut]. These individual complainants include[d] Amado Roa, [a]cting [v]ice-[p]resident for marketing and all [d]ivision [h]eads of the Sales Department of the company, namely: Leonora Punongbayan, Elma Mendoza, Nestor Pamintuan and Melly Rubid. The company, through its [p]resident, furnished [petitioner] with a copy of the complaint and gave her time to answer the same. Despite having been given an extension to file a reply to the charges against her, [petitioner] failed to submit the same. Instead, on June 10, 1995, she stopped reporting for work.<br><br>"In addition, [private] respondent claims that on June 15, 1995, another employee of the company, a certain Rufino Pahati, lodged a separate complaint against [petitioner] regarding his application for cash advance. Mr. Pahati claim[ed] that [petitioner] made him apply for cash advance but it was she who took the money. She promised to pay him back but failed. Allegedly, the company sent a letter to Mendoza dated June 24, 1995 demanding her to explain all [the] irregularities imputed [to] her. Hearing no response from her, the company was constrained to conduct an investigation in her absence. [Petitioner] was found to have committed the above-mentioned anomalies imputed [to] her. On June 28, 1995, the [private] respondent notified [petitioner] that as of June 15, 1995, she was considered resigned from her job.<br><br>"On June 23, 1995 the instant complaint was filed seeking xxx reinstatement, backwages, damages and attorney's fees."</blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of Respondent Commission</u></b></center><br>As finance manager, petitioner held a sensitive position which depended largely on her employer's continued trust and confidence in her. Respondent Commission found that she had committed acts that were of such nature as to be sufficient to cause the loss of such trust and confidence.<br><br>The dismissal of the criminal charges against petitioner did not prove the absence of a valid ground for her dismissal. Conviction in a criminal case is not indispensable to the dismissal of an employee, and the findings of a public prosecutor are not binding upon a labor tribunal.<br><br>Respondent Commission also faulted petitioner for the failure of private respondent to conduct a hearing regarding the complaints against her. Allegedly, she refused to report for work to avoid and prevent an investigation by the company. Thus, the accusations against her stood unrebutted, and private respondent had no recourse but to consider her services ended.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>Petitioner does not pinpoint the issues, but Respondent Commission poses the following question:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote>"Whether or not Respondent NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in reversing the decision of the labor arbiter and in declaring that petitioner was not illegally dismissed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>To fully ventilate the foregoing question, the Court resolved to subdivide the discussion into three issues: (1) Should this Court review the factual findings of the labor tribunals below? (2) Did petitioner abandon her post? (3) May petitioner be validly dismissed on the ground of breach of trust and loss of confidence?<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The Petition is partly meritorious.<br><br><center><b><u>First Issue:<br><i>Review of Factual Findings</i></u></b></center><br>The factual findings of the labor arbiter, when sufficiently supported by the evidence on record, should as a rule be given great respect by appellate tribunals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Pursuant to this doctrine, petitioner insists that private respondent adduced no "scintilla of evidence" to establish that she abandoned her job or committed serious irregularities constituting a breach of trust and loss of confidence. Hence, the NLRC abused its discretion in reversing the labor arbiter's factual findings.<br><br>On the other hand, Respondent Commission ruled that "there [was] sufficient cause for respondent to terminate complainant after she failed to report back to work without justifiable cause." The NLRC and private respondent argue that the labor arbiter failed to take into account important pieces of relevant evidence showing that petitioner was guilty of a serious breach of trust. Thus, Respondent Commission invokes the similarly entrenched rule that its findings should be respected because they are grounded on substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Since the factual findings of the NLRC are inconsistent with those of the labor arbiter, this Court -- as an exception to the rule that only questions of law may be raised in <i>certiorari</i> proceedings -- resolved to conduct a full review of the records before us in order to determine the facts of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In <i>St. Martin Funeral Home v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we held that petitions for <i>certiorari</i> challenging NLRC decisions should be remanded to or filed directly with the Court of Appeals, which has concurrent jurisdiction over such cases. However, since the Memoranda of the parties have already been filed in this Court prior to the finality of <i>St. Martin, </i>we shall dispose of this case once and for all, rather than remand it to the appellate court.<br><br><center><b><u>Second Issue:<br><i>Abandonment Must Be Proven</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioner prays that we should reinstate the labor arbiter's Decision, which ruled out abandonment in this wise:<br><blockquote>"Anent the defense of alleged abandonment, [the labor arbiter] also find[s] the same to be incredible if not highly unthinkable because [petitioner] is a mother and at the same time the head of the family having been separated from her husband. She is the only breadwinner of the family and her job is her only means of livelihood. Abandonment of position is a matter of intention and cannot be lightly inferred, much less legally presumed from certain equivocal acts. For abandonment to arise, there must be concurrence of the intention to abandon and some overt acts from which it can be inferred that the employee concerned has no more interest to work. On the contrary, she immediately filed her complaint for illegal dismissal with prayer for reinstatement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Respondent Commission found the foregoing reasoning weak. It held that petitioner abandoned her work to avoid the investigation of the complaints filed against her, viz.:<br><blockquote>"xxx Admittedly, there was a xxx [falling] out between [petitioner] and [private] respondent which was triggered by the complaint filed by several company agents against complainant. This, however, [did] not justify complainant's absence for an indefinite period. There was no reason for her to abandon her work beginning June 10, 1995. In fact, she was supposed to confront her accusers on that day. The absence of any memorandum or order directing her dismissal, which complainant herself kept xxx harping [on] to prove illegal dismissal, all the more strengthens the theory that she was expected by the company to report for work on June 10, 1995 and on the following days. With her actuation, the company was left with no choice but to consider her as resigned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>We cannot concur with the NLRC. The unflinching rule in illegal dismissal cases is that the employer bears the burden of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> To establish a case of abandonment, the employer must prove the employee's deliberate and unjustified refusal to resume employment without any intention of returning. Specifically, the employer has to show the concurrence of the following: (1) the employee's intention to abandon employment and (2) overt acts from which such intention may be inferred -- as when the employee shows no desire to resume work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The private respondent failed to establish any of these.<br><br>The employer herein argues that the lack of a notice of termination is proof that petitioner abandoned her job. We disagree. Mere absence from work, especially where the employee has been verbally told not to report, cannot by itself constitute abandonment. To repeat, the employer has the burden of proving overt acts on the employee's part which demonstrate a desire or an intention to abandon her work. It failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>Furthermore, the filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal within a reasonable period negates abandonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the present case, the Complaint was filed about two weeks after petitioner had been dismissed or had been deemed resigned.<br><br><center><b><u>Third Issue:<br><i>Loss of Trust and Breach of Confidence</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioner insists that the complaints against her were "afterthoughts" concocted by the private respondent to gain leverage in the Complaint for illegal dismissal that she had filed. As proof, she cites the city fiscal's dismissal of the criminal Complaints for estafa brought against her by her employer.<br><br>Respondent Commission correctly held that the dismissal of the said Complaints by the city prosecutor did not bar the private respondent from considering them in evaluating petitioner's trustworthiness. Proof beyond reasonable doubt of an employee's misconduct is not required to establish loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It is enough for the employer to present substantial evidence - such amount of evidence as to induce a belief that the employee is responsible for a misconduct, and participation therein renders that employee unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by the job.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Complaints and Notices</i></u></b><br><br>Petitioner questions the NLRC's admission in evidence of the letter-complaint of Roa and the other division heads of the Sales Department of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> She alleges that these complaints were concocted by the private respondent, as she never received any copy of these; and that they were made known to her only after she had filed the Complaint for illegal dismissal.<br><br>We disagree. The notices served on her sufficiently apprised her of the existence and the nature of the accusations against her. The company president's letter of June 2, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> informed her that there was a complaint from Amado Roa and the other division heads of the Sales Department for her "alleged deliberate withholding or delaying of the release and payment of the commissions xxx, unless and until given a certain amount in consideration [of] the expeditious release of the said commissions." Celeridad's letter of June 24, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> reiterated the same gripe. That she did not receive a copy of these Complaints does not show that they were mere fabrications of the private respondent. Procedural due process only requires employers to furnish their errant employees written notices stating the particular acts or omissions constituting the grounds for their dismissal and to hear their side of the story.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Obviously, the employer complied with these. It was, therefore, incumbent upon petitioner to exercise her right by asking the management for copies of the letters.<br><br>She also alleges that the notices were fabricated since the private respondent presented them only during the appeal before the NLRC. Again, we disagree. Under its rules, the NLRC is allowed to receive evidence and to weigh its probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Furthermore, contrary to petitioner's claims, the private respondent did not have to send these notices via registered mail, because the recipient could have been served such documents in the very office where she was working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b><u><i>Accusations Must Be Substantiated</i></u></b><br><br>All in all, we believe the petitioner was sufficiently notified of the charges against her. Nonetheless, such belief does not necessarily ripen into a holding that her dismissal was justified, because the employer failed to substantiate the accusations, which are as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> The division heads, led by acting Vice President Amado Roa, complained that (a) on several occasions petitioner intentionally delayed the release of commissions, unless the sales agents agreed to give her grease money; and (b) she solicited "contributions" for various "causes" in exchange for the release of said commissions.<br><br></li><li> Elma Mendoza grumbled that, to encash her disbursement voucher, she had to give the petitioner P1,000.<br><br></li><li> Carolyn "Bam" Gonzales, one of the firm's accredited brokers, protested that although the company's book of accounts showed a disbursement of P6,712.32 representing her commissions for closing a sale, she did not receive such amount.<br><br></li><li> Rufino Pahati complained that petitioner made him sign a cash advance voucher for money given to another employee.</li></ol></blockquote>After hearing the testimonies of Roa, Mendoza and Pahati, the labor arbiter disbelieved these accusations, because "the alleged serious irregularities surfaced for the first time only after this complaint [for illegal dismissal] was filed." The labor arbiter rationalized that, if there was any truth to petitioner's involvement in any serious irregularities, "she should have been informed and furnished xxx a written notice stating the particular acts or omissions constituting the grounds for her dismissal," but that private respondent failed to show evidence that it had complied with the notice and hearing requirements.<br><br>To rectify the oversight, private respondent submitted before the NLRC two notices requiring petitioner to respond to the accusations leveled against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On this basis, Respondent Commission reversed the labor arbiter, holding that there was sufficient basis for private respondent to lose trust and confidence in petitioner. It held:<br><blockquote>"xxx Based on evidence submitted, the allegations in the complaint of Mr. Roa and several other employees stood unrebutted and the company had no recourse but to hold her responsible for the accusations leveled against her, or [at] least, to find her unfit to continue holding such sensitive and fiduciary position as finance manager.<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x</center><br>As finance manager, complainant's relationship with the company [was] one of trust and confidence. After complainant refused to answer the charges of anomalies imputed [to] her by several sales agents despite being afforded the opportunity to be heard and to defend herself, the respondent cannot be faulted for losing its trust and confidence [i]n her as financ[e] manager. Under the circumstances, it would be most unfair to compel the company to continue employing complainant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>We fail to see how the NLRC could have arrived at such a conclusion. Reviewing the evidence on record, we find that the relevant evidence for the private respondent consisted only of the following: (a) Gonzales' commission voucher (Exh. 3);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (b) the letter-complaint signed by the division heads of the Sales Department (Exh. 2);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (c) Pahati's letter-complaint (Exh. 1);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (d) the affidavits of Celeridad, Gonzales and Mendoza (Exhs. 4-A, 4-B &amp; 5);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (e) Lee's letter-notice dated June 2, 1995 (Annex 6);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (f) Celeridad's letter-notice dated June 24, 1995 (Annex 8);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and (g) several cash disbursement vouchers including those of Mendoza and Gonzales (Annexes 9-18).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>While the cash disbursement voucher and Gonzales' affidavit support the claim that her commission was released to another person, they do not show that petitioner was responsible for such irregularity. As finance manager, she approved disbursement of the company's funds, but the actual payment of cash was usually the function of the company cashier. Petitioner insists that she had no participation in the preparation of said documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The flimsiness of private respondent's evidence is obvious. In its Memorandum on Appeal, it claims that petitioner had "effective control not only over the processing of said application [referring to Pahati's cash advance] but also the subsequent salary deduction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> From such premise, private respondent concludes that petitioner was guilty of the accusations of Roa and company, viz.:<br><br>"In the light of the actuations of [petitioner] in the foregoing transaction, the accusations of the sale[s] agents and managers regarding her motives behind the delay in the payment of their commission income become credible. xxx [This] betrays a tendency on her part to circumvent [c]ompany procedures and to employ irregular means without qualms for her personal benefit, especially in pecuniary matters. She likewise exhibited a propensity to capitalize on her superior position to exert undue influence over her peers and subordinates for purposes inimical to the interest of the [c]ompany. Such mental attitude and psychological make-up of [petitioner] renders her unfit to assume a position as sensitive as that of the [f]inance [m]anager."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Labor tribunals should be cautioned against confusing conjecture with evidence. The absence of petitioner, who failed to contest the charges against her in the investigation conducted by private respondent, did not mean admission of the accusations.<br><br>Although admissible in evidence, affidavits being self-serving must be received with caution, even if presented only on appeal before the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This is because the adverse party is not afforded any opportunity to test their veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> While Roa, Mendoza and Pahati testified for the private respondent before the labor arbiter, stenographic notes of the proceedings were not taken. Since their testimonies were not retaken during the appeal before Respondent Commission, the NLRC had no basis to reverse the labor arbiter's assessment of their credibility. Their affidavits, standing alone, cannot be considered as substantial evidence. By themselves, generalized and pro forma affidavits cannot constitute relevant evidence which a reasonable mind may accept as adequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>True, employers cannot be compelled to retain in their service employees who are guilty of acts inimical to the interest of the former. True also, management has the right to dismiss erring employees as a measure of self-protection. In the case of managerial employees, employers are allowed a wider latitude of discretion in terminating their employment because they perform functions which by their nature require the full trust and confidence of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>However, loss of trust and confidence has never been intended to afford an occasion for abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It cannot be used arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously; it must be supported with substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Unsubstantiated suspicions, accusations and conclusions of employers do not provide legal justifications for dismissing employees. In case of doubt, such cases should be resolved in favor of labor, pursuant to the social justice policy of our labor laws and the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The act of extorting money from sales agents in exchange for releasing their commissions is a serious accusation, but allegation is not proof. We reiterate that the employer has the burden of proof. As already pointed out, it failed to present sufficient evidence that petitioner was responsible for such abnormality.<br><br>An employee who has been illegally dismissed is entitled to reinstatement and full back wages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> However, as held by the labor arbiter, conflict and antagonism have strained the relations between the parties; hence, reinstatement is no longer viable or advisable. Instead, petitioner should be awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Moral damages are recoverable only where the dismissal of an employee is attended by bad faith, fraud, or an act oppressive to labor; or if it is done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The adverse result of an action does not per se subject the actor to the payment of moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Neither attorney's fees nor litigation expenses should be awarded,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> absent a showing of any of the grounds provided under the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Where the award of moral damages is eliminated, so must the award for attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <i><b>GRANTED.</b></i> The assailed Decision and Resolution are hereby <i><b>SET ASIDE.</b></i> The labor arbiter's Decision is <i>REINSTATED </i>with <i><b>MODIFICATION,</b> </i>as follows:<i> </i>(1) private respondent is hereby <i><b>ORDERED</b></i> to pay petitioner (a) back wages from June 16, 1995 up to the finality of this judgment without any deduction or qualification and (b) separation pay in the sum of P8,000; and (2) the award for moral damages and attorney's fees is <i><b>DELETED</b></i>.
