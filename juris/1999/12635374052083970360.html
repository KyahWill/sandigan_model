				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A counsel-assisted, voluntary confession of guilt is evidence of strong persuasive weight.

Carbonell filed against Rizal Espiritu, along with two others -- Gerald Alicoy and Fred Malicdan -- an Information which reads:<sup> </sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><blockquote>"The undersigned accuses GERALD ALICOY Y SIANO as principal by inducement and FRED MALICDAN Y MILLER and RIZAL ESPIRITU Y KINAO as principal by direct participation [in] the crime of MURDER, committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 8th day of September, 1995, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and with treachery and evident prem[e]ditation, after the accused GERALD ALICOY Y SIANO offered the sum of P20,000.00 to the accused FRED MALICDAN Y MILLER and RIZAL ESPIRITU Y KINAO for them to kill SATO SANAD<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Y DOGA-ONG, the accused Fred Malicdan and Rizal Espiritu, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Sato Sanad with a sharp pointed instrument several times on his back inflicting on said Sato Sanad several stab wounds at his back as a result of which said Sato Sanad died.<br><br>"The commission of the offense is qualified by evident premeditation in that the three (3) accused planned the killing where the accused Gerald Alicoy offered to the accused Fred Malicdan and Rizal Espiritu the sum of P20,000.00 for them to kill Sato Sanad and the accused Fred Malicdan and Rizal Espiritu carried out the plan and killed Sato Sanad.<br><br>"The commission of the offense is likewise qualified by treachery in that the accused Rizal Espiritu suddenly held and locked the neck of Sato Sanad with his hands and thereafter the accused Fred Malicdan stabbed Sato Sanad several times on his back and the accused adopted that mode of attack to ensure that the deceased could not put up a defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned on May 14, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Espiritu<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and his co-accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> entered a plea of not guilty. After the prosecution presented its evidence, a joint Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> was filed by the counsels of Alicoy and Malicdan, namely, Jose M. Molintas and Fred Bagbagen. On August 20, 1996, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> acquitting the two accused for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The trial of Appellant Espiritu, however, continued.<br><br>On October 30, 1996, the court <i>a quo </i>rendered its Decision and the dispositive portion thereof reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court [f]inds accused Rizal Espiritu y Kinao guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as defined under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Section 6 of Republic Act 7659 as charged in the Information, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua; to indemnify the heirs of Sato Sannad the sum of P50,000.00 for his death; P200,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, all indemnifications are without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the costs,<br><br>"In the service of his sentence, accused Rizal Espiritu is entitled to be credited 4/5 of his preventive imprisonment in accordance with Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal direct to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>The Facts </b><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">Version of the Prosecution</i></center></u><br>In the 35-page Brief for the Appellee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the solicitor general narrated the prosecution's version of the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>"Between 7:30 and 8:00 o'clock in the evening of September 8, 1995, Henry Saclangan saw Sato Sanad conversing with appellant Rizal Espiritu in front of Starlight Bakery located at Sunflower Street, Navy Base Subdivision, Baguio City. Later, he saw Sato Sanad and appellant, who placed his arm around the former's shoulder, walk.<br><br>"At about 9:00 o'clock in that evening, Jeffrey Bernabe was in his house at Sunflower St., Navy Base Subdivision, Baguio City conversing with friends. Momentarily, he heard someone outside shouting for help. When he went out, Jeffrey Bernabe saw a man, who turned out to be Sato Sanad, wounded and bleeding. Other people came out of their houses but no one dared to help Sato Sanad who lay prostrate on the ground. Jeffrey Bernabe went back to his house and boarded his truck. Accompanied by his friends and helpers, Jeffrey Bernabe brought Sato Sanad to the Baguio General Hospital where he died on arrival.<br><br>"At about 9:00 o'clock that same evening, Police Officer Johnson Ayagen of the Pacdal Police Substation, Baguio City, received a report from the base operator of a fight that occurred in Sunflower Street. He was ordered to immediately proceed to the place. Along the way, PO Ayagen met an Isuzu Elf Truck whose driver flagged him down. He was informed by Jeffrey Bernabe that he and his companions were bringing a wounded person to the hospital. PO Ayagen told the driver, Jeffrey Bernabe, to proceed to the hospital and to wait for him there as he would first proceed to the crime scene. The police met nobody at the crime scene. What they found were bloodstains on the ground; also, a bloodied, perforated maong jacket and false dentures. When they arrived at the hospital, Jeffrey Bernabe informed them that the victim was already dead.<br><br>"Dr. Vladimir Villaseñor of the PNP Crime Laboratory Service, Camp Bado Dangwa, Benguet, conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of Sato Sanad. Per Medico-Legal Report issued by Dr. Villaseñor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the victim sustained the following injuries, to wit:<br><br>Trunk and Extremities:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Stab wound, right suprascapular region, measuring 1.5 x 0.5cm, 5cm from the posterior midline, directed anteriorwards, downwards, and medialwards, lacerating the underlying soft tissues and muscles.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right scapular region, measuring 1.2 x 0.4cm, 6cms from the posterior midline, directed anteriorwards, downwards and medialwards, lacerating soft tissues and muscles.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right scapular region, measuring 1.5 x 0.6cm, 7cms from the posterior midline, directed anteriorwards, downwards and medialwards, lacerating soft tissues and muscles.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right infrascapular region, measuring 1.8 x 0.9cm, 14cms from the posterior midline 10cms deep, directed anteriorwards, slightly downwards and medialwards, passing through the 9th right intercostal space, lacerating the lower lobe of the right lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right lumbar region, measuring 1.8 x 0.8cm, 12cms from the posterior midline.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right para-vertebral region, measuring 1.6 x 0.6cm, 2cms from the posterior midline.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, right para-vertebral region, measuring 1.8 x 1cm, 19cms from the posterior midline, 10cms deep, directed anteriorwards, slightly upwards and medialwards, passing through the 8th right intercostal space, lacerating the lower lobe of the right lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left suprascapular region, measuring 1.5 x 0.5cm, 9cms from the posterior midline, 8cms deep, directed anteriorwards, downwards and medialwards, passing through the 2nd left intercostal space, lacerating the upper lobe of the left lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left suprascapular region, measuring 1.5 x 0.5cm, 8cms from the posterior midline, 9cms deep, directed anteriorwards, downwards and medialwards, passing through the 6th left intercostal space, lacerating the lower lobe of the left lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left intrascapular region, measuring 0.5 x 0.3cm, 14cms from the posterior midline.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left infrascapular region, measuring 1.7 x 0.6cm, 6cms from the posterior midline, 8cms deep, directed anteriorwards, slightly upwards and medialwards, fracturing the 9th left thoracic rib, lacerating the left lower lobe of the left lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left para-vertebral region, measuring 1.5 x 0.5cm, 2cms from the posterior midlin[e], 8.5cms deep, directed posteriorwards, slightly upwards and medialwards, passing through the 9th left intercostal space, lacerating the lower lobe of the left lung.<br><br></li><li> Stab wound, left lumber region, measuring 2.5 x 0.8cm, .2cm from the posterior midline, directed anteriorwards, slightly downwards and medialwards, lacerating the underlying soft tissues and muscles.</li></ol></blockquote>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Cause of Death: Hemorrhage as a result of multiple stab wounds on the body.<br><br>"At the wake of Sato Sanad, Reyvo Sanad, his son, was informed by his cousin, Nestor Kinao, that appellant Rizal Espiritu, a cousin of Nestor mentioned something about the killing of his father. Together, they sought out appellant. They found him in the company of his uncle, Alfredo Kinao, who was also related to the wife of Sato Sanad. When confronted, appellant was persuaded to relate his participation in the killing of Sato Sanad. Appellant eventually confessed to being one of the assailants of Sato Sanad. Then, all those present agreed to meet the following day at the Baguio City Police where appellant would surrender.<br><br>"The following day, or on September 20, 1995, appellant, accompanied by Alfredo Kinao, met with the victim's relatives at the Baguio City Police Station. However, the day before their meeting, Alfredo Kinao had talked to Atty. Daniel Mangallay in his office and asked him to be appellant's counsel. Atty. Mangallay thus went to the Baguio City Police Station where he met the others. Atty. Mangallay conferred with appellant regarding the case and agreed to represent him.<br><br>"Prior to the investigation, Atty. Mangallay informed the police that appellant would voluntarily give his statement. Police Officer Wilfredo Cabanayan, who was assigned to take appellant's statements, apprised the latter, in the presence of his lawyer, of his constitutional rights to remain silent, to have competent and independent counsel of his choice and his right against self-incrimination. After Atty. Mangallay, himself, had explained to appellant his constitutional rights, the latter signified his willingness and readiness to give his statement. Police Officer Cabanayan propounded his questions in Ilocano to which appellant replied in the same dialect. The questions and answers were then translated into English.<br><br>"Thereafter, appellant and Atty. Mangallay affixed their respective signatures on the sworn statement. During the proceeding, Atty. Mangallay was at all times assisting appellant. x x x.<br><br>"x x x x x x x x x<br><br>"Thereafter, appellant, accompanied by Atty. Mangallay and Police Officer Cabanayan, was presented before Prosecutor Dizon for personal examination. Appellant declared that he understood his statement as explained to him by Prosecutor Dizon. Thereafter, appellant again signed his sworn statement.<br><br>"At the preliminary investigation conducted by Prosecutor Romeo Carbonell, appellant was likewise assisted by Atty. Mangallay. Accused Gerald Alicoy and Fred Malicdan were present with their respective counsel. During the clarificatory questions, appellant repeated the contents of his sworn statement given before the police which was recorded in the transcript of stenographic notes. Further, Prosecutor Carbonell conducted an ocular inspection of the scene of the crime with all the accused and their counsel present."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><center><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></center><br>Denying participation in the killing of Sanad, Appellant Espiritu assails the admissibility of his extrajudicial confession. In the 23-page Appellant's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the defense submitted its version of the facts in this wise:<br><blockquote>"AFREDO KINAO, the uncle of the accused, stated that on September 17, 1995, he was at a vigil in Quirino Hill, when his son arrived and told him that they had to see the accused who was at the police station. He asked the police if they could bring out the accused. They were able to do so when they signed a promissory note. The police told him that Espiritu was a suspect in the killing of Sato Sannad and they had to return him on September 20, 1995. Upon their return, Espiritu told the police, that he [would] tell them what happened since his conscience was bothering him. The police advised them to get a lawyer to assist the accused.<br><br>"He added that on September 19, 1995, he went to Atty. Mangallay's house, but was advised to see the latter in his office on September 20, 1995. When informed by the police that a lawyer [was] needed, he went to Atty. Mangallay's office, and they proceeded to the police station. Upon their arrival, the statement of the accused was taken. Then they proceeded to the prosecutor's office for the subscription of the statement.<br><br>"RIZAL ESPIRITU stated that the victim's relatives asked him to give a statement to the effect that he together with Alicoy and Malicdan killed Sato Sannad. They offered him P50,000.00 and said that the two [would] be put in jail. He did not participate in the killing of Sannad. He went to the police station accompanied by Alfredo Kinao and the relatives of the victim on September 20, 1995. He was advised by the police to get a lawyer and Alfredo Kinao, left to get a lawyer but he did not authorize him to do so. The police started to take and prepare his statement at around 8:00 AM and the lawyer arrived at around 10:00 AM, when his statement was already being taken. Lawyer Mangallay did not give him any advice and did not explain in detail the contents of the statement. He was not advised nor informed that by giving the statement he could be imprisoned and even sentenced to death.<br><br>"On sur-rebuttal, he declared that it was only after he had related the incident that the police told him to get a lawyer. He was at the investigation room when the lawyer arrived together with Alfredo Kinao and at that time, his statement had already been taken by the police."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The trial court convicted Espiritu on the basis of his confession and corroborating evidence of <i>corpus delicti</i>. The confession was admitted in evidence, because the Court believed that the appellant voluntarily executed it while being assisted by a competent and independent counsel. Further, during the investigation conducted by Assistant Prosecutor Romeo Carbonell, Espiritu affirmed that he had voluntarily executed the extrajudicial confession before the police, and he even reenacted how Sanad was killed.<br><br><center><b><u>Assignment of Errors</u></b></center><br>Appellant assigns the following errors to the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><blockquote>"I. The court <u>a quo</u> gravely erred in admitting in evidence the uncounselled extra-judicial confession (Exhibit "B") of the accused-appellant.<br><br>"II. The court a quo erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>In resolving this appeal, the Court will address two main issues: (1) the admissibility of the extrajudicial confession and (2) the sufficiency of the evidence of guilt.<br><br><center><b><u>This Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><center><u><b>First Issue:</b><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">Admissibility of Extrajudicial Confession</i></u></center><br>In assailing the admissibility of his extrajudicial confession, appellant invokes paragraphs 1 and 3 of Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. He insists that his confession was obtained in violation of his rights (1) to have an independent and competent counsel and (2) to be informed of such right. Further, he argues that he was not advised by Atty. Mangallay of the consequences of the execution of a confession.<br><br>We disagree. We are convinced that the confession of Appellant Espiritu is admissible in evidence, as it was satisfactorily shown that it was (1) voluntary and (2) made with the assistance of a competent and independent counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>With respect to the first requisite, we find that Espiritu readily admitted killing Sanad when he was confronted by the relatives of the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thereafter, without being "invited" by the investigating officers, he went to the police station and voluntarily gave his statement to SPO1 Wilfredo P. Cabanayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Later, appellant affirmed before Prosecutor Romeo Carbonell the fact that he, with Atty. Mangallay, had gone to the police station to surrender and that the said counsel had assisted him when the police started taking his statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In his confession, appellant admitted that he and Malicdan killed Sanad, after being hired by Alicoy to do so for the sum of P20,000. Aside from describing the details of how he and his cohort killed Sanad, Espiritu, during an ocular inspection, even pointed out the place where the killing had been committed.<br><br>These acts of the appellant are clear manifestations that, contrary to his protestations, no "torture, force, violence, threat, intimidation or any other means" was used against him to force him to confess.<br><br><u><i>Competent and<br>Independent Counsel</i></u><br><br>The defense contends that Atty. Mangallay was retained by Alfredo Kinao and not by appellant. It is also argued that the said lawyer was unable to advise or to explain the contents of the extrajudicial confession to the appellant before the latter signed it.<br><br>We are not persuaded. At the outset, we must clarify that the right to counsel does not mean that the accused must personally hire his own counsel. The constitutional requirement is satisfied when a counsel is (1) engaged by anyone acting on behalf of the person under investigation or (2) appointed by the court upon petition of the said person or by someone on his behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, that Atty. Mangallay was retained not by the appellant personally but by his uncle, Alfredo Kinao, is not proof of counsel deprivation. The fact remains that Kinao, in hiring the counsel, acted on behalf of Appellant Espiritu. Besides, Espiritu did not object when Atty. Mangallay represented him during the investigations before the police and the city prosecutor. In fact, he expressly acknowledged Atty. Mangallay as his counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The meaning of "competent counsel" was explained in People v. Deniega<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>"xxx [T]he lawyer called to be present during such investigations should be as far as reasonably possible, the choice of the individual undergoing questioning. If the lawyer were one furnished in the accused's behalf, it is important that he should be competent and independent, i.e., that he is willing to fully safeguard the constitutional rights of the accused, as distinguished from one who would merely be giving a routine, peremptory and meaningless recital of the individual's constitutional rights. In People v. Basay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court stressed that an accused's right to be informed of the right to remain silent and to counsel `contemplates the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.'<br><br>"Ideally therefore, a lawyer engaged for an individual facing custodial investigation (if the latter could not afford one) `should be engaged by the accused (himself), or by the latter's relative or person authorized by him to engage an attorney or by the court, upon proper petition of the accused or person authorized by the accused to file such petition.' Lawyers engaged by the police, whatever testimonials are given as proof of their probity and supposed independence, are generally suspect, as in many areas, the relationship between lawyers and law enforcement authorities can be symbiotic.<br><br><center>"x x x x x x x x x</center><br>"x x x The competent or independent lawyer so engaged should be present from the beginning to end, i.e., at all stages of the interview, counseling or advising caution reasonably at every turn of the investigation, and stopping the interrogation once in a while either to give advice to the accused that he may either continue, choose to remain silent or terminate the interview."</blockquote>Undoubted is the competence of Atty. Mangallay who was himself presented by the prosecution as witness. Without violating the rule on privileged communication, he testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q</td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">So all the while the provisions of this preliminary questions from A, B and C were asked, it was only the police who [h]as all the time been talking to the accused?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">Of course, before the Police Officer propounded those questions, we agreed that it be propounded in Ilocano dialect so that the accused can understand, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">Who agreed, you?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">The accused, me and the Police Officer, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">And do you know if it was reduced first in Ilocano version before it was translated in English version?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">It was propounded in English dialect and then into the Ilocano dialect and after that, the accused was asked if he understood the same, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">What do you mean, if he understood the same?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">Of course, if he got the meaning of what was propounded to him, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">What, for example?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">That he had the right to counsel.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><p align="justify">And what did the accused say?</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">The accused clearly stated that he understood the same.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">No more?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">No more, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">And, [were] those the only questions being propounded during the preliminary questions?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><p align="justify">Of course there were several questions.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">What [were] those questions?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">That the accused ha[d] the right to remain silent.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">And what did the accused say?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">Of course, he said that he [was] willing to give his statement.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">And what else, no more?

In a derivative sense, it means the substantial fact that a crime was committed. It is made up of two elements: (a) that a certain result has been prove[n], for example, a man has died or a building has been burned, and (b) that some person is criminally responsible for the act. Section 3, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court does not mean that every element of the crime charged must be clearly established by independent evidence apart from the confession. Otherwise, the utility of the confession as a species of proof would vanish if it were necessary, in addition to the confession, to adduce other evidence sufficient to justify conviction independently of such confession. Otherwise stated, the other evidence need not, independently of the confession, establish the <i>corpus delicti</i> beyond a reasonable doubt." (People v.
