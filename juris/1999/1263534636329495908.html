				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The primordial duty of judges is to decide cases justly and expeditiously. Indeed, justice delayed is justice denied.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b></center><br>The Court stresses this principle in resolving the June 3, 1997 sworn Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of Arnulfo B. Tauro, charging Judge Angel V. Colet of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 8, of failure to decide Criminal Case Nos. 92-109346, 92-109347 and 92-109348 (three counts of violation of Art. 125, Revised Penal Code) within the reglementary period of 90 days.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>In his sworn Complaint, Tauro alleges the following:<br><blockquote>"1. That I am the complaining witness in People of the Philippines vs. Jose Sta. Cruz, Sr. docketed under Criminal Case Nos. 92-109346, 92-109347 and 92-109348 for Violation of Article 125 (b) (Three Counts), raffled to RTC Br. 43, Manila, presided by the Honorable Judge ANGEL V. COLET;<br><br>"2. That the presentation of evidence by both parties in the aforementioned cases has been terminated in the early part of December 1995, after postponements, and resettings, and aggravated by the non-punctuality of the Honorable Judge, who often comes to court late, and sometimes absent which caused the said cases to be considerably delayed;<br><br>"3. That the said cases were submitted for decision after the same ha[ve] been terminated in the same year of 1995;<br><br>"4. That the said Honorable Judge failed to decide my case within the 90 day period as mandated by law;<br><br>"5. That after the 90 day period to decide the aforementioned cases lapsed, the said Honorable Judge was transferred to Quezon City Regional Trial Court bringing with him the records[;] and not long thereafter, I was informed that the said Honorable Judge was again transferred to Baguio City Regional Trial Court with all the pertaining documents relative to the above cited cases;<br><br>"6. That until now the aforementioned cases [have] remained undecided for no valid reasons at all[;] or for more than a year and a half now the said Honorable Judge ignored and blatantly disregarded the 90 day period mandated by law;<br><br>"7. That if the said Honorable Judge has collected his monthly salaries and submits REPORTS that he has no pending cases to be decided, then he is not candid with the Honorable Supreme Court;<br><br>"8. That under the facts as above presented, it is clear that Honorable Judge ANGEL V. COLET has violated Section 5 of Republic Act 269, as [a]mended, which ordains that judges must decide cases submitted for decision within ninety (90) days; Likewise, Canon 1, Rule 1.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which ordains that a judge should administer justice impartially and without delay was grossly violated;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>In his Comment filed on October 10, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Respondent Judge Colet admits that he failed to decide the said cases within the prescribed period, but pleads for leniency.

He is expected to act within the demands of his exalted position. A judge should always be the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence and should administer justice impartially and without delay. He should be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence, dispose of the court's business promptly, and decide cases within the required periods."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br><br><center>x x x x x x x x x</center><br>"In failing to decide the cases subject of the complaint within the prescribed period, respondent judge has violated Canon 1, Rule 1.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which provides that `A Judge should administer justice impartially and without delay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>The OCA recommends that respondent be fined in the amount of P10,000.<br><br><center><b><u>This Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>We agree with the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator.<br><br><i><center><b><u>Speedy Resolution of Cases</u></b></center></i><br>Respondent admits that he failed to decide the aforementioned cases within the three-month period prescribed by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> For this reason, he should be administratively sanctioned.<br><br>Indeed, judges are mandated to dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Accordingly, they have been consistently reminded that delay in the disposition of cases ordinarily constitutes gross inefficiency and, as such, is deemed inexcusable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, should the resolution of a case within the reglementary period prove to be unlikely, they may ask this Court for a reasonable extension of time to prepare a decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In the present case, respondent judge never asked for extension, for he forgot that the cases were pending.<br><br>As respondent himself admits, the charge against him cannot be justified by the claims that transcripts of stenographic notes (TSN) were not immediately transmitted to him, and that he totally forgot the cases after he was transferred to other stations.<br><br>Judges are required to take down notes and to proceed in the preparation of decisions, even without the TSNs. The Court has held that the three-month reglementary period continues to run, with or without them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, their absence or the delay in their transcription cannot excuse respondent judge's failure to decide the cases within the prescribed period.<br><br>Further, respondent was remiss in his duty to adopt a system of record management, as evidenced by the loss of the records of the cases. Worse, he did not even endeavor to locate the missing documents. In fact, he totally forgot about the pending cases, until he accidentally came across them. In this light, members of the bench are reminded that they are required to organize their courts so as to bolster the prompt and efficient dispatch of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Villanueva</i>, we ruled:<br><blockquote>"A judge xxx is expected to keep his own record of cases so that he may act on them promptly without undue delay. It is incumbent upon him to devise an efficient recording and filing system in his court so that no disorderliness can affect the flow of cases and their speedy disposition. x x x Proper and efficient court management is as much his responsibility. He is the one directly responsible for the proper discharge of his official functions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Accordingly, we adopt the recommendation of the OCA that respondent judge be fined P10,000. In <i>Celino v.
