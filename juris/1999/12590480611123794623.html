				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The constitutionality of Sections 4 and 7 of Republic Act No. 8249 – an act which further defines the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> – is being challenged in this petition for prohibition and mandamus.&nbsp; Petitioner Panfilo Lacson, joined by petitioners-intervenors Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr., also seeks to prevent the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> from proceeding with the trial of Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 (for multiple murder) against them on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>The antecedents of this case, as gathered from the parties’ pleadings and documentary proofs, are as follows:<br><br>In the early morning of May 18, 1995, eleven (11) persons believed to be members of the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> gang, reportedly an organized crime syndicate which had been involve in a spate of bank robberies in Metro Manila, were slain&nbsp; along Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City by elements of the Anti-Bank Robbery and Intelligence Task Group (ABRITG) headed by Chief Superintendent Jewel Canson of the Philippine National Police (PNP).&nbsp; The ABRITG was composed of police officers from the Traffic Management Command (TMC) led by petitioner-intervenor Senior Superintendent Francisco Zubia, Jr.; Presidential Anti-Crime Commission – Task Force Habagat (PACC-TFH) headed by petitioner Chief Superintendent Panfilo M. Lacson; Central Police District Command (CPDC) led by Chief Superintendent Ricardo de Leon; and the Criminal Investigation Command (CIC) headed by petitioner-intervenor Chief Superintendent Romeo Acop.<br><br>Acting on a media expose of SPO2 Eduardo delos Reyes, a member of the CIC, that what actually transpired at dawn of May 18, 1995 was a summary execution (or a rub out) and not a shoot-out between the Kuratong Baleleng gang members and the ABRITG, Ombudsman Aniano Desierto formed a panel of investigators headed by the Deputy Ombudsman for Military Affairs, Bienvenido Blancaflor, to investigate the incident.&nbsp; This panel later absolve from any criminal liability all the PNP officers and personnel allegedly involved in the May 18, 1995 incident, with a finding that the said incident was a legitimate police operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>However, a review board led by Overall Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa modified the Blancaflor panel’s finding and recommended the indictment for multiple murder against twenty-six (26) respondents, including herein petitioner and intervenors.&nbsp; This recommendation was approved by the Ombudsman, except for the withdrawal of the charges against Chief Supt. Ricardo de Leon.<br><br>Thus, on November 2, 1995, petitioner Panfilo Lacson was among those charged as principal in eleven (11) informations for murder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> before the <i>Sandiganbayan’s</i> Second Division, while intervenors Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr. were among those charged in the same informations as accessories after-the-fact.<br><br>Upon motion by all the accused in the 11 informations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Sandiganbayan allowed them to file a motion for reconsideration of the Ombudsman’s action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>After conducting a reinvestigation, the Ombudsman filed on March 1, 1996 eleven (11) <b>amended</b> informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> before the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, wherein petitioner was charged only as an accessory, together with Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr. and others.&nbsp; One of the accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was dropped from the case.<br><br>On March 5-6, 1996, all the accused filed separate motions questioning the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, asserting that under the amended informations, the cases fall within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court pursuant to Section 2 (paragraphs a and c) of Republic Act No. 7975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They contend that the said law limited the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> to cases where one or more of the "<b>principal</b> accused” are government officials with Salary Grade (SG) 27 or higher, or PNP officials with the rank of Chief Superintendent (Brigadier General) or higher.&nbsp; The highest ranking <b>principal</b> accused in the amended informations has the rank of only a Chief Inspector, and none has the equivalent of at least SG 27.<br><br>Thereafter, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated May 8, 1996 (promulgated on May 9, 1996), penned by Justice Demetriou, with Justices Lagman and de Leon concurring, and Justices Balajadia and Garchitorena dissenting,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> admitted the amended information and ordered the cases transferred to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court which has original and exclusive jurisdiction under R.A. 7975, as none of the principal accused has the rank of Chief Superintendent or higher.<br><br>On May 17, 1996, the Office of the Special Prosecutor moved for a reconsideration, insisting that the cases should remain with the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.&nbsp; This was opposed by petitioner and some of the accused.<br><br>While these motions for reconsideration were pending resolution, and even before the issue of jurisdiction cropped up with the filing of the amended informations on March 1, 1996, House Bill No. 2299<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and No. 1094<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (sponsored by Representatives Edcel C. Lagman and Neptali M. Gonzales II, respectively), as well as Senate Bill No. 844<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (sponsored by Senator Neptali Gonzales), were introduced in Congress, defining/expanding the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; Specifically, the said bills sought, among others, to amend the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan by deleting the word “principal” from the phrase “principal accused” in Section 2 (paragraphs a and c) of R.A. No. 7975.<br><br>These bills were consolidated and later approved into law as R.A. No. 8249<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>.&nbsp; The law is entitled, “AN ACT FURTHER DEFINING THE JURISDICTION OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1606, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.”&nbsp; It took effect on February 25, 1997.13 by the President of the Philippines on February 5, 1997.<br><br>Subsequently, on March 5, 1997, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration of the Special Prosecutor, ruling that it “stands pat in its resolution dated May 8, 1996.”<br><br>On the same day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> issued an ADDENDUM to its March 5, 1997 Resolution, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>“<b>After</b> Justice Lagman wrote the Resolution and Justice Demetriou concurred in it, but <b>before</b> Justice de Leon, Jr. rendered his concurring and dissenting opinion, the legislature enacted Republic Act 8249 and the President of the Philippines approved it on February 5, 1997.&nbsp; <b>Considering the pertinent provisions of the new law, Justices Lagman and Demetriou are now in favor of granting, as they are now granting, the Special Prosecutor’s motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Justice de Leon has already done so in his concurring and dissenting opinion.</b><br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br>“<b>Considering that three of the accused in each of these cases are PNP Chief Superintendents:</b>&nbsp; namely, Jewel T. Canson, Romeo M. Acop and Panfilo M. Lacson, <b>and that trial has not yet begun in all these cases </b>– in fact, no order of arrest has been issued – <b>this court has competence to take cognizance of these cases.</b><br><br>“To recapitulate, the net result of all the foregoing is that by the vote of 3 to 2, <b>the court admitted the Amended Informations in these cases and by the unanimous vote of 4 with 1 neither concurring nor dissenting, retained jurisdiction to try and decide the cases.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>Petitioner now questions the constitutionality of Section 4 R.A. No. 8249, including Section 7 thereof which provides that the said law “shall apply to all cases pending in any court over which trial has not begun as of the approval hereof.”&nbsp; Petitioner argues that:<br><blockquote>“a)&nbsp; The questioned provision of the statute were introduced by the authors thereof in bad faith as it was made to precisely suit the situation in which petitioner’s cases were in at the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> by restoring jurisdiction thereover to it, thereby violating his right to procedural due process and the equal protection clause of the Constitution.&nbsp; Further, from the way the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> has foot-dragged for nine (9) months the resolution of a pending incident involving the transfer of the cases to the Regional Trial Court, the passage of the law may have been timed to overtake such resolution to render the issue therein moot, and frustrate the exercise of petitioner’s vested rights under the old <i>Sandiganbayan</i> law (RA 7975)<br><br>“b)&nbsp; Retroactive application of the law is plain from the fact that it was again made to suit the peculiar circumstances in which petitioner’s cases were under, namely, that trial had not yet commenced, as provided in Section 7, to make certain that those cases will no longer be remanded to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, as the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> alone should try them, thus making it an <i>ex post facto</i> legislation and a denial of the right of petitioner as an accused in Criminal Case Nos. 23047 – 23057 to procedural due process<br><br>“c)&nbsp; The title of the law is misleading in that it contains the aforesaid “innocuous” provisions in Sections 4 and 7 which actually expands rather than defines the old <i>Sandiganbayan</i> law (RA 7975), thereby violating the one-title-one-subject requirement for the passage of statutes under Section 26(1), Article VI of the Constitution.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>For their part, the intervenors, in their petition-in-intervention, add that “while Republic Act No. 8249 innocuously appears to have merely expanded the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, the introduction of Sections 4 and 7 in said statute impressed upon it the character of a class legislation and an <i>ex-post facto</i> statute intended to apply specifically to the accused in the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> case pending before the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They further argued that if their case is tried before the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> their right to procedural due process would be violated as they could no longer avail of the two-tiered appeal to the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, which they acquired under R.A. 7975, before recourse to the Supreme Court.<br><br>Both the Office of the Ombudsman and the Solicitor General filed separate pleadings in support of the constitutionality of the challenged provisions of the law in question and praying that both the petition and the petition-in-intervention be dismissed.<br><br>This Court then issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> requiring the parties to file simultaneously within a <b>nonextendible</b> period of ten (10) days from notice thereof additional memoranda on the question of whether the subject amended informations filed in Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 sufficiently alleged the commission by the accused therein of the crime charged within the meaning Section 4 b of Republic Act No. 8249, so as to bring the said cases <b>within</b> the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The parties, except for the Solicitor General who is representing the People of the Philippines, filed the required supplemental memorandum within the nonextendible reglementary period.<br><br>The established rule is that every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality, and to justify its nullification there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not a doubtful and argumentative one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The burden of proving the invalidity of the law lies with those who challenge it.&nbsp; That burden, we regret to say, was not convincingly discharged in the present case.<br><br>The creation of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> was mandated in Section 5, Article XIII of the 1973 Constitution, which provides:<br><blockquote>“<b>SEC. 5.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Batasang Pambansa shall create a special court, to be known as Sandiganbayan, which shall have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses committed by public officers and employees including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office as may be determined by law."</blockquote>The said special court is retained in the new (1987) Constitution under the following provision in Article XI, Section 4:<br><blockquote>“<b>Section 4.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The present anti-graft court known as the Sandiganbayan shall continue to function and exercise its jurisdiction as now or hereafter may be provided by law.”</blockquote>Pursuant to the constitutional mandate, Presidential Decree No. 1486<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> created the <i>Sandiganbayan.</i>&nbsp; Thereafter, the following laws on the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, in chronological order, were enacted:&nbsp; P.D.

It is due to this deletion of the word “principal” that the parties herein are at loggerheads over the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.&nbsp; Petitioner and intervenors, relying on R.A. 7975, argue that the Regional Trial Court, not the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, has jurisdiction over the Subject criminal cases since none of the <b>principal</b> accused under the <b>amended</b> information has the rank of Superintendent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or higher.&nbsp;

This paragraph b pertains to “<b>other offenses</b> or <b>felonies</b> whether simple or complexed with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a of [Section 4, R.A. 8249] in relation to their office.”&nbsp; The phrase “other offenses or felonies” is too broad as to include the crime of murder, provided it was committed in relation to the accused’s official functions.&nbsp; Thus, under said paragraph b, what determines the <i>Sandiganbayan’s</i> jurisdiction is the <b>official position</b> or <b>rank</b> of the offender – that is, whether he is one of those public officers or employees enumerated in paragraph a of Section 4.&nbsp; The offenses mentioned in paragraphs a, b and c of the same Section 4 do <b>not</b> make any reference to the <b>criminal participation</b> of the accused public officer as to whether he is charged as a principal, accomplice or accessory.&nbsp; In enacting R.A. 8249, the Congress simply restored the original provisions of P.D. 1606 which does not mention the criminal participation of the public officer as a requisite to determine the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.<br><br>Petitioner and intervenors’ posture that Section 4 and 7 of R.A. 8249 violate their right to equal protection of the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> because its enactment was particularly directed only to the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> cases in the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, is a contention too shallow to deserve merit.&nbsp; No concrete evidence and convincing argument were presented to warrant a declaration of an act of the entire Congress and signed into law by the highest officer of the co-equal executive department as unconstitutional.&nbsp; Every classification made by law is presumed reasonable.&nbsp; Thus, the party who challenges the law must present proof of arbitrariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>It is an established precept in constitutional law that the guaranty of the equal protection of the laws is not violated by a legislation based on reasonable classification.&nbsp; The classification is reasonable and not arbitrary when there is concurrence of four elements, namely:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="TOP" width="10%" align="LEFT">(1)</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"><p> it must rest on substantial distinction;</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">(2)</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> it must be germane to the purpose of the law;</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">(3)</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> must not be limited to existing conditions only, and</td></tr><tr><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT">(4)</td><td valign="TOP" align="LEFT"> must apply equally to all members of the same class,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>all of which are present in this case.<br><br>The challengers of Sections 4 and 7 of R.A. 8249 failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality and reasonableness of the questioned provisions.&nbsp; The classification between those pending cases involving the concerned public officials whose trial has not yet commenced and whose cases could have been affected by the amendments of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> jurisdiction under R.A. 8249, as against those cases where trial had already started as of the approval of the law, rests on substantial distinction that makes real differences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In the first instance, evidence against them were not yet presented, whereas in the latter the parties had already submitted their respective proofs, examined witness and presented documents.&nbsp; Since it is within the power of Congress to define the jurisdiction of courts subject to the constitutional limitations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> it can be reasonably anticipated that an alteration of that jurisdiction would necessarily affect pending cases, which is why it has to provide for a remedy in the form of a transitory provision.&nbsp; Thus, petitioner and intervenors cannot now claim that Sections 4 and 7 placed them under a different category from those similarly situated as them.&nbsp; Precisely, paragraph a of Section 4 provides that it shall apply to “all cases involving" certain public officials and, under the transitory provision in Section 7, to “all cases pending in any court.”&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner and intervenors’ arguments, the law is not particularly directed only to the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> cases.&nbsp; The transitory provision does not only cover cases which are in the Sandiganbayan but also in “<b>any court</b>.”&nbsp; It just happened that the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> cases are one of those affected by the law.&nbsp; Moreover, those cases where trial had already begun are not affected by the transitory provision under Section 7 of the new law (R.A. 8249).<br><br>In their futile attempt to have said sections nullified, heavy reliance is premised on what is perceived as bad faith on the part of a Senator and two Justices of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> for their participation in the passage of the said provisions.&nbsp; In particular, it is stressed that the Senator had expressed strong sentiments against those officials involved in the <i>Kuratong Baleleng</i> cases during the hearings conducted on the matter by the committee headed by the Senator.&nbsp; Petitioner further contends that the legislature is biased against him as he claims to have been selected from among the 67 million other Filipinos as the object of the deletion of the word “principal” in paragraph a, Section 4 of P.D. 1606, as amended, and of the transitory provision of R.A. 8249.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> R.A. 8249, while still a bill, was acted, deliberated, considered by 23 other Senators and by about 250 Representatives, and was separately approved by the Senate and House of Representatives and, finally, by the President of the Philippines.<br><br>On the perceived bias that the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> Justices allegedly had against petitioner during the committee hearings, the same would not constitute sufficient justification to nullify an otherwise valid law.&nbsp; Their presence and participation in the legislative hearings was deemed necessary by Congress since the matter before the committee involves the graft court of which one is the head of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> and the other a member thereof.&nbsp;

It is a substantive law on jurisdiction which is not penal in character.&nbsp; Penal laws are those acts of the Legislature which prohibit certain acts and establish penalties for their violations;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or those that define crimes, treat of their nature, and provide for their punishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> R.A. 7975, which amended P.D. 1606 as regards the <i>Sandiganbayan’s</i> jurisdiction, its mode of appeal and other procedural matters, has been declared by the Court as not a penal law, but clearly a procedural statute, i.e. one which prescribes rules of procedure by which courts applying laws of all kinds can properly administer justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Not being a penal law, the retroactive application of R.A. 8249 cannot be challenged as unconstitutional.<br><br>Petitioner’s and intervenor’s contention that their right to a two-tiered appeal which they acquired under R.A. 7975 has been diluted by the enactment of R.A. 8249, is incorrect.&nbsp; The same contention has already been rejected by the court several times<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> considering that the right to appeal is <b>not</b> a <b>natural right</b> but statutory in nature that can be regulated by law.&nbsp; The mode of procedure provided for in the statutory right of appeal is not included in the prohibition against <i>ex post facto</i> laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> R.A. 8249 pertains only to matters of procedure, and being merely an amendatory statute it does not partake the nature of an <i>ex post facto</i> law.&nbsp; It does not mete out a penalty and, therefore, does not come within the prohibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Moreover, the law did not alter the rules of evidence or the mode of trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It has been ruled that adjective statutes may be made applicable to actions pending and unresolved at the time of their passage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In any case, R.A. 8249 has preserved the accused’s right to appeal to the Supreme Court to review questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> On the removal of the intermediate review facts, the Supreme Court still has the power of review to determine if the presumption of innocence has been convincingly overcome.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Another point.&nbsp; The challenged law does not violate the one-title-one-subject provisions of the Constitution.&nbsp; Much emphasis is placed on the wording in the title of the law that it “defines” the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> jurisdiction when what it allegedly does is to “expand” its jurisdiction.&nbsp; The expansion in the jurisdiction of the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, if it can be considered as such, does not have to be expressly stated in the title of the law because such is the necessary consequence of the amendments.&nbsp; The requirement that every bill must only have one subject expressed in the title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> is satisfied if the title is comprehensive enough, as in this case, to include subjects related to the general purpose which the statute seeks to achieve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Such rule is severally interpreted and should be given a practical rather than a technical construction.&nbsp; There is here sufficient compliance with such requirement, since the title of R.A. 8249 expresses the general subject (involving the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and the amendment of P.D. 1606, as amended) and all the provisions of the law are germane to that general subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The Congress, in employing the word “define” in the title of the law, acted within its powers since Section 2, Article VIII of the Constitution itself empowers the legislative body to “<b>define, prescribe</b>, and <b>apportion</b> the jurisdiction of various courts”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>There being no unconstitutional infirmity in both the subject amendatory provision of Section 4 and the retroactive procedural application of the law as provided in Section 7 R.A.
