				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for review, petitioner Renato Cenido seeks to reverse and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 41011 which declared the private respondents as the owners of a house and lot in Binangonan, Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>On May 22, 1989, respondent spouses Amadeo Apacionado and Herminia Sta. Ana filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 70, Rizal a complaint against petitioner Renato Cenido for "Declaration of Ownership, Nullity, with Damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The spouses alleged that:&nbsp; (1) they are the owners of a parcel of unregistered land, 123 square meters in area and located at Rizal Street, Barrio Layunan, Binangonan, Rizal, more particularly described as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x that certain parcel of land located at Rizal, St., Layunan, Binangonan, Rizal, with an area of 123 square meters, more or less, bounded on the North by Gavino Aparato; on the East by Rizal St., on the South by Tranquilino Manuzon; and on the West by Simplicio Aparato, and the residential house standing thereon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>(2) this house and lot were purchased by the spouses from its previous owner, Bonifacio Aparato, now deceased, who lived under the spouses' care and protection for some twenty years prior to his death; (3) while he was alive, Bonifacio Aparato mortgaged the said property twice, one to the Rural Bank of Binangonan and the other to Linda C. Ynares, as security for loans obtained by him; (4) the loans were paid off by the spouses thereby securing the release and cancellation of said mortgages; (5) the spouses also paid and continue to pay the real estate taxes on the property; (6) from the time of sale, they have been in open, public, continuous and uninterrupted possession of the property in the concept of owners; (7) that on January 7, 1987, petitioner Renato Cenido, claiming to be the owner of the subject house and lot, filed a complaint for ejectment against them with the Municipal Trial Court, Branch 2, Binangonan, Rizal; (8) through fraudulent and unauthorized means, Cenido was able to cause the issuance in his name of Tax Declaration No. 02-0368 over the subject property, which fact the spouses learned only upon the filing of the ejectment case; (9) although the ejectment case was dismissed by the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Branch 2, the tax declaration in Cenido's name was not cancelled and still subsisted; (10) the spouses have referred the matter to the barangay for conciliation but Cenido unjustifiably refused to appear thereat.&nbsp; The spouses thus prayed that:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court that judgment issue in the case:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Declaring them (plaintiffs) the true and absolute owners of the house and lot now covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-0368;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Declaring Tax Declaration No. 02-0368 in the name of defendant Renato Cenido as null and void and directing the Provincial Assessor of Rizal and the Municipal Assessor of Binangonan, Rizal to register and to declare the house and lot covered by the same in their names (plaintiffs) for purposes of taxation;<br><br>3.&nbsp; Ordering defendant to pay them in the least amount of P50,000.00 as and for moral damages suffered;<br><br>4.&nbsp; Ordering defendant to pay them the amount of P10,000.00 as and for attorney's fees;<br><br>5.&nbsp; Ordering payment by defendant of exemplary damages in such amount which the Honorable Court may deem just and equitable in the premises;<br><br>6.&nbsp; Ordering defendant to pay the costs of suit; and<br><br>Plaintiffs pray for such other and further relief which the Honorable Court may deem just and equitable considering the foregoing premises."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner Cenido answered claiming that:&nbsp; (1) he is the illegitimate son of Bonifacio Aparato, the deceased owner of the subject property; (2) as Aparato's sole surviving heir, he became the owner of the property as evidenced by the cancellation of Tax Declaration No. 02-0274 in Bonifacio's name and the issuance of Tax Declaration No. 02-0368 in his name; (3) his ownership over the house and lot was also confirmed in 1985 by the Municipal Trial Court, Branch 1, Binangonan in Case No. 2264 which "adjudicated various claims involving the same subject property wherein plaintiffs were privy to the said case;" (4) that in said case, the Apacionado spouses participated in the execution of the compromise agreement partitioning the deceased's estate among his heirs, which agreement was adopted by the Municipal Trial Court as its judgment; (5) that the Apacionado spouses were allowed to stay in his father's house temporarily; (6) the mortgages on the property were obtained by his father upon request of the Apacionados who used the proceeds of the loans exclusively for themselves; (7) the real estate taxes on the property were paid for by his father, the principal, and the spouses were merely his agents; (8) the instrument attesting to the alleged sale of the house and lot by Bonifacio Aparato to the spouses is not a public document; (8) petitioner Cenido was never summoned to appear before the barangay for conciliation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondent spouses replied that:&nbsp; (1) Cenido is not the illegitimate son of Bonifacio, Cenido's claim of paternity being spurious; (2) the ownership of the property was not the proper subject in Civil Case No. 2264 before the MTC, Branch I, nor were the spouses parties in said case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The parties went to trial.&nbsp; Respondent spouses presented four (4) witnesses, namely, respondent Herminia Sta. Ana Apacionado; Rolando Nieves, the barangay captain; Norberto Aparato, the son of Gavino Aparato, Bonifacio's brother; and Carlos Inabayan, one of the two witnesses to the deed of sale between Bonifacio Aparato and the spouses over the property.&nbsp; Petitioner Cenido presented only himself as witness.<br><br>On March 30, 1993, the trial court rendered judgment.&nbsp; The court upheld petitioner Cenido's ownership over the property by virtue of the recognition made by Bonifacio's then surviving brother, Gavino, in the compromise judgment of the MTC. Concomitantly, the court also did not sustain the deed of sale between Bonifacio and the spouses because it was neither notarized nor signed by Bonifacio and was intrinsically defective. The court ordered thus:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court believes that preponderance of evidence is on the side of defendant and so the complaint could not be given due course. Accordingly, the case is, as it should be, dismissed.&nbsp; No attorney's fees or damages is being awarded as no evidence to this effect had been given by defendant.&nbsp; With costs against plaintiffs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondent spouses appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In a decision dated September 30, 1997, the appellate court found the appeal meritorious and reversed the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; It held that the recognition of Cenido's filiation by Gavino, Bonifacio's brother, did not comply with the requirements of the Civil Code and the Family Code; that the deed between Bonifacio and respondent spouses was a valid contract of sale over the property; and Cenido's failure to object to the presentation of the deed before the trial court was a waiver of the defense of the Statute of Frauds.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals disposed of as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Plaintiffs-Appellants Spouses Amadeo Apacionado and Herminia Sta. Ana are declared owners of the subject house and lot now covered by Tax Declaration No. 02-6368."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this recourse.&nbsp; Petitioner Cenido alleges that:<br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; The unsigned, unnotarized and highly doubtful private document designated as "Pagpapatunay" which is solely relied upon by the respondents in support of their case is not sufficient to vest ownership of and transfer the title, rights and interest over the subject property to the respondents.<br><br>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x.<br><br>2.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings in that it ruled against the petitioner in view of the alleged weakness of his defense rather than evaluate the case based on the strength of the respondents' evidence, thereby necessitating this Honorable Court's exercise of its power of supervision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Victoria Cenidosa, in representation of petitioner Cenido, has manifested, through counsel, that petitioner died in September 1993; that on December 18, 1985, eight years before his death, Cenido sold the subject house and lot to Maria D. Ojeda for the sum of P70,000.00; that Maria D. Ojeda is now old and sickly, and is thus being represented in the instant case by her daughter, Victoria O. Cenidosa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, respondent Herminia Sta. Ana Apacionado also manifested that her husband, Amadeo Apacionado, died on August 11, 1989. Amadeo is now being represented by his compulsory heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Before ruling on petitioner's arguments, it is necessary to establish certain facts essential for a proper adjudication of the case.<br><br>The records reveal that the late Bonifacio Aparato had two siblings-- a sister named Ursula and a brother named Gavino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Ursula died on March 1, 1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Bonifacio on January 3, 1982<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and Gavino, sometime after Bonifacio's death. Both Ursula and Bonifacio never married and died leaving no legitimate offspring.&nbsp; Gavino's son, Norberto, however, testified that there was a fourth sibling, a sister, who married but also died; as to when she died or whether she left any heirs, Norberto did not know.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> What is clear and undisputed is that Bonifacio was survived by Gavino who also left legitimate heirs.<br><br>Both Bonifacio and Ursula lived in the subject property under the care and protection of the Apacionados.&nbsp; Herminia Sta. Ana Apacionado started living with them in 1976. She took care of Bonifacio and Ursula, who died three years later. Herminia married Amado Apacionado, whose paternal grandmother was a sister of Bonifacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Amadeo moved into Bonifacio's house and assisted Herminia in taking care of the old man until his demise.<br><br>Shortly after Bonifacio's death, Civil Case No. 2264 was instituted by petitioner Cenido against Gavino Aparato before the Municipal Trial Court, Branch 1, Binangonan.&nbsp; The records do not reveal the nature of this action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Nevertheless, three years after filing of the case, the parties entered into a compromise agreement.&nbsp; The parties listed the properties of Bonifacio comprising two parcels of land: one parcel was the residential house and lot in question and the other was registered agricultural land with an area of 38,641 square meters; Gavino Aparato expressly recognized Renato Cenido as the sole illegitimate son of his brother, likewise, Cenido recognized Gavino as the brother of Bonifacio; as Bonifacio's heirs, they partitioned his estate among themselves, with the subject property and three portions of the agricultural land as Cenido's share, and the remaining 15,309 square meters of the agricultural land as Gavino's; both parties agreed to share in the documentation, registration and other expenses for the transfer of their shares. This compromise agreement was adopted as the decision of the MTC on January 31, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the same year, petitioner Cenido obtained in his name Tax Declaration No. 02-6368 over the subject property.&nbsp; Two years later, in January 1987, he filed an ejectment case against respondent spouses who continued occupying the property in question. This case was dismissed.<br><br>Respondent spouses' claim of ownership over the subject property is anchored on a one-page typewritten document entitled "Pagpapatunay," executed by Bonifacio Aparato.&nbsp; The "Pagpapatunay" reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>"PAGPAPATUNAY</center><br><br>DAPAT MALAMAN NG LAHAT:<br><br>Akong si BONIFACIO APARATO, binata, Pilipino, husto sa gulang, at kasalukuyang naninirahan sa Layunan, Binangonan, Rizal, ay nagpapatunay nitong mga sumusunod:<br><br>Una: -- Na, ako ang siyang nagmamay-ari ng isang lagay na lupang SOLAR at Bahay Tirahan na nakatirik sa nabanggit na solar na makikita sa lugar ng Rizal St., Layunan, Binangonan, Rizal;<br><br>Ikalawa:&nbsp; -- Na, sapagkat ang nagalaga sa akin hanggang sa ako'y tuluyang kunin ng Dakilang Maykapal ay walang iba kungdi ang mag-asawang AMADEO APACIONADO at HERMINIA STA.

Bonifacio affixed his thumbmark on the space above his name; and this was witnessed by Virgilio O. Cenido and Carlos Inabayan.<br><br>Petitioner Cenido disputes the authenticity and validity of the "Pagpapatunay." He claims that it is not a valid contract of sale and its genuineness is highly doubtful because:&nbsp; (1) it was not notarized and is merely a private instrument; (2) it was not signed by the vendor, Bonifacio; (3) it was improbable for Bonifacio to have executed the document and dictated the words "lumagda ako ng aking pangalan at apelyido" because he was paralyzed and could no longer sign his name at that time; and (4) the phrase "ang nag-alaga sa akin hanggang sa ako'y tuluyang kunin ng Dakilang Maykapal" speaks of an already departed Bonifacio and could have been made only by persons other than the dead man himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>To determine whether the "Pagpapatunay" is a valid contract of sale, it must contain the essential requisites of contracts, <i>viz</i>: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) cause of the obligation which is established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The object of the "Pagpapatunay" is the house and lot. The consideration is P10,000.00 for the services rendered to Aparato by respondent spouses.&nbsp; According to respondent Herminia Apacionado, this P10,000.00 was not actually paid to Bonifacio because the amount merely quantified the services they rendered to the old man.&nbsp; It was the care the spouses voluntarily gave that was the cause of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The cause therefore was the service remunerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleges that Bonifacio did not give his consent to the deed because he did not affix his signature, but merely his thumbmark, on the document.&nbsp; Bonifacio was a literate person who could legibly sign his full name, and his signature is evident in several documents such as his identification card as member of the Anderson Fil-American Guerillas;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the "Kasulatan ng Palasanglaan" dated July 25, 1974 where he and his two other siblings mortgaged the subject property for P2,000.00 to one Linda Y. Cenido;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> "Padagdag sa Sanglaan" dated June 16, 1976;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and another "Padagdag sa Sanglaan" dated March 2, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Respondent Herminia Sta. Ana Apacionado testified that Bonifacio Aparato affixed his thumbmark because he could no longer write at the time of execution of the document.&nbsp; The old man was already 61 years of age and could not properly see with his eyes. He was stricken by illness a month before and was paralyzed from the waist down.&nbsp; He could still speak, albeit in a garbled manner, and be understood. The contents of the "Pagpapatunay" were actually dictated by him to one Leticia Bandola who typed the same on a typewriter she brought to his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>That Bonifacio was alive at the time of execution of the contract and voluntarily gave his consent to the instrument is supported by the testimony of Carlos Inabayan, the lessee of Bonifacio's billiard hall at the ground floor of the subject property.&nbsp; Inabayan testified that on December 10, 1981, he was summoned to go up to Bonifacio's house.&nbsp; There, he saw Bonifacio, respondent Apacionados, and a woman and her husband.&nbsp; He was given a sheet of paper to read.&nbsp; He read the paper and understood that it was a deed of sale of the house and lot executed by Bonifacio in favor of the Apacionados. Thereafter, Bonifacio requested him to sign the document as witness.&nbsp; Reexamining the "Pagpapatunay," Inabayan saw that Bonifacio affixed his thumbmark on the space above his name.&nbsp; Inabayan thus signed the document and returned to the billiard hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Inabayan's testimony has not been rebutted by petitioner. Petitioner, through counsel, waived his right to do so, finding no need to cross-examine the witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This waiver was granted by the court in the order of September 23, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>One who alleges any defect or the lack of a valid consent to a contract must establish the same by full, clear and convincing evidence, not merely by preponderance thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Petitioner has not alleged that the old man, by his physical or mental state, was incapacitated to give his consent at the time of execution of the "Pagpapatunay." Petitioner has not shown that Bonifacio was insane or demented or a deaf-mute who did not know how to write.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Neither has petitioner claimed, at the very least, that the consent of Bonifacio to the contract was vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> If by assailing the intrinsic defects in the wordage of the "Pagpapatunay" petitioner Cenido seeks to specifically allege the exercise of extrinsic fraud and undue influence on the old man, these defects are not substantial as to render the entire contract void.&nbsp; There must be clear and convincing evidence of what specific acts of undue influence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or fraud<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> were employed by respondent spouses that gave rise to said defects.&nbsp; Absent such proof, Bonifacio's presumed consent to the "Pagpapatunay" remains.<br><br>The "Pagpapatunay," therefore, contains all the essential requisites of a contract.&nbsp; Its authenticity and due execution have not been disproved either.&nbsp; The finding of the trial court that the document was prepared by another person and the thumbmark of the dead Bonifacio was merely affixed to it is pure conjecture.&nbsp; On the contrary, the testimonies of respondent Herminia Sta. Ana and Carlos Inabayan prove that the document is authentic and was duly executed by Bonifacio himself.<br><br>The "Pagpapatunay" is undisputably a private document.&nbsp; And this fact does not detract from its validity. The Civil Code, in Article 1356 provides:<br><br><blockquote>"<i>Art</i>. <i>1356</i>.&nbsp; <b>Contracts shall be obligatory, in whatever form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present.&nbsp; However, when the law requires that a contract be in some form in order that it may be valid or enforceable, or that a contract be proved in a certain way, that requirement is absolute and indispensable</b>.&nbsp; In such cases, the right of the parties stated in the following article cannot be exercised."</blockquote><br>Generally, contracts are obligatory, in whatever form such contracts may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for their validity are present.&nbsp; When, however, the law requires that a contract be in some form for it to be valid or enforceable, that requirement must be complied with.<br><br>A certain form may be prescribed by law for any of the following purposes: for validity, enforceability, or greater efficacy of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> When the form required is for validity, its non-observance renders the contract void and of no effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> When the required form is for enforceability, non-compliance therewith will not permit, upon the objection of a party, the contract, although otherwise valid, to be proved or enforced by action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Formalities intended for greater efficacy or convenience or to bind third persons, if not done, would not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the contract between the contracting parties themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Article 1358 of the Civil Code requires that:<br><br><blockquote>"<i>Art. 1358</i>.&nbsp; <b>The following must appear in a public document:</b><br><br><b>(1) Acts and contracts which have for their object the creation, transmission, modification or extinguishment of real rights over immovable property; sales of real property or of an interest therein are governed by Articles 1403, No. 2 and 1405;</b><br><br>(2) The cession, repudiation or renunciation of hereditary rights or of those of the conjugal partnership of gains;<br><br>(3) The power to administer property, or any other power which has for its object an act appearing or which should appear in a public document, or should prejudice a third person;<br><br>(4) The cession of actions or rights proceeding from an act appearing in a public document.<br><br>All other contracts where the amount involved exceeds five hundred pesos must appear in writing, even a private one.&nbsp; But sales of goods, chattels or things in action are governed by Articles 1403, No. 2 and 1405."</blockquote><br>Acts and contracts which create, transmit, modify or extinguish real rights over immovable property should be embodied in a public document.&nbsp; Sales of real property are governed by the Statute of Frauds which reads:<br><br><blockquote>"<i>Art. 1403</i>.&nbsp; The following contracts are unenforceable, unless they are ratified:<br><br>(1) x x x<br><br>(2) Those that do not comply with the Statute of Frauds as set forth in this number.&nbsp; <b>In the following cases an agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing, and subscribed and by the party charged, or by his agent</b>; evidence, therefore, of the agreement cannot be received without the writing, or a secondary evidence of its contents:<br><br>(a) An agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making thereof;<br><br>x x x<br><br>(e) An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, <b>or for the sale of real property or of an interest therein;</b><br><br>(3) x x x."</blockquote><br>The sale of real property should be in writing and subscribed by the party charged for it to be enforceable.&nbsp; The "Pagpapatunay" is in writing and subscribed by Bonifacio Aparato, the vendor; hence, it is enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.&nbsp; Not having been subscribed and sworn to before a notary public, however, the "Pagpapatunay" is not a public document, and therefore does not comply with Article 1358, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code.<br><br>The requirement of a public document in Article 1358 is not for the validity of the instrument but for its efficacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Although a conveyance of land is not made in a public document, it does not affect the validity of such conveyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Article 1358 does not require the accomplishment of the acts or contracts in a public instrument in order to validate the act or contract but only to insure its efficacy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> so that after the existence of said contract has been admitted, the party bound may be compelled to execute the proper document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This is clear from Article 1357, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"<i>Art. 1357</i>.&nbsp; <b>If the law requires a document or other special form, as in the acts and contracts enumerated in the following article [Article 1358], the contracting parties may compel each other to observe that form, once the contract has been perfected.&nbsp; This right may be exercised simultaneously with the action upon the contract.</b>"</blockquote><br>The private conveyance of the house and lot is therefore valid between Bonifacio Aparato and respondent spouses.&nbsp; The question of whether the "Pagpapatunay" is sufficient to <b>transfer and convey</b> title to the land for purposes of original registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> or the issuance of a real estate tax declaration in respondent spouses' names, as prayed for by respondent spouses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is another matter altogether.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> For greater efficacy of the contract, convenience of the parties and to bind third persons, respondent spouses have the right to compel the vendor or his heirs to execute the necessary document to properly convey the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Anent petitioner's second assigned error, the fact that the Court of Appeals sustained the validity of the "Pagpapatunay" was not a conclusion that necessarily resulted from the weakness of petitioner's claim of filiation to Bonifacio Aparato.&nbsp; Of and by itself, the "Pagpapatunay" is a valid contract of sale between the parties and the Court of Appeals did not err in upholding its validity.<br><br>The issue of petitioner's paternity, however, is essential to determine whether Tax Declaration No. 02-6368 in the name of petitioner Cenido should be nullified, as prayed for by respondent spouses in their complaint.<br><br>Tax Declaration No. 02-6368<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> in petitioner Cenido's name was issued pursuant to the compromise judgment of the MTC where Gavino Aparato, Bonifacio's brother, expressly recognized petitioner Cenido as Bonifacio's sole illegitimate son.&nbsp; The compromise judgment was rendered in 1985, three years after Bonifacio's demise.<br><br>Under the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> natural children and illegitimate children other than natural are entitled to support and successional rights only when recognized or acknowledged by the putative parent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Unless recognized, they have no rights whatsoever against their alleged parent or his estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The filiation of illegitimate children may be proved by any of the forms of recognition of natural children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This recognition may be made in three ways:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (1) voluntarily, which must be express such as that in a record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record, or in any authentic writing;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (2) legally, <i>i.e.,</i> when a natural child is recognized, such recognition extends to his or her brothers and sisters of the full blood;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and (3) judicially or compulsorily, which may be demanded by the illegitimate child of his parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The action for compulsory recognition of the illegitimate child must be brought during the lifetime of the presumed parents.&nbsp; This is explicitly provided in Article 285 of the Civil Code, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"<i>Art. 285</i>.&nbsp; The action for the recognition of natural children may be brought only during the lifetime of the presumed parents, except in the following cases:<br><br>(1) If the father or mother died during the minority of the child, in which case the latter may file the action before the expiration of four years from the attainment of his majority;<br><br>(2) If after the death of the father or of the mother a document should appear of which nothing had been heard and in which either or both parents recognize the child.</blockquote><br>In this case, the action must be commenced within four years from the finding of the document."<br><br>The illegitimate child can file an action for compulsory recognition only during the lifetime of the presumed parent.&nbsp; After the parent's death, the child cannot bring such action, except, however, in only two instances: one is when the supposed parent died during the minority of the child, and the other is when after the death of the parent, a document should be discovered in which the parent recognized the child as his.&nbsp; The action must be brought within four years from the attainment of majority in the first case, and from the discovery of the document in the second case.&nbsp; The requirement that the action be filed during the parent's lifetime is to prevent illegitimate children, on account of strong temptations to large estates left by dead persons, to claim part of this estate without giving the alleged parent personal opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> It is vital that the parent be heard for only the parent is in a position to reveal the true facts surrounding the claimant's conception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner Cenido did not present any record of birth, will or any authentic writing to show he was voluntarily recognized by Bonifacio as his illegitimate son.&nbsp; In fact, petitioner admitted on the witness stand that he had no document to prove Bonifacio's recognition, much less his filiation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The voluntary recognition of petitioner's filiation by Bonifacio's brother before the MTC does not qualify as a "statement in a court of record." Under the law, this statement must be made personally by the parent himself or herself, not by any brother, sister or relative; after all, the concept of recognition speaks of a voluntary declaration by the <b>parent</b>, or if the parent refuses, by judicial authority, to establish the paternity or maternity of children born outside wedlock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The compromise judgment of the MTC does not qualify as a compulsory recognition of petitioner.&nbsp; In the first place, when he filed this case against Gavino Aparato, petitioner was no longer a minor.&nbsp; He was already pushing fifty years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Secondly, there is no allegation that after Bonifacio's death, a document was discovered where Bonifacio recognized petitioner Cenido as his son.&nbsp; Thirdly, there is nothing in the compromise judgment that indicates that the action before the MTC was a settlement of Bonifacio's estate with a gross value not exceeding P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Definitely, the action could not have been for compulsory recognition because the MTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The Real Property Tax Code provides that real property tax be assessed in the name of the person "owning or administering" the property on which the tax is levied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Since petitioner Cenido has not proven any successional or administrative rights to Bonifacio's estate, Tax Declaration No. 02-6368 in Cenido's name must be declared null and void.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the petition is denied and the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
