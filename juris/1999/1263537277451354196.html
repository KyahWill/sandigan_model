				<H3>RE:  REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL AUDIT AND PHYSICAL INVENTORY OF PENDING CASES IN THE MTCC, BRANCH 1 AND THE RTC, BRANCH  57, BOTH IN LUCENA CITY
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DE LEON, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the basis of a physical inventory and audit conducted in May 1996 of the cases pending in Branch 57 of the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City, its Presiding Judge, Hon. Federico A. Tañada, was ordered, per our Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>dated August 13, 1996, to decide the twenty-one (21) criminal cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and six (6) civil cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which remained pending and unresolved beyond the 90-day reglementary period. Judge Tañada was also directed to submit his docket inventories for the periods from January to June 1994, July to December 1994, January to June 1995, and July to December 1995. His Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Luis N. Pedron, was likewise directed to submit the Monthly Report of Cases from January 1995 onwards.<br><br>On February 17, 1997, Judge Tañada, through Atty. Pedron, sent to this Court certified copies of decisions in thirteen (13) criminal cases. However, Judge Tañada neither justified his delay in the resolution of those cases nor explained his continued failure to decide the eight (8) other criminal cases and six (6) civil cases reported in the May 1996 audit. Thus, in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of June 17, 1997, we required him to show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure. As Atty. Pedron also continued to fail to submit the Monthly Report of Cases from January 1995 onwards, he, too, was ordered to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court.<br><br>On June 10, 1998, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) reported that both Judge Tañada and Atty. Pedron remained defiant. We examined the records of the case and agreed with the OCA. Thus, in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of July 28, 1998, the Court held both Judge Tañada and Atty. Pedron in contempt of court. They were fined P20,000.00 and P10,000.00, respectively, and the Court also froze the salaries of Judge Tañada pending compliance with its Resolutions of August 13, 1996 and June 17, 1997.<br><br>Meantime, Atty. Pedron compulsorily retired on June 21, 1998.<br><br>On December 4, 1998, the Court Management Office (CMO) received the Monthly Report of Cases for January 1995 to August 1998 prepared and signed by Atty. Pedron and certified correct by Judge Tañada. However, the reports lacked the required dates when the cases listed therein were submitted for decision.<br><br>On February 16, 1999, the Court, adopting the conclusion of the OCA that continued disobedience to the orders of the Court constitutes gross insubordination, suspended Judge Tañada and ordered a second audit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The team dispatched by the OCA to Lucena City conducted the second audit on July 28 and 29, 1999. While the results thereof included the finding that Judge Tañada had already decided nineteen (19) of the original twenty-one (21) criminal cases and four (4) of the original six (6) civil cases, the team discovered that there were additional twenty (20) criminal cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and eleven (11) civil cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that remained undecided beyond the 90-day reglementary period. Consequently, the OCA recommended that Judge Tañada be penalized with another fine of P20,000.00.<br><br>Judge Tañada applied for disability retirement, effective June 15, 1999, because he was suffering from organic brain syndrome, hypertension with cerebral infraction and central retinal vein occlusion of the left eye. Taking this into consideration, the OCA recommended that his suspension be lifted and his salaries from August 13, 1996 to June 14, 1999 be released. However, the OCA also recommended that the amount of P40,000.00 be deducted from his disability retirement benefits to answer for the P20,000.00 fine earlier imposed on him in the Resolution dated July 28, 1998 and for the additional fine of same amount for his failure to decide the thirty-one (31) other cases reported in the second audit.<br><br>The team also found out that Atty. Pedron failed, before his compulsory retirement, to submit his reports on the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> reception of evidence in Civil Case Nos. 94-45 and 95-13 to Hon. Ismael B. Sanchez, Pairing Judge of Branch 57 of the Regional Trial Court of Lucena City. Thus, the OCA recommended a second fine of P5,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.<br><br>In its Memorandum dated August 19, 1999, the OCA likewise recommended that:<br><blockquote>“2. Mr. Manuel P. Marasigan, Officer-in-Charge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, Lucena City, be <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTED</span> to: (2-a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">INFORM</span> this Court through the Office of the Court Administrator, within five (5) days from notice, whether or not the decision in Criminal Case No. 91-143 was adopted and/or promulgated by Pairing Judge Ismael B.
