				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> f the Regional Trial Court (Branch 38) of Boac, Marinduque convicting accused-appellant LOLITO MORENO of rape committed against his 14-year-old cousin TIFFANY MORENO, and sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and to pay the private complainant the sum of P30,000.00 as moral damages and P525.00 as actual litigation expenses.<br><br>The complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or rape was filed before the Municipal Trial Court of Mogpog, Marinduque, on November 11, 1991 by Froilan M. Moreno, father of the private complainant. After conducting the preliminary examination and finding insufficient evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> o warrant the filing of a case for rape in court, municipal trial judge Eduardo Mirafuente recommended to the Provincial Prosecutor the dismissal of the complaint for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Upon a review of the aforestated resolution of the Municipal Trial Court, the provincial prosecutor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> esolved to set the case for re-investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After due proceedings in the Provincial Prosecution Office which found probable cause against accused-appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> an information[8] was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Boac, Marinduque, Branch 38, charging him with the crime of rape committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 7th day of July 1991, at around 12:00 o’clock noontime, in barangay Sayao, municipality of Mogpog, province of Marinduque, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused entered the secluded house of complainant, and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie on top of his 14-year old cousin, complainant Tiffany Moreno y Pakaigui, who was alone and then and there forcibly succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her against her will and consent, and to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>During arraignment, accused-appellant expressed his willingness to enter a plea of guilty to the lesser offense of simple seduction. However, the private complainant’s father and another relative refused to lower the charge from rape to simple seduction, hence accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, trial ensued. The prosecution presented as its witnesses, private complainant Tiffany Moreno and her father Froilan Moreno, and on rebuttal, Gervacio Recamara, barangay captain of Sayao, Mogpog, Marinduque. The parties stipulated on the genuineness and due execution of the medical certificate (Exh. C) issued by Dr. Reynaldo Montegrejo, rural health physician of Mogpog, Marinduque; the sworn statement of private complainant made before the provincial prosecutor (Exh.

The pregnancy test revealed that private complainant was about five (5) months pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Froilan Moreno, father of private complainant, testified that on July 7, 1991, at noontime, he was working in the farm while his wife, the mother of private complainant was selling foodstuff in school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He went back to their house around 12:00 noon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> just as private complainant finished frying fish.

Upon learning this he went to the barangay captain of Sayao, Mogpog, Marinduque where he had a confrontation with accused-appellant and the latter’s wife, Delia Moreno.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> He asked accused-appellant "why he did it to his [my] daughter" however accused-appellant did not answer but instead he got angry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The following day he went back to the barangay captain and asked for permission to file the case in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Froilan Moreno testified that he and his wife talked about the enlargement of private complainant’s belly only in October, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Prior to their confrontation before the barangay captain, he first summoned accused-appellant but it was the latter’s wife, Delia Moreno who went to his house.

Thereafter, Froilan Moreno left. The barangay captain further testified that after Froilan Moreno left, he told accused-appellant that "it might be true what is being complained about him," then accused-appellant admitted that he really raped (hinalay) the private complainant but only once.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense put up denial and alibi. Accused-appellant, a 38-year-old farmer, on direct examination, originally claimed that on July 7, 1991, around 12:00 noon, he was in his house located near the river of Sayao and about half a kilometer away from the house of private complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Still on direct examination, he later claimed that on July 7, 1991, from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., he was in Sta. Cruz, Marinduque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> When asked by the trial court to clarify his previous statements, accused-appellant admitted that on July 7, 1991, around 12:00 noon, he was in his house together with his wife doing nothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> He further testified that on August 7, he learned for the first time that private complainant was accusing him of rape because his wife, who was earlier fetched by Froilan Moreno’s wife,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> told him that he was being accused of having raped private complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> He did not react to that statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> He denied having had any confrontation with private complainant’s family before the barangay captain but admitted having received summons from the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant’s wife, Delia Moreno, on the other hand, testified that on July 7, 1991, around 12:00 noon, she was with accused-appellant and Liza Leynes in Sta. Cruz, Marinduque for the purpose of renting a wedding gown for Liza Leynes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> They allegedly left their residence at 7:00 a.m. to fetch Liza Leynes in Tarug, Mogpog and stayed in Sta. Cruz, Marinduque from 11:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> They arrived back in Sayao at 7:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> She further claimed that private complainant and her family filed a case against accused-appellant because private complainant learned that she was pregnant and her boyfriend had left for Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> They allegedly pointed to her husband as the culprit because he was the one who was in Marinduque<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and she suspected that private complainant had a liking (crush) on accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented Liza Leynes-Palomares, a goddaughter of Delia Moreno, to corroborate the testimony of the latter that on July 7, 1991, around 12:00 noon, they were in Sta.

Tiffany Moreno was very certain that it was herein accused who sexually abused her on July 7, 1991 while alone at their residence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The trial court found private complainant’s testimony to be "credible" and "straight-forward."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> All told, the trial court found "...the private complainant’s version to be credible enough to be relied upon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant is now before this Court seeking the reversal of his conviction on account of the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN GIVING EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT TO THE INCREDIBLE, IMPLAUSIBLE, INCONSISTENT IF NOT CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINANT RELATIVE TO THE ASSAILED INCIDENT.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT COMPLAINANT WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY APPELLANT CONSIDERING THAT SHE DID NOT OFFER ANY TENACIOUS RESISTANCE.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT GIVING EXCULPATORY WEIGHT TO THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF RAPE AS THE CRIME COMMITTED WAS ONLY SEDUCTION.</blockquote>In his Appellant’s Brief, accused-appellant argues that "...the evidence adduced by the prosecution, consisting mainly on (sic) the incredible, unworthy and inconsistent, nay contradictory testimony of complainant, failed to pass the exacting test of moral certainty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Accused-appellant contends that "[w]ithout doubt, complainant perverted the truth when she insisted it was the alleged rape on July 7, 1991 that caused her pregnancy,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> relying mainly on the medical certificate which indicated that private complainant was already five (5) months pregnant when she was examined in October 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Accused-appellant also faults private complainant’s lack of "tenacious resistance" while she was allegedly being raped by the accused-appellant, citing the absence of body injuries like bruises and contusions, hard struggle, outcry, scratches or kicks; and questions her actuation after the alleged rape, that of resuming to fry fish, as "highly unusual and uncommon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Accused-appellant justifies his inconsistent statements regarding his whereabouts on July 7, 1991, around 12:00 noon, by claiming that he suffered a nervous breakdown and argues that his alibi "...was amply corroborated on material points."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Lastly, accused-appellant asserts that he should be held liable only for seduction considering that private complainant allegedly had a "crush" on him and that "they are related to each other, their fathers being brothers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) maintains that "[u]nless there is a showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact of (sic) circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the case, the appellate court will not disturb the factual findings of the lower court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> According to the OSG, the inaccuracies in the testimony of private complainant are minor and trivial, hence, do not adversely affect her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The OSG insists that "the inaccuracies pertain to minor details that do not go into the essence of the crime of rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The OSG further argues that while the force, violence or intimidation used by accused-appellant against private complainant did not leave physical marks on the latter, it affected her will and marred her psyche.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> "The threat of being hacked to death with a bolo was sufficient to instill fear on complainant causing her to submit her will to appellant’s bestial desire."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Finally, the OSG submits that "the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the witness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>While the version of the defense is not entirely satisfactory, as in any criminal prosecution, conviction must rest on proof beyond reasonable doubt. The State must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the evidence of the defense. The Court is constrained to reverse the conviction of the accused-appellant Lolito Moreno y Lancion on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>In rape cases, the following guidelines and principles are well-entrenched: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to meet the standard necessary to secure conviction. Well-settled is the rule that in the crime of rape alleged to have been committed by force, it is imperative for the prosecution to establish that the element of voluntariness on the part of the victim be absolutely lacking. Otherwise stated, the prosecution must prove that force or intimidation was actually employed by the accused-appellant upon his victim to achieve his end. Failure to do so is fatal to its cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Private complainant’s actuation before, during and after the alleged rape fails to convince us that the sexual intercourse was truly against her will. First, when accused-appellant allegedly held her and pointed a bolo against her body without any verbal threat from the accused-appellant to hold her silence, she did not even try to make an outcry or otherwise vigorously resist the accused-appellant, even while she was being carried to the makeshift bed (papag). When she was held by the accused-appellant, all she did was to twist her body from right to left. While the accused was on top of her, she likewise merely twisted her body from right to left.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="17%"><div align="LEFT">"ATTY.

The Court cannot bring itself to believe that there was force or intimidation of such character as to render private complainant helpless to resist the assault against her virtue.<br><br>Assuming that accused-appellant did point a bolo against her while he held and carried her to the makeshift bed, when private complainant’s shorts was being removed, he no longer pointed the bolo against her but the bolo was lying on the papag. She could have grabbed that bolo and defended herself. When private complainant was lying on the makeshift bed without her shorts and accused-appellant was undressing himself, he no longer pointed the bolo against her but had earlier replaced it in its scabbard tied to his waist. At these precise moments, private complainant was no longer in extreme danger of her life. She could have tried to escape then. Even as accused-appellant was allegedly sexually attacking her, accused-appellant guided his penis into her vagina using his right hand, and his left hand to hold private complainant’s right upper arm. It is clear therefore that private complainant’s left arm was free from restraint and she could have vigorously resisted the alleged sexual assault by grabbing the bolo which allegedly was in its scabbard tied to the waist of accused-appellant and by defending herself against her purported assailant. Therefore, her actuations before and during the alleged sexual assault did not show the kind of resistance expected of a young woman defending her virtue and honor. A much more vigorous opposition to the assault on her virtue is only to be expected of an inexperienced victim on the threshold of womanhood.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="15%"><div align="LEFT">"COURT:</div></th><td width="85%"><div align="LEFT"> (to witness)</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">xxxxxx</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"Q:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">When you said he was already on top, inserted his organ to your organ, which hand did he use in guiding his organ?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">The right hand, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">And which hand was holding you then when he was guiding his organ to you?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">The left hand, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">And which arm of yours was being held by him?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> My right upper arm, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> So his left arm was holding your right arm?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">The bolo was no longer in the hand of the accused?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, sir....

As we have previously held, "[t]he conduct of the victim immediately following the alleged sexual assault is of utmost importance as tending to establish the truth or falsity of the charge of rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> In the case at bar, after the alleged rape, private complainant merely finished her cooking.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="16%"><div align="LEFT">"FISCAL OPIS</div></th><td width="84%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">xxxxxx</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"Q:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">After the accused your house ... after he had gone over your top and after he inserted his private part to your private part, what did you do?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A: </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">I finished my cooking, sir." (TSN, June 7, 1993, p.10.)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Froilan Moreno's testimony that he saw private complainant crying for about 10 minutes when he arrived at their house appears unconvincing considering his own testimony that he did not inquire from her why she was crying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> It is hardly believable and indeed unnatural for a father who sees his daughter crying for about 10 minutes not to ask her what was troubling her.<br><br>The foregoing considered, we find the conduct of the private complainant to be inconsistent with human experience and behavior. What she did before, during, and after she was allegedly raped was not in accord with normal human conduct and experience.<br><br>Coming now to the credibility of the testimony of private complainant, we are guided by the ruling that "[b]y the very nature of the crime of rape, conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony because of the fact that usually only the participants can testify as to its occurrence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The trial court found private complainant’s testimony to be "coherent," "straight-forward," and "credible enough to be relied upon." We disagree.<br><br>Inconsistencies in the testimony of private complainant on material and substantial matters detract from the credibility of her testimony. First, her testimony on the exact location of the bolo allegedly used by accused-appellant in satisfying his bestial desire, while the latter was on top of private complainant, was not coherent and straight-forward.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> When asked by the trial court, private complainant claimed that while accused-appellant was on top of her, the bolo was on the makeshift bed but when the trial court clarified later on, she testified that the bolo was in the scabbard on accused-appellant’s waist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Second, when asked by the trial court, private complainant testified that she did not have sexual intercourse with accused-appellant prior to July 7, 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> but she claimed that it was accused-appellant who impregnated her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> When she was asked for the second time by the trial court if there was any occasion prior to July 7, 1991 that accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with her, she admitted that there was such an occasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> The foregoing inconsistencies and contradictions in private complainant’s testimony cannot be considered as minor and trivial as they impugn the credibility of her testimony. We find that the trial court erred in relying on the testimony of private complainant in convicting the accused-appellant. We reiterate that "[t]rial courts must keep in mind that the prosecution must be able to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt to justify the conviction of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> As we have ruled:<br><blockquote>"Rape is a very emotional word, and the natural human reactions to it are categorical: admiration and sympathy for the courageous female publicly seeking retribution for her outrageous violation, and condemnation of the rapist. However, being interpreters of the law and dispensers of justice, judges must look at a rape charge without those proclivities, and deal with it with extreme caution and circumspection. Judges must free themselves of the natural tendency to be overprotective of every woman decrying her having been sexually abused, and demanding punishment for the abuser. While they ought to be cognizant of the anguish and humiliation the rape victim goes through as she demands justice, judges should equally bear in mind that their responsibility is to render justice based on the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup></blockquote>Even as the prosecution failed to prove the use of force, violence and intimidation by the accused-appellant, we cannot convict the accused-appellant of the crime of simple seduction without offense to the constitutional rights of the accused-appellant to due process and to be informed of the accusation against him. The charge of rape does not include simple seduction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> for failure of the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused-appellant of the crime of rape as charged beyond reasonable doubt, the decision of the trial court in Criminal Case No. 1-93 is <b>REVERSED</b> and accused-appellant Lolito Moreno y Lancion is <b>ACQUITTED</b> and ordered immediately released unless there are other legal grounds for his continued detention.<br><br>The Director of Prisons is <b>DIRECTED</b> to implement this Decision and to report to this Court immediately the action taken hereon within five (5) days from receipt hereof.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Bellosillo, (Chairman), Mendoza, Quisumbing, and De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Original Record (OR), Criminal Case No. 1-93, pp. 114-129; Rollo, pp. 12-27 per Executive Judge Romulo A.
