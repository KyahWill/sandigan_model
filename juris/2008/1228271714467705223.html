Lock issued three memoranda, all dated May 30, 2005: (1) to Judge Doyon directing him to take appropriate action on the cases where no action was taken for a considerable length of time; resolve with dispatch pending incidents and cases that were already beyond the period to resolve; decide within the reglementary period the cases already submitted for decision; and submit copies of the resolutions/decisions to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup>(2) to Atty.

Compendio Jr., Clerk of Court VI, directing him to apprise Judge Doyon regarding cases submitted for resolution/decision and those requiring immediate action; order and supervise the updating of docket books; attach certificates of arraignment duly signed by the accused and his counsel; explain why the bundy clock was not installed and why he and the staff did not comply with OCA Circular No. 7-2003 on the mandatory use of bundy clocks in all courts; inform the Court whether the amount of P48,000.37 was immediately deposited, furnish the OCA documents showing the same, and explain why no disciplinary sanction should be imposed on him for failure to strictly comply with A.C. No. 3-2000;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup>(3) to Noel B. Albiva and Jeanette T.

Compendio submitted his compliance dated August 22, 2005 stating that as soon as he received the May 30, 2005 Memorandum, he apprised Judge Doyon of the cases submitted for resolution/decision and is continuously doing so; he ordered and personally supervised the updating of their docket books; the bundy clock was not installed right away because&nbsp; nobody in their office was capable of installing it, and until the arrival of the bundy cards, they kept it in a safe place to avoid damage; eventually they were able to set it up and have used the same since June 1, 2005; they have already deposited the amount of P48,000.37 and will send the supporting documents within one week; the failure to immediately deposit said amount was due to the heavy work load of Sayas; however, necessary measures were already undertaken in order to comply with A.C. No. 3-2000; they did not require the accused and their counsels to sign the certificates of arraignment because such was not required by the Rules of Court; he requests clarification on the matter and promises to comply with further directives of the OCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Judge Doyon retired from the service on January 11, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a Memorandum to Atty.

Heirs of Ramo</i>" and Civil Case No. 2000-01, "<i>Morada</i><i> v. Cosina</i>" and merely provided a copy of the transmittal letters to the Court of Appeals (CA) without providing information whether these cases were decided within the required period; and that although he stated that he ordered the updating of the docket books of Albiva and Sayas, the compliance of the two still remained wanting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The OCA likewise found that Albiva and Sayas failed to submit their compliance even though memoranda dated May 30, 2005, January 2, 2007 and October 30, 2007 contained warnings on the possible imposition of administrative sanctions on the continued non-compliance with the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Court noted the said Memorandum and redocketed the instant case as a regular administrative matter in the Resolution dated March 19, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In the Resolution dated August 6, 2008, the Court directed Judge Doyon, Atty.

Case No. 2004-116.&nbsp; They prayed that this letter and its attachments be considered as substantial compliance with the Court's memoranda and that the administrative case against them be dropped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Albiva and Sayas also submitted a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> on the August 29, 2008 Resolution of the Court, stating that they immediately endeavored to comply in good faith with the same by updating and preparing the court's semi-annual docket inventory reports covering the required period; however, they finished the reports within 6 months, instead of the 2-month period given by the Court; they attached the official receipt from the LBC dated January 14, 2006, the date the docket inventory reports were sent to the OCA; as to the Memorandum dated January 2, 2007, they sent a letter-compliance dated January 19, 2007 to the DCA manifesting in good faith their long-time compliance with the May 30, 2005 Memorandum; anent the Memorandum dated October 30, 2007, they presumed that compliance with the same was already retroactively carried over in their letter dated January 2, 2007; in Judge Xenos's letter to the DCA dated February 4, 2008, they again attached their January 19, 2007 letter attesting compliance; after receiving the March 19, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Resolution of the Court, Siwa started to experience pregnancy bleedings and eventually had a miscarriage on June 6, 2008, a day after they finished gathering documents to be attached to their letter; in May 2008, they approached their new Legal Researcher who explained to them that what was required of them by the Court was the updating of entries in their respective docket books; it was only then that they realized that they misunderstood the memoranda and that what they repeatedly sent as compliance to the OCA, <i>i.e</i>., the semi-annual docket inventory reports, were not the ones required of them; they humbly submit that at the time they received the memorandum dated May 30, 2005, they had already updated their docket books in compliance with the judicial audit in April 2005; what remained was the submission to the OCA of docket inventory reports covering the period of July 2003 to June 2005; realizing their mistake, they immediately requested their Clerk of Court for a certification attesting to the fact that their docket books are updated up to the present time.&nbsp; They pray for mercy in the consideration of their case since they are breadwinners of their respective families.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the OCA's findings except as to the recommended penalty for Judge Doyon.<br><br>As correctly found by the OCA, Judge Doyon is guilty of undue delay in rendering decisions and resolutions.&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br><br>The Constitution requires trial judges to dispose of all cases or matters within three months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]&nbsp; </sup>The New Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> also provides in Canon 6, Section 5 thereof that judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness.<br><br>The reason for this rule is that justice delayed is justice denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]&nbsp; </sup>Undue delay in the disposition of cases results in a denial of justice which, in turn, brings the courts into disrepute and ultimately erodes the faith and confidence of the public in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the failure of judges to render judgments within the required period constitutes gross inefficiency and warrants the imposition of administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In this case, Judge Doyon failed to resolve and decide within the reglementary period nine motions and six cases submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; While the OCA found that he failed to decide SP. 43-04, a copy of an Order which was belatedly filed shows that the case was resolved on April 21, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Judge Doyon's explanation that the undue delay was caused by the failure of Atty.

Compendio to properly apprise him of the status of their court's cases.&nbsp; The judicial audit team also found that the court's dockets were not updated; the bundy clock was not immediately installed and used; there were sums of money that were not immediately deposited in violation of A. C. No. 3-2000; the certificates of arraignment were not signed by the accused or by their counsel contrary to the form provided for in the 2002 Manual for Clerks of Court; and, Clerks Sayas and Albiva failed to immediately comply with the OCA's memoranda despite clear instructions to Atty. Compendio to ensure such compliance.<br><br>Simple neglect of duty, under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19, s. 1999, Rule IV, Section 52, B (1) carries the penalty of suspension of one month and one day to six months for the first offense and dismissal for the second offense.&nbsp; The fact that Judge Doyon has resigned from office does not warrant the dismissal of the administrative case against him while he was still in the service and does not preclude the finding of any administrative liability to which he shall still be answerable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; That this is his first offense, however, since he started service in the judiciary on July 2, 1998, should be considered in his favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Under the circumstances, a fine in the amount of P5,000.00, as recommended by the OCA, is reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>As to Clerks-in-Charge Sayas and Albiva, the Court finds unbelievable their claim that they merely misunderstood the OCA's memoranda; thus, their failure to immediately comply with the same.&nbsp; Memorandum dated May 30, 2005 is short, simple and could easily be understood by any ordinary court employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; And if it were true that they misunderstood the same, their receipt of the January 2, 2007 Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> as well as the third memorandum dated October 30, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> which called their attention to their failure to comply with the first memorandum, should have prompted them to seek help in understanding the directives.&nbsp; They did not make any effort in clarifying the matter, however, and it was only in May 2008 that they approached their new Legal Researcher who explained to them that what was required of them by the Court was the updating of entries in their respective docket books and the submission of proof of compliance therewith; and that what they repeatedly sent to the OCA, <i>i.e</i>., the semi-annual docket inventory reports, were not the ones required of them.<br><br>In view of these circumstances, the Court finds them guilty of simple neglect of duty, which is defined as the failure to give attention to a task, or the disregard of a duty due to carelessness or indifference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; It carries the penalty of suspension of one month and one day to six months for the first offense and dismissal for the second.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Because of the fact that this is their first administrative infraction since they entered the judiciary in March 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> which serve to mitigate their penalty, the recommended penalty of P5,000.00 fine to be imposed on each of them is proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds <b>Judge Orlando F.
