SP&nbsp; No. 70480. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (petitioner) questioning the 15 April 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in CTA Case No. 6054 ordering petitioner to issue, in favor of Central Luzon Drug Corporation (respondent), a tax credit certificate in the amount of P2,376,805.63, arising from the alleged erroneous interpretation of the term "tax credit" used in Section 4(a) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7432.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</b><br></div><br>Respondent is a domestic corporation engaged in the retail of medicines and other pharmaceutical products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In 1997, it operated eight drugstores under the business name and style "Mercury Drug."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to the provisions of RA 7432 and Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 2-94<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), respondent granted 20% sales discount to qualified senior citizens on their purchases of medicines covering the calendar year 1997. The sales discount granted to senior citizens totaled P2,798,508.00.<br><br>On 15 April 1998, respondent filed its 1997 Corporate Annual Income Tax Return reflecting a nil income tax liability due to net loss incurred from business operations of P2,405,140.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Respondent filed its 1997 Income Tax Return under protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 19 March 1999, respondent filed with the petitioner a claim for refund or credit of overpaid income tax for the taxable year 1997 in the amount of P2,660,829.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Respondent alleged that the overpaid tax was the result of the wrongful implementation of RA 7432. Respondent treated the 20% sales discount as a deduction from gross sales in compliance with RR 2-94 instead of treating it as a tax credit as provided under Section 4(a) of RA 7432.<br><br>On 6 April 2000, respondent filed a Petition for Review with the CTA in order to toll the running of the two-year statutory period within which to file a judicial claim. Respondent reasoned that RR 2-94, which is a mere implementing administrative regulation, cannot modify, alter or amend the clear mandate of RA 7432. Consequently, Section 2(i) of RR 2-94 is without force and effect for being inconsistent with the law it seeks to implement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In his Answer, petitioner stated that the construction given to a statute by a specialized administrative agency like the BIR is entitled to great respect and should be accorded great weight. When RA 7432 allowed senior citizens' discounts to be claimed as tax credit, it was silent as to the mechanics of availing the same. For clarification, the BIR issued RR 2-94 and defined the term "tax credit" as a deduction from the establishment's gross income and not from its tax liability in order to avoid an absurdity that is not intended by the law. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals</b><br></div><br>On 15 April 2002, the CTA rendered a Decision ordering petitioner to issue a tax credit certificate in the amount of P2,376,805.63 in favor of respondent.<br><br>The CTA stated that in a number of analogous cases, it has consistently ruled that the 20% senior citizens' discount should be treated as tax credit instead of a mere deduction from gross income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In quoting its previous decisions, the CTA ruled that RR 2-94 engraved a new meaning to the phrase "tax credit" as deductible from gross income which is a deviation from the plain intendment of the law. An administrative regulation must not contravene but should conform to the standards that the law prescribes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The CTA also ruled that respondent has properly substantiated its claim for tax credit by documentary evidence. However, based on the examination conducted by the commissioned independent certified public accountant (CPA), there were some material discrepancies due to missing cash slips, lack of senior citizen's ID number, failure to include the cash slips in the summary report and vice versa. Therefore, between the Summary Report presented by respondent and the audited amount presented by the independent CPA, the CTA deemed it proper to consider the lesser of two amounts.<br><br>The re-computation of the overpaid income tax<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> for the year 1997 is as follows:<br><br> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="45%">Sales, Net </td> <td width="15%">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="40%">P 176,742,607.00 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Add: 20% Sales Discount to Senior Citizens</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,798,508.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Sales, Gross </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P 179,541,115.00 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Less: Cost of Sales</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;Merchandise inventory, beg.</div></td> <td style="text-align: right;">P 20,905,489.00</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;Purchases</div></td> <td style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;168,762,950.00</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;Merchandise inventory, end&nbsp;</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: right;">&nbsp; ( 27,281,439.00)</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">162,387,000.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Gross Profit </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P&nbsp;&nbsp; 17,154,115.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Add: Miscellaneous income </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 402,124.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Total Income </td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P&nbsp;&nbsp; 17,556,239.00 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Less: Operating expenses </td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16,913,699.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Net Income</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 642,540.00 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Less: Income subjected to final tax (Interest Income<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>) </td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 249,172.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Net Taxable Income </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 393,368.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Income Tax Due (35%) </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 137,679.00 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Less: Tax Credit (Cost of 20% discount as adjusted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>)</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,514,484.63</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Income Tax Payable </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;">(P&nbsp; 2,376,805.63)</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Income Tax Actually Paid </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00</span> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Income Tax Refundable</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">(P&nbsp; 2,376,805.63)</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Aggrieved by the CTA's decision, petitioner elevated the case before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></div><br>On 13 August 2003, the Court of Appeals affirmed the CTA's decision <i>in toto.</i><br><br>The Court of Appeals disagreed with petitioner's contention that the CTA's decision applied a literal interpretation of the law. It reasoned that under the <i>verba</i><i> legis</i> rule, if the statute is clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without&nbsp; interpretation. This principle rests on the presumption that the words used by the legislature in a statute correctly express its intent and preclude the court from construing it differently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals distinguished "tax credit" as an amount subtracted from a taxpayer's total tax liability to arrive at the tax due while a "tax deduction" reduces the taxpayer's taxable income upon which the tax liability is computed. "A credit differs from deduction in that the former is subtracted from tax while the latter is subtracted from income before the tax is computed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found no legal basis to support petitioner's opinion that actual payment by the taxpayer or actual receipt by the government of the tax sought to be credited or refunded is a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the availment of tax credit as enunciated in Section 229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Tax Code. The Court of Appeals stressed that Section 229 of the Tax Code pertains to illegally collected or erroneously paid taxes while RA 7432 is a special law which uses the method of tax credit in the context of just compensation. Further, RA 7432 does not require prior tax payment as a condition for claiming the cost of the sales discount as tax credit.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</b><br></div><br>Petitioner raises two issues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in this Petition:<br><ol><li>Whether the appellate court erred in holding that respondent may claim the 20% senior citizens' sales discount as a tax credit deductible from future income tax liabilities instead of a mere deduction from&nbsp; gross income or gross sales; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the appellate court erred in holding that respondent is entitled to a refund.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court</b><br></div><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>The issues presented are not novel. In two similar cases involving the same parties where respondent lodged its claim for tax credit on the senior citizens' discount granted in 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court has squarely ruled that the 20% senior citizens' discount required by RA 7432 may be claimed as a tax credit and not merely a tax deduction from gross sales or gross income.&nbsp; Under RA 7432, Congress granted the tax credit benefit to all covered establishments without conditions. The net loss incurred in a taxable year does not preclude the grant of tax credit because by its nature, the tax credit may still be deducted from a future, not a present, tax liability. However, the senior citizens' discount granted as a tax credit cannot be refunded.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>RA 7432 expressly allows private establishments </i></b><br><b><i>to claim the amount of discounts they grant to senior citizens </i></b><br><b><i>as tax credit. </i></b><br></div><br>Section 4(a) of RA 7432 states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. <i>Privileges for the Senior Citizens</i>. - The senior citizens shall be entitled to the following:<br><br>a) <b>the grant of twenty percent (20%) discount from</b> all establishments relative to the utilization of transportation services, hotels and similar lodging establishments, restaurants and recreation centers and <b>purchase of medicines </b>anywhere in the country: Provided, That <b>private establishments may claim the cost as tax credit</b>; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>However, RR 2-94 interpreted the tax credit provision of RA 7432 in this wise:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. DEFINITIONS. - For purposes of these regulations:<br><br>x x x<br><br>i. Tax Credit - refers to the <b>amount representing 20% discount granted to a qualified senior citizen </b>by all establishments relative to their utilization of transportation services, hotels and similar lodging establishments, restaurants, drugstores, recreation centers, theaters, cinema houses, concert halls, circuses, carnivals and other similar places of culture, leisure and amusement, which <b>discount shall be deducted by the said establishments from their gross income for income tax purposes</b> and from their gross sales for value-added tax or other percentage tax purposes. (Emphasis supplied).<br><br>x x x<br><br>Sec. 4. Recording/Bookkeeping Requirement for Private Establishments<br><br>x x x<br><br><b>The</b> <b>amount of 20% discount shall be deducted from the gross income for income tax purposes</b> and from gross sales of the business enterprise concerned for purposes of the VAT and other percentage taxes. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Tax credit is defined as a peso-for-peso reduction from a taxpayer's tax liability. It is a direct subtraction from the tax payable to the government. On the other hand, RR 2-94 treated the amount of senior citizens' discount as a tax deduction which is only&nbsp; a subtraction from gross income resulting to a lower taxable income. RR 2-94 treats the senior citizens' discount in the same manner as the allowable deductions provided in Section 34, Chapter VII of the National Internal Revenue Code. RR 2-94 affords merely a fractional reduction in the taxes payable to the government depending on the applicable tax rate.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Central Luzon Drug Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court ruled that petitioner's definition in RR 2-94 of a tax credit is clearly erroneous. To deny the tax credit, despite the plain mandate of the law, is indefensible. In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Central Luzon Drug Corporation, </i>the<i> </i>Court<i> </i>declared,<i> </i>"When the law says that the cost of the discount may be claimed as a <i>tax credit</i>, it means that the amount-- when claimed â€• shall be treated as a reduction from any tax liability, plain and simple." The Court further stated&nbsp; that the law cannot be amended by a mere regulation because "administrative agencies in issuing these regulations may not enlarge, alter or restrict the provisions of the law it administers; it cannot engraft additional requirements not contemplated by the legislature." Hence, there being a dichotomy in the law and the revenue regulation, the definition provided in Section 2(i) of RR 2-94 cannot be given effect.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>The tax credit may still be deducted <br></i></b><b><i>from a future, not a present, tax liability. </i></b><br></div><br>In the petition filed before this Court, petitioner alleged that respondent incurred a net loss from its business operations in 1997; hence, it did not pay any income tax. Since no tax payment was made, it follows that no tax credit can also be claimed because tax credits are usually applied against a tax liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Central Luzon Drug Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court stressed that prior payment of tax liability is not a pre-condition before a taxable entity can avail of the tax credit. The Court declared, "Where there is no tax liability or where a private establishment reports a net loss for the period, the tax credit can be availed of and carried over to the next taxable year."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It is irrefutable that under RA 7432, Congress has granted the tax credit benefit to all covered establishments without conditions. Therefore, neither a tax liability nor a prior tax payment is required for the existence or grant of a tax credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The applicable law on this point is clear and without any qualifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Hence, respondent is entitled to claim the amount of P2,376,805.63 as tax credit despite incurring net loss from business operations for the taxable year 1997.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>The senior citizens' discount may be claimed </i></b><br><b><i>as a tax credit and not a refund. </i></b><br></div><br>Section 4(a) of RA 7432 expressly provides that private establishments may claim the cost as a tax credit. A tax credit can only be utilized as payment for future internal revenue tax liabilities of the taxpayer while a tax refund, issued as a check or a warrant, can be encashed. A tax refund can be availed of immediately while a tax credit can only be utilized if the taxpayer has existing or future tax liabilities.<br><br>If the words of the law are clear, plain, and free of ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without any interpretation. Hence, the senior citizens' discount may be claimed as a tax credit and not as a refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><b><i></i></b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>RA 9257 now specifically provides that all covered establishments </i></b><br><b><i>may claim the senior citizens' discount as tax deduction.</i></b><br></div><br>On 26 February 2004, RA 9257, otherwise known as the "Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2003," was signed into law and became effective on 21 March 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>RA 9257 has amended RA 7432. Section 4(a) of RA 9257 reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 4. <i>Privileges for the Senior Citizens</i>. - The senior citizens shall be entitled to the following:<br><br><b>(a)</b> <b>the</b> <b>grant of twenty percent (20%) discount</b> from all establishments relative to the utilization of services in hotels and similar lodging establishments, restaurants and recreation centers, and <b>purchase of medicines</b> in all establishments for the exclusive use or enjoyment of senior citizens, including funeral and burial services for the death of senior citizens;<br><br>x x x<br><br><b>The</b> <b>establishment may claim the discounts granted under (a)</b>, (f), (g) and (h) as <b>tax deduction</b> based on the net cost of the goods sold or services rendered: <i>Provided</i>, That the cost of the discount shall be allowed as deduction from gross income for the same taxable year that the discount is granted. <i>Provided</i>, <i>further</i>, That the total amount of the claimed tax deduction net of value added tax if applicable, shall be included in their gross sales receipts for tax purposes and shall be subject to proper documentation and to the provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Contrary to the provision in RA 7432 where the senior citizens' discount granted by all covered establishments can be claimed as tax credit, RA 9257 now specifically provides that this discount should be treated as tax deduction.<br><br>With the effectivity of RA 9257 on 21 March 2004, there is now a new tax treatment for senior citizens' discount granted by all covered establishments. This discount should be considered as a deductible expense from gross income and no longer as tax credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The present case, however, covers the taxable year 1997 and is thus governed by the old law, RA 7432.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
