Talaga, Jr. (petitioner) and the City Councilors are prosecuted for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act: Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, as amended.<br><br>The assailed Resolution ordered petitioner's preventive suspension for ninety (90) days in accordance with Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019.<br><br>The facts of the case:<br><br>Criminal and administrative complaints were filed by Elan Recreation, Inc. (ELAN) against petitioner with the Office of the Ombudsman. The complaints alleged that petitioner, in his capacity as mayor of the City of Lucena, had unlawfully granted favors to a third party with respect to the operation of bingo games in the city, to the damage and prejudice of the complainants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On May 23, 2003, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon recommended the dismissal of both the criminal and administrative complaints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> However, the Ombudsman approved the dismissal of the administrative case but denied the dismissal of the criminal case.<br><br>As a result, the Office of the Special Prosecutor recommended the filing of three criminal charges for violation of R.A.

Talaga, Jr., Godofredo V. Faller, Danilo R. Zaballero, Salome S. Dato, Simon N. Aldovino, Wilfredo F. Asilo, and Aurora C.

Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that unless the accused is suspended, he may frustrate or commit further acts of malfeasance or do both.<br><br>Petitioner asks this Court to first look into the circumstances of the case and thereafter determine the propriety of issuing a suspension order.&nbsp; The Court could not be more explicit than its ruling in <i>Segovia v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>Petitioners would now have this Court strike down these resolutions because supposedly rendered in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. The Court will not do so. In no sense may the challenged resolutions be stigmatized as so clearly capricious, whimsical, oppressive, egregiously erroneous or wanting in logic as to call for invalidation by the extraordinary writ of certiorari. On the contrary, in promulgating those resolutions, the Sandiganbayan did but adhere to the clear command of the law and what it calls a "mass of jurisprudence" emanating from this Court, sustaining its authority to decree suspension of public officials and employees indicted before it. <b>Indeed that the theory of "discretionary suspension" should still be advocated at this late date, despite the "mass of jurisprudence" relevant to the issue, is little short of amazing, bordering on contumacious disregard of the solemn magisterial pronouncements of the Highest Court of the land</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>While petitioners concede that this Court has "almost consistently ruled that the preventive suspension contemplated in Section 13 of RA 3019 is mandatory in character," they nonetheless urge the Court to consider their case an exception because of the "peculiar circumstances" thereof</b>. They assert that the evils sought to be avoided by "separating a public official from the scene of his alleged misfeasance while the same is being investigated" — e.g., "to preclude the abuse of the prerogative of (his) office, such as through intimidation of witnesses,"or the tampering with documentary evidence — will not occur in the present situation where:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The Project has been canceled.<br><br></li><li>(Their) ** official duties no longer pertain, in any manner, to the prequalification of contractors dealing with NPC. Neither are they now involved in any bidding for or awarding of contracts, ** it (being) emphasized (in this connection) that they were merely designated as <i>ad hoc</i> members of the Committee without additional compensation for their additional duties.<br><br></li><li>All the relevant documentary evidence had been either submitted to the Ombudsman or to the Honorable Sandiganbayan.<br></li></ol></blockquote>They conclude that their preventive suspension "at this point would actually be purposeless, as there is no more need for precautionary measures against their abuse of the prerogatives of their office."<br><br><b>The arguments are not new. They have been advanced and rejected in earlier cases. They will again be so rejected in this case.</b><br><br>The Court's pronouncements in Bolastig v. Sandiganbayan, are germane:<br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; The fact is that the possibility that the accused would intimidate witnesses or otherwise hamper his prosecution is just one of the grounds for preventive suspension. The other one is, <b>to prevent the accused from committing further acts of malfeasance while in office</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Ineluctably, the theory of petitioner that "environmental circumstances" of the case should first be explored has no leg to stand on.<br><br>Section 13, R.A. No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, provides:<br><blockquote><i>Suspension and loss of benefits</i>. - Any public officer against whom any criminal prosecution <b>under a valid information</b> <b>under this Act or under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on bribery is pending in court,</b> <b>shall be suspended from office</b>. Should he be convicted by final judgment, he shall lose all retirement or gratuity benefits under any law, but if he is acquitted, he shall be entitled to reinstatement and to salaries and benefits which he failed to receive during suspension, unless in the meantime administrative proceedings have been filed against him. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Beroña v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court explicitly ruled:<br><blockquote>Section 13 is so clear and explicit that there is hardly room for any extended court rationalization of the law.&nbsp; Section 13 unequivocally mandates the suspension of a public official from office pending a criminal prosecution under R.A. 3019 or Title 7, Book II of the Revised Penal Code or for any offense involving public funds or property or fraud on government.&nbsp; This Court has repeatedly held that such preventive suspension is mandatory, and there are no "ifs" and "buts" about it.<br></blockquote>As early as <i>Luciano v. Mariano,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><i> </i>the Court has set out the guidelines to be followed by the lower courts in the exercise of the power of suspension, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(c) By way of broad guidelines for the lower courts in the exercise of the power of suspension from office of public officers charged under a valid information under the provisions of Republic Act No. 3019 or under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on bribery, pursuant to section 13 of said Act, it may be briefly stated that upon the filing of such information, the trial court should issue an order with proper notice requiring the accused officer to show cause at a specific date of hearing why he should not be ordered suspended from office pursuant to the cited mandatory provisions of the Act. <b>Where either the prosecution seasonably files a motion for an order of suspension or the accused in turn files a motion to quash the information or challenges the validity thereof, such show-cause order of the trial court would no longer be necessary.</b> <b>What is indispensable is that the trial court duly hear the parties at a hearing held for determining the validity of the information, and thereafter hand down its ruling, issuing the corresponding order of suspension should it uphold the validity of the information or withhold such suspension in the contrary case.</b><br><br>(d) No specific rules need be laid down for such pre-suspension hearing. Suffice it to state that the accused should be given a fair and adequate opportunity to challenge the validity of the criminal proceedings against him, e.g., that he has not been afforded the right of due preliminary investigation, the act for which he stands charged do not constitute a violation of the provisions of Republic Act No. 3019 or of bribery provisions of the Revised Penal Code which would warrant his mandatory suspension from office under Section 13 of the Act, or he may present a motion to quash the information on any of the grounds provided in the Rule 117 of the Rules of Court. The mandatory suspension decreed by the act upon determination of the pendency in court or criminal prosecution for violation of the Anti-Graft Act or for bribery under a valid information requires at the same time that the hearing be expeditious, and not unduly protracted such as to thwart the prompt suspension envisioned by the Act. Hence, if the trial court, say, finds the ground alleged in the quashal motion not to be indubitable, then it shall be called upon to issue the suspension order upon its upholding the validity of the information and setting the same for trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Stated differently, the purpose of the law in requiring a pre-suspension hearing is to determine the validity of the information so that the court can have a basis to either suspend the accused and proceed with the trial on the merits of the case, or withhold the suspension and dismiss the case, or correct any part of the proceedings that impairs its validity. That hearing is similar to a challenge to the validity of the information by way of a motion to quash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, respondent had determined the validity of the Information when petitioner filed his Motion to Quash.&nbsp; The hearings or proceedings held thereon, in effect, constituted a pre-suspension hearing. Respondent has followed the dictates of the law.<br><br>This brings the Court to petitioner's third assigned error that there is no valid Information under which petitioner stands charged.<br><br>In effect, petitioner is stating once again that the allegations in the Information do not constitute an offense.&nbsp; Petitioner is holding on to a thin straw in claiming that the Information is fatally defective since it failed to allege that petitioner by enacting and approving Ordinance No. 1963 had "caused injury to any party, whether the government or private party", an essential element in the crime charged.<br><br>The Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about June 5, 2000, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Lucena City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused RAMON TALAGA , JR., being the City Mayor of Lucena, Quezon and GODOFREDO V. FALLER, VICTOR U. PAULO, DANILO R. ZABALLERO, SALOME S. DATO, SIMON N. ALDOVINO, WILFREDO F. ASILO, PHILIP M. CASTILLO, AURORA C. GARCIA, ROMANO FRANCO C. TALAGA, being members of the City Council of Lucena City, while in the performance of their official and/or administrative functions, committing the offense in relation to their office, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, with evident bad faith and/or manifest partiality, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping such other, <b>give unwarranted benefit to Jose Sy Bang of Lucena City, by then and there, in conspiracy with each other, by enacting and approving Ordinance No. 1963, series of 2000 dated June 5, 2000 granting unto the said Jose Sy Bang a local franchise to operate a bingo business in Lucena City in violation of Presidential decree No. 771</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, under which petitioner is charged, provides:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers.- In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or<b> giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence</b>.&nbsp; This provision shall apply to officers and employees charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Contrary to the argument of petitioner, the law does not require that the information must allege that the acts in question "caused injury to any party, whether the government or private party."&nbsp; The presence of the word "or" clearly shows that there are two acts which can be prosecuted under Section 3: First, causing any undue injury to any party, including the government, and, Second, giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantages or preference.&nbsp; Moreover, in <i>Quibal v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court ruled that violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019 requires proof of the following facts:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">x x x x<br></div><blockquote><ol><li>His action caused undue injury to the Government or any private party, <b><u>or</u> gave any party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to such parties</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Section 9, Rule 110, Rules of Court provides the guideline for the determination of the validity or sufficiency of allegations in an information, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 9. <i>Cause of the Accusation</i>. — The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be <b>stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged </b>as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The test is whether the crime is described in intelligible terms with such particularity as to appraise the accused, with reasonable certainty, of the offense charged.&nbsp; The <i>raison d'etre </i>of the rule is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing test, the Information sufficiently apprises petitioner of the charges against him. The Information charged the petitioner of evident bad faith and manifest partiality when as Mayor of Lucena City, petitioner, in conspiracy with the City Council, gave unwarranted benefits to Jose Sy Bang.&nbsp; Moreover, it states the specific act which constituted the giving of unwarranted benefits, namely, granting unto the said Jose Sy Bang a local franchise to operate a bingo business in Lucena City in violation of existing laws.&nbsp; These allegations are clear enough for a layman to understand.<br><br>Finally, petitioner's second assigned error deserves scant consideration. The validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section 13, R.A. No. 3019&nbsp; may&nbsp; no longer&nbsp; be&nbsp; put at&nbsp; issue,&nbsp; the same&nbsp; having&nbsp; been repeatedly&nbsp; upheld&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]&nbsp; </sup>Basic is&nbsp; the&nbsp; rule that&nbsp; every&nbsp; law has&nbsp; in&nbsp; its favor&nbsp; the&nbsp; presumption of&nbsp; constitutionality,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to justify its nullification, there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, and not one that is doubtful, speculative or argumentative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act implicitly recognizes that the power of preventive suspension lies in the court in which the criminal charge is filed; once a case is filed in court, all other acts connected with the discharge of court functions - including preventive suspension - should be acknowledged as within the competence of the court that has taken cognizance thereof, no violation of the doctrine of separation of powers being perceivable in that acknowledgement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; As earlier mentioned, the court must first determine the validity of the information through a pre-suspension hearing.&nbsp; But once a proper determination of the validity of the information has been made, it becomes the ministerial duty of the court to forthwith issue the order of preventive suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DISMISSED,</b> there being no showing that the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> gravely abused its discretion in issuing its Resolution of October 3, 2005, preventively suspending the petitioner for ninety (90) days.
