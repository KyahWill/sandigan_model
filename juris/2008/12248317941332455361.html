She gave a prescription drug to a customer who did not have the proper form of prescription, she did not take a good look at said prescription, she merely presumed plaintiff was looking for Cortisporin Otic Solution because it was the only one available in the market and she further presumed that by merely putting the drug by the counter wherein plaintiff looked at it, paid and took the drug without any objection meant he understood what he was buying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC ruled that although De Leon may have been negligent by failing to read the medicine's label or to instruct his sheriff to do so, Mercury Drug was first to be negligent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Ganzon dispensed a drug without the requisite prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, she did so without fully reading what medicine was exactly being bought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, she presumed that since what was available was the drug Cortisporin Otic Solution, it was what De Leon was attempting to buy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Said the court:<br><blockquote>When the injury is caused by the negligence of a servant or employee, there instantly arises a presumption of law that there was negligence on the part of the employer or employer either in the selection of the servant or employee, or in the supervision over him after the selection or both.<br><center><br>x x x x<br></center><br>The theory bases the responsibility of the master ultimately on his own negligence and not on that of his servant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Dissatisfied with the RTC ruling, Mercury Drug and Ganzon elevated the matter to the CA.&nbsp; Accordingly, they filed their respective briefs.&nbsp; Raising technical grounds, De Leon moved for the appeal's dismissal.<br><center><br><b>CA Disposition</b><br></center><br>On July 4, 2008, the CA issued a resolution which granted De Leon's motion and dismissed the appeal.&nbsp; Said the appellate court:<br><blockquote>As pointed out by the plaintiff-appellee, the Statement of Facts, Statement of the Case, Assignment of Errors/issues, Arguments/ Discussions in the Brief make no references to the pages of the records.

Hollenkemp</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the US Supreme Court ruled that a druggist that sells to a purchaser or sends to a patient one drug for another or even one innocent drug, calculated to produce a certain effect, in place of another sent for and designed to produce a different effect, cannot escape responsibility, upon the alleged pretext that it was an accidental or innocent mistake.&nbsp; His mistake, under the most favorable aspect for himself, is negligence.&nbsp; And such mistake cannot be countenanced or tolerated, as it is a mistake of the gravest kind and of the most disastrous effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><i>Smith's Admrx v.

Consequently, it must be that the druggist warrants that he will deliver the drug called for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote>Mercury Drug and Ganzon's defense that the latter gave the only available Cortisporin solution in the market deserves scant consideration.&nbsp; Ganzon could have easily verified whether the medicine she gave De Leon was, indeed, the prescribed one or, at the very least, consulted her supervisor. Absent the required certainty in the dispensation of the medicine, she could have refused De Leon's purchase of the drug.<br><br><b>The award of damages is proper and shall only be reduced considering the peculiar facts of the case.</b>&nbsp; Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury.&nbsp; Though incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they are the proximate result of defendant's wrongful act or omission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Moral damages are not intended to impose a penalty to the wrongdoer or to enrich the claimant at the expense of defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>&nbsp; There is no hard and fast rule in determining what would be a fair and reasonable amount of moral damages since each case must be governed by its peculiar circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>&nbsp; However, the award of damages must be commensurate to the loss or injury suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Taking into consideration the attending facts of the case under review, We find the amount awarded by the trial court to be excessive.&nbsp; Following the precedent case of <i>Mercury Drug</i>, We reduce the amount from P100,000.00 to P50,000.00 only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]&nbsp; </sup>In addition, We also deem it necessary to reduce the award of exemplary damages from the exorbitant amount of P300,000.00 to P25,000.00 only.<br><br>This Court explained the propriety of awarding exemplary damages in the earlier <i>Mercury Drug</i> case:<br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; Article 2229 allows the grant of exemplary damages by way of example or correction for the public good.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the drugstore business is affected by public interest.&nbsp; Petitioner should have exerted utmost diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees.&nbsp; On the part of the employee concerned, she should have been <b>extremely cautious in dispensing pharmaceutical products</b>.&nbsp; Due to the sensitive nature of its business, petitioner must at all times maintain a high level of meticulousness.&nbsp; Therefore, an award of exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is generally recognized that the drugstore business is imbued with public interest.&nbsp; This can not be more real for Mercury Drug, the country's biggest drugstore chain.&nbsp; This Court can not tolerate any form of negligence which can jeopardize the health and safety of its loyal patrons.&nbsp; Moreover, this Court will not countenance the cavalier manner it treated De Leon.
