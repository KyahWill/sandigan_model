SP No. 79912, which affirmed the Decision dated 22 January 2003 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in <i>NLRC Case No. V-000241-2002</i> finding that Helpmate, Inc. (HI) is a legitimate independent job contractor and that the petitioners were not illegally dismissed from work; and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 31 October 2006 of the same court denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the petitioners.<br><br>Respondent Equitable-PCI Bank (E-PCIBank),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a banking entity duly organized and existing under and by virtue of Philippine laws, entered into a Contract for Services<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with HI, a domestic corporation primarily engaged in the business of providing janitorial and messengerial services. Pursuant to their contract, HI shall hire and assign workers to E-PCIBank to perform janitorial/messengerial and maintenance services.&nbsp; The contract was impliedly renewed year after year.&nbsp; Petitioners Rolando Sasan, Sr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Leonilo Dayday,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Modesto Aguirre,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Alejandro Ardimer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Eleuterio Sacil,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Wilfredo Juegos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Petronilo Carcedo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and Cesar Peciencia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> were among those employed and assigned to E-PCIBank at its branch along Gorordo Avenue, Lahug, Cebu City, as well as to its other branches in the Visayas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>O 23 July 2001, petitioners filed with the Arbitration Branch of the NLRC in Cebu City separate complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> against E-PCIBank and HI for illegal dismissal, with claims for separation pay, service incentive leave pay, allowances, damages, attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp; Their complaints were docketed as NLRC RAB-VII Case No. 07-1381-2001 and raffled to Labor Arbiter Jose G. Gutierrez (Labor Arbiter Gutierrez) for their proper disposition.&nbsp; Subsequently, on 22 August 2001, the petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> amended their complaints to include a claim for 13<sup>th</sup> month-pay.<br><br>Several conciliation hearings were scheduled by Labor Arbiter Gutierrez but the parties still failed to arrive at a mutually beneficial settlement; hence, Labor Arbiter Gutierrez ordered that they submit their respective position papers.<br><br>In their position papers, petitioners claimed that they had become regular employees of E-PCIBank with respect to the activities for which they were employed, having continuously rendered janitorial and messengerial services to the bank for more than one year; that E-PCIBank had direct control and supervision over the means and methods by which they were to perform their jobs; and that their dismissal by HI was null and void because the latter had no power to do so since they had become regular employees of E-PCIBank.<br><br>For its part, E-PCIBank averred that it entered into a Contract for Services with HI, an independent job contractor which hired and assigned petitioners to the bank to perform janitorial and messengerial services thereat.&nbsp; It was HI that paid petitioners' wages, monitored petitioners' daily time records (DTR) and uniforms, and exercised direct control and supervision over the petitioners and that therefore HI has every right to terminate their services legally.&nbsp; E-PCIBank could not be held liable for whatever misdeed HI had committed against its employees.<br><br>HI, on the other hand, asserted that it was an independent job contractor engaged in the business of providing janitorial and related services to business establishments, and E-PCIBank was one of its clients.&nbsp; Petitioners were its employees, part of its pool of janitors/messengers assigned to E-PCIBank.&nbsp; The Contract for Services between HI and E-PCIBank expired on 15 July 2000. E-PCIBank no longer renewed said contract with HI and, instead, bidded out its janitorial requirements to two other job contractors, Able Services and Puritan.&nbsp; HI designated petitioners to new work assignments, but the latter refused to comply with the same.&nbsp; Petitioners were not dismissed by HI, whether actually or constructively, thus, petitioners' complaints before the NLRC were without basis.<br><br>Labor Arbiter Gutierrez focused on the following issues: (a) whether petitioners were regular employees of HI; (b) whether petitioners were illegally dismissed from their employment; and (c) whether petitioners were entitled to their money claims.<br><br>On 7 January 2002, on the basis of the parties' position papers and documentary evidence, Labor Arbiter Gutierrez rendered a Decision finding that HI was not a legitimate job contractor on the ground that it did not possess the required substantial capital or investment to actually perform the job, work, or service under its own account and responsibility as required under the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; HI is therefore a labor-only contractor and the real employer of petitioners is E-PCIBank which is held liable to petitioners.&nbsp; According to Labor Arbiter Gutierrez:<br><blockquote>[T]he undisputed facts show that the [herein petitioners] were made to perform not only as janitors but also as messengers, drivers and one of them even worked as an electrician.&nbsp; For us, these jobs are not only directly related to the main business of the principal but are, likewise deemed necessary in the conduct of respondent Equitable-PCI Bank's principal business.&nbsp; Thus, based on the above, we so declare that the [petitioners] are employees of respondent Equitable-PCI Bank.&nbsp; And having worked with respondent Equitable-PCI Bank for more than one (1) year, they are deemed regular employees.&nbsp; They cannot, therefore, be removed from employment without cause and without due process, which is wanting in this case.&nbsp; Hence, the severance of their employment in the guise of termination of contract is illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>In the dispositive portion of his 7 January 2002 Decision, Labor Arbiter Gutierrez awarded to petitioners the following amounts:  <br> <blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="49%"> I. - CESAR PACIENCIA </td><td width="5%"> <br></td> <td valign="bottom" width="46%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>a) Backwages<br> July 15, 2001 to January 8, 2002<br> = P190.00 per day <br> = 5 months and 6 days <br> = 136 days x P190.00 </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">= P25,840.00 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td> </tr><tr> <td>b) Separation Pay<br> June 10, 1996 to July 15, 2001<br> = 5 years<br> =P190.00 x 26 days x 5 years / 2 </td> <td> <br> <br></td><td valign="bottom">= P12,350.00 </td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td> </tr><tr> <td> c) 13<sup>th</sup> Month Pay <br>= P190.00 x 26 days<br> Total </td> <td> <br></td> <td valign="bottom"><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">= P 4,940.00</span> <br>&nbsp;P 43,130.00 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td> </tr><tr> <td> II - Dominador Suico, Jr. (did not file Amended Complaint)</td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>a) Backwages <br> July 15, 2001 to January 15, 2002 <br> same as Paciencia </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">= P25,840.00 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>b) Separation Pay <br> Feb. 2, 1999 to July 15, 2001 <br> = P190.00 x 26 days x 2.5 years / 2 <br> Total </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><u>= P6,175.00</u><br> = P32,015.00 </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom">&nbsp;</td> </tr><tr> <td> III - Roland Mosquera (did not file Amended Complaint)&nbsp;

The petitioners, therefore, were not even placed on "floating status."&nbsp; They simply refused, without justifiable reason, to assume their new work assignments which refusal was tantamount to abandonment.&nbsp; There being no illegal dismissal, petitioners are not entitled to backwages or separation pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The <i>fallo</i> of the 24 April 2006 Decision of the appellate court reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us DENYING the petition filed in this case and AFFIRMING the decision of the NLRC, Fourth Division, in NLRC Case No. V-000145-2003 promulgated on June 22, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners now come before us <i>via</i> the instant Petition raising the following issues:<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED IN EXCESS OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND/OR COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN UPHOLDING THE NLRC 4<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION'S DECISION AND GRAVELY ERRED IN:<br><ol type="I"><li>ACCEPTING AND APPRECIATING THE PIECES OF EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS DURING APPEAL, ALL EXISTING DURING THE TIME THE NLRC RAB 7'S TRIAL, CONTRARY TO THIS HONORABLE COURT'S PREVIOUS ESTABLISHED DECISIONS.<br><br></li><li>REVERSING, WITHOUT ANY LEGAL BASIS, THE FACTUAL FINDING OF NLRC RAB 7 THAT THE RESPONDENT HI WAS LABOR ONLY CONTRACTOR.<br><br></li><li>RULING, WITHOUT ANY LEGAL BASIS, THAT THE ILLEGAL DISMISSAL COMPLAINTS WERE PREMATURELY FILED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Before proceeding to the substantive issues, we first address the procedural issues raised by petitioners.<br><br>Petitioners object to the acceptance and consideration by the NLRC of the evidence presented by HI for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; This is not a novel procedural issue, however, and our jurisprudence is already replete with cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> allowing the NLRC to admit evidence, not presented before the Labor Arbiter, and submitted to the NLRC for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; Technical rules of evidence are not binding in labor cases.&nbsp; Labor officials should use every reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The submission of additional evidence before the NLRC is not prohibited by its New Rules of Procedure. After all, rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity are not controlling in labor cases.&nbsp; The NLRC and labor arbiters are directed to use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law and procedure all in the interest of substantial justice.&nbsp; In keeping with this directive, it has been held that the NLRC may consider evidence, such as documents and affidavits, submitted by the parties for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; The submission of additional evidence on appeal does not prejudice the other party for the latter could submit counter-evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In <i>Clarion Printing House, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; we again emphasized that:<br><blockquote>[T]he NLRC is not precluded from receiving evidence, even for the first time on appeal, because technical rules of procedure are not binding in labor cases.<br><br>The settled rule is that the NLRC is not precluded from receiving evidence on appeal as technical rules of evidence are not binding in labor cases.&nbsp; In fact, labor officials are mandated by the Labor Code to use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Lawin Security Services v. NLRC</i>, and <i>Bristol Laboratories Employees' Association-DFA v. NLRC</i>, we held that even if the evidence was not submitted to the labor arbiter, the fact that it was duly introduced on appeal to the NLRC is enough basis for the latter to be more judicious in admitting the same, instead of falling back on the mere technicality that said evidence can no longer be considered on appeal.&nbsp; Certainly, the first course of action would be more consistent with equity and the basic notions of fairness.<br></blockquote>For the same reasons, we cannot find merit in petitioners' protestations against the documentary evidence submitted by HI because they were mere photocopies. Evidently, petitioners are invoking the best evidence rule, espoused in Section 3, Rule130 of the Rules of Court. It provides that:<br><blockquote>Section 3. - <i>Original document must be produced; exceptions</i>. - When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself x x x.<br></blockquote>The above provision explicitly mandates that when the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, <b>certified true copies</b> of these documents, acceptable under the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> were furnished to the petitioners. Even assuming that petitioners were given mere photocopies, again, we stress that proceedings before the NLRC are not covered by the technical rules of evidence and procedure as observed in the regular courts.&nbsp; Technical rules of evidence do not apply if the decision to grant the petition proceeds from an examination of its sufficiency as well as a careful look into the arguments contained in position papers and other documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioners had more than adequate opportunity when they filed their motion for reconsideration before the NLRC, their Petition to the Court of Appeals and even to this Court, to refute or present their counter-evidence to the documentary evidence presented by HI. Having failed in this respect, petitioners cannot now be heard to complain about these documentary evidences presented by HI upon which the NLRC and the Court of Appeals based its finding that HI is a legitimate job contractor.<br><br>The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain one's side.&nbsp; It is also an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.&nbsp; It is not the denial of the right to be heard but denial of the opportunity to be heard that constitutes violation of due process of law. Petitioners herein were afforded every opportunity to be heard and to seek reconsideration of the adverse judgment against them.&nbsp; They had every opportunity to strengthen their positions by presenting their own substantial evidence to controvert those submitted by E-PCIBank and HI before the NLRC, and even before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It cannot win its case by merely raising unsubstantiated doubt or relying on the weakness of the adverse parties' evidence.<br><br>We now proceed to the resolution of the substantive issues submitted by petitioners for our consideration, particularly, whether HI is a labor-only contactor and E-PCIBank should be deemed petitioners' principal employer; and whether petitioners were illegally dismissed from their employment.<br><br>Permissible job contracting or subcontracting refers to an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to put out or farm out to a contractor or subcontractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; A person is considered engaged in legitimate job contracting or subcontracting if the following conditions concur:<br><blockquote>(a) The contractor or subcontractor carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes to perform the job, work or service on its own account and under its own responsibility according to its own manner and method, and free from the control and direction of the principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof;<br><br>(b) The contractor or subcontractor has substantial capital or investment; and<br><br>(c) The agreement between the principal and contractor or subcontractor assures the contractual employees entitlement to all labor and occupational safety and health standards, free exercise of the right to self-organization, security of tenure, and social and welfare benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>In contrast, labor-only contracting, a prohibited act, is an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; In labor-only contracting, the following elements are present:<br><blockquote>(a) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment to actually perform the job, work or service under its own account and responsibility; and<br><br>(b) The employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>In distinguishing between permissible job contracting and prohibited labor-only contracting,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we elucidated in <i>Vinoya v.

Other facts that may be considered include the following: whether or not the contractor is carrying on an independent business; the nature and extent of the work; the skill required; the term and duration of the relationship; the right to assign the performance of specified pieces of work; the control and supervision of the work to another; the employer's power with respect to the hiring, firing and payment of the contractor's workers; the control of the premises; the duty to supply premises, tools, appliances, materials and labor; and the mode and manner or terms of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Simply put, the totality of the facts and the surrounding circumstances of the case are to be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Each case must be determined by its own facts and all the features of the relationship are to be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, we find substantial evidence to support the finding of the NLRC, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that HI is a legitimate job contractor.<br><br>We take note that HI has been issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Certificate of Registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Numbered VII-859-1297-048.&nbsp; The said certificate states among other things:<br><blockquote><center>"CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION<br>Numbered VII-859-1297-048<br><br>is issued to<br><br>HELPMATE, INCORPORATED<br>330 N.

Moreover, the DOLE being the agency primarily responsible for regulating the business of independent job contractors, we can presume in the absence of evidence to the contrary that it thoroughly evaluated the requirements submitted by HI as a precondition to the issuance of the Cerificate of Registration.<br><br>The evidence on record also shows that HI is carrying on a distinct and independent business from E-PCIBank.&nbsp; The employees of HI are assigned to clients to perform janitorial and messengerial services, clearly distinguishable from the banking services in which E-PCIBank is engaged.<br><br>Despite the afore-mentioned compliance by HI with the requisites for permissible job contracting, Labor Arbiter Gutierrez still declared that HI was engaged in prohibited labor-only contracting because it did not possess substantial capital or investment to actually perform the job, work or service under its own account or responsibility.&nbsp; Both the NLRC and the Court of Appeals ruled to the contrary, and we agree.<br><br>"Substantial capital or investment" refers to capital stocks and subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, tools, equipments, implements, machineries and work premises, actually and directly used by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of the job, work or service contracted out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; An independent contractor must have either substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others. The law does not require both substantial capital and investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, <i>etc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; It is enough that it has substantial capital. In the case of HI, it has proven both.<br><br>We have&nbsp; expostulated that once it is established that an entity such as in this case, HI has substantial capital, it was no longer necessary to adduce further evidence to prove that it does not fall within the purview of "labor-only" contracting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> There is even no need for HI to refute the contention of petitioners that some of the activities they performed such as those of messengerial services are directly related to the principal business of E- PCIBank.<br><br>In any event, we have earlier declared that while these services rendered by the petitioners as janitors, messengers and drivers are&nbsp; considered directly related to the principal business of a bank, in this case E-PCIBank, nevertheless, they are not necessary in the conduct of its (E-PCIBANK's) principal business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>HI has substantial capital in the amount of P20,939,935.72.&nbsp; It has its own building where it holds office and it has been engaged in business for more than a decade now.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As observed by the Court of Appeals, surely, such a well-established business entity cannot be considered a labor-only contractor.<br><br>Etched in an unending stream of cases are four standards in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, namely: (a) the manner of selection and engagement of the putative employee; (b) the mode of payment of wages; (c) the presence or absence of power of dismissal; and, (d) the presence or absence of control of the putative employee's conduct. Most determinative among these factors is the so-called "control test."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The presence of the first requisite for the existence of an employer-employee relationship to wit, the selection and engagement of the employee is shown by the fact that it was HI which selected and engaged the services of petitioners as its employees.&nbsp; This is fortified by the provision in the contract of services between HI and E-PCIBank which states:<br><blockquote><i>Selection, Engagement, Discharge</i>.&nbsp; [HI] shall have exclusive discretion in the selection, engagement, investigation, discipline and discharge of its employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>On the second requisite regarding the payment of wages, it was HI who paid petitioners their wages and who provided their daily time records and uniforms and other materials necessary for the work they performed.&nbsp; Therefore, it is HI who is responsible for petitioner's claims for wages and other employee's benefits.&nbsp; Precisely, the contract of services between HI and E-PCIBank reveals the following:<br><blockquote><i>Indemnity for Salaries and Benefits, etc</i>.&nbsp; [HI] shall be responsible for the salaries, allowances, overtime and holiday pay, and other benefits of its personnel including withholding taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>As to the third requisite on the power to control the employee's conduct, and the fourth requisite regarding the power of dismissal, again E-PCIBank did not have the power to control petitioners with respect to the means and methods by which their work was to be accomplished.&nbsp; It likewise had no power of dismissal over the petitioners.&nbsp; All that E-PCIBank could do was to report to HI any untoward act, negligence, misconduct or malfeasance of any employee assigned to the premises.&nbsp; The contract of services between E-PCIBank and HI is noteworthy.&nbsp; It states:<br><blockquote>[HI] shall have the entire charge, control and supervision over all its employees who may be fielded to [E-PCIBank].&nbsp; For this purpose, [HI] shall assign a regular supervisor of its employees who may be fielded to the Bank and which regular supervisor shall exclusively supervise and control the activities and functions defined in Section 1 hereof.&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>All these circumstances establish that HI undertook said contract on its account, under its own responsibility, according to its own manner and method, and free from the control and direction of E-PCIBank. Where the control of the principal is limited only to the result of the work, independent job contracting exists. The janitorial service agreement between E-PCIBank and HI is definitely a case of permissible job contracting.<br><br>Considering the foregoing, plus taking judicial notice of the general practice in private, as well as in government institutions and industries, of hiring an independent contractor to perform special services,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> ranging from janitorial, security and even technical services, we can only conclude that HI is a legitimate job contractor.&nbsp; As such legitimate job contractor, the law creates an employer-employee relationship between HI and petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which renders HI liable for the latter's claims.<br><br>In view of the preceding conclusions, petitioners will never become regular employees of E-PCIBank regardless of how long they were working for the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>We further rule that petitioners were not illegally dismissed by HI.&nbsp; Upon the termination of the Contract of Service between HI and E-PCIBank, petitioners cannot insist to continue to work for the latter.&nbsp; Their pull-out from E-PCIBank did not constitute illegal dismissal since, <i>first</i>, petitioners were not employees of E-PCIBank; and <i>second</i>, they were pulled out from said assignment due to the non-renewal of the Contract of Service between HI and E-PCIBank.&nbsp; At the time they filed their complaints with the Labor Arbiter, petitioners were not even dismissed by HI; they were only "off-detail" pending their re-assignment by HI to another client.&nbsp; And when they were actually given new assignments by HI with other clients,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> petitioners even refused the same.&nbsp; As the NLRC pronounced, petitioners' complaint for illegal dismissal is apparently premature.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

The contractor is considered merely an agent of the principal employer and the latter is responsible to the employees of the labor-only contractor as if such employees had been directly employed by the principal employer.&nbsp; The principal employer therefore becomes solidarity liable with the labor-only contractor for all the rightful claims of the employees (<i>San Miguel Corporation v.
