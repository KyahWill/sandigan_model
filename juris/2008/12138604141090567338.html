(emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner protested the assessment in a letter dated February 23, 2000. As respondent did not act on the protest, petitioner filed a petition for review in the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) seeking the cancellation of the deficiency VAT and DST assessments.<br><br>On April 5, 2002, the CTA rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the dispositive portion of which read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant Petition for Review is PARTIALLY GRANTED.&nbsp; Petitioner is hereby ORDERED to PAY the deficiency VAT amounting to P22,054,831.75 inclusive of 25% surcharge plus 20% interest from January 20, 1997 until fully paid for the 1996 VAT deficiency and P31,094,163.87 inclusive of 25% surcharge plus 20% interest from January 20, 1998 until fully paid for the 1997 VAT deficiency.&nbsp; Accordingly, VAT Ruling No. [231]-88 is declared void and without force and effect. The 1996 and 1997 deficiency DST assessment against petitioner is hereby CANCELLED AND SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Respondent is ORDERED to DESIST from collecting the said DST deficiency tax.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent appealed the CTA decision to the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> insofar as it cancelled the DST assessment. He claimed that petitioner's health care agreement was a contract of insurance subject to DST under Section 185 of the 1997 Tax Code.<br><br>On August 16, 2004, the CA rendered its decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It held that petitioner's health care agreement was in the nature of a non-life insurance contract subject to DST:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, insofar as it cancelled and set aside the 1996 and 1997 deficiency documentary stamp tax assessment and ordered petitioner to desist from collecting the same is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<br><br>Respondent is ordered to pay the amounts of P55,746,352.19 and P68,450,258.73 as deficiency Documentary Stamp Tax for 1996 and 1997, respectively, plus 25% surcharge for late payment and 20% interest per annum from January 27, 2000, pursuant to Sections 248 and 249 of the Tax Code, until the same shall have been fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the CA denied it. Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner essentially argues that its health care agreement is not a contract of insurance but a contract for the provision on a prepaid basis of medical services, including medical check-up, that are not based on loss or damage. Petitioner also insists that it is not engaged in the insurance business. It is a health maintenance organization regulated by the Department of Health, not an insurance company under the jurisdiction of the Insurance Commission. For these reasons, petitioner asserts that the health care agreement is not subject to DST.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>The DST is levied on the exercise by persons of certain privileges conferred by law for the creation, revision, or termination of specific legal relationships through the execution of specific instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It is an excise upon the privilege, opportunity, or facility offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In particular, <b>t</b><b>he DST under Section 185 of the 1997 Tax Code is imposed on the privilege of making or renewing any policy of insurance (except life, marine, inland and fire insurance)</b>, bond or obligation <b>in the nature of indemnity</b> for loss, damage, or liability.<br><br>Under the law, a contract of insurance is an agreement whereby one undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The event insured against must be designated in the contract and must either be unknown or contingent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's health care agreement is primarily a contract of indemnity. And in the recent case of <i>Blue Cross Healthcare, Inc. v. Olivares</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Court ruled that a health care agreement is in the nature of a non-life insurance policy.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner's claim, its health care agreement is not a contract for the provision of medical services. Petitioner does not actually provide medical or hospital services but merely arranges for the same<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and pays for them up to the stipulated maximum amount of coverage. It is also incorrect to say that the health care agreement is not based on loss or damage because, under the said agreement, petitioner assumes the liability and indemnifies its member for hospital, medical and related expenses (such as professional fees of physicians). The term "loss or damage" is broad enough to cover the monetary expense or liability a member will incur in case of illness or injury.<br><br>Under the health care agreement, the rendition of hospital, medical and professional services to the member in case of sickness, injury or emergency or his availment of so-called "out-patient services" (including physical examination, x-ray and laboratory tests, medical consultations, vaccine administration and family planning counseling) is the contingent event which gives rise to liability on the part of the member. In case of exposure of the member to liability, he would be entitled to indemnification by petitioner.<br><br>Furthermore, the fact that petitioner must relieve its member from liability by paying for expenses arising from the stipulated contingencies belies its claim that its services are prepaid. The expenses to be incurred by each member cannot be predicted beforehand, if they can be predicted at all. Petitioner assumes the risk of paying for the costs of the services even if they are significantly and substantially more than what the member has "prepaid." Petitioner does not bear the costs alone but distributes or spreads them out among a large group of persons bearing a similar risk, that is, among all the other members of the health care program. This is insurance.<br><br>Petitioner's health care agreement is substantially similar to that involved in <i>Philamcare Health Systems, Inc</i>.<i> v. CA</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The health care agreement in<i> </i>that case entitled the subscriber to avail of the hospitalization benefits, whether ordinary or emergency, listed therein. It also provided for "out-patient benefits" such as annual physical examinations, preventive health care and other out-patient services. This Court ruled in <i>Philamcare Health Systems, Inc.</i>:<br><blockquote>[T]he insurable interest of [the subscriber] in obtaining the health care agreement was his own health. <b>The health care agreement was in the nature of non-life insurance, which is primarily a contract of indemnity</b>. Once the member incurs hospital, medical or any other expense arising from sickness, injury or other stipulated contingency, the health care provider must pay for the same to the extent agreed upon under the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Similarly, the insurable interest of every member of petitioner's health care program in obtaining the health care agreement is his own health. Under the agreement, petitioner is bound to indemnify any member who incurs hospital, medical or any other expense arising from sickness, injury or other stipulated contingency to the extent agreed upon under the contract.<br><br>Petitioner's contention that it is a health maintenance organization and not an insurance company is irrelevant. Contracts between companies like petitioner and the beneficiaries under their plans are treated as insurance contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Moreover, DST is not a tax on the business transacted but an excise on the privilege, opportunity, or facility offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <b>It is an excise on the facilities used </b>in the transaction of the business,<b> separate and apart from the business itself</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.<b> </b>The August 16, 2004 decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
