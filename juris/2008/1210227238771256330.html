Romualdez and Jose Manuel G. Romualdez.<br><br>SO RESOLVED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>The Ombudsman reasoned out:<br><blockquote>The claim of complainant that there was extraordinary speed in the loan approval, a mark of behest loan was not supported by evidence.&nbsp; While it is true that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the loan was approved on December 29, 1980</span>, no evidence had been presented that the loan application was filed on December 15, 1980.&nbsp; On the contrary, December 15, 1980 was the date of the Evaluation Report on the loan application of Agretronics.&nbsp; Page 4 of the evaluation report shows that the security for the loan was appraised in November 1980 while the balance sheet of Agretronics as of October 31, 1980 was submitted to show the financial condition of the borrower.&nbsp; These facts clearly show that the date of the loan application was not December 15, 1980.<br><br>Republic Act No. 3019, specifically Section 3(e) thereof, punishes acts which cause undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.&nbsp; While Section 3(g) punishes the act of entering on behalf of the Government into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same.<br><br>A perusal of the records revealed that the loan entered into by DBP and Agretronics is not grossly disadvantageous to the government.&nbsp; The allegation of the complaint that the questioned transaction caused damage to the government was negated by the evidence on record.&nbsp; DBP Board Resolution No. 296 which approved the loan transaction clearly shows that various safety measures were imposed by the DBP Board of Governors to protect the interest of the Bank. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The loan granted was $2,866,667 (equivalent to P21,500,000 at $1.00: P7.50)</span> and the same was secured:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">By first mortgage on the following assets registered in the name of Agretronics:<br></div></td> </tr></tbody></table><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td width="5%"><br></td> <td width="5%"><br></td><td width="50%"><br></td><td width="40%"><br></td></tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">a)</div></td><td valign="top"><div align="justify">Land</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;" valign="top">P&nbsp; 5,487,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">b) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Building and improvements</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;" valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8,887,000</td></tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">c) </div></td><td valign="top"><div align="justify">Machinery and equipment</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;" valign="top">&nbsp; 14,587,680</td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Transportation equipment</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;" valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">e)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Furniture and office equipment</div></td> <td style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;" valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 692,270</td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><div align="center">Total =</div></td> <td style="text-align: center;" valign="top">P29,690,950<br></td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr><tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2) </div></td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify">By joint and several signatures with Agretronics, Inc. of Messrs.

Blg. 195 dated March 16, 1982, increasing the period of prescription to fifteen (15) years.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Therefore, the applicable prescriptive period in the case at bar is ten (10) years since the act complained of was committed in 1980 or prior to the amendment.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>The Supreme Court in the case of <i>People vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, 211 SCRA 241, ruled that in the computation of the prescriptive period, the same should be reckoned either from the date of the commission of the violation of the law, or if the same is not known, at the time of the discovery thereof.<br><br>Considering that pronouncement, in the case of <i>People vs. Dinsay</i>, C.A. 40 O.G. 12<sup>th</sup> Supplement 50, that when the series of transactions were by public instruments, like the case at bar, the period of prescription shall commence to run from the date of the execution of the public instruments.<br><br>Therefore, the questioned transaction herein involved has already been barred by prescription considering the lapse of more than ten (10) years from the date of the questioned transaction which happened in 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Petitioner Committee remains staunch in its view of the behest character of the subject loan.&nbsp; It assails the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsman as being vividly tainted with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Hence, through the present petition, petitioner prays for the reversal of the assailed Resolution and for the issuance of an Order directing the Ombudsman to file the necessary information against respondents before the appropriate forum.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br>Petitioner Committee hoists two issues for Our consideration:<br><br>WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC RESPONDENT OMBUDSMAN COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND/OR ACTED IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN HOLDING THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE TO PROCEED AGAINST ANY OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS</span>; AND<br><br>WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC RESPONDENT OMBUDSMAN COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND/OR ACTED IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN HOLDING THAT THE OFFENSE HAD ALREADY PRESCRIBED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br><div style="text-align: left;">The petition is meritorious.<br></div></div><br><b><i>Ombudsman is subject to judicial review when there is grave abuse of discretion.</i></b><br><br>Ordinarily, the Court will not interfere with the Ombudsman's determination of the existence or non-existence of probable cause.&nbsp; The rule, however, finds no application if there is grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> or if the action taken is done in a manner contrary to the dictates of the Constitution, law or jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>We have to make it clear at the outset that it is not for the Ombudsman to try the case.&nbsp; He is merely supposed to establish whether there exists probable cause to file an information in court against the accused.&nbsp; A finding of probable cause merely binds over the suspect to stand trial. It is not a pronouncement of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Considering the quantum of evidence needed to support a finding of probable cause, We hold that the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion when he found such to be lacking here, apart from declaring that the offense charged has prescribed.<br><br><b><i>Probable cause undoubtedly exists.</i></b><br><br>Preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence.&nbsp; Its purpose is for the presentation of such evidence as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.&nbsp; It is a means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged with a crime. The validity and merits of a party's defense or accusation, as well as admissibility of testimonies and evidences, are better ventilated during the trial proper than at the preliminary investigation level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Ombudsman held that the alleged extraordinary speed in the loan approval was not supported by evidence.&nbsp; However, questions as to the existence of so-called extraordinary speed as a mark of a behest loan and what constitutes extraordinary speed are matters best left to the trial court to decide.&nbsp; This it would do upon the evidence presented before it.&nbsp; Such evidence would not only show the time periods involved in the subject transaction but also what is considered as normal speed for the grant of loans in the world of banking.<br><br>The Ombudsman also based his dismissal of the complaint on claims that standard banking procedures were followed.&nbsp; Again, such claims should be presented and proved before the trial court who would have an opportunity to discern from testimony and other pieces of evidence the usual practice in the processing of loan applications and whether this was complied with.<br><br>The Committee and private respondents present conflicting accounts on whether the subject loan was undercollateralized.&nbsp; While private respondents point to several first mortgages on both real and personal property, the Committee claims that not all the items identified as collaterals actually exist.&nbsp; What is more, the securities originally promised were allegedly never put up.&nbsp; Clearly, these conflicting claims of the Committee and private respondents should be resolved in a full-blown trial.<br><br>Private respondents Romualdezes balk at their being branded as cronies.&nbsp; They insist that they are only distant nephews of former First Lady Imelda Marcos.&nbsp; This is irrelevant.&nbsp; Cronies need not even be distant relatives of the Marcoses.&nbsp; It is of no consequence that they are merely distant nephews. They may, indeed, not be nephews at all yet still be cronies.&nbsp; Again, these are things that should be threshed out during trial.<br><br>At any rate, there is no need for the presence of all the enumerated characteristics of a behest loan under Memorandum Order No. 61.&nbsp; A few will suffice.&nbsp; From their investigation, the Committee found that there exist several markers of a behest loan: undercapitalization, undercollateralization, extraordinary speed in loan release as well as the possibility that the incorporators and principal officers of Agretronics were cronies.<br><br>It is argued, however, that the Ombudsman's findings should be respected.&nbsp; It is true that the Ombudsman decides whether probable cause exists.&nbsp; But while respondent Ombudsman asks that We respect his findings, it behooves said official to accord also a proper modicum of respect towards the expertise of the Committee, which was formed precisely to determine the existence of behest loans.<br><br>Findings of facts of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise are afforded great weight by the courts.&nbsp; Absent a substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are conclusive, and in the interest of stability of the governmental structure, should not be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Considering the membership of the Committee, its recommendation should be given great weight as they are undoubtedly experts in the field of banking.&nbsp; The Committee boasts of representatives from the Department of Finance, the Philippine National Bank, the Asset Privatization Trust, the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation and even the DBP itself.&nbsp; By reason of their special knowledge and expertise, the Committee is in a better position to determine whether standard banking practice were, indeed, followed in the approval of a loan or what would generally constitute as sufficient security for a given loan.<br><br>The Ombudsman also found that there is no evidence of damage to the government as a result of the transaction between Agretronics and DBP.<br><br>That is absurd. The resulting damage to the government of Agretronics' transaction with DBP is clear.&nbsp; As of June 1986, Agretronics' total obligation to the DBP amounted to around P154,969,000.00.&nbsp; Upon foreclosure and sale of the remaining assets of Agretronics, the government only realized the measly sum of around P1,942,000.00.&nbsp; The fact that the loan was not paid back is, by itself, enough evidence of damage to the government.<br><br>Probable cause is not an opaque concept in our jurisdiction.&nbsp; Continuing accretions of case law reiterate that they are facts and circumstances which would lead <i>a reasonably discreet and prudent man </i>to believe that an offense has been committed by the persons involved.&nbsp; Other jurisdictions utilize the term <i>man of reasonable caution </i>or the term <i>ordinarily prudent and cautious man</i>.<br><br>Petitioner Committee, with its members from the banking sector, is in a better position to determine that the loan bears the earmarks of a behest loan.<br><br>To reiterate, probable cause need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt.&nbsp; Neither is it based on evidence establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt or on evidence establishing absolute certainty of guilt.&nbsp; It simply implies probability of guilt and requires more than bare suspicion but less than evidence which would justify a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; A finding of probable cause need only rest on evidence showing that <i>more likely than not </i>a crime has been committed and was committed by the suspects..<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> There is clearly probable cause here for the suspects to stand trial.<br><br><b><i>Offense charged has not prescribed.</i></b><br><br>The Ombudsman also grounded his dismissal of petitioner's complaint on the supposed prescription of the offense.<br><br>Again, the Ombudsman is mistaken.&nbsp; The offense charged has not prescribed.&nbsp; The reckoning point for the prescriptive period of offenses in relation to R.A. No. 3019 is well-settled.&nbsp; In the 1999 case of <i>Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> it was ruled that:<br><blockquote>It was well-nigh impossible for the State, the aggrieved party, to have known the violations of R.A. No. 3019 at the time the questioned transactions were made because, as alleged, the public officials concerned connived or conspired with the "beneficiaries of the loans." Thus, we agree with the COMMITTEE that the prescriptive period for the offenses with which the respondents in OMB-0-96-0968 were charged should be computed from the discovery of the commission thereof and not from the day of such commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>The ruling was echoed in 2001 in another <i>Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Ombudsman Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where the Court explained:<br><blockquote>In cases involving violations of R.A. No. 3019 committed prior to the February 1986 EDSA Revolution that ousted President Ferdinand E. Marcos, we ruled that the government as the aggrieved party could not have known of the violations at the time the questioned transactions were made.&nbsp; Moreover, no person would have dared to question the legality of those transactions.
