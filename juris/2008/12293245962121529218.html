("<i>binaboy niya ako</i>").  She felt afraid of getting pregnant by her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>AAA revealed that despite the series of rapes, she did not get pregnant because appellant would let her drink some medicine on the pretext of giving her "vitamins."  The medicines were given to her two (2) to five (5) days after being ravished.<sup style="color:

by Dr. Manuel Aves on February 8, 1998, upon the request of the Chief of Police of Malolos.<br><br>Dr. Aves, the medico-legal officer of the Bulacan Provincial Crime Laboratory Office, prepared a

positions.<br><br>During his testimony, Dr. Aves explained that AAA probably sustained her lacerations around seven (7) to ten (10) days prior to the examination.  However, he did not rule out the possibility that these lacerations were sustained as early as 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>CCC, who is FFF's sister,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> testified that AAA went to her house on the morning of February 2, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> She found this unusual because she was not close to AAA.  After eating her breakfast, AAA went to her room and started crying.  When asked what was wrong, AAA told her that her body and vagina were aching.  After further prodding, AAA revealed that she was raped by her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>BBB, AAA's maternal grandmother,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> testified that sometime in February 1998, AAA got sick.  She

accepted or tolerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  When AAA was already cooperative, he asked her what she went through.  She replied that she was raped by her father.<sup

arrived there, she heard three (3) of her aunts asking AAA about their father. AAA just replied "yes, yes" to the questions of her aunts.  AAA was later brought to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>GGG also claimed that she is very close to AAA.  They would divulge their secrets to one another, including even their resentment towards their parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  AAA never revealed to her that their father made advances to her.  In fact, according to GGG, appellant was very good to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  He treated them equally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>HHH, on the other hand, claimed that from 1996 up to June 1997, she noticed that AAA had sleepless nights and kept walking around.  She heard that AAA was under the spell of dwarves ("<i>nadudwende</i>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  On March 15, 1997, AAA was treated by a local quack doctor.  The doctor asked BBB, CCC, and FFF to exit the house.

Their father would always give AAA pieces of advice ("<i>pinangangaralan</i>"), but AAA would instead get angry with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>FFF testified that her daughter AAA got sick in January 1997.  This lasted till March of that year.  AAA had difficulty menstruating, had sleepless nights and was constantly walking around for about one (1) week.  AAA would tell her that she wanted to leave their house and that someone was calling her name.  AAA also revealed to her that she was "<i>naduwende</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>AAA was brought to a lady quack doctor.  When this did not prove effective, BBB summoned another medicine man who treated AAA the whole day of March 15, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  He brought AAA inside the room and asked them to leave and close the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  FFF heard AAA scream on both occasions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  She did not ask the doctor why AAA screamed while being treated because she trusted him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>That evening, AAA was not her usual self so they brought her again to the same doctor.  After the treatment, FFF noticed that AAA got well because she was already menstruating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  FFF remembered that the said doctor asked her once to lift her shirt.  He said that there was air in her breasts.  He fondled her breasts and told her that he would suck the air out of them.  FFF refused.<br><br>FFF  revealed  that  she and  her sister CCC are at odds because she sold a parcel of land inherited from their mother, without her knowledge and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Appellant, for his part, denied the charges of rape levelled against him by AAA. He claimed that AAA collapsed in their house on January 3, 1997.  Her sickness lasted from January 3, 1997 until mid-April, 1997.  She had sleepless nights and she kept on walking around.  She was calling names that nobody recognized, like the name "Jolina."<br><br>Because of her condition, AAA was treated by no less than ten (10) local doctors.

view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (4) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

charged for the rape on this date.  AAA's testimony on the first rape, nonetheless, provided the springboard for the prosecution in painting a complete picture  of  the  other rapes committed by appellant against her.  Thus, AAA narrated that appellant violated her again sometime on (1) <u>February 1997</u>, (2) <u>April 1997</u>, (3) <u>June 1997</u>, (4) <u>August 1997</u>, (5) <u>September 1997</u>, and (6) <u>November 1997</u>.  These succeeding rapes occurred under similar circumstances as the first rape, except that they would normally last for five (5) minutes.  As vividly recounted

the presence of her two (2)  younger brothers DDD and EEE, while the latter were sleeping, is not improbable.<br><br>Lust is no respecter of time and place.  This Court has repeatedly held that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises and even inside a house where there are other occupants or where other members of the family are also sleeping.  Thus, it is an accepted rule in criminal law that rape may be committed even when the rapist and the victim are not alone.  Fact is, rape may even be committed in the same room while the rapist's spouse is asleep, or in a small room where other family members also sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>We now come to the defenses hoisted by appellant in his attempt at exculpation.<br><br><b>First</b>, appellant avers that the testimony of AAA lacks the elements of truthfulness and does not inspire belief.  Her narration regarding her alleged ordeal sounds too perfect.  They are uniform with no variations at all.<br><br>We agree with the CA observation that the fact that appellant committed the rapes on AAA at dawn  in  the same manner  and  under  the same circumstances bespeak his evil intention to consummate his crime in the most disingenuous manner.  Appellant lost no time in ravishing AAA to satisfy his libido in the wee  hours  of the  morning after bringing his wife FFF to the bus station.  He knew too well that his other children would still be fast asleep at that time and, thus, he would be able to commit his nefarious acts with impunity.<br><br><b><i>Findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses are matters  best  left  to the trial court</i></b>.  What militates against the claim of appellant  is  the  time-honored  rule that the findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses  are  matters best left to the trial court.  The trial court has the unique position of having observed  that  elusive  and  incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts.  Only the trial judge can observe the furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath - all of which are useful aids for an accurate determination of a witness' honesty and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case, the trial court's assessment must be respected, for it had the opportunity to observe the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying and to detect if they were lying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>After a careful review of the records, We find nothing that would impel Us to reverse the trial court's calibration of AAA's credibility.  As the trial court observed, although there were times when she took a little time to answer, this was more due to shyness and hesitation to be so brutally frank than the trepidation of a prevaricator.<br><br>Indeed, AAA testified in a categorical, straightforward, and consistent manner even in the face of a tedious and grueling cross-examination.  Her testimony, bearing badges of truth, is sufficient to establish appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crimes charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  AAA's testimony gives no impression whatsoever that her testimony is a mere fabrication.  If her story had only been contrived, she would not have been so composed and consistent throughout her testimony in the face of intense and lengthy interrogation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><b><i>Positive identification prevails over self-serving denial/alibi</i></b>.  Appellant's denial cannot prevail over AAA's positive identification of him as the one who repeatedly raped her.  Positive identification of the accused, when categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying, should prevail over the alibi and denial of appellant whose testimony  is  not  substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.  Such denial and alibi are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of any weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>This Court cannot agree with the theory raised by the defense that AAA implicated appellant because she was under the spell of dwarves.  Such claim, besides being in the realm  of  the  paranormal, is not supported by evidence.<br><br>On the contrary, what is extant in the records is the testimony of Dr. Jose Soriano of the NCMH on his treatment of AAA.  He testified that when he first treated AAA on October 2, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> she manifested on and off symptoms of mood disorder classified as Bipolar I, a syndrome characterized by elevated, expansive or irritable mood for at least a week or less.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  According to Dr. Soriano, this is caused by a highly traumatic event that the patient could no longer accept or tolerate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> which contained his psychiatric evaluation of AAA, Dr. Soriano stated that AAA had been doing well as a third year high school student until sometime in January 1997.  Dr. Soriano also testified that the behavior manifested by AAA could not have been due to suggestions from other people because there was consistency in her stories.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>It is worth noting that Dr. Soriano's medical finding on the date when AAA manifested symptoms of mood disorder <i>does not run counter</i> to AAA's account that appellant started raping her sometime in December 1996.  As correctly pointed out by the CA, the only logical conclusion that can be drawn on AAA's mood disorder is that she found the series of rapes committed against her too traumatic and unbearable to the point that it affected her mental condition.<br><br>Nor can We agree with appellant's theory that it was the male quack doctor who raped AAA because both of them were locked up in a room and AAA was heard screaming while being treated.  On rebuttal, BBB testified that she and FFF were present when that particular doctor was treating AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>  It was thus not probable that it was the doctor who raped her granddaughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Appellant's argument that he was being framed by BBB and CCC because of family conflicts is a flimsy excuse.  It is highly improbable that AAA would accuse appellant, her own father at that, of so serious a crime as rape, if it were not the truth.  In any case, revenge or feud  has  never swayed this Court from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor, who remained steadfast in her testimony that she was raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br><b>Second</b>, appellant argues that if AAA was, indeed, raped, the prosecution failed to prove the presence of force or intimidation that accompanied the rapes. There is also no evidence showing that he had moral ascendancy over her.<br><br>Contrary to appellant's contention, the records show that he employed force and/or intimidation when he repeatedly raped his daughter.<br><br>AAA testified that when appellant raped her in February 1997, he slapped her and covered her mouth when she attempted to shout.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>  Appellant also threatened to kill her if  she would tell anybody what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>  The same threat was made when he raped her in April 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>  He slapped her face while raping her in June 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>  He again slapped her while raping her in September 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>  This he did again when he raped his daughter on November 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Be that as it may, appellant did not have to employ force or intimidation on AAA to be convicted of rape.<br><br>It is a hornbook doctrine that in the incestuous rape of a  minor, actual force or intimidation need not even be employed where the overpowering moral influence of the father would suffice. The moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim into submission to his beastly desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>  One should bear in mind that in incestuous rape, the minor victim is at a great disadvantage.  The assailant, by his overpowering and overbearing moral influence, can easily consummate his bestial lust with impunity.  As a consequence, proof of force and violence is unnecessary, unlike when the accused is not an ascendant or a blood relative of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>  The reason for this rule was explained in <i>People v. Chua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><i> </i>through now Mr. Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, in this manner:<br><blockquote>In Philippine society, the father is considered the head of the family, and the children are taught not to defy the father's authority even when this is abused.  They are taught to respect the sanctity of marriage and  to  value  the family above everything else.  Hence, when the abuse begins, the victim sees no reason or need to question the righteousness of the father whom she had trusted right from the start.  The value of respect and obedience to parents instilled among Filipino children is transferred into the very same value that exposes them to risks of exploitation by their own parents.  The sexual relationship could begin so subtly that the child does not realize that it is abnormal. Physical force then becomes unnecessary. The perpetrator takes full advantage of this blood relationship.  Most daughters cooperate and this is one reason why they suffer tremendous guilt later on. It is almost impossible for a daughter to reject her father's advances, for children seldom question what grown-ups tell them to do.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>The instant case is no exception.  Appellant took advantage of his overpowering moral and physical ascendancy to unleash his lechery upon his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br><b>Third</b>, appellant asseverates that the claim of AAA that she was raped once in almost every month is impossible, contrary to reason, ridiculous, and unbelievable.  If lust is no respecter of time and place, he could have raped AAA every day of each month, or even thrice in the first month, maybe ten (10) times in the second month, twice in the third month, six (6) times in the fourth month, thirty (30) times in the fifth month, and so on and so forth.  While menstruation for women comes once in a month, libido or lust for men subsists every second, minute, hour, and day.  Appellant also draws Our attention to his weight and build compared to those of AAA.  He posits that it would have been impossible for him to rape her a second time, since she could be dead after the first alleged raped.<br><br>The hypothetical and self-serving nature of the assertions of appellant destroys their viability.  They beg for a conclusion without providing the premises which, whether from behavioral science or from settled jurisprudence, would support his claim of improbabilities.  Only appellant can give the answer to his own assumptions.  Sad to say, he did not present any during the trial.  While We can hazard some rationalizations, We decline from doing so lest We also be guilty of speculation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br><b>Fourth</b>, appellant repeatedly points to the August 29, 2002 letter of AAA to then Mr. Justice  (later Chief Justice)  Hilario Davide, Jr. withdrawing her accusations against him.  Our attention is also called to the letters dated March 14, 2008 purportedly written by AAA, GGG, and FFF.  All the letters declare, <i>inter alia</i>, that appellant is innocent; that AAA was not really raped; that her accusations were mere fabrications due to the prodding of her aunt CCC who had a land dispute with FFF; and that AAA had a mental illness and/or was afflicted with a paranormal condition at that time.  Appellant also submitted the November 2, 2006 Medical Abstract issued by the Bureau of Corrections, New Bilibid Prison Hospital, Muntinlupa City, stating that appellant is suffering from numerous illnesses, namely: (a) Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, uncontrolled; (b) Hypertension; (c) Diabetic Nephropathy; (d) Dyslipidemia; and (e) Hyperuricemia, plus the Certification dated March 14, 2008 issued by the RTC in Malolos, Bulacan, stating that appellant has no pending criminal case except Criminal Case Nos. 1541-M-98 to 1547-M-98.<br><br>There is no concrete proof that AAA, GGG, and FFF, indeed, wrote the said letters.  And if it were the case, whether or not they wrote them freely and voluntarily.  More than that, the purported letters were never introduced as evidence before the trial court.  They are hearsay. They are not even under oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>  To admit the letters would not only violate the rules of evidence, but the elementary rules of due process of law and fair play.<br><br>Admitting the letters would also set a dangerous precedent.  There would be no end to litigation.  All that a losing party would do is to obtain the necessary desistance from the winning party after trial has ended and raise it on appeal.  Of course, We do not foreclose the possibility that there may be instances when such would be meritorious.  That, however, is not the case here.<br><br>It is possible that AAA, GGG, and FFF may, indeed, have written the letters but, to Our mind, the motive was more out of pity for appellant.  It is not an unnatural behavior for rape victims to be angry at first with their ravisher, but feel pity after, more so in the instant case where the culprit is the victim's own father.  It should not also be forgotten that GGG and FFF testified for the defense during the trial.  Thus, their motive becomes suspect.<br><br>In other words, the letters cannot prevail over the evidence presented during the trial, especially the testimonies of AAA, Dr. Aves, and Dr. Soriano, who withstood rigorous cross-examination from the defense panel.<br><br>The medical abstract and certification also deserve scant consideration.  They are irrelevant and immaterial as far as the claim of innocence of appellant is concerned.  We also note that appellant secured the medical abstract in order "[t]o support his petition for Executive Clemency."  That is an implied admission of guilt.<br><br><b>Fifth</b>, appellant claims that the CA erred in not dismissing the case on the ground that BBB had no authority to assist AAA in filing the charges against him, because FFF is still alive.  He buttresses his stance by citing Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 344. <i>Prosecution of the crimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape, and acts of lasciviousness</i>. - x x x<i> </i><br><br>The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape, or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, <u>grandparents</u>, or guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named persons, as the case may be. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It is patent that this provision was enacted out of consideration for the offended woman and her family who might prefer to suffer the outrage in silence rather than go through with the scandal of a public trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>  In the instant case, BBB, the <u>grandmother</u>, assisted AAA in the filing of the complaints for multiple rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>  More than that, AAA could not have relied on her mother FFF to assist her in filing the charges against appellant.  FFF was not concerned at all with what had befallen her daughter.  BBB testified that she called up FFF after learning of the revelation of AAA to one of the local doctors who treated her that she was raped by appellant, but FFF did not bother to come to her house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>  FFF's lack of concern for her own daughter was all the more confirmed when she testified for the defense during trial.<br><br>Be that as it may, AAA could actually have been assisted by anybody.  R.A.
