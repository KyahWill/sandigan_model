				<BR><STRONG>REYES, R.T., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">THIS case portrays the peculiar story of an international flight steward who was dismissed because of his failure to adhere to the weight standards of the airline company.<br><br>He is  now before this Court via a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> claiming that he was illegally dismissed. To buttress his stance, he argues that (1) his dismissal does not fall under 282(e) of the Labor Code; (2) continuing adherence to the weight standards of the company is not a bona fide occupational qualification; and (3) he was discriminated against <br> because other overweight employees were promoted instead of being disciplined.<br><br>After a meticulous consideration of all arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,  We uphold the legality of dismissal.  Separation pay, however, should be awarded in favor of the employee as an act of social justice or  based on equity.  This is so because his dismissal is not for serious misconduct.  Neither is it reflective of his moral character.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Petitioner Armando G. Yrasuegui  was  a  former <u>international flight steward</u> of Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL).  He stands five feet and eight inches (5'8") with a large body frame.  The proper weight for a man of his height and body structure is from 147 to 166 pounds, <u>the ideal weight being 166 pounds</u>, as mandated by the Cabin and Crew Administration Manual<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of PAL.<br><br>The weight problem of petitioner dates back to 1984.  Back then, PAL advised him to go on an extended vacation leave from December 29, 1984 to March 4, 1985 to address his weight concerns.  Apparently, petitioner failed to meet the company's weight standards,  prompting  another  leave  without pay from March 5, 1985 to November 1985.<br><br>After meeting the required weight, petitioner was allowed to return to work. But petitioner's weight problem recurred.  He again went on leave without pay from October 17, 1988 to February 1989.<br><br>On April 26, 1989, petitioner weighed <u>209 pounds</u>, 43 pounds over his ideal weight.  In line with company policy, he was removed from flight duty effective May 6, 1989 to July 3, 1989.  He was formally requested to trim down to his ideal weight and report for weight checks on several dates.  He was  also  told  that he  may  avail of  the services of the company physician should he wish to do so.  He was advised that his case will be evaluated on July 3, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On February 25, 1989, petitioner underwent weight check.  It was discovered that he gained, instead of losing, weight.  He was overweight at <u>215 pounds</u>, which is 49 pounds beyond the limit.  Consequently, his off-duty status was retained.<br><br>On October 17, 1989, PAL Line Administrator Gloria Dizon personally visited petitioner at his residence to check on the progress of his effort to lose weight.  Petitioner weighed <u>217 pounds</u>, gaining 2 pounds from his previous weight.  After the visit, petitioner made a commitment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to reduce weight in a letter addressed to Cabin Crew Group Manager Augusto Barrios.  The letter, in full, reads:<br><blockquote>Dear Sir:<br><br>I would like to guaranty my commitment towards a weight loss from<u> 217 pounds</u> to <u>200 pounds </u>from today until 31 Dec. 1989.<br><br>From thereon, I promise to continue reducing at a reasonable percentage until such time that my ideal weight is achieved.<br><br>Likewise, I promise to personally report to your office at the designated time schedule you will set for my weight check.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 160px;">Respectfully Yours,<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 160px;">F/S Armando Yrasuegui<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Despite the lapse of a ninety-day period given him to reach his ideal weight, petitioner remained overweight.  On January 3, 1990, he was informed of the PAL decision for him to remain grounded until such time that he satisfactorily complies with the weight standards.  Again, he was directed to report every two weeks for weight checks.<br><br>Petitioner failed to report for weight checks.  Despite that, he was given one more month to comply with the weight requirement.  As usual, he was asked to report for weight check on different dates.  He was reminded that his grounding would continue pending satisfactory compliance with the weight standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Again, petitioner failed to report for weight checks, although he was seen submitting his passport for processing at the PAL Staff Service Division.<br><br>On April 17, 1990, petitioner was formally warned that a repeated refusal to report for weight check would be dealt with accordingly.  He was given another set of weight check dates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Again, petitioner ignored the directive and did not report for weight checks.  On June 26, 1990, petitioner was required to explain his refusal to undergo weight checks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>When petitioner tipped the scale on July 30, 1990, he weighed at <u>212 pounds</u>.  Clearly, he was still way over his ideal weight of 166 pounds.<br><br>From then on, nothing was heard from petitioner until he followed up his case requesting for leniency on the latter part of 1992.  He weighed at <u>219 pounds</u> on August 20, 1992 and <u>205 pounds</u> on November 5, 1992.<br><br>On November 13, 1992, PAL finally served petitioner a Notice of Administrative Charge for violation of company standards on weight requirements. He was given ten (10) days from receipt of the charge within which to file his answer and submit controverting evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On December 7, 1992, petitioner submitted his Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  Notably, he did not deny being overweight.  What he claimed, instead, is that his violation,  if any,  had already been condoned by PAL since "no action has been taken by the company" regarding his case "since 1988."  He also claimed that PAL discriminated against him because "the company has not been fair in treating the cabin crew members who are similarly situated."<br><br>On December 8, 1992, a clarificatory hearing was held where petitioner manifested that he was undergoing a weight reduction program to lose at least two (2) pounds per week so as to attain his ideal weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On June 15, 1993, petitioner was formally informed by PAL that due to his inability to attain his ideal weight, "and considering the utmost leniency" extended to him "which spanned a period covering a total of almost five (5) years," his services were considered terminated "effective immediately."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>His motion for reconsideration having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against PAL.<br><br><center><b>Labor Arbiter, NLRC and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On November 18, 1998, Labor Arbiter Valentin C. Reyes ruled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that petitioner was illegally dismissed.  The dispositive part of the Arbiter ruling runs as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered, declaring the complainant's dismissal illegal, and ordering the respondent to reinstate him to his former position or substantially equivalent one, and to pay him:<br><ol type="a"><li>Backwages of Php10,500.00 per month from his dismissal on June 15, 1993 until reinstated, which for purposes of appeal is hereby set from June 15, 1993 up to August 15, 1998 at P651,000.00;<br><br></li><li>Attorney's fees of five percent (5%) of the total award.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The Labor Arbiter held that the weight standards of PAL are reasonable in view of the nature of the job of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  However, the weight standards need not be complied with under pain of dismissal since his weight did not hamper the performance of his duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Assuming that it did, petitioner could be transferred to other positions where his weight would not be a negative factor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Notably, other overweight employees, i.e., Mr. Palacios, Mr. Cui, and Mr. Barrios, were promoted instead of being disciplined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Both parties appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On October 8, 1999, the Labor Arbiter issued a writ of execution directing the reinstatement of petitioner without loss of seniority rights and other benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On February 1, 2000, the Labor Arbiter denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Motion to Quash Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of PAL.<br><br>On March 6, 2000, PAL appealed the denial of its motion to quash to the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On June 23, 2000,  the  NLRC  rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  in  the  following tenor:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered[,] the Decision of the Arbiter dated  18 November 1998 as modified by our findings herein, is hereby A<b>FFIRMED </b>and that part of the dispositive portion of said decision concerning complainant's entitlement to backwages shall be deemed to refer to complainant's entitlement to his full backwages,<u> inclusive of allowances and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent</u> instead of simply backwages, from date of dismissal until his actual reinstatement or finality hereof. Respondent is enjoined to manifests (<i>sic</i>) its choice of the form of the reinstatement of complainant, whether physical or through payroll within ten (10) days from notice failing which, the same shall be deemed as complainant's reinstatement through payroll and execution in case of non-payment shall accordingly be issued by the Arbiter.  Both appeals of respondent thus, are <b>DISMISSED </b>for utter lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>According to the NLRC, "obesity, or the tendency to gain weight uncontrollably regardless of the amount of food intake, is a disease in itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  As a consequence, there can be no intentional defiance or serious misconduct by petitioner to the lawful order of PAL for him to lose weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Like the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC found the weight standards of PAL to be reasonable.  However, it found as unnecessary the Labor Arbiter holding that petitioner was not remiss in the performance of his duties as flight steward despite being overweight.  According to the NLRC, the Labor Arbiter should have limited himself  to  the  issue of  whether the failure of petitioner to attain his ideal weight constituted willful defiance of the weight standards of PAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>PAL moved for reconsideration to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Thus, PAL elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals (CA) via a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>By Decision dated August 31, 2004, the CA reversed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the NLRC:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, we hereby GRANT the petition.  The assailed NLRC decision is declared NULL and VOID and is hereby SET ASIDE. The private respondent's complaint is hereby DISMISSED.  No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA opined that there was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC because it "looked at wrong and irrelevant considerations"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> in evaluating the evidence of  the parties.  Contrary to the NLRC ruling, the weight standards of PAL are meant to be a <u>continuing qualification</u> for an employee's position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  The failure to adhere to the weight standards is an <u>analogous cause</u> for the dismissal of an employee under Article 282(e) of the Labor Code in relation to Article 282(a).  It is not willful disobedience as the NLRC seemed to suggest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Said the CA, "the element of willfulness that the NLRC decision cites is an irrelevant consideration in arriving at a conclusion on  whether the dismissal is legally proper."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  In other words, "the relevant question to ask is not one of willfulness but one of reasonableness of the standard and whether or not the employee qualifies or continues to qualify under this standard."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Just like the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, the CA held that the weight standards of PAL are reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  Thus, petitioner was legally dismissed because he repeatedly failed to meet the prescribed weight standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  It is obvious that the issue of discrimination was only invoked by petitioner for purposes of escaping the result of his dismissal for being overweight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On May 10, 2005, the CA denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  Elaborating on its earlier ruling, the CA held that the weight standards of PAL are a <u>bona fide occupational qualification</u> which, in case of violation, "justifies an employee's separation from the service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>In this Rule 45 petition for review, the following issues are posed for resolution:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br><u>WHETHER OR NOT</u> THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT <u>PETITIONER'S OBESITY CAN BE A GROUND FOR DISMISSAL UNDER PARAGRAPH (e) OF ARTICLE 282 OF THE LABOR CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES;</u><br><br><center>II.<br></center><br><u>WHETHER OR NOT</u> THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT <u>PETITIONER'S DISMISSAL FOR OBESITY CAN BE PREDICATED ON THE "BONA FIDE OCCUPATIONAL QUALIFICATION (BFOQ) DEFENSE"</u>;<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br><u>WHETHER OR NOT</u> THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT <u>PETITIONER WAS NOT UNDULY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHEN HE WAS DISMISSED WHILE OTHER OVERWEIGHT CABIN ATTENDANTS WERE EITHER GIVEN FLYING DUTIES OR PROMOTED;</u><br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br><u>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT BRUSHED ASIDE PETITIONER'S CLAIMS FOR REINSTATEMENT [AND] WAGES ALLEGEDLY FOR BEING MOOT AND ACADEMIC.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br><b>I.  The obesity of petitioner is a ground for dismissal under Article 282(e)</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <b>of the Labor Code</b>.<br><br>A reading of the weight standards of PAL would lead to no other conclusion than that they constitute a continuing qualification of an employee in order to keep the job.  Tersely put, an employee may be dismissed the moment he is unable to comply with his ideal weight as prescribed by the weight standards.  The dismissal of the employee would thus fall under Article 282(e) of the Labor Code.  As explained by the CA:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he standards violated in this case were not mere "orders" of the employer; they were the "prescribed weights" that a cabin crew must maintain <b><i>in order to qualify for and keep his or her position in the company</i></b>.  In other words, they were standards that establish <b><i>continuing qualifications </i></b>for an employee's position.  In this sense, the failure to maintain these standards does not fall under Article 282(a) whose express terms require the element of willfulness in order to be a ground for dismissal.  The failure to meet the employer's <b><i>qualifying standards</i></b> is in fact a ground that does not squarely fall under grounds (a) to (d) and is therefore one that falls under Article 282(e) - the "other causes analogous to the foregoing."<br><br>By its nature, these "qualifying standards" are norms that apply <b><i>prior to and after </i></b>an employee is hired.  They apply <b><i>prior to employment </i></b>because these are the standards a job applicant must initially meet in order to be hired.  They apply <b><i>after hiring </i></b>because an employee must continue to meet these standards while on the job in order to keep his job.  Under this perspective, a violation is not one of the faults for which an employee can be dismissed pursuant to pars. (a) to (d) of Article 282; the employee can be dismissed simply because he no longer "qualifies" for his job irrespective of whether or not the failure to qualify was willful or intentional.  x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner, though, advances a very interesting argument.  He claims that obesity is a "physical abnormality and/or illness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Relying on <i>Nadura</i><i> v. Benguet Consolidated, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> he says his dismissal is illegal:<br><blockquote>Conscious of the fact that Nadura's case cannot be made to fall squarely  within the specific causes enumerated in subparagraphs 1(a) to (e), Benguet invokes the provisions of subparagraph 1(f) and says that Nadura's illness - occasional attacks of asthma - is a cause analogous to them.<br><br>Even a cursory reading of the legal provision under consideration is sufficient to convince anyone that, as the trial court said, "illness cannot be included as an analogous cause by any stretch of imagination."<br><br>It is clear that, except the<i> just cause </i>mentioned in sub-paragraph 1(a), all the others expressly enumerated in the law are due to the voluntary and/or willful act of the employee.  How Nadura's illness could be considered as "analogous" to any of them is beyond our understanding, there being no claim or pretense that the same was contracted through his own voluntary act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>The reliance on <i>Nadura</i> is off-tangent.  The factual milieu in <i>Nadura </i>is substantially different from the case at bar.  <u>First</u>,<i> Nadura</i> was not decided under the Labor Code.  The law applied in that case was Republic Act (RA) No. 1787.  <u>Second</u>, the issue of flight safety is absent in <i>Nadura</i>, thus, the rationale there cannot apply here.  <u>Third</u>, in<i> Nadura</i>, the employee who was a miner, was laid off from work because of illness, i.e., asthma.  Here, petitioner was dismissed for his failure to meet the weight standards of PAL.  He was not dismissed due to illness.  <u>Fourth</u>, the issue in<i> Nadura</i> is whether or not  the dismissed employee is entitled to separation pay and damages.  Here, the issue centers on the propriety of the dismissal of petitioner for his failure to meet the weight standards of PAL.  <u>Fifth</u>, in <i>Nadura</i>, the employee was not accorded due process. Here, petitioner was accorded utmost leniency. He was given more than four (4) years to comply with the weight standards of PAL.<br><br>In the case at bar, the evidence on record militates against petitioner's claims that obesity is a disease.  That he was able to reduce his weight from 1984 to 1992 clearly shows that it is possible for him to lose weight given the proper attitude, determination, and self-discipline.  Indeed, during the clarificatory hearing on December 8, 1992, petitioner himself claimed that "[t]he issue is could I bring my weight down to ideal weight which is 172, then the answer is yes. I can do it now."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>True, petitioner claims that reducing weight is costing him "a lot of expenses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> However, petitioner has only himself to blame.  He could have easily availed the assistance of the company physician, per the advice of PAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> He chose to ignore the suggestion.  In fact, he repeatedly failed to report when required to undergo weight checks, without offering a valid explanation.  Thus, his fluctuating weight indicates absence of willpower rather than an illness.<br><br>Petitioner cites <i>Bonnie Cook v. State of </i><i>Rhode Island</i><i>, Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> decided  by  the  United States Court of Appeals (First Circuit).  In that case, Cook worked from 1978 to 1980 and from 1981 to 1986 as an institutional attendant for the mentally retarded at the Ladd Center that was being operated by respondent.  She twice resigned voluntarily with an unblemished record.  Even respondent admitted that her performance met the Center's legitimate expectations.  In 1988, Cook re-applied for a similar position.  At that time, "she stood 5'2" tall and weighed over 320 pounds."  Respondent claimed that the morbid obesity of plaintiff compromised her ability to evacuate patients in case of emergency and it also put her at greater risk of serious diseases.<br><br>Cook contended that the action of respondent amounted to discrimination on the basis of a handicap.  This was in direct violation of Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> which incorporates the remedies contained in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Respondent claimed, however, that morbid obesity could never constitute a handicap within the purview of the Rehabilitation Act.  Among others, obesity is a mutable condition, thus plaintiff could simply lose weight and rid herself of concomitant disability.<br><br>The appellate Court disagreed and held that morbid obesity is a disability under the Rehabilitation Act and that respondent discriminated against Cook based on "perceived" disability. The evidence included expert testimony that morbid obesity is a physiological disorder.  It involves a dysfunction of both the metabolic system and the neurological appetite - suppressing signal system, which is capable of causing adverse effects within the musculoskeletal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. Notably, the Court stated that "mutability is relevant only in determining the substantiality of the limitation flowing from a given impairment," thus "mutability only precludes those conditions that an individual can easily and quickly reverse by behavioral alteration."<br><br>Unlike Cook, however, <u>petitioner is not morbidly obese</u>.  In the words of the District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Cook was sometime before 1978 "at least one hundred pounds more than what is considered appropriate of her height."  According to the Circuit Judge, Cook weighed "over 320 pounds" in 1988.  Clearly, that is not the case here.  At his heaviest, petitioner was only less than 50 pounds over his ideal weight.<br><br>In fine, We hold that the obesity of petitioner, when placed in the context of his work as flight attendant, becomes an analogous cause under Article 282(e) of the Labor Code that justifies his dismissal from the service.  His obesity may not be unintended, but is nonetheless voluntary.  As the CA correctly puts it, "[v]oluntariness basically means that the just cause is solely attributable to the employee without any external force influencing or controlling his actions.  This element runs through all just causes under Article 282, whether they be in the nature of a wrongful action or omission. Gross and habitual neglect, a recognized just cause, is considered voluntary although it lacks the element of intent found in Article 282(a), (c), and (d)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>II.  The dismissal of petitioner can be predicated on the bona fide occupational qualification defense</b>. <br><br>Employment in particular jobs may not be limited to persons of a particular sex, religion, or national origin unless the employer can show that sex, religion, or national origin is an actual qualification for performing the job. The qualification is called a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  In the United States, there are a few federal and many state job discrimination laws that contain an exception allowing an employer to engage in an otherwise unlawful form of prohibited discrimination when the action is based on a BFOQ necessary to the normal operation of a business or enterprise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that BFOQ is a statutory defense. It does not exist if there is no statute providing for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Further, there is no existing BFOQ statute that could justify his dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Both arguments must fail.<br><br><u>First</u>, the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and RA No. 7277<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> or the Magna Carta for Disabled Persons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> contain provisions similar to BFOQ.<br><br><u>Second</u>, in <i>British Columbia Public Service Employee Commission (BSPSERC) v. The British Columbia Government and Service Employee's Union (BCGSEU)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the so-called "Meiorin Test" in determining whether an employment policy is justified.  Under this test, (1) the employer must show that it adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (2) the employer must establish that the standard is reasonably necessary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> to the accomplishment of that work-related purpose; and (3) the employer must establish that the standard is reasonably necessary in order to accomplish the legitimate work-related purpose. Similarly, in <i>Star Paper Corporation v. Simbol</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this Court held that in order to justify a BFOQ, the employer must prove that (1) the employment qualification is reasonably related to the essential operation of the job involved; and (2) that there is factual basis for believing that all or substantially all persons meeting the qualification would be unable to properly perform the duties of the job.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In short, the test of reasonableness of the company policy is used because it is parallel to BFOQ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>  BFOQ is valid "provided  it  reflects  an inherent quality reasonably necessary for satisfactory job performance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In <i>Duncan Association of Detailman-PTGWTO v. Glaxo Wellcome Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court did not hesitate to pass upon the validity of a company policy which prohibits its employees from marrying employees of a rival company. It was held that the company policy is reasonable considering that its purpose is the protection of the interests of the company against possible competitor infiltration on its trade secrets and procedures.<br><br>Verily, there is no merit to the argument that BFOQ cannot be applied if it has no supporting statute.  Too, the Labor Arbiter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> NLRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> are one in holding that the weight standards of PAL are reasonable.  A common carrier, from the nature of its business and for reasons of public policy, is bound to observe extraordinary diligence for the safety of the passengers it transports.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It is bound to carry its passengers safely as far as human  care  and  foresight can  provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons, with due regard for all the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The law leaves no room for mistake or oversight on the part of a common carrier.  Thus, it is only logical to hold that the weight standards of PAL show its effort to comply with the exacting obligations imposed upon it by law by virtue of being a common carrier.<br><br>The business of PAL is <u>air transportation</u>.  As such, it has committed itself to safely transport its passengers.  In order to achieve this, it must necessarily rely on its employees, most particularly the cabin flight deck crew who are on board the aircraft.  The weight standards of PAL should be viewed as imposing strict norms of discipline upon its employees.<br><br>In other words, the primary objective of PAL in the imposition of the weight standards for cabin crew is <u>flight safety</u>.  It cannot be gainsaid that cabin attendants must maintain agility at all times in order to inspire passenger confidence on their ability to care for the passengers when something goes wrong.  It is not farfetched to say that airline companies, just like all common carriers, thrive due to public confidence on their safety records.  People, especially the riding public, expect no less than that airline companies transport their passengers to their respective destinations safely and soundly.  A lesser performance is unacceptable.<br><br>The task of a cabin crew or flight attendant is not limited to serving meals or attending to the whims and caprices of the passengers.  The most important activity of the cabin crew is to care for the safety of passengers and the evacuation of the aircraft when an emergency occurs.  <u>Passenger safety goes to the core of the job of a cabin attendant</u>.  Truly, airlines need cabin attendants who have the necessary strength to open emergency doors, the agility to attend to passengers in cramped working conditions, and the stamina to withstand grueling flight schedules.<br><br>On board an aircraft, the body weight and size of a cabin attendant are important factors to consider in case of emergency.  Aircrafts have constricted cabin space, and narrow aisles and exit doors.  Thus, the arguments of respondent that  "[w]hether the airline's flight attendants are overweight or not has no direct relation to its mission of transporting passengers to their destination"; and that the weight standards "has nothing to do with airworthiness of respondent's airlines," must fail.<br><br>The rationale in <i>Western Air Lines v. Criswell</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><i> </i>relied upon by petitioner cannot apply to his case.  What was involved there were two (2) airline pilots who were denied reassignment as flight engineers upon reaching the age of 60, and a flight engineer who was forced to retire at age 60.  They sued the airline company, alleging that the age-60 retirement for flight engineers violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.<u> Age-based BFOQ and being overweight are not the same</u>.  The case of overweight cabin attendants is another matter.  Given the cramped cabin space and narrow aisles and emergency exit doors of the airplane, any overweight cabin attendant would certainly have difficulty navigating the cramped cabin area.<br><br>In short, there is no need to individually evaluate their ability to perform their task.  That an obese cabin attendant occupies more space than a slim one is an unquestionable fact which courts can judicially recognize without introduction of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It would also be absurd to require airline companies to reconfigure the aircraft in order to widen the aisles and exit doors just to accommodate overweight cabin attendants like petitioner.<br><br>The biggest problem with an overweight cabin attendant is the possibility of impeding passengers from evacuating the aircraft, should the occasion call for it.  The job of a cabin attendant during emergencies is to speedily get the passengers out of the aircraft safely.  <u>Being overweight necessarily impedes mobility</u>.  Indeed, <u>in an emergency situation, seconds are what cabin attendants are dealing with, not minutes</u>.  Three lost seconds can translate into three lost lives.  Evacuation might slow down just because a wide-bodied cabin attendant is blocking the narrow aisles.  These possibilities are not remote.<br><br>Petitioner is also in estoppel.  He does not dispute that the weight standards of PAL were made known to him prior to his employment.  He is presumed to know the weight limit that he must maintain at all times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In fact, never  did  he  question the  authority of PAL when he was repeatedly asked to trim down his weight.  <i>Bona fides exigit ut quod convenit fiat</i>.  Good faith demands that what is agreed upon shall be done.  <b><i>Kung ang tao ay tapat kanyang tutuparin ang napagkasunduan</i></b>.<br><br>Too, the weight standards of PAL provide for separate weight limitations based on height and body frame for both male and female cabin attendants.  A progressive discipline is imposed to allow non-compliant cabin attendants sufficient opportunity to meet the weight standards.  Thus, the clear-cut rules obviate any possibility for  the commission of abuse or arbitrary action on the part of PAL.<br><br><center><b>III. Petitioner failed to substantiate his claim that he was discriminated against by PAL</b>.<br></center><br>Petitioner next claims that PAL is using passenger safety as a convenient excuse to discriminate against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> We are constrained, however, to hold otherwise. We agree with the CA that "[t]he element of discrimination  came  into play in this case as a secondary position for the private respondent in order to escape the consequence of dismissal that being overweight entailed.  It is a confession-and-avoidance position that impliedly admitted the cause of dismissal, including the reasonableness of the applicable standard and the private respondent's failure to comply."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  It is a basic rule in evidence that each party must prove his affirmative allegation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Since the burden of evidence lies with the party who asserts an affirmative allegation, petitioner has to prove his allegation with particularity.  There is nothing on the records which could support the finding of discriminatory treatment. Petitioner cannot establish discrimination by simply naming the supposed cabin attendants who are allegedly similarly situated with him.  Substantial proof must be shown as to how and why they are similarly situated and the differential treatment petitioner got from PAL despite the similarity of his situation with other employees.<br><br>Indeed, except for pointing out the names of the supposed overweight cabin attendants, petitioner miserably failed to indicate their respective ideal weights; weights over their ideal weights; the periods they were allowed to fly despite their being overweight; the particular flights assigned to them; the discriminating treatment they got from PAL; and other relevant data that could have adequately established a case of discriminatory treatment by PAL.  In the words of the CA, "PAL really had no substantial case of discrimination to meet."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>We are not unmindful that findings of facts of administrative agencies, like the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, are accorded respect, even finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The reason is simple: administrative agencies are experts in matters within their specific and specialized jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> But the principle is not a hard and fast rule.  It only applies if the findings of facts are duly supported by substantial evidence. If it can be shown that administrative bodies grossly misappreciated evidence of such nature so as to compel a conclusion to the contrary, their findings of facts must necessarily be reversed.  Factual findings of administrative agencies do not have infallibility and must be set aside when they fail the test of arbitrariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Here, the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC inexplicably misappreciated evidence.

The claims of petitioner for reinstatement and wages are moot</b>.<br></center><br>As his last contention, petitioner avers that his claims for reinstatement and wages have not been mooted.  He is entitled to reinstatement and his full backwages, "from the time he was illegally dismissed" up to the time that the NLRC was reversed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>At this point, Article 223 of the Labor Code finds relevance:<br><blockquote>In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal.

The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein.<br></blockquote>The law is very clear.  Although an award or order of reinstatement is self-executory and does not require a writ of execution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> the option to exercise actual reinstatement or payroll reinstatement belongs to the employer.  It does not belong to the employee, to the labor tribunals, or even to the courts.<br><br>Contrary to the allegation of petitioner that PAL "did everything under the sun" to frustrate his "immediate return to his previous position,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> there is evidence that PAL opted to physically reinstate him to a substantially equivalent position in accordance with the order of the Labor <br> Arbiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> In fact, petitioner duly received the return to work notice on February 23, 2001, as shown by his signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Petitioner cannot take refuge in the pronouncements of the Court in a case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> that "[t]he unjustified refusal of the employer to reinstate the dismissed employee entitles him to payment of his salaries effective from the time the employer failed to reinstate him despite the issuance of a writ of execution"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> and ""even if the order of reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter is reversed on appeal, it is obligatory on the part of the employer to reinstate and pay the wages of the employee during the period of appeal until reversal by the higher court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> He failed to prove that he complied with the return to work order of PAL.  Neither does it appear on  record  that  he actually rendered services for PAL from the moment he was dismissed, in order to insist on the payment of his full backwages.<br><br>In insisting that he be reinstated to his <u>actual position</u> despite being overweight, petitioner in effect wants to render the issues in the present case moot.  He asks PAL to comply with the impossible.  Time and again, the Court ruled that the law does not exact compliance with the impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br><b>V.  Petitioner is entitled to separation pay</b>.<br><br>Be that as it may, all is not lost for petitioner.<br><br>Normally, a legally dismissed employee is not entitled to separation pay.
