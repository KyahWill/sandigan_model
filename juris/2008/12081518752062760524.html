				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 10 February 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00003 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Gubat, Sorsogon, Branch 54, finding appellant Sammy D. Ramos guilty of four (4) counts of rape but acquitted him of the other 46 charges. Appellant was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count and to pay the victim AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P25,000.00 as moral damages, for every conviction.<br><br>Appellant was charged under Article 335(1) of the Revised Penal Code before the RTC with 50 counts of rape spanning the period of 18 January 1992 to 28 March 1992 against his 13-year old daughter.<br><br>The four charges which are the subject matter of this appeal were docketed as Criminal Cases No. 1770, 1771, 1772 and 1831. The four similarly-worded Informations, except for the dates of commission, contained the following allegations, to wit:<br><blockquote>Criminal Case No. 1770<br><br>That on or about the night of January18, 1992, at Barangay Cogon, Gubat, Sorsogon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, through force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own 12-year old daughter, AAA against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The three other Informations alleged that the rape was committed on 19 January 1992 (Criminal Case No. 1771);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> on 20 January 1992 (Criminal Case No. 1772);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and on 28 March 1992 (Criminal Case No. 1831).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Upon arraignment on 12 February 1993, appellant, assisted by counsel <i>de parte</i>, pleaded not guilty to each count of rape. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thereafter, joint trial on the merits ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>From AAA’s testimony, the prosecution was able to establish the following:<br><br>AAA was born out of wedlock on 5 October 1978 to appellant Sammy Ramos and BBB in Consuelo, Santa Marcela, Kalinga, Apayao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> She grew up in the custody of her mother who was living with her maternal grandparents in Ballesteros, Cagayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It was there that she studied and finished her elementary education from Grade I until Grade V.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Sometime in May of 1991 and after finishing Grade V, she stowed away from her maternal grandparent’s house because her uncle attempted to sexually molest her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Wanting to experience the love and protection of a father, she proceeded to the hometown of her father in Sta. Marcela, Kalinga, Apayao. There, she stayed with her paternal grandmother for a week until she was fetched by her father’s live-in-partner, Maribel Serayda. Maribel Serayda brought AAA to appellant who was then working in Cogon, Gubat, Sorsogon. It was the first time she met her father who worked there as a heavy equipment operator in a construction company allegedly owned by his uncle. While assigned in Sorsogon, AAA’s father lived with his live-in partner in one of the barracks for the company employees. When she arrived, AAA stayed with the couple in the barracks. Appellant allowed AAA to continue her studies and she was enrolled in Grade VI in June 1991. Towards the end of 1991, however, Maribel Serayda left because she could no longer bear the physical abuse done to her by the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> From that time, AAA was left alone with appellant in the barracks. The dwelling had two bedrooms which they separately occupied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 18 January 1992, appellant committed the first act of rape. When AAA went to sleep, at about 3:00 a.m., clad in a duster and a panty underneath, she woke up finding appellant on top of her and holding her breast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He covered her mouth with a blanket and told her not to tell anybody or he would kill her. She tried to extricate herself from the appellant, but the latter proved to be too strong for her. He then removed her panty and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Upon realizing that her struggle to repel appellant from satisfying his bestial desire was coming to naught, AAA began to cry. Appellant switched on the light in the room and turned on the radio. It was from the radio that AAA heard the exact time of the first sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the night of 19 January 1992, appellant repeated what he did to AAA the day before. He again forced himself into her and threatened to kill her if she would tell anybody of the incident. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The following night, 20 January 1992, appellant committed the third rape at the same place. He again stayed on top of her and had sexual intercourse against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As in the previous occassions, she did not report the same because she was afraid of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The molestation&nbsp;continued nightly from 21 January to 28 March 1992, except from February 1 to 14 of 1992, when appellant was assigned in Casiguran.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The last rape incident, which, as mentioned earlier, occurred on 28 March 1992 coincided with the graduation exercises of AAA. During the ceremony, AAA was accompanied by the female secretary of the construction firm named Deding. The graduation program ended at around 9 p.m., after which AAA and Deding went to the barracks to eat. Appellant did not eat with the two. When Deding left, AAA went to sleep. She was again awakened from her sleep when she felt appellant was on top of her and ravished her against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On 4 April 1992, she related these harrowing experiences to Nelly Enaje who helped her escape from the claws of the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Three days after, Nelly Enaje brought her to Danilo Enaje, the Barangay Captain of Cogon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Danilo Enaje accompanied the victim to the police station. The policemen had her undergo a physical examination at the Gubat District Hospital under Dr. Edna Gorospe who disclosed that the victim’s hymen had old lacerations at various areas and that the labia minora had abrasion which means that the victim could have been raped several times before she was examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>AAA explained that aside from fact that she was afraid of the threat of the appellant, it took her some time to leave appellant and to report the abuses done to her because she had no other relatives in Sorsogon and that she wanted to finish her schooling which was then in its final stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The defense presented its only witness, the appellant, who denied having committed the charges hurled against him. He claimed that he came to Cogon, Gubat, Sorsogon, in 1991 to work with a construction company as road roller operator. The victim, whom he admitted to be his daughter, stayed with her in a bunk house provided for them by his employer. He testified that sometime in 1992, AAA, together with a friend, took his money which was kept inside the bunk house and ran away from Cogon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He reported the incident to the barangay captain of Cogon. He looked for AAA in Abuyog, Irosin, Sorsogon and in Manila, but his search was in vain. Upon his return to Cogon, he learned that AAA and her friend were both in Abuyog. He was later called by the mayor of Gubat, Sorsogon, and was put behind bars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The RTC, in a decision dated 30 August 1998, convicted the appellant of 4 counts of rape in Criminal Cases No. 17170, 1771, 1772 and 1831 which were committed on 18 January, 19 January, 20 January, and 28 March 1992, respectively. The RTC, however, acquitted appellant of the other 46 rape charges against him for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The decretal portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Sammy Ramos y Dalere GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape on four (4) counts in Criminal Case Nos. 1770,1771,1772 and 1831, and hereby sentences him to RECLUSION PERPETUA for each and every count of the crime committed, with all the accessory penalties of the law; and to pay AAA the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity and TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P25,000.00) for moral damages, for each of the four felonies of rape, subject to the provisions of Art. 70 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The other cases against the accused as stated above, are hereby DISMISSED for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>In its decision dated 10 February 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the RTC, thus:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the judgment is rendered AFFIRMING the decision appealed from and DISMISSING the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the instant recourse.<br><br>In his brief, the appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF MULTIPLE RAPE NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT PRIVATE COMPLAINANT HAD HER CLOTHES ON DURING THE OCCURRENCE OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENTS.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE TIMID AND PASSIVE CONDUCT AND ACTUATION OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SUPPOSED SEXUAL ASSAULT ON HER CAST SERIOUS DOUBT ON THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.</blockquote>Appellant expresses a strong concern over the victim’s account of the alleged rape incidents. He claims that the rapes could not have been committed because the offended party had her clothes on all the time when the said incidents took place. He likewise points out that the victim’s timid and passive conduct during and after every incident of defloration runs counter to the normal reaction of a rape victim since it is unnatural for a victim to continue living with her tormentor and not to extricate herself from said abusive environment. Moreover, he insists that his conviction of four counts of rape is unwarranted because the victim merely gave general statements that she was raped, but she failed to disclose sufficient details to substantiate her allegations.<br><br>In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in cases of rape, the courts have been traditionally guided by three settled principles, namely: (a) an accusation for rape is easy to make, difficult to prove and even more difficult to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with utmost caution; and (c) the evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own merits and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Since the crime of rape is essentially one committed in relative isolation or even secrecy, hence, it is usually only the victim who can testify with regard to the fact of the forced <i>coitus</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In its prosecution, therefore, the credibility of the victim is almost always the single and most important issue to deal with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> If her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused can justifiably be convicted on the basis thereof; otherwise, he should be acquitted of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, upon assessing the victim’s testimony, the RTC found her credible, thus:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, AAA did not only say she had been raped, she described in detail how she had been sexually abused by her own natural father and the testimony of the private complainant bears the earmarks of truth. No woman especially one who is of tender age would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter permit herself to be subjected to a public trial, if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit punished.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On the basis of substantial evidence of culpability which the defense of denial and alibi failed to overcome, this Court is persuaded into finding and holding, as it hereby finds and holds that on four (4) occasions: (1) in the early morning of January 18, 1992; (2) in the evening of January 19, 1992; (3) in the evening of January 20, 1992; and (4) in the evening of March 28, 1992 in Cogon, Gubat, Sorsogon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>This Court itself has assiduously scrutinized the transcripts of stenographic notes of this case and like the RTC, it finds the victim’s testimony of the incident forthright and straightforward, reflective of an honest and realistic account of the tragedy that befell her. She narrated the first and the second rape incidents in this manner: <br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="70%"><div align="justify">Now, at the initial stage of the hearing you mentioned that your stepmother by the name of Maribel left your father in December 1991.

the prosecution adequately established in graphic detail that during the incidents in question, AAA stayed with the appellant in the barracks of the 642 Construction in Cogon, Gubat, Sorsogon and that appellant ravished his 13-year old daughter in four different dates, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, in the early morning of 18 January 1992, during the nights of 19 January 1992, 20 January 1992 and 28 March 1992. In all these deflorations, the victim resisted the bestial acts of the appellant, but the same proved fruitless as the latter was far stronger than her. Medical findings revealed that the victim’s hymen had old lacerations at various areas and that her <i>labia minora</i> had abrasion which are consistent with her claim that she was molested. Against the damning evidence adduced by the prosecution, what appellant could only muster is a barefaced denial. Unfortunately for the appellant, his defense is much too flaccid to stay firm against the weighty evidence for the prosecution. Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a negative and self-serving evidence which deserves no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimony of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Between the self-serving testimony of appellant and the positive identification by the eyewitness, the latter deserves greater credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s assertion that the sexual assault against the victim could not have been consummated because AAA was wearing her underwear every time appellant attempted on her chastity is not supported by evidence. During trial it was revealed by the victim that in all those four rape incidents, appellant removed her panty before inserting his penis and put it back after he satisfied his filthy desire. This was clarified by the victim when the trial court raised some clarificatory questions on this matter, thus:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Court: (to witness)<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="70%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Counsel for the accused had been using the word intercourse, rape and sexual intercourse and you were answering “yes”.

Since childhood, she had been longing to experience the love and protection of a father. When she finally found herself under the refuge of her father, it brought the bliss of an answered prayer. This idyllic experience, however, remained a fleeting episode because the person who should shield her from harm and evil was the very same person who wrought malady upon her. Such must be a startling occurrence for her. Behavioral psychology teaches that people react to similar situations dissimilarly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Their reactions to harrowing incidents may not be uniform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> AAA’s conduct of staying with her tormentor and her failure to prevent the repetition of the rape incident should not be taken against her. She was too disturbed and too young to totally comprehend the consequences of the dastardly acts inflicted on her by the appellant. Rape victims, especially child victims, should not be expected to act the way mature individuals would when placed in such a situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It is not proper to judge the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experience by the norms of behavior expected from adults under similar circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The range of emotions shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by calculus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is, thus, unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from rape victims. Certainly, the Court has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after she has been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the victim depending on the circumstances, but her credibility should not be tainted with any modicum of doubt. Indeed, different people act differently to a given stimulus or type of situation, and there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It would be insensitive to expect the victim to act with equanimity and to have the courage and the intelligence to disregard the threat made by the appellant. When a rape victim is paralyzed with fear, she cannot be expected to think and act coherently. This is especially true in this case since AAA was repeatedly threatened by appellant if ever she would tell anybody about the rape incidents. The threat instilled enormous fear in her such that she failed to take advantage of any opportunity to escape from the appellant. Also, as AAA explained, she withstood her father’s lechery and stayed with him despite what he did because she wanted to complete her studies until 28 March 1992 when she graduated. Besides, getting away from appellant was a task extremely difficult for a 13-year old girl, alone with the predator in a far-away place, motherless, without any relative to turn to in an hour of need, penniless, and uninformed in the ways of the world. In fact, it was only when a Good Samaritan crossed her path that the victim was able to report to the authorities about her father’s spiteful deeds.<br><br>As regards the initial delay of the victim in reporting the rape incident, suffice it to state that the delay in revealing the commission of rape is not an indication of a fabricated charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It is not uncommon for a young girl to conceal for some time the assault on her virtue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Her hesitation may be due to her youth, the moral ascendancy of the ravisher, and the latter’s threats against her. In the case at bar, the victim's fear of her father who had moral ascendancy over her, was explicit. Such reaction is typical of a thirteen-year-old girl and only strengthens her credibility.<br><br>Appellant’s allegation that the complaints for rapes were prompted by the victim’s hatred of the appellant for abandoning her is bereft of any basis. The victim even during her tender years had been looking for her father. She was, in fact, delighted when she saw her father for the first time in May of 1991. If AAA at all nurtured ill-will against her father, it was because he, instead of acting as protector of his daughter, defiled her. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that AAA harbored hatred against appellant, it would be unlikely for a 13-year old girl to fabricate such story. This Court has held that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature deserve full credence, considering that no young woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is highly improbable for an innocent girl, who is very naïve to the things of this world, to fabricate a charge so humiliating not only to herself but to her family. Moreover, it is doctrinally settled that testimonies of rape victims who are of tender age are credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The revelation of an innocent child whose chastity was abused deserves full credit, as the willingness of the complainant to face police investigation and to undergo the trouble and humiliation of a public trial is eloquent testimony of the truth of her complaint. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court finds that the RTC, as well as the Court of Appeals, committed no error in giving credence to the evidence of the prosecution and finding appellant guilty of the charges. The Court has long adhered to the rule that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great respect unless it overlooked substantial facts and circumstances, which if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In rape cases, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose conclusion thereon deserves much weight and respect because the judge has the direct opportunity to observe them on the stand and ascertain if they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This deference to the trial court’s appreciation of the facts and of the credibility of witnesses is consistent with the principle that when the testimony of a witness meets the test of credibility, that alone is sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This is especially true when the factual findings of the trial court are affirmed by the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As to the penalty imposed, the RTC correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count. Note that the rapes complained of in this case took place on 18 January 1992 to 28 March 1992, prior to the restoration of the death penalty for cases of qualified rape by virtue of Republic Act No. 7659 or the Death Penalty Law. The death penalty law took effect only on 31 December 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As thus correctly found by the RTC, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, before its amendment by Republic Act No. 7659, is applicable. The rapes committed by appellant are, therefore, simple, penalized by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<br><br>The RTC ordered the appellant to pay the victim the amount of P50,000.00 for each count of rape as civil indemnity. In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, such award is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, the award of moral damages in the amount of P25,000.00 for each count of rape is modified and increased to P50,000.00 conformably with the recent pronouncement of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 10 February 2006, affirming the Decision dated 30 August 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 54, Gubat, Sorsogon, finding appellant Sammy Ramos y Dalere <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of 4 counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <b><i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i></b> for each count and ordering him to pay the victim P50,000.00 for each count as civil indemnity, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.
