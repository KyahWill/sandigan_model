Discipulo submitted the affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of Atty. Jessie W. Tuldague (Tuldague), clerk of court of the RTC, and the joint affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of other court employees Vilma Agustin (Agustin), Naty S. Fernando (Fernando), George Mateo (Mateo), and Gil Orias (Orias) to vouch that he was present on 9 and 17 February 2006.<br><br>Discipulo charged Judge Pardo with gross misconduct: (1) Judge Pardo initiated and allowed drinking of alcohol during office hours on 6 July 2004; (2) he allowed court employees Luhlu M.

In its Resolution dated 13 December 2006, the Court resolved to refer the matter to a consultant of the OCA.<br><br>In his Report dated 19 March 2007, hearing officer-designate and retired Justice Narciso T. Atienza (Justice Atienza) found that Discipulo is liable for dishonesty and that Discipulo failed to prove his allegations against Judge Pardo.&nbsp; Justice Atienza recommended that Discipulo be suspended from office for six months and one day and that the charge against Judge Pardo be dismissed.<br><br>The Court agrees with Justice Atienza's findings and recommendations.<br><br>OCA Circular No. 7-2003 states that court personnel should indicate in their bundy cards the <i> truthful</i> and <i>accurate</i> times of their arrival at, and departure from, the office.&nbsp; In <i> Garcia v.

Complementing the bundy clock is [the] logbook where [the security guards on duty write the names of the employees who report for work, their time of arrival, and their time of departure.]&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; The names of [the] employees[, their time of arrival, and their time of departure] are all written by the security guards on duty.&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; [Whether an employee reported for work or not can be determined -- even if that employee forgot to punch his or her time card in the bundy clock -- by checking the records in the logbook.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Security Guards x x x make the entries in the Attendance Logbook.&nbsp; The Security guards on duty, two (2) at a time, are stationed at the entrance of the Hall[s] of Justice and the Attendance Logbook [is placed] on top of a table at the entrance of the Hall[s] of Justice.&nbsp; The Security Guards on duty make all the entries in the attendance logbook except for the signatures of the employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The surrounding circumstances show that Discipulo is liable for dishonesty: (1) Discipulo admitted inserting "12:00" and "5:00" on his time card; (2) the security guards did not see Discipulo punch his time card in the bundy clock at 12:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on 9 and 17 February 2006, respectively; (3) the logbook did not contain Discipulo's time of departure on 9 and 17 February 2006; (4) Discipulo took the logbook and brought it to the Office of the Clerk of Court; and (5) Discipulo inserted "12:00" and "5:00" on the logbook without informing the security guards.&nbsp; Justice Atienza observed that:<br><blockquote> <b>When</b> [<b>Discipulo</b><b> borrowed</b>] <b>the logbook from the security guards</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x on March 1, 2006, <b>his intention was not just to compare</b> [<b>the time</b>] <b>appearing</b> [<b>on</b>] <b>his bundy card</b> x x x <b>with</b> [<b>the time appearing in the logbook,</b>] <b>but to</b> [<b>insert on the logbook the time he typed on</b>] <b>his bundy card</b>.&nbsp; <b>If Discipulo's intention</b> [<b>were</b>] <b>just to compare</b> [ <b>the time appearing</b>] <b>in</b> <b>the logbook with</b> [<b>the time appearing in</b>] <b>the bundy card</b> x x x<b>, he would have</b> [<b>checked the logbook right there</b>] <b> on the table of the security guards or asked the permission of the security guards before writing anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the logbook</b>.<br><br>x x x&nbsp; <b>The testimonies of Tuldague and the other employees of the Office of the Clerk of Court are not as credible as the testimonies of security guards</b> [<b>D</b>]<b>e</b> <b>Guzman and Ciano who have no interest</b> <b>whatsoever in the outcome of the</b> [<b>instant</b>] <b>case and</b> [<b>whose testimonies</b>] <b>are supported by the entries in the logbook</b>.&nbsp; The guards were in good terms with Discipulo before and after March 1, 2006.&nbsp; On the other hand, Tuldague was a complainant in an administrative case against Judge Pardo.&nbsp; He was the one who prepared all the pleadings Discipulo filed in the instant case.&nbsp; Tuldague showed hostility towards [J]udge Pardo.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The security guards on duty did not see Discipulo</b> [<b>punch his time card in the bundy clock at </b><b>12:00</b><b> and </b><b>5:00 p.m.</b><b> on 9 and 17 February 2006, respectively </b>].&nbsp; <b>The only plausible explanation why Discipulo's time card was</b> [<b>punched in the bundy clock in the morning and at noon of 9 and 17 February 2006, respectively, and was not punched in the bundy clock after office hours on those dates is</b>] <b>that he left the office surreptitiously or without the knowledge of the security guards</b> x x x, otherwise<b> </b>[the<b> </b>time he left the office] would have been entered in the logbook.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>In <i>Duque</i><i> v.
