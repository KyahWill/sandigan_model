				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 assailing the March 31, 2004 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408 and the August 1, 2006 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.<br><br>The facts are undisputed. On September 16, 1998, petitioner, an Account Executive of Suyen Corporation, received an Infraction Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> from the management of the company asking her to explain why she should not be disciplinarily dealt with after declaring a false point of origin, the Pasay Head Office, when actually she came directly from her residence to the designated place of sales operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In response, petitioner wrote the personnel manager: (1) that she regularly went through the said route because it entailed cheaper transportation cost for the company; (2) that she had been doing this since her employment in March 1997 with the consent of her manager; and (3) that she was never questioned before.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 1998, petitioner was dismissed from employment on account of acts constituting gross dishonesty thru falsification of the company request form for the reimbursement of transportation allowance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Protesting her termination, petitioner filed a Complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The case was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-11-09065-98.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In her pleadings, she argued, among others, that she was dismissed not because of the alleged infraction but due to her active participation, as the acting president of the union, in the negotiation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On January 11, 2001, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On appeal, the NLRC, in its September 5, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in NLRC NCR CA No. 028962-01, ruled in petitioner’s favor and declared that she was illegally dismissed. Finding, however, that she was not entirely faultless (as she in fact proceeded to the place of assignment from her residence), the labor tribunal refused to award backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Both parties filed their respective Motions for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On October 28, 2002, the NLRC denied petitioner’s motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> prompting her to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA. This was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. <b>75185</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On July 28, 2003, the NLRC also denied respondent’s motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Respondent then filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. <b>79408</b> [the subject of this case].<br><br><b>On February 27, 2004, the Ninth Division of the appellate court, in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185, affirmed the September 5, 2002 Decision</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><b> of the NLRC with the modification that respondent was to pay petitioner full backwages from the time of illegal dismissal up to her actual reinstatement.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This decision attained finality when the parties did not interpose any appeal. An Entry of Judgment was then issued on April 2, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, on March 15, 2004, the Fourth Division of the CA, in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408, issued a Resolution denying the motion for the consolidation of the two <i>certiorari</i> petitions in view of the aforesaid promulgation of the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>The appellate court (4<sup>th</sup> Division), in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408, consequently, rendered the assailed March 31, 2004 Decision</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <b>affirming <i>in toto</i> the September 5, 2002 Decision</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <b>of the NLRC.</b> In the likewise challenged August 1, 2006 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the CA denied the motions for reconsideration of both parties.<br><br>Meanwhile, on January 12, 2005, the NLRC issued a Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of petitioner’s monetary award, including the backwages granted by the CA in the aforesaid February 27, 2004 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185. On motion to quash by the respondent, the NLRC, on January 25, 2005, held in abeyance the implementation of the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner subsequently filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> questioning the CA’s issuances in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408 on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>PUBLIC RESPONDENT COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF DISCRETION (SIC) IN REFUSING TO APPLY THE SERRANO DOCTRINE (RUBEN SERRANO vs. NLRC, 323 SCRA 45) AND BUSTAMANTE DOCTRINE (BUSTAMANTE vs. NLRC, 265 SCRA 6 [1996]) RESPECTIVELY, IN THE INSTANT CASE, AS DECREED BY THE NINTH DIVISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IN CA-G.R. SP NO. 75187 FILED BY PETITIONER.<br><center><br>II.<br></center><br>PUBLIC RESPONDENT COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN AWARDING ONLY SEPARATION PAY TO PETITIONER AS ALTERNATIVE TO REINSTATEMENT AND WITHOUT BACKWAGES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court grants the petition.<br><br>We note at the outset that the Ninth Division of the appellate court, in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 75185</b>, already affirmed the <b>September 5, 2002 Decision</b> of the NLRC that petitioner was illegally dismissed but modified the ruling and awarded backwages to the petitioner. Later, the Fourth Division of the CA, in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 79408</b>, rendered another decision inconsistent with the earlier ruling of its coordinate division. The Fourth Division merely affirmed the NLRC <b>September 5, 2002 Decision</b>, and did not award backwages to the petitioner.<br><br>This conflict in the decisions of the different divisions of the appellate court would have been avoided had the two <i>certiorari</i> petitions been consolidated or had the Fourth Division, when apprised of the earlier ruling, remained consistent with the Ninth Division’s pronouncements. The various divisions of the CA are, in a sense, coordinate courts, and, pursuant to the policy of judicial stability, a division of the appellate court should not interfere with the decision of the other divisions of the court, otherwise confusion will ensue and may seriously hinder the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Court notes further that no appeal was interposed to challenge the CA’s decision in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 75185</b>. The said decision declaring petitioner as illegally dismissed and entitled to backwages, therefore, already attained <b>finality</b>. Established is the rule that when a decision becomes final and executory, the court loses jurisdiction over the case and not even an appellate court will have the power to review the said judgment. Otherwise, there will be no end to litigation and will set to naught the main role of courts of justice which is to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable controversies with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We have further stressed in prior cases that just as the losing party has the privilege to file an appeal within the prescribed period, so does the winner have the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is <b>GRANTED</b>. The March 31, 2004 Decision and the August 1, 2006 Resolution of the appellate court in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408 are <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that private respondent Suyen Corporation is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay petitioner Eleanor C. Magalang full backwages from the time of her illegal dismissal up to actual reinstatement, in order to make it consistent with the decision in CA-G.R.
