				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><blockquote><i>Of the so-called heinous crimes, none perhaps more deeply provokes feelings of outrage, detestation, and disgust than incestuous rape.

When arraigned on 21 April 1999, appellant, with the assistance of counsel <i>de oficio</i>, pleaded “Not Guilty” to each of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses AAA and Dr. Armie Soreto-Umil (Dr. Umil). Their testimonies are as follows:<br><br>AAA testified that appellant is her father and BBB is her mother; that appellant and BBB are married; that she is the fourth child in a brood of five children born to appellant and BBB; and that she resided with her family at XXX.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On <b>8 March 1995</b>, AAA went home from work to celebrate with her family the birthday of her younger brother, CCC. Later that evening, she slept inside the house, while appellant had a drinking session with some friends outside the house. BBB was then peddling several merchandise at the Quirino Memorial Hospital (QMH). Subsequently, appellant entered the house and lay down beside her. Appellant fondled her breast and vagina. She resisted but to no avail because appellant punched her in the stomach and slapped her face. Appellant then placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. Thereafter, DDD, her elder brother, entered the house and saw appellant on top of her. Afraid of appellant, DDD ignored the two. The following day, DDD told AAA that he saw the incident and that he will report it to appellant’s sister, EEE. AAA did not inform BBB of the incident because of her fear that appellant would make good his threat to kill her and the rest of the family members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Again, in <b>1996</b>, appellant, with the use of force, threat and intimidation, raped AAA six times on several occasions inside the house. BBB was selling goods at the QMH during the commission of these rapes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Likewise, in <b>1997</b>, appellant, by applying the same physical harm, threat and intimidation, sexually assaulted her several times inside the house. BBB was also out of the house when these bestial acts transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On <b>24 July 1998</b>, at about 1:00 in the morning, AAA and her siblings were sleeping inside a nipa hut owned by her family and located in front of their house, while appellant was drinking liquor with a certain Rey and Benito Casaljay outside the house. After the drinking session, Rey and Benito left appellant. Appellant then entered the nipa hut, woke her up, and started to make sexual advances on her. She tried to resist appellant’s onslaught but failed because appellant punched her in the stomach. Appellant went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. After satisfying his lust, appellant warned her not to tell anyone of the incident or he would kill her and the rest of the family members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Upon being informed by EEE of the incidents, BBB, on 30 July 1998, accompanied AAA to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) office at Taft Avenue, Manila, and reported the heinous acts of appellant. AAA also executed a <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> regarding the incidents. Thereupon, appellant was arrested and charged with rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Dr. Umil narrated that she conducted a genital examination on AAA upon the request of NBI Supervising Agent Rosalina Espina-Chiong. Her findings as stated in her medico-legal report are: (1) no evident sign of any extra-genital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of the examination; and (2) hymen, intact, but distensible, and its orifice wide (2.5 cm. in diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing hymenal injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also adduced documentary evidence to buttress the foregoing testimonies of prosecution witnesses, to wit: (1) <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> of AAA;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (2) Medico-Legal Report regarding AAA signed and issued by Dr. Umali;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and (3) a letter written by appellant in a Marlboro cigarette wrapper addressed to AAA asking her forgiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense proffered the lone testimony of appellant to refute the foregoing accusations.<br><br>Appellant divulged that AAA is his daughter and BBB is his wife; that he did not rape AAA on 8 March 1995; that a birthday celebration for one of his children, CCC, was held at their house on 8 March 1995 which was attended by several friends; that he did not rape AAA in 1996, 1997, and on 24 July 1998; that BBB, AAA and his other children resided with him in their house at XXX from 8 March 1995 to 24 July 1998; that he had a drinking spree with Rey and Benito at nighttime during the said periods; and that he wrote a letter to AAA but denied that it was the same one presented by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The defense also offered as its sole documentary evidence the Medico-Legal Report issued and signed by Dr. Umil.<br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision finding appellant guilty of rape as alleged in the four informations. In Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and No. 1150<b>32</b>-H, the Court imposed on appellant the penalty of death. In Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>33</b>-H and No. 1150<b>34</b>-H, appellant was sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this Court finds accused Juanito dela Cruz y Rivera, as follows:<br><br>1. In Criminal Case No. 1150<b>31</b>-H, GUILTY as principal of the offense of qualified rape penalized under then Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, and sentences him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH. Accused is further ordered to pay the offended person, AAA, the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity plus Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<br><br>2. In Criminal Case No. 1150<b>32</b>-H, GUILTY as principal of the offense of qualified rape penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, and sentences him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH. Accused is further ordered to pay AAA the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity plus Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<br><br>3. In Criminal Case No. 1150<b>33</b>-H, GUILTY as principal of the offense of simple rape penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659 [Now Art. 266-A and Art. 266-B under R.A. 8353], and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Accused is further ordered to pay AAA the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity plus the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<br><br>4. In Criminal Case No. 1150<b>34</b>-H, GUILTY as principal of the offense of simple rape penalized under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Accused is further ordered to pay AAA the sum of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity and the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>In view of the death penalty it imposed on appellant in Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and 1150<b>32</b>-H, the RTC forwarded the records of the cases to us for automatic review. However, pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> we remanded the cases to the Court of Appeals for disposition. On 26 October 2006, the appellate court promulgated its Decision affirming with modifications the RTC decision. It held that appellant is liable only for simple rape and not qualified rape in Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and No. 1150<b>32</b>-H because the qualifying circumstance of AAA’s minority was not duly proven by the prosecution. Thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the February 12, 2000 Joint Decision, as far as Criminal Case No. 1150<b>33</b>-H and Criminal Case No. 1150<b>34</b>-H are concerned, is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and Criminal Case No. 1150<b>32</b>-H, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two acts of simple rape, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, and to pay moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>In his Brief, appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE UNBELIEVABLE AND UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINANT AAA;<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT JUANITO DELA CRUZ OF FOUR (4) COUNTS OF RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Rape is committed when the accused has carnal knowledge of the victim by force or intimidation and without consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in cases of rape, the victim’s testimony is crucial in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime in which only two persons are normally involved. The accused may be convicted on the basis of the victim’s lone and uncorroborated testimony provided it is clear, positive, convincing, and consistent with human nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>We have painstakingly reviewed the records and found that appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA through force and intimidation on the dates stated in the informations.

The RTC and the Court of Appeals found their testimonies to be “credible, true and sufficiently reliable.” Both courts also found no ill motive on their part to testify against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The rule is that the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings are accorded respect if not conclusive effect.

When the trial court’s findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant, however, alleges in his first assigned error several inconsistencies in the testimony of AAA, to wit: (1) AAA testified that she was with her five siblings inside the house when she was raped by appellant on 8 March 1995, while in her subsequent testimony she stated that only DDD was present when she was raped by appellant on the said date; (2) AAA told the court that she was with her five siblings inside the house when she was raped by appellant on 24 July 1998, while in her later testimony she narrated that her siblings were out of the house when she was raped by appellant on the said date; and (3) AAA disclosed that during the rape on 24 July 1998 she saw Rey and Benito outside the house staring at appellant who was then on top of her, while in her other testimony she recounted that she merely learned from EEE that Rey and Benito saw appellant on top of her on the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The credibility of a rape victim is not impaired by some inconsistencies in her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Such inconsistencies are inconsequential when they refer to minor details that have nothing to do with the essential fact of the commission of the crime – carnal knowledge through force and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The supposed contradictions cited by appellant refer to minor details and are evidently beyond the essential fact of the commission of rape because they do not pertain to the actual sexual assault itself – that very moment when appellant was forcing himself on AAA. Besides, these minor inconsistencies even bolster the credibility of AAA as one could hardly doubt that her testimony was contrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant further claims that AAA’s testimony does not jibe with her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> and with the testimony of Dr. Umil as shown by the following: (1) In her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, AAA stated that she was raped by appellant on 8 March 1995 and on 24 July 1998, while in her court testimony she revealed that she was raped by appellant six times in 1996 and several times in 1997; and (2) AAA divulged that appellant punched her in the stomach and slapped her during the incidents but Dr. Umil testified that no contusions, abrasions or other physical injuries were found on AAA’s body during the latter’s physical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>We have steadfastly ruled that the alleged inconsistencies between the testimony of a witness in open court and his sworn statement are not fatal defects to justify a reversal of judgment of conviction. Such discrepancies do not necessarily discredit the witness since <i>ex-parte</i> affidavits are almost always incomplete. Sworn statements taken <i>ex-parte</i> are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The fact that Dr. Umil found no contusions or abrasions on AAA’s body during the latter’s physical examination does not render improbable the occurrence of rape because settled is the doctrine that absence of external signs or physical injuries does not negate the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Anent the second assignment of error, appellant argues that it is improbable for appellant to rape AAA in the presence of the latter’s siblings; that the informations in Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>32</b>-H and 1150<b>33</b>-H which allege that the rapes were committed “during the period January to December 1996,” and “during the period January to December 1997,” respectively, are defective because it does not specifically state the exact dates of the commission of rapes; that AAA is not a credible witness because she did not immediately inform BBB nor the police authorities of the incidents; that the failure of AAA to immediately report the incidents implies that no rapes were committed and that the sexual contacts between him and AAA were voluntary and consensual; that AAA’s testimony that she reported the 8 March 1995 incident to EEE is unbelievable because if such was true then the instant case would have been filed earlier and the subsequent rapes could have been avoided; that he never admitted having written the letter on a Marlboro cigarette wrapper to AAA and thus the said letter cannot be used as evidence against him because its due execution and authenticity was not proven; and that the qualifying circumstance of minority of AAA during the incidents was not proven because the latter’s birth certificate was not presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Lust is no respecter of time and place. Thus, we held that rape can be committed inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It is not impossible, nor incredible, for AAA’s siblings to be in deep slumber and not to be awakened while appellant was raping her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Failure to specify the exact dates or time when the rapes occurred does not <i>ipso facto</i> make the information defective on its face. The reason is obvious. The date or time of the commission of rape is not a material ingredient of the said crime because the <i>gravamen</i> of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman through force and intimidation. As such, the date or time need not be stated with absolute accuracy. It is sufficient that the complaint or information states that the crime has been committed at any time as near as possible to the date of its actual commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In several cases, we sustained complaints and informations in prosecutions for rape which merely alleged the month and year of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Hence, the allegations in the informations regarding Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>32</b>-H and 1150<b>33</b>-H which state that rapes were committed “during the period January to December 1996” and “during the period January to December 1997” are sufficient to affirm the conviction of appellant.<br><br>We have ruled that the failure of the rape victim to immediately report the rape is not necessarily an indication of a fabricated charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It is not uncommon for young girls like AAA to conceal for some time the assault on their virtues because of the rapist’s threat on their lives, more so when the rapist is living with her as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> AAA testified that appellant threatened to kill her and the other family members should she report what he had done to her. AAA’s delay in reporting the sexual violations is therefore understandable and cannot undermine her credibility.<br><br>Appellant’s letter written on a Marlboro cigarette wrapper asking AAA’s forgiveness is admissible in evidence against him. AAA testified that after the instant case was filed in the RTC, BBB visited appellant once in jail. During the said visit, appellant handed to BBB a letter written on a Marlboro cigarette wrapper and thereafter instructed BBB to give the said letter to her. BBB gave her the said letter and told her “<i>pinaabot ng tatay mo</i>.” In the said letter, appellant asked her to forgive him for what he did to her as he was only drunk at that time. She knows that the letter was written by appellant because she is familiar with his handwriting and signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> AAA positively identified the letter itself during her direct examination and this was formally offered as documentary evidence for the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>More importantly, appellant himself readily admitted that the letter is the same letter he wrote for AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He also confirmed that the handwriting therein is his.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Although later, he would deny the same on the basis that he does not use the Marlboro cigarette brand, but only Winston cigarette brand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we still give more weight to his admission of the said letter since it was given voluntarily and spontaneously. His subsequent denial is not only based on flimsy grounds but also an obvious attempt to cover-up his earlier damaging testimony. As to the contents of the letter, verily, no one would ask for forgiveness unless he has committed a wrong and a plea for forgiveness may be considered analogous to an attempt to compromise, which offer of compromise by the appellant may be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt pursuant to Section 27, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We agree, however, with appellant’s contention, as affirmed by the Office of the Solicitor General and the Court of Appeals, that the RTC erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of minority of AAA and in imposing the maximum penalty of death in Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and 1150<b>32</b>-H.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7659 is the law applicable for the rapes committed in March 1995 and on several occasions during the period of January to December 1996, as respectively alleged in Criminal Cases No. 1150<b>31</b>-H and 1150<b>32</b>-H. The said law states that the death penalty shall be imposed if the rape victim is a minor and the offender is a parent. The qualifying circumstances of minority of the victim and the latter’s relationship with the offender must be <b>alleged</b> and <b>proven</b> to warrant the imposition of death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The informations specifically alleged that AAA was a minor when she was raped by appellant. Nonetheless, the prosecution failed to prove such allegation with sufficient evidence.<br><br>AAA solely testified that she was fifteen years old when appellant raped her on March 1995, and sixteen years old when appellant defiled her again six times during the period of January to December 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Appellant neither denied nor objected to the said testimony of AAA.<br><br>In <i>People v.

We emphasized therein that there must be independent evidence proving the age of the victims other than their own testimonies and the absence of denial by the accused. The victims’ original or duly certified birth certificate, or baptismal certificate, or school records would suffice as competent evidence of their age. The prosecution presented a photocopy of one of the victim’s birth certificate but we gave no probative value to it because it was neither duly certified nor formally offered in evidence. In conclusion, we ruled therein that the prosecution failed to prove the minority of the rape victims.<br><br>Applying the foregoing jurisprudence to the case at bar, the bare testimony of AAA as to her age is not sufficient proof that she was a minor when appellant raped her on the given dates. There must be independent evidence showing her minority other than her bare testimony and the absence of denial by the appellant. The independent proof may consist of her original or duly certified birth certificate, or her baptismal certificate or school records.<br><br>A photocopy of AAA’s birth certificate is included in the records of the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Nevertheless, the same was neither properly identified nor formally offered in evidence. Hence, no probative value can be given to it. Aside from the said birth certificate, no other documentary evidence was adduced to prove the age of AAA.<br><br>With respect to appellant’s failure to object on the aforesaid testimony of AAA, we decreed in <i>People v. Pruna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> that the failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding the rape victim’s age shall not be taken against him.
