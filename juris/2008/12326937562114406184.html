Thus:<br><blockquote>As early as August 27, 2001, the Court received an Order (Annex 6) issued by the Second Division, Commission on Elections in EPC No. 2001-34, Quintos vs. Villarosa, or the gubernatorial protest case, directing this court to conduct the revision and appreciation proceedings in Election Case Nos. 19 and 20 (De Ocampo vs. Pangilinan and Terana vs. Velendria, respectively,) in the most expeditious manner in order that the subject ballot boxes and other election documents both subject of election protest pending the court and the Commission on Elections can be turned over in due time.<br><br>On November 13, 2001, however, the same Commision issued <i>status quo</i> order in SPR No. 32-2001 (Annex 7), thus, the Court had nothing to do but defer the revision of ballots in the remaining precincts x x x and instead the election protest case pending before the court was held in abeyance until receipt of the Order from the Second Division, Commission on Elections.<br><br>Another order was issued in ECP No. 2001-34 directing the court to expedite and terminate within fifteen (15) days from notice the revision and appreciation of ballots.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Without passing the blame on the Commission on Elections, it is necessary, however, with all due respect to mention that the Commission on Elections itself had been inexplicably inconsistent and ambiguous when, in EPC No. 2001-34, it directed speedy termination of revision and appreciation proceedings in the cases pending in the court first in its August 27, 2001 order and subsequently in May 24, 2002 order but only to be overruled and/or negated by its issuance of the November 23, 2001 then the June 11, 2002 status quo order in SPR No. 32-2001.<br><br>Confronted with such contradictory orders, respondent judge had the prerogative to reasonably construe, without having in mind to disobey the issuance of superior order, as it had done, to the effect that the May 24, 2002 Order in EPC No. 2001-34 had effectively lifted the status order in SPR No. 32-2001.  Simply stated, between one which adheres to the policy and legal mandate for speedy disposition of election protest cases, and one which contravenes or hampers said policy respondent's only recourse, a just and logical one, is to implement the former order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Evidently, the Order dated June 5, 2002 directing, without qualification, the revision of ballots for the remaining precincts to commence on June 10, 2002 pursuant to the Comelec Order of May 24, 2002, is erroneous, for it failed to take into account that said Comelec Order covered only certain ballot boxes in specified precincts, not all the ballot boxes protested in EC No. 19 before respondent Judge.  While the erroneous interpretation by respondent Judge of the Comelec Order dated May 24, 2002 may not be considered gross ignorance of the law, his failure to rectify his Order dated June 5, 2002 when complainant filed an urgent motion for postponement with manifestation and clarification, constitutes gross inefficiency.<br><br><u><center><b><i>SECOND ISSUE</i></b><br></center></u><br>On the alleged absences of respondent Judge<br><br>The erroneous interpretation of the Comelec Order dated May 24, 2002 would have been avoided or readily corrected by respondent Judge and the revision of ballots covered by Comelec's <i>status quo</i> Order would not <br> have proceeded, had respondent Judge been in his office on June 5 (Wednesday), 6 (Thursday), 7 (Friday), 10 (Monday) and 11 (Tuesday), 2002.<br><br>Respondent Judge admits that he was not in his official station on June 6, 7 and 10, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  However, there is no showing that he ever filed an application for leave of absence on said dates.  Neither did he state any reason for his absence on June 7 and 10, 2002.<br><br>Respondent Judge claims that on June 5, 2002, while holding trial of several cases pending before his sala, he received an important and urgent call asking him to come to San Jose, Occidental Mindoro on the same date to attend to some important "official business." Thus, he immediately instructed respondent Clerk of Court to prepare for him and issue an Order for the resumption of revision of ballots on June 10, 2002, giving respondent Clerk of Court authority to do the signing by using the stamp "Original Signed."<br><br>Initially, respondent Judge claimed that he had a dialogue with the IBP Chapter President in Occidental Mindoro on June 5, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> but he later claimed that the dialogue was on June 6, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  When he went to San Jose, Occidental Mindoro on June 5, 2002 in order to attend to some "official business," he could not specify what "official business" it was.  It could not be the supposed dialogue with the IBP Chapter President, because the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> submitted by respondent Judge refers to a conference with the IBP Chapter President on the following day, June 6, 2002.  The certification is also dubious, as it has no letterhead or any address of the signatory thereto.  Even if, indeed, such conference transpired on June 6, 2002, respondent Judge cannot claim that he was on official business because his dialogue with the IBP Chapter President is not part of his judicial functions.<br><br>The allegations of respondent Judge that he was still able to hold trial of several cases in the morning of June 5, 2002 and that he even signed some Orders before he left for San Jose, Occidental Mindoro does not inspire credence for if it did, he could have readily prepared the one-page Order dated June 5, 2002 and signed the same before he left for San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.  The Orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in the other cases purportedly signed by respondent Judge on June 5, 2002, merely pertain to resetting of hearings in said cases.  The Orders do not conclusively show that respondent Judge indeed signed the Order of June 5, 2002, as he himself claims that he signed the Order of June 5, 2002 in EC No. 19 only after he reported back to his office.  Moreover, the calendar of hearing on June 5, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>, as compared to the other calendars of hearings on June 4, 5, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26 and 27, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> submitted by respondent Judge, does not bear any handwritten notes as to what transpired in the hearing.<br><br>Moreover, after his alleged dialogue with the IBP Chapter President on June 6, 2002, respondent Judge should have reported to his official station on June 7, 2002, or at least, immediately after he was informed of complainant's urgent motion for postponement of the scheduled revision on June 10, 2002.  The claim of respondent Judge that he reported back to his official station on June 11, 2002 and signed the order of June 5, 2002 while the revision committee was conducting revision of ballots is also not credible and not supported by independent and competent evidence.  Even if, indeed, he signed the Order dated June 5, 2002 on June 11, 2002, the fact remains that the revision of ballots proceeded on the basis of the June 5, 2002 Order which was merely stamped with "Original Signed" by respondent Clerk of Court. Also, if he was back to his office on June 11, 2002, why did he stay inside his chambers instead of attending to the ongoing revision on said date?  His claim that his presence was not necessary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> deserves scant consideration, because even if the Head Revisor was respondent Clerk of Court, the revision proceedings should be under his direct control and supervision and therefore his presence thereat was essential.<br><br>The foregoing considerations show that, indeed, respondent Judge was absent in his official station not only on June 6, 7 and 10, 2002, as he admits, but also on June 5 and 11, 2002.  The unexplained absences of respondent Judge, including the issuance of the Order dated June 5, 2002 without his signature, constitute serious misconduct, gross neglect of duty and gross inefficiency, as he failed to exercise the requisite circumspection and diligence in the discharge of his official duties and functions required by the attendant circumstances.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Clerk of Court failed to exercise reasonable diligence when he failed to take into account that the ballot boxes to be revised in EC Case No. 19 should only be those specified in the Comelec Order dated May 24, 2002.  Since the basis of the Order dated June 5, 2002 which he prepared was the Comelec Order dated May 24, 2002, he should have carefully read and analyzed the contents of said Comelec Order.  Also, when complainant filed the motion for postponement of June10, 2002, citing the reasons therefor, respondent Clerk of Court should have exercised prudence in proceeding with the revision of ballot boxes, by revising first those which were mentioned in the Comelec Order dated May 24, 2002, specifically ballot boxes of Precinct Nos. 26A1 and 48A.<br><br>On the basis of her findings, the Investigating Justice recommends that respondent Judge be meted suspension from office, without pay, for a period of six (6) months for gross inefficiency, serious misconduct and gross neglect of duty, and that respondent Clerk of Court be reprimanded for failure to exercise reasonable diligence in the issuance of the Order dated June 5, 2002 and in the revision of ballots.<br><br>The Court fully agrees with the findings of Justice Fernanda Lampas Peralta.  The records and copies of the Orders issued by respondent Judge in relation to the Orders of the Comelec clearly support the finding of gross inefficiency.  The admission of respondent Judge in the face of his patently lame excuses equally bears out his serious misconduct and gross neglect of duty.<br><br>Similarly, the respondent Clerk of Court's failure to exercise reasonable diligence in the issuance of the Order dated June 5, 2002 in the revision of ballots is incontrovertible.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge Inocencio M. Jaurigue is found <b>GUILTY</b> of gross inefficiency, serious misconduct and gross neglect of duty and is hereby <b>SUSPENDED</b> from office, without pay, for six (6) months. Respondent Clerk of Court Atty. Cirilo Q.
