The foregoing remedies shall be available to the Non-Defaulting Party only if the demand therefor is presented in writing to the Defaulting Party within three (3) years from the Closing Date except that the remedy for a breach of the SELLERS' representation and warrant in Section 5 (h) shall be available only if the demand therefor is presented to the Defaulting Party in writing together with schedules and to substantiate such demand, within six (6) months from the Closing Date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On June 2, 2000, RCBC deposited the stipulated downpayment amount in an escrow account after which it was given full management and operational control of Bankard. <b>June 2, 2000</b> is also considered by the parties as the <b>Closing Date</b> referred to in the SPA.<br><br>Thereafter, the parties executed an <i>Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement</i> (ASPA) dated September 19, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Its paragraph 2(e) provided that:<br><blockquote>2.  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Share Purchase Agreement and/or any agreement, instrument or document entered into or executed by the Parties in relation thereto (the "Related Agreements"), the Parties hereby agree that:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 7 of the Share Purchase Agreement to the contrary, <b>the remedy for a breach of the SELLERS' representation and warranty in Section 5(h)</b> of the Share Purchase Agreement <b>shall be available if the demand therefor is presented</b> to the SELLERS in writing together with schedules and data to substantiate such demand, on or before <b>31 December 2000</b>. (Emphasis added.)<br></blockquote>Sometime in September 2000, RCBC had Bankard's accounts audited, creating for the purpose an audit team led by a certain Rubio, the Vice-President for Finance of RCBC at the time. Rubio's conclusion was that the warranty, as contained in Section 5(h) of the SPA (simply Sec. 5[h] hereinafter), was correct.<br><br>On December 28, 2000, RCBC paid the balance of the contract price. The corresponding deeds of sale for the shares in question were executed in January 2001.<br><br>Thereafter, in a letter of May 5, 2003, RCBC informed petitioners of its having overpaid the purchase price of the subject shares, claiming that there was an overstatement of valuation of accounts amounting to PhP 478 million, resulting in the overpayment of over PhP 616 million. Thus, RCBC claimed that petitioners violated their warranty, as sellers, embodied in Sec. 5(g) of the SPA (Sec. 5[g] hereinafter).<br><br>Following unsuccessful attempts at settlement, RCBC, in accordance with Sec. 10 of the SPA, filed a <i>Request for Arbitration</i> dated May 12, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the ICC-ICA.  In the request, RCBC charged Bankard with deviating from, contravening and not following generally accepted accounting principles and practices in maintaining their books.  Due to these improper accounting practices, RCBC alleged that both the audited and unaudited financial statements of Bankard prior to the stock purchase were far from fair and accurate and, hence, violated the representations and warranties of petitioners in the SPA. Per RCBC, its overpayment amounted to PhP 556 million. It thus prayed for the rescission of the SPA, restitution of the purchase price, payment of actual damages in the amount of PhP 573,132,110, legal interest on the purchase price until actual restitution, moral damages, and litigation and attorney's fees. As alternative to rescission and restitution, RCBC prayed for damages in the amount of at least PhP 809,796,092 plus legal interest.<br><br>To the <i>Request for Arbitration</i>, petitioners filed an Answer dated July 28, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> denying RCBC's inculpatory averments and setting up the following affirmative allegations: the period for filing of the asserted claim had already lapsed by force of Sec. 7 of the SPA; RCBC is not entitled to rescission having had ample opportunity and reasonable time to file a claim against petitioners; RCBC is not entitled to its alternative prayer of damages, being guilty of laches and failing to set out the details of the breach as required under Sec. 7.<br><br>Arbitration in the ICC-ICA proceeded after the formation of the arbitration tribunal consisting of retired Justice Santiago M. Kapunan, nominated by petitioners; Neil Kaplan, RCBC's nominee; and Sir Ian Barker, appointed by the ICC-ICA.<br><br>After drawn out proceedings with each party alleging deviation and non-compliance by the other with arbitration rules, the tribunal, with Justice Kapunan dissenting, rendered a Partial Award dated September 27, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>15 AWARD AND DIRECTIONS<br><br>15.1 The Tribunal makes the following declarations by way of Partial Award:<br><br>(a) The Claimant's claim is not time-barred under the provisions of this SPA.<br>(b) The Claimant is not estopped by its conduct or the equitable doctrine of laches from pursuing its claim.<br>(c) As detailed in the Partial Award, the Claimant has established the following breaches by the Respondents of clause 5(g) of the SPA:<br><blockquote>i) the assets, revenue and net worth of Bankard were overstated by reason of its policy on and recognition of Late Payment Fees;<br>ii) reported receivables were higher than their realizable values by reason of the `bucketing' method, thus overstating Bankard's assets; and<br>iii) the relevant Bankard statements were inadequate and misleading in that their disclosures caused readers to be misinformed about Bankard's accounting policies on revenue and receivables.<br></blockquote>(d)  Subject to proof of loss the Claimant is entitled to damages for the foregoing breaches.<br>(e) The Claimant is not entitled to rescission of the SPA.<br>(f) All other issues, including any issue relating to costs, will be dealt with in a further or final award.<br><br>15.2 A further Procedural Order will be necessary subsequent to the delivery of this Partial Award to deal with the determination of quantum and in particular, whether there should be an Expert appointed by the Tribunal under Article 20(4) of the ICC Rules to assist the Tribunal in this regard.<br><br>15.3 This Award is delivered by a majority of the Tribunal (Sir Ian Barker and Mr. Kaplan). Justice Kapunan is unable to agree with the majority's conclusion on the claim of estoppel brought by the respondents.<br></blockquote>On the matter of prescription, the tribunal held that RCBC's claim is not time-barred, the claim properly falling under the contemplation of Sec. 5(g) and not Sec. 5(h).  As such, the tribunal concluded, RCBC's claim was filed within the three (3)-year period under Sec. 5(g) and that the six (6)-month period under Sec. 5(h) did not apply.<br><br>The tribunal also exonerated RCBC from laches, the latter having sought relief within the three (3)-year period prescribed in the SPA. On the matter of estoppel suggested in petitioners' answer, the tribunal stated in par. 10.27 of the Partial Award the following:<br><blockquote>10.27 Clearly, there has to be both an admission or representation by (in this case) the Claimant [RCBC], plus reliance upon it by (in this case) the Respondents [herein petitioners]. The Tribunal cannot find as proved any admission/representation that the Claimant was abandoning a 5(g) claim, any reliance by the Respondents on an admission, and any detriment to the Respondents such as would entitle them to have the Claimant deprived of the benefit of clause 5(g). These aspects of the claim for estoppels are rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Notably, the tribunal considered the rescission of the SPA and ASPA as impracticable and "totally out of the question."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In his Dissenting Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which he submitted to and which was received on September 24, 2007 by the ICC-ICA, Justice Kapunan stated the observation that RCBC's claim is time-barred, falling as such claim did under Sec. 5(h), which prescribes a comparatively shorter prescriptive period, not 5(g) as held by the majority of the tribunal, to wit:<br><blockquote>Claimant admits that the Claim is for recovery of P431 million on account of alleged "overvaluation of the net worth of Bankard," allegedly for "improper accounting practices" resulting in "its book value per share as of 31 December 1999 [being] overstated." Claimant's witness, Dean Echanis asserts that "the inadequate provisioning for Bankard's doubtful accounts result[ed] in an overstatement of its December 31, 1999 total assets and net worth of by [sic] least P418.2 million."<br><br>In addition, Claimant's demand letter addressed to the Respondents alleged that "we overpaid for the Shares to the extent of the impact of the said overstatement on the Book Value per share".<br><br>These circumstances establish beyond dispute that the Claim is based on the alleged overstatement of the 1999 net worth of Bankard, which the parties relied on in setting the purchase price of the shares. Moreover, it is clear that there was an overstatement because of "improper accounting practices" which led Claimant to overpay for the shares.<br><br>Ultimately, the Claim is one for recovery of overpayment in the purchase price of the shares. x x x<br></blockquote>As to the issue of estoppel, Justice Kapunan stated:<br><blockquote>Moreover, Mr. Rubio's findings merely corroborated the disclosures made in the Information Memorandum that Claimant received from the Respondents prior to the execution of the SPA. In this connection, I note that Bankard's policy on provisioning and setting of allowances using the Bucketed Method and income recognition from AR/Principal, AR/Interest and AR/LPFs were disclosed in the Information Memorandum. Thus, these alleged improper accounting practices were known to the Claimant even prior to the execution of the SPA.<br><br>Thus, when Claimant paid the balance of the purchase price, it did so with full knowledge of these accounting practices of Bankard that it now assails. By paying the balance of the purchase price without taking exception or objecting to the accounting practices disclosed through Mr. Rubio' s review and the Information Memorandum, Claimant is deemed to have accepted such practices as correctly reporting the 1999 net worth. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As last point, I note that my colleagues invoke a principle that for estoppels to apply there must be positive indication that the right to sue was waived. I am of the view that there is no such principle under Philippine law. What is applicable is the holding in <b>Knecht and in Coca- Cola</b> that prior knowledge of an unfavorable fact is binding on the party who has such knowledge; "when the purchaser proceeds to make investigations by himself, and the vendor does nothing to prevent such investigation from being as complete as the former might wish, the purchaser cannot later allege that the vendor made false representations to him" (Cf. Songco v. Sellner, 37 Phil 254 citations omitted).<br><br>Applied to this case, the Claimant cannot seek relief on the basis that when it paid the purchase price in December 2000, it was unaware that the accounting practices that went into the reporting of the 1999 net worth as amounting to P1,387,275,847 were not in conformity with GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles]. (Emphasis added.)<br></blockquote>On October 26, 2007, RCBC filed with the RTC a Motion to Confirm Partial Award. On the same day, petitioners countered with a Motion to Vacate the Partial Award. On November 9, 2007, petitioners again filed a Motion to Suspend and Inhibit Barker and Kaplan.<br><br>On January 8, 2008, the RTC issued the first assailed order confirming the Partial Award and denying the adverted separate motions to vacate and to suspend and inhibit. From this order, petitioners sought reconsideration, but their motion was denied by the RTC in the equally assailed second order of March 17, 2008.<br><br>From the assailed orders, petitioners came directly to this Court through this petition for review.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><blockquote>This petition seeks the review, reversal and setting aside of the orders Annexes A and B and, in lieu of them, it seeks judgment vacating the arbitrators' liability award, Annex C, on these grounds:<br><blockquote>(a) The trial court acted contrary to law and judicial authority in refusing to vacate the arbitral award, notwithstanding it was rendered in plain disregard of the parties' contract and applicable Philippine law, under which the claim in arbitration was indubitably time-barred.<br><br>(b) The trial court acted contrary to law and judicial authority in refusing to vacate and in confirming the arbitral award, notwithstanding that the arbitrators had plainly and admittedly failed to accord petitioners' due process by denying them a hearing on the basic factual matter upon which their liability is predicated.<br><br>(c) The trial court committed grave error in confirming the arbitrators' award, which held petitioners-sellers liable for an alleged improper recording of accounts, allegedly affecting the value of the shares they sold, notwithstanding that the respondent-buyer knew before contracting that the accounts were kept in the manner complained of, and in fact ratified and adopted the questioned accounting practice and policies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition must be denied.<br><br><center><b>On Procedural Misstep of Direct Appeal to This Court</b><br></center><br>As earlier recited, the ICC-ICA's Partial Award dated September 27, 2007 was confirmed by the RTC in its first assailed order of January 8, 2008. Thereafter, the RTC, by order of March 17, 2008, denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration. Therefrom, petitioners came directly to this Court on a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>This is a procedural miscue for petitioners who erroneously bypassed the Court of Appeals (CA) in pursuit of its appeal. While this procedural gaffe has not been raised by RCBC, still we would be remiss in not pointing out the proper mode of appeal from a decision of the RTC confirming, vacating, setting aside, modifying, or correcting an arbitral award.<br><br>Rule 45 is not the remedy available to petitioners as the proper mode of appeal assailing the decision of the RTC confirming as arbitral award is an appeal before the CA pursuant to Sec. 46 of Republic Act No. (RA) 9285, otherwise known as the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>, or completely, <i>An Act to Institutionalize the Use of an Alternative Dispute Resolution System in the Philippines and to Establish the Office for Alternative Dispute Resolution, and for other Purposes</i>, promulgated on April 2, 2004 and became effective on April 28, 2004 after its publication on April 13, 2004.<br><br>In <i>Korea Technologies Co., Ltd v. Lerma</i>, we explained, <i>inter alia</i>, that the RTC decision of an assailed arbitral award is appealable to the CA and may further be appealed to this Court, thus:<br><blockquote>Sec. 46 of RA 9285 provides for an appeal before the CA as the remedy of an aggrieved party in cases where the RTC sets aside, rejects, vacates, modifies, or corrects an arbitral award, thus:<br><br>SEC. 46. <i>Appeal from Court Decision or Arbitral Awards.-</i>A    decision of the Regional Trial Court confirming, vacating, setting aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award may be <b>appealed to the Court of Appeals </b>in accordance with the rules and procedure to be promulgated by the Supreme Court.<br><br>The losing party who appeals from the judgment of the court confirming an arbitral award shall be required by the appellate court to post a counterbond executed in favor of the prevailing party equal to the amount of the award in accordance with the rules to be promulgated by the Supreme Court.<br><br>Thereafter, the CA decision may further be appealed or reviewed before this Court through a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>It is clear from the factual antecedents that RA 9285 applies to the instant case. This law was already effective at the time the arbitral proceedings were commenced by RCBC through a request for arbitration filed before the ICC-ICA on May 12, 2004. Besides, the assailed confirmation order of the RTC was issued on March 17, 2008. Thus, petitioners clearly took the wrong mode of appeal and the instant petition can be outright rejected and dismissed.<br><br>Even if we entertain the petition, the outcome will be the same.<br><br><center><b>The Court Will Not Overturn an Arbitral Award </b><br><b>Unless It Was Made in Manifest Disregard of the Law</b><br></center><br>In <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court passed on similar issues as the ones tendered in the instant petition. In that case, the arbitration committee issued an arbitral award which the trial court, upon due proceedings, confirmed despite the opposition of the losing party. Motions for reconsideration by the losing party were denied. An appeal interposed by the losing party to the CA was denied due course. On appeal to this Court, we established the parameters by which an arbitral award may be set aside, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>As a rule, the award of an arbitrator cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or as to the facts. Courts are without power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the arbitrators. They will not review the findings of law and fact contained in an award, and will not undertake to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators, since any other rule would make an award the commencement, not the end, of litigation. Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision of matters submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are insufficient to invalidate an award fairly and honestly made. Judicial review of an arbitration is, thus, more limited than judicial review of a trial.</b><br><br>Nonetheless, the arbitrators' awards is not absolute and without exceptions.  The arbitrators cannot resolve issues beyond the scope of the submission agreement. The parties to such an agreement are bound by the arbitrators' award only to the extent and in the manner prescribed by the contract and only if the award is rendered in conformity thereto. Thus, Sections 24 and 25 of the Arbitration Law provide grounds for vacating, rescinding or modifying an arbitration award. Where the conditions described in Articles 2038, 2039 and 2040 of the Civil Code applicable to compromises and arbitration are attendant, the arbitration award may also be annulled.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Finally, it should be stressed that while a court is precluded from overturning an award for errors in determination of factual issues, nevertheless, if an examination of the record reveals no support whatever for the arbitrators' determinations, their award must be vacated. In the same manner, <b>an award must be vacated if it was made in "manifest disregard of the law</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Following <i>Asset Privatization Trust</i>, errors in law and fact would not generally justify the reversal of an arbitral award. A party asking for the vacation of an arbitral award must show that any of the grounds for vacating, rescinding, or modifying an award are present or that the arbitral award was made in manifest disregard of the law. Otherwise, the Court is duty-bound to uphold an arbitral award.<br><br>The instant petition dwells on the alleged manifest disregard of the law by the ICC-ICA.<br><br>The US case of <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Jaros</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> expounded on the phrase "manifest disregard of the law" in the following wise:<br><blockquote>This court has emphasized that manifest disregard of the law is a very narrow standard of review.<i> Anaconda Co. v. District Lodge No. 27, 693 F.2d 35 (6<sup>th</sup> Cir.1982)</i>. A mere error in interpretation or application of the law is insufficient. <i>Anaconda</i>, 693 F.2d at 37-38. Rather, the decision must fly in the face of clearly established legal precedent. When faced with questions of law, an arbitration panel does not act in manifest disregard of the law unless (1) the applicable legal principle is clearly defined and not subject to reasonable debate; and (2) the arbitrators refused to heed that legal principle.<br></blockquote>Thus, to justify the vacation of an arbitral award on account of "manifest disregard of the law," the arbiter's findings must clearly and unequivocally violate an established legal precedent. Anything less would not suffice.<br><br>In the present case, petitioners, in a bid to establish that the arbitral award was issued in manifest disregard of the law, allege that the Partial Award violated the principles of prescription, due process, and estoppel. A review of petitioners' arguments would, however, show that their arguments are bereft of merit. Thus, the Partial Award dated September 27, 2007 cannot be vacated.<br><br><center><b>RCBC's Claim Is Not Time-Barred</b><br></center><br>Petitioners argue that RCBC's claim under Sec. 5(g) is based on overvaluation of Bankard's revenues, assets, and net worth, hence, for price reduction falling under Sec. 5(h), in which case it was belatedly filed, for RCBC presented the claim to petitioners on May 5, 2003, when the period for presenting it under Sec. 5(h) expired on December 31, 2000.  As a counterpoint, RCBC asserts that its claim clearly comes under Sec. 5(g) in relation to Sec. 7 which thus gave it three (3) years from the closing date of June 2, 2000, or until June 1, 2003, within which to make its claim.

(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Before we address the issue put forward by petitioners, there is a necessity to determine the nature and application of the reliefs provided under Sec. 5(g) and Sec. 5(h) in conjunction with Sec. 7, thus:<br><br>(1) The relief under Sec. 5(h) is specifically for price reduction as said section explicitly states that the "Purchase Price shall be reduced in accordance with the following formula x x x."  In addition, Sec. 7 gives the aggrieved party the right to ask damages based on the stipulation that the non-defaulting party "shall have the right to require the Defaulting Party, at the latter's expense, to cure such breach and/<b>or seek damages</b>."<br><br>On the other hand, the remedy under Sec. 5(g) in conjunction with Sec. 7 can include specific performance, damages, and other reliefs <b>excluding price reduction</b>.<br><br>(2) Sec. 5(g) warranty covers the audited financial statements (AFS) for the three (3) years ending December 31, 1997 to 1999 and the unaudited financial statements (UFS) for the first quarter ending March 31, 2000.  On the other hand, the Sec. 5(h) warranty refers only to the AFS for the year ending December 31, 1999 and the UFS up to May 31, 2000.  It is undenied that Sec. 5(h) refers to price reduction as it covers "only the most up-to-date audited and unaudited financial statements upon which the price must have been based."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>(3) Under Sec. 5(h), the responsibility of petitioners for its warranty shall <b>exclude</b> the disclosures and reservations made in AFS of Bankard as of  December 31, 1999 and its UFS up to  May 31, 2000. No such exclusions were made under Sec. 5(g) with respect to the warranty of petitioners in the AFS and UFS of Bankard.<br><br>(4) Sec. 5(h) gives relief only if there is material adverse effect in the net worth in excess of PhP 100 million and it provides a formula for price reduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  On the other hand, Sec. 5(g) can be the basis for remedies like specific performance, damages, and other reliefs, except price reduction, even if the overvaluation is less or above PhP 100 million and there is no formula for computation of damages.<br><br>(5) Under Sec. 7, the aggrieved party shall present its written demand to the defaulting party within three (3) years from closing date.  Under Sec. 5(h), the written demand shall be presented within six (6) months from closing date.  In accordance with par. 2(c) of the ASPA, the deadline to file the demand under Sec. 5(h) was extended to December 31, 2000.<br><br>From the above determination, it becomes clear that the aggrieved party is entitled to two (2) separate alternative remedies under Secs. 5 and 7 of the SPA, thus:<br><blockquote><ol><li>A claim for price reduction under Sec. 5(h) and/or damages based on the breach of warranty by Bankard on the absence of liabilities, omissions and mistakes on the financial statements as of 31 December 1999 and the UFS as of 31 May 2000, provided that the material adverse effect on the net worth exceeds PhP 100M and the written demand is presented within six (6) months from closing date (extended to 31 December 2000); and<br><br></li><li>An action to cure the breach like specific performance and/or damages under Sec. 5(g) based on Bankard's breach of warranty involving its AFS for the three (3) fiscal years ending 31 December 1997, 1998, and 1999 and the UFS for the first quarter ending 31 March 2000 provided that the written demand shall be presented within three (3) years from closing date.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Has RCBC the option to choose between Sec. 5(g) or Sec. 5(h)?<br><br>The answer is yes.  Sec. 5 and Sec. 7 are clear that it is discretionary on the aggrieved parties to avail themselves of any remedy mentioned above. They may choose one and dispense with the other.  Of course, the relief for price reduction under Sec. 5(h) will have to conform to the prerequisites and time frame of six (6) months; otherwise, it is waived.<br><br>Preliminarily, petitioners' basic posture that RCBC's claim is for the recovery of overpayment is specious.  The records show that in its <i>Request for Arbitration</i> dated May 12, 2004, RCBC prayed for the rescission of the SPA, restitution of the whole purchase price, and damages not for reduction of price or for the return of any overpayment.  Even in its May 5, 2000 letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> RCBC did not ask for the recovery of any overpayment or reduction of price, merely stating in it that the accounts of Bankard, as reflected in its AFS for 1999, were overstated which, necessarily, resulted in an overpayment situation.  RCBC was emphatic and unequivocal that petitioners violated their warranty covered by Sec. 5(g) of the SPA.<br><br>It is thus evident that RCBC did not avail itself of the option under Sec. 5(h), i.e., for price reduction or the return of any overpayment arising from the overvaluation of Bankard's financial condition. Clearly, RCBC invoked Sec. 5(g) to claim damages from petitioners which is one of the alternative reliefs granted under Sec. 7 in addition to rescission and restitution of purchase price.<br><br>Petitioners do not deny that RCBC formally filed its claim under Sec. 5(g) which is anchored on the material overstatement or overvaluation of Bankard's revenues, assets, and net worth and, hence, the overstatement of the purchase price. They, however, assert that such claim for overpayment is actually a claim under Sec. 5(h) of the SPA for price reduction which it forfeited after December 31, 2000.<br><br>We cannot sustain petitioners' position.<br><br>It cannot be disputed that an overstatement or overvaluation of Bankard's financial condition as of closing date translates into a misrepresentation not only of the accuracy and truthfulness of the financial statements under Sec. 5(g), but also as to Bankard's actual net worth mentioned in Sec. 5(h). Overvaluation presupposes mistakes in the entries in the financial statements and amounts to a breach of petitioners' representations and warranties under Sec. 5.  Consequently, such error in the financial statements would impact on the figure representing the net worth of Bankard as of closing date. An overvaluation means that the financial condition of Bankard as of closing date, i.e., June 2, 2000, is overstated, a situation that will definitely result in a breach of EPCIB's representations and warranties.<br><br>A scrutiny of Sec. 5(g) and Sec. 5(h) in relation to Sec. 7 of the SPA would indicate the following remedies available to RCBC should it be discovered, as of closing date, that there is overvaluation which will constitute breach of the warranty clause under either Sec. 5(g) or (h), to wit:<br><br>(1) An overvaluation of Bankard's actual financial condition as of closing date taints the veracity and accuracy of the AFS for 1997, 1998, and 1999 and the UFS for the first quarter of 2000 and is an actionable breach of petitioners' warranties under Sec. 5(g).<br><br>(2) An overvaluation of Bankard's financial condition as of May 31, 2000, encompassing the warranted financial condition as of December 31, 1999 through the AFS for 1999 and as of March 31, 2000 through the UFS for the first quarter of 2000, is a breach of petitioners' representations and warranties under Sec. 5(h).<br><br>Thus, RCBC has two distinct alternative remedies in case of an overvaluation of Bankard's financial condition.  It may invoke Sec. 5(h) when the conditions of the threshold aggregate overvaluation and the claim made within the six-month time-bar are present.  In the alternative, it may invoke Sec. 5(g) when it finds that a claim for "curing the breach" and/or damages will be more advantageous to its interests provided it is filed within three (3) years from closing date. Since it has two remedies, RCBC may opt to exercise either one.  Of course, the exercise of either one will preclude the other.<br><br>Moreover, the language employed in Sec. 5(g) and Sec. 5(h) is clear and bereft of any ambiguity. The SPA's stipulations reveal that the non-use or waiver of Sec. 5(h) does not preclude RCBC from availing itself of the second relief under Sec. 5(g).  Article 1370 of the Civil Code is explicit that "if terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control." Since the terms of a contract have the force of law between the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> then the parties must respect and strictly conform to it. Lastly, it is a long held cardinal rule that when the terms of an agreement are reduced to writing, it is deemed to contain all the terms agreed upon and no evidence of such terms can be admitted other than the contents of the agreement itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Since the SPA is unambiguous, and petitioners failed to adduce evidence to the contrary, then they are legally bound to comply with it.<br><br>Petitioners agreed ultimately to the stipulation that:<br><blockquote>Each of the representations and warranties of the SELLERS is deemed to be a <b>separate representation and warranty</b>, and the BUYER has placed complete reliance thereon in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in entering into this Agreement. The representations and warranties of the SELLERS shall be correct as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as though such representations and warranties had been made as of the Closing Date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The Court sustains the finding in the Partial Award that Sec. 5(g) of the SPA is a free standing warranty and not constricted by Sec. 5(h) of the said agreement.<br><br>Upon the foregoing premises and in the light of the undisputed facts on record, RCBC's claim for rescission of the SPA and damages due to overvaluation of Bankard's accounts was properly for a breach of the warranty under Sec. 5(g) and was not time-barred. To repeat, RCBC presented its written claim on May 5, 2003, or a little less than a month before closing date, well within the three (3)-year prescriptive period provided under Sec. 7 for the exercise of the right provided under Sec. 5(g).<br><br>Petitioners bemoan the fact that "the arbitrators' liability award (a) disregarded the 6-month contractual limitation for RCBC's <b>`overprice' claim</b>, and [b] substituted in its place the 3-year limitation under the contract for <b>other claims</b>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> adopting in that regard the interpretation of the SPA made by arbitral tribunal member, retired Justice Kapunan, in his Dissenting Opinion, in which he asserted:<br><blockquote>Ultimately, the Claim is one for recovery of overpayment in the purchase price of the shares. And it is in this context, that I respectfully submit that Section 5(h) and not Section 5(g), applies to the present controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>True, without Section 5(h), the Claim for price recovery would fall under Section 5(g). The recovery of the pecuniary loss of the Claimant in the form of the excess price paid would be in the nature of a claim for actual damages by way of compensation. In that situation, all the accounts in the 1999 financial statements would be the subject of the warranty in Section 5(g).<br><br>However, since the parties explicitly included Section 5(h) in their SPA, which assures the Claimant that there were no "omissions or mistakes in the records" that would misstate the 1999 net worth account, <b>I am left with no other conclusion but that the accuracy of the net worth was the subject of the warranty in Section 5(h), while the accuracy or correctness of the <i>other accounts</i> that did not bear on, or affect Bankard's net worth, were guaranteed by Section 5(g)</b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This manner of reconciling the two provisions is consistent with the principle in Rule 130, Section 12 of the Rules of Court that "when a general and a particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former... [so] a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it." This is also consistent with existing doctrines on statutory construction, the application of which is illustrated in the case of Commissioner of Customs vs. Court of Tax Appeals, GR No. L-41861, dated March 23, 1987 x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The Claim is for recovery of the excess price by way of actual damages</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Justice Kapunan noted that without Sec. 5(h), RCBC's claim would fall under Sec. 5(g), impliedly admitting that both provisions could very well cover RCBC's claim, except that Sec. 5(h) excludes the situation contemplated in it from the general terms of Sec. 5(g).<br><br>Such view is incorrect.<br><br>While it is true that Sec. 5(h), as couched, is a warranty on the accuracy of the Bankard's net worth while Sec. 5(g), as also couched, is a warranty on the veracity, accuracy, and completeness of the AFS in all material respects as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed throughout the period audited, yet both warranties boil down to the same thing and stem from the same accounts as summarized in the AFS.  Since the <b>net worth is the balance of Bankard's assets less its liabilities, it necessarily includes all the accounts under the AFS</b>.  In short, <b>there are no accounts in the AFS that do not bear on the net worth of Bankard</b>.  Moreover, as earlier elucidated, any overvaluation of Bankard's net worth is necessarily a misrepresentation of the veracity, accuracy, and completeness of the AFS and also a breach of the warranty under Sec. 5(g). Thus, the subject of the warranty in Sec. 5(h) is also covered by the warranty in Sec. 5(g), and Sec. 5(h) cannot exclude such breach from the ambit of Sec. 5(g). There is no need to rely on Sec. 12, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court for both Sec. 5(g) and Sec. 5(h) as alternative remedies are of equal footing and one need not categorize one section as a general provision and the other a particular provision.<br><br>More importantly, a scrutiny of the four corners of the SPA does not explicitly reveal any stipulation nor even impliedly that the parties intended to limit the scope of the warranty in Sec. 5(g) or gave priority to Sec. 5(h) over Sec. 5(g).<br><br>The arbitral tribunal did not find any legal basis in the SPA that Sec. 5(h) "somehow cuts down" the scope of Sec. 5(g), thus:<br><blockquote>9.10 In the opinion of the Tribunal, <b>there is nothing in the wording used in the SPA to give priority to one warranty over the other. There is nothing in the wording used to indicate that the parties intended to limit the scope of the warranty in 5(g)</b>. If it be contended that, on a true construction of the two warranties, 5(h) somehow cuts down the scope of 5(g), <b>the Tribunal can find no justification for such conclusion on the wording used</b>. Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that very clear words would be needed to cut down the scope of the 5(g) warranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court upholds the conclusion of the tribunal and rules that the claim of RCBC under Sec. 5(g) is not time-barred.<br><br><center><b>Petitioners Were Not Denied Due Process</b><br></center><br>Petitioners impute on RCBC the act of creating summaries of the accounts of Bankard which "in turn were used by its experts to conclude that Bankard improperly recorded its receivables and committed material deviations from GAAP requirements."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Later, petitioners would assert that "the arbitrators' partial award admitted and used the Summaries as evidence, and held on the basis of the `information' contained in them that petitioners were in breach of their warranty in GAAP compliance."<br><br>To petitioners, the ICC-ICA's use of such summaries but without presenting the source documents violates their right to due process. Pressing the point, petitioners had moved, but to no avail, for the exclusion of the said summaries. Petitioners allege that they had reserved the right to cross-examine the witnesses of RCBC who testified on the summaries, pending the resolution of their motion to exclude. But, according to them, they were effectively denied the right to cross-examine RCBC's witnesses when the ICC-ICA admitted the summaries of RCBC as evidence.<br><br>Petitioners' position is bereft of merit.<br><br>Anent the use but non-presentation of the source documents as the jumping board for a claim of denial of due process, petitioners cite <i>Compania Maritima v.

Finally, it must be emphasized that petitioners had the opportunity to appeal the Partial Award to the RTC, which they in fact did. Later, petitioners even moved for the reconsideration of the denial of their appeal. Having been able to appeal and move for a reconsideration of the assailed rulings, petitioners cannot claim a denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' right to due process was not breached.<br><br>As regards petitioners' claim that its right to due process was violated when they were allegedly denied the right to cross-examine RCBC's witnesses, their claim is also bereft of merit.<br><br>Sec. 15 of RA 876 or the <i>Arbitration Law</i> provides that:<br><blockquote>Section 15.  <i>Hearing by arbitrators</i>. -- Arbitrators may, at the commencement of the hearing, ask both parties for brief statements of the issues in controversy and/or an agreed statement of facts. Thereafter the parties may offer such evidence as they desire, and shall produce such additional evidence as the arbitrators shall require or deem necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute. <b>The arbitrators shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence offered or produced, and shall not be bound to conform to the Rules of Court pertaining to evidence. Arbitrators shall receive as exhibits in evidence any document which the parties may wish to submit and the exhibits shall be properly identified at the time of submission. </b>All exhibits shall remain in the custody of the Clerk of Court during the course of the arbitration and shall be returned to the parties at the time the award is made. The arbitrators may make an ocular inspection of any matter or premises which are in dispute, but such inspection shall be made only in the presence of all parties to the arbitration, unless any party who shall have received notice thereof fails to appear, in which event such inspection shall be made in the absence of such party. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The well-settled rule is that administrative agencies exercising quasi-judicial powers shall not be fettered by the rigid technicalities of procedure, albeit they are, at all times required, to adhere to the basic concepts of fair play. The Court wrote in <i>CMP Federal Security Agency, Inc. v. NLRC</i>:<br><blockquote>While administrative tribunals exercising quasi-judicial powers, like the NLRC and Labor Arbiters, are free from the rigidity of certain procedural requirements, they are nonetheless bound by law and practice to observe the fundamental and essential requirements of due process. The standard of due process that must be met in administrative tribunals allows a certain degree of latitude as long as fairness is not ignored. Hence, it is <i>not</i> legally objectionable, for being violative of due process, for the Labor Arbiter to resolve a case based solely on the position papers, affidavits ordocumentary evidence submitted by the parties. The affidavits of witnesses in such case may take the place of their direct testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>Of the same tenor is our holding in <i>Quiambao v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><blockquote>In resolving administrative cases, conduct of full-blown trial is not indispensable to dispense justice to the parties. The requirement of notice and hearing does not connote full adversarial proceedings. Submission of position papers may be sufficient for as long as the parties thereto are given the opportunity to be heard. <b>In administrative proceedings, the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, or an opportunity to explain one's side or opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. This constitutional mandate is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek reconsideration of an action or a ruling.</b> It does not require trial-type proceedings similar to those in the courts of justice. Where opportunity to be heard either through oral arguments or through pleadings is accorded, there is no denial of procedural due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Citing <i>Vertudes v. Buenaflor</i>, petitioners also cry denial of due process when they were allegedly denied the right to cross-examine the witnesses presented by RCBC. It is true that in <i>Vertudes</i>, we stated: "The right of a party to confront and cross-examine opposing witnesses in a judicial litigation, be it criminal or civil in nature, or in proceedings before administrative tribunals with quasi-judicial powers, is a fundamental right which is part of due process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>It is, however, equally true that:<br><blockquote>[T]he right is a personal one which may be waived expressly or impliedly by conduct amounting to a renunciation of the right of cross-examination. <b>Thus, where a party has had the opportunity to cross-examine a witness but failed to avail himself of it, he necessarily forfeits the right to cross-examine</b><b> and the testimony given on direct examination of the witness will be received or allowed to remain in the record.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><b> </b>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>We also held in one case:<br><blockquote><b>However, the right has always been understood as requiring not necessarily an actual cross-examination but merely an opportunity to exercise the right to cross-examine if desired. What is proscribed by statutory norm and jurisprudential precept is the absence of the opportunity to cross-examine.</b> The right is a personal one and may be waived expressly or impliedly.  There is an implied waiver when the party was given the opportunity to confront and cross-examine an opposing witness but failed to take advantage of it for reasons attributable to himself alone. If by his actuations, the accused lost his opportunity to cross-examine wholly or in part the witnesses against him, his right to cross-examine is impliedly waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>And later in <i>Velez v. De Vera</i>, the Court <i>En Banc</i> expounded on the above rulings, adding that in administrative proceedings, cross-examination is not indispensable, thus:<br><blockquote>Due process of law in administrative cases is not identical with "judicial process" for a trial in court is not always essential to due process. While a day in court is a matter of right in judicial proceedings, it is otherwise in administrative proceedings since they rest upon different principles. The due process clause guarantees no particular form of procedure and its requirements are not technical. Thus, in certain proceedings of administrative character, the right to a notice or hearing [is] not essential to due process of law. The constitutional requirement of due process is met by a fair hearing before a regularly established administrative agency or tribunal. It is not essential that hearings be had before the making of a determination if thereafter, there is available trial and tribunal before which all objections and defenses to the making of such determination may be raised and considered. One adequate hearing is all that due process requires. What is required for "hearing" may differ as the functions of the administrative bodies differ.<br><br><b>The right to cross-examine is not an indispensable aspect of due process.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Clearly, the right to cross-examine a witness, although a fundamental right of a party, may be waived. Petitioners themselves admit having had the opportunity to cross-examine RCBC's witnesses during the hearings before the tribunal, but declined to do so by reserving such right at a later time. Having had the opportunity to cross-examine RCBC's witnesses, petitioners were not denied their right to due process.<br><br><center><b>RCBC Is Not Estopped from Questioning</b><br><b>the Financial Condition of Bankard</b></center><br>On estoppel, petitioners contend that RCBC already knew the recording of the Bankard accounts before it paid the balance of the purchase price and could no longer challenge the financial statements of Bankard. RCBC, they claim, had full control of the operations of Bankard since June 2, 2000 and RCBC's audit team reviewed the accounts in September 2000. Thus, RCBC is now precluded from denying the fairness and accuracy of said accounts since it did not seek price reduction under Sec. 5(h). Lastly, they asseverate that RCBC continued with Bankard's accounting policies and practices and found them to conform to the generally accepted accounting principles, contrary to RCBC's allegations.<br><br>It also bears stating that in his dissent, retired Justice Kapunan, an arbitral tribunal member, argued that Bankard's accounting practices were disclosed in the information memorandum provided to RCBC; hence, RCBC was supposed to know such accounting practices and to have accepted their propriety even before the execution of the SPA. He then argued that when it paid the purchase price on December 29, 2000, RCBC could no longer claim that the accounting practices that went into the reporting of the 1999 AFS of Bankard were not in accord with generally accepted accounting principles. He pointed out that RCBC was bound by the audit conducted by a certain Rubio prior to the full payment of the purchase price of Bankard. Anchored on these statements by Justice Kapunan, petitioners conclude that RCBC is estopped from claiming that the former violated their warranties under the SPA.<br><br>Petitioners' contention is not meritorious.<br><br>Art. 1431 of the Civil Code, on the subject of estoppel, provides: "Through estoppel an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon."<br><br>The doctrine of estoppel is based upon the grounds of public policy, fair dealing, good faith, and justice; and its purpose is to forbid one to speak against one's own acts, representations, or commitments to the injury of one to whom they were directed and who reasonably relied on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>We explained the principle of estoppel in <i>Philippine Savings Bank v. Chowking Food Corporation</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x The equitable doctrine of estoppel was explained by this Court in <i>Caltex (Philippines ), Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><blockquote>Under the doctrine of estoppel, an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon. A party may not go back on his own acts and representations to the prejudice of the other party who relied upon them. In the law of evidence, whenever a party has, by his own declaration, act, or omission, intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true, to act upon such belief, he cannot, in any litigation arising out of such declaration, act, or omission, be permitted to falsify it.<br></blockquote>The principle received further elaboration in <i>Maneclang  v. Baun</i>:<br><blockquote>In estoppel by <i>pais</i>, as related to the party sought to be estopped, it is necessary that there be a concurrence of the following requisites: (a) conduct amounting to false representation or concealment of material facts or at least calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (b) intent, or at least expectation that this conduct shall be acted upon, or at least influenced by the other party; and (c) knowledge, actual or constructive of the actual facts.<br></blockquote>Estoppel may vary somewhat in definition, but all authorities agree that <b>a party invoking the doctrine must have been misled to one's prejudice</b>. That is the final and, in reality, most important of the elements of equitable estoppel. It is this element that is lacking here.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The elements of estoppel pertaining to the party estopped are:<br><blockquote>(1) conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or, at least, which calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention, or at least expectation, that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the actual facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the first element of estoppel in relation to the party sought to be estopped is not present. Petitioners claim that RCBC misrepresented itself when RCBC made it appear that they considered petitioners to have sufficiently complied with its warranties under Sec. 5(g) and 5(h), in relation to Sec. 7 of the SPA. Petitioners' position is that "RCBC was aware of the manner in which the Bankard accounts were recorded, well before it consummated the SPA by taking delivery of the shares and paying the outstanding 80% balance of the contract price."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, therefore, theorize that in this case, the first element of estoppel in relation to the party sought to be estopped is that RCBC made a false representation that it considered Bankard's accounts to be in order and, thus, RCBC abandoned any claim under Sec. 5(g) and 5(h) by its inaction.<br><br>Such contention is incorrect.<br><br>It must be emphasized that it was only after a second audit that RCBC presented its claim to petitioners for violation of Sec. 5(g), within the three (3)-year period prescribed. In other words, RCBC, prior to such second audit, did not have full and thorough knowledge of the correctness of Bankard's accounts, in relation to Sec. 5(g). RCBC, therefore, could not have misrepresented itself considering that it was still in the process of verifying the warranties covered under Sec. 5(g). Considering that there must be a concurrence of the elements of estoppel for it to arise, on this ground alone such claim is already negated. As will be shown, however, all the other elements of estoppel are likewise absent in the case at bar.<br><br>As to the second element, in order to establish estoppel, RCBC must have intended that petitioners would act upon its actions. This element is also missing. RCBC by its actions did not mislead petitioners into believing that it waived any claim for violation of a warranty. The periods under Sec. 5(g) and 5(h) were still available to RCBC.<br><br>The element that petitioners relied on the acts and conduct of RCBC is absent. The Court finds that there was no reliance on the part of petitioners on the acts of RCBC that would lead them to believe that the RCBC will forego the filing of a claim under Sec. 5(g). The allegation that RCBC knew that the Bankard accounts did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles before payment and, hence, it cannot question the financial statements of Bankard is meritless. Precisely, the SPA explicitly provides that claims for violation of the warranties under Sec. 5(g) can still be filed within three (3) years from the closing date. Petitioners' contention that RCBC had full control of Bankard operations after payment of the price and that an audit undertaken by the Rubio team did not find anything wrong with the accounts could not have plausibly misled petitioners into believing that RCBC will waive its right to file a claim under Sec. 5(g). After all, the period to file a claim under Sec. 5(g) is three (3) years under Sec. 7, much longer than the six (6)-month period under Sec. 5(h). Petitioners are fully aware that the warranties under Sec. 5(g) (1997 up to March 2000) are of a wider scope than that of Sec. 5(h) (AFS of 1999 and UFS up to May 31, 2000), necessitating a longer audit period than the six (6)-month period under Sec. 5(h).<br><br>The third element of estoppel in relation to the party sought to be estopped is also absent considering that, as stated, RCBC was still in the process of verifying the correctness of Bankard's accounts prior to presenting its claim of overvaluation to petitioners. RCBC, therefore, had no sufficient knowledge of the correctness of Bankard's accounts.<br><br>On another issue, RCBC could not have immediately changed the Bankard accounting practices until it had conducted a more extensive and thorough audit of Bankard's voluminous records and transactions to uncover any irregularities. That would be the only logical explanation why Bankard's alleged irregular practices were maintained for more than two (2) years from closing date. The fact that RCBC continued with the audit of Bankard's AFS and records after the termination of the Rubio audit can only send the clear message to petitioners that RCBC is still entertaining the possibility of filing a claim under Sec. 5(g). It cannot then be said that petitioners' reliance on RCBC's acts after full payment of the price could have misled them into believing that no more claim will be presented by RCBC.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal explained in detail why estoppel is not present in the case at bar, thus:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">10.18</div></td> <td colspan="2" width="90%"><div align="justify">The audit exercise conducted by Mr. Legaspi and Mr. Rubio was clearly not one comprehensive enough to have discovered the problems later unearthed by Dr. Laya and Dean Ledesma. x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">10.19</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Although the powers of the TC [Transition Committee] may have been widely expressed in the view of Mr. Rogelio Chua, then in charge of Bankard x x x the TC conducted meetings only to get updated on the status and progress of Bankard's operations.

We agree with the findings of the tribunal that estoppel is not present in the situation at bar.<br><br>Additionally, petitioners claim that in <i>Knecht v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> and <i>Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals </i>(<i>Coca-Cola</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court ruled that the absence of the element of reliance by a party on the representation of another does not negate the principle of estoppel. Those cases are, however, not on all fours with and cannot be applied to this case.<br><br>In <i>Knecht</i>, the buyer had the opportunity of knowing the conditions of the land he was buying early on in the transaction, but proceeded with the sale anyway. According to the Court, the buyer was estopped from claiming that the vendor made a false representation as to the condition of the land. This is not true in the instant case. RCBC did not conduct a due diligence audit in relation to Sec.5(g) prior to the sale due to petitioners' express representations and warranties. The examination conducted by RCBC, through Rubio, after the execution of the SPA on June 2, 2000, was confined to finding any breach under Sec. 5(h) for a possible reduction of the purchase price prior to the payment of its balance on December 31, 2000. Further, the parties clearly agreed under Sec. 7 of the SPA to a three (3)-year period from closing date within which to present a claim for damages for violation of the warranties under the SPA. Hence, <i>Knecht</i> is not a precedent to the case at bar.<br><br>So is <i>Coca-Cola</i>. As lessee, Coca-Cola Bottlers was well aware of the nature and situation of the land relative to its intended use prior to the signing of the contract. Its subsequent assertion that the land was not suited for the purpose it was leased was, therefore, cast aside for being unmeritorious. Such circumstance does not obtain in the instant case. There was no prior due diligence audit conducted by RCBC, it having relied, as earlier stated, on the warranties of petitioners with regard to the financial condition of Bankard under Sec. 5(g). As such, Sec. 5(g) guaranteed RCBC that it could file a claim for damages for any mistakes in the AFS and UFS of Bankard. Clearly, <i>Coca-Cola</i> also cannot be applied to the instant case.<br><br>It becomes evident from all of the foregoing findings that the ICC-ICA is not guilty of any manifest disregard of the law on estoppel. As shown above, the findings of the ICC-ICA in the Partial Award are well-supported in law and grounded on facts. The Partial Award must be upheld.<br><br>We close this disposition with the observation that a member of the three-person arbitration panel was selected by petitioners, while another was respondent's choice. The respective interests of the parties, therefore, are very much safeguarded in the arbitration proceedings. Any suggestion, therefore, on the partiality of the arbitration tribunal has to be dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
