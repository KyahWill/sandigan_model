				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the September 17, 2004 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and January 20, 2005 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 74248.<br><br>The spouses Santiago and Maria Samson were the owners of parcels of land covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 21671 (covering an area of 1,440 sq. m.) and 10353 (945 sq. m.) classified as unirrigated rice land and residential land, respectively,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> located in Poblacion, Lingayen, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  After the death of the spouses, their heirs executed an "extrajudicial settlement and ratification of an absolute deed of sale" on March 24, 1955 over the property described as follows:<br><blockquote>A parcel of land covered by <b>Tax Declaration No[s]. 21671 &amp; No. 10353</b> of the Province of Pangasinan.  x x x  Containing an area of <b>SIX (6) ARES AND EIGHTY SIX (86) CENTARES more or less</b> x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the agreement, the heirs equally divided among themselves the land they inherited.  Marceliano Samson (one of the children of the spouses) acquired, for valuable consideration, all the shares of his co-heirs over the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  On May 17, 1965, he died intestate and with no known legitimate or adopted children,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> leaving a parcel of land containing an area of 1,270 sq. m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On December 31, 1997, Fe Ramona Versoza Samson and respondent Katrina Isabel Samson Yulo (a compulsory heir of Marceliano)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> executed a "deed of extrajudicial settlement of estate of a deceased person" over the 1,270 sq. m. parcel of land they inherited from Marceliano which they divided as follows:  553 sq. m. for Versoza Samson and 717 sq. m. (including the residential house built thereon) for respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Consequently,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> respondent filed in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Lingayen, Pangasinan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> an application for registration of title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> over her share of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  She complied with all the jurisdictional requirements.  Only the Director of Lands, as represented by the Solicitor General, opposed.  After respondent presented her evidence, the MTC granted the application in a decision dated December 18, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Not satisfied with the decision, petitioner Republic of the Philippines appealed to the CA.  In a decision dated September 17, 2004, the CA affirmed the MTC decision. It dismissed the appeal and ordered petitioner to pay the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Reconsideration was denied in a resolution dated January 20, 2005.  The CA agreed with the MTC that respondent's claim was valid because it covered a portion of the land owned by the spouses Santiago and Maria which, in turn, was acquired by Marceliano from whom she (respondent) inherited the same.<br><br>Hence this petition.<br><br>Petitioner raises two issues: (1) whether the land claimed by respondent is included in the land she inherited from Marceliano and (2) whether the imposition of costs against petitioner is proper.<br><br>The petition is partially meritorious.<br><br>Petitioner argues that, according to the agreement of the heirs of Santiago and Maria, the property acquired by Marceliano had an area of "six (6) <i>ares</i> and eighty six (86) <i>centares</i>" which was equivalent to 686 sq. m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  This was much smaller than the parcel which respondent and Versoza Samson divided between the two of them (1,270 sq. m.).<br><br>Respondent counters that the same agreement stated that the property was covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 21671 and 10353 which pertained to a combined area of 2,385 sq. m.  The area described as containing only 686 sq. m. was therefore a mistake.<br><br>We disagree with the argument of petitioner. The identification of the land being claimed is a factual finding supported by evidence and cannot be disturbed in this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Both the CA and MTC found that the subject land was a portion of the land which respondent inherited from her predecessor.  They considered the total land area covered by the tax declarations. We see no reason to disturb such factual determination.<br><br>However, we agree with petitioner that costs should not have been imposed on it.  Sec. 1, Rule 142 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1.  <i>Costs ordinarily follow results of suit</i>. -  Unless otherwise provided in these rules, costs shall be allowed to the prevailing party as a matter of course, but the court shall have power, for special reasons, to adjudge that either party shall pay the costs of an action, or that the same be divided, as may be equitable.  <b>No costs shall be allowed against the Republic of the Philippines unless otherwise provided by law</b>.  (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>It is a well-established rule that costs are not recoverable against petitioner unless otherwise provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  The CA did not cite any provision of law authorizing such imposition of costs. Thus, the assessment of costs against petitioner should be removed for being unwarranted and violative of the aforequoted provision of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.  The imposition of costs against petitioner is <b>DELETED</b>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Carpio, Azcuna,</i> and <i>Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur,<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Jose L.
