				<H3>ATTY. UBALDINO A. LACUROM, Complainant, vs. JUDGE JUANITA C. TIENZO, Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, Cabanatuan City, Respondent.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For resolution is an administrative complaint
charging Judge Juanita C. Tienzo of the Regional Trial Court (RTC),
Branch 27, Cabanatuan City, with Gross Ignorance of the Law or
Procedure in connection with two (2) separate cases: one is for
Replevin or Sum of Money, while the other is an appealed case of
Unlawful Detainer from the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC),
Branch 3, Cabanatuan City.<br><br>
On the first charge, complainant, Atty. Ubaldino A. Lacurom, assails
the issuance by respondent judge of a writ of replevin in Civil Case
No. 4971 entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">Roy G. Claudio and Michael Allan Parungao v. Carlos Dy and John Doe</span>,” for violation of Sections 2(a),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 6,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 7,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rule 60 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>
According to complainant, respondent judge should have desisted from
issuing the writ as plaintiff Claudio in Civil Case No. 4971 failed to
prove that he is the owner of the subject vehicle, and consequently
entitled to its possession. Complainant points out that Claudio admits
the sale of the subject vehicle to defendant, and the same had been the
object of several conveyances to third persons.<br><br>
In addition, complainant avers that respondent judge delayed the
release of the property despite a third-party claim thereon.
Apparently, respondent judge granted plaintiffs an extension of time
within which to post the required indemnity bond. As such, the subject
vehicle remained with the sheriff in excess of the five-day period
provided in Section 6, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>
Thereafter, respondent judge, instead of ordering the return of the
vehicle to the third-party claimant, issued an order not only granting
plaintiffs’ motion for delivery of the vehicle, but also setting aside
an earlier order which required plaintiffs to post an indemnity bond.<br><br>



On the second charge relating to Civil Case No. 4884, complainant alleges that respondent judge rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
in violation of the constitutional mandate to state clearly and
distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, and Section 1,
Rule 36 of the Rules of Court echoing the same requisite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>
Complainant further charges that respondent judge issued an order
written in the English language, and in a fashion that does not befit
an RTC Judge which thereby demonstrates her incompetence and lack of
diligence. However, complainant discloses that the inclusion of the
foregoing matter in his administrative complaint was merely at the
behest of his former colleague, Feliciano Buenaventura, a retired
presiding judge of RTC, Branch 27, Cabanatuan City.<br><br>



In response, respondent judge vehemently opposed, and prayed for the outright dismissal of, the complaint because:



<blockquote><ol><li>(That) the complainant has no legal personality to commence the instant administrative complaint;</li><br><li>(That) the complainant has no cause of action against the
respondent considering that the complaint is legally and factually
baseless, perjurious in nature, malicious and only intends to harass
the [respondent];</li><br><li>The complainant has no locus standi to raise the second issue
considering he is not a person directly affected by the Decision of the
Court;</li><br><li>(That) the Decision of the Court dated July 21, 2005 is made in
accordance with Section 24 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines of BP
Blg. 129 and the ruling of the Honorable Supreme Court in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Francisco v. Permskul</span>, G.R. No. 81006 dated May 12, 1989, thus it is lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>
Corollary to the proffered grounds for dismissal of the complaint,
respondent judge argues that complainant is not the real party in
interest in Civil Case No. 4971. She posits that the proper parties are
the defendants-litigants whose interests were ostensibly aggrieved and
prejudiced by the Order of Release of the vehicle in favor of the
plaintiffs-applicants, and not the complainant who has no apparent
authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to institute the administrative complaint against her.<br><br>
Respondent judge next contends that the issuance of the writ of
replevin was done in the discharge of her judicial functions which are
presumed to have been regularly performed. Accordingly, she claims that
the assailed order cannot be used as ground for an administrative case
against her in the absence of malice, dishonesty and corrupt motive on
her part. Under the circumstances, even if the Order was erroneously
issued, complainant’s proper remedy is to file a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> or an appeal, as may be applicable, and not the instant administrative case.<br><br>
Respondent judge likewise points out that the complaint contained false
statements considering complainant’s categorical admission that he had
strongly opposed the release of the property to plaintiff Claudio.<br><br>



As regards the diminutive decision in Civil Case No. 4884, respondent judge again questions complainant’s <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi</span>
to institute the complaint. She emphasizes that Atty. Buenaventura did
not, in fact, appeal the decision to the appellate court. At any rate,
respondent judge submits that her decision is in accord with the ruling
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Francisco v. Permskul</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> wherein this Court sustained the validity of memorandum decisions.<br><br>
In his reply, complainant refuted respondent judge’s arguments,
contending that the rule on real party-in-interest is not applicable to
administrative cases. Section 1, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
permits a party who has personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the
complaint to lodge administrative charges against an erring judge. In
all, complainant reiterated the allegations in his complaint.<br><br>
Evaluating the parties’ respective claims, the Office of the Court
Administrator (OCA) considered the complaint partly meritorious. Anent
the first charge, the OCA found that the error imputed to the
respondent judge in her challenged order is of a judicial character.
Essentially, complainant assails respondent judge’s interpretation of
the law and rules of procedure on Replevin. The OCA asserted that
complainant’s remedy lies with the courts for the appropriate
corrective judicial action, and not in this administrative complaint.<br><br>
On the second issue pertaining to the minute decision in Civil Case No.
4884, the OCA noted that if the decision had already attained finality,
then the absence of an appeal evinces the parties’ satisfaction with
the judgment. Otherwise, a challenge thereto would have been brought
before the higher courts. Accordingly, the OCA believed that
complainant lacks standing to question the said decision.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the OCA found respondent judge guilty of gross ignorance
of the law or procedure in her blatant disregard of the constitutional
mandate that no decision shall be rendered by any court without
expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on
which it is based.<br><br>



We agree with the OCA.<br><br>
After a careful scrutiny of the records, we sustain the OCA’s finding
that the charge respecting the erroneous issuance of the writ of
replevin in Civil Case No. 4971 is clearly judicial in nature. The
instant administrative complaint is not the proper remedy to assail the
legality of respondent judge’s order. In this regard, we have
previously held that where sufficient judicial remedies exist, the
filing of an administrative complaint is not the proper recourse to
correct a judge’s allegedly erroneous act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>
Indeed, as a matter of public policy, not every error or mistake
committed by judges in the performance of their official duties renders
them administratively liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
In the absence of fraud, dishonesty or deliberate intent to do an
injustice, acts done in their official capacity, even though erroneous,
do not always constitute misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>
Only errors that are tainted with fraud, corruption or malice may be
the subject of disciplinary actions. For administrative liability to
attach, respondent must be shown to have been moved by bad faith,
dishonesty, hatred or some other similar motive. Verily, judges may not
be held administratively liable for any of their official acts, no
matter how erroneous, as long as they acted in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>



However, with respect to the decision in Civil Case No. 4884, we find respondent judge administratively liable therefor.<br><br>



In that case, respondent judge ruled in this wise, to wit:



<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">N</span></div><br>
After a cursory study of this appealed case of Unlawful Detainer, this
Court finds that the procedural due process [has] been complied with
under the Summary Procedure. The Decision of the Lower Court cannot be
disturbed by this Court.<br><br>



WHEREFORE, the Decision of the said Lower Court, MTCC, Branch III, Cabanatuan City, is hereby AFFIRMED en toto.<br><br>



SO ORDERED.<br><br>



Cabanatuan City, July 21, 2005.
</blockquote>




The quoted decision does not measure up to the clear constitutional command:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>



<blockquote>SEC. 14. No decision shall be rendered by any court without
expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on
which it is based.</blockquote>





Section 1, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court likewise reflects the foregoing mandate, thus:



<blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rendition of judgments and final orders</span>.
– A judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be
in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating
clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based,
signed by him, and filed with the clerk of court.</blockquote>





Notwithstanding this unequivocal rule, respondent judge insists that her decision is in accord with our holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Francisco v. Permskul</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>



We reject respondent judge’s insistence.&nbsp; Although we have sustained the validity of memorandum decisions on several occasions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we laid down specific requirements for the proper utility thereof:



<blockquote>The memorandum decision, to be valid, cannot incorporate
the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of the lower court only
by <span style="font-style: italic;">remote</span> reference, which is
to say that the challenged decision is not easily and immediately
available to the person reading the memorandum decision. For the
incorporation by reference to be allowed, it must provide for <span style="font-style: italic;">direct</span> access to the facts and the law being adopted, which must be contained in a statement <span style="font-style: italic;">attached</span>
to the said decision. In other words, the memorandum decision
authorized under Section 40 of B.P. Blg. 129 should actually embody the
findings of fact and conclusions of law of the lower court in an annex
attached to and made an indispensable part of the decision.<br><br>
It is expected that this requirement will allay suspicion that no study
was made of the decision of the lower court and that its decision was
merely affirmed without a proper examination of the facts and law on
which it is based. The <span style="font-style: italic;">proximity</span>
at least of the annexed statement should suggest that such an
examination has been undertaken. It is, of course, also understood that
the decision being adopted should, to begin with, comply with Article
VIII, Section 14 as no amount of incorporation or adoption will rectify
its violation.<br><br>
The Court finds it necessary to emphasize that the memorandum decision
should be sparingly used lest it become an addictive excuse for
judicial sloth. It is an additional condition for its validity that
this kind of decision may be resorted only in cases where the facts are
in the main accepted by both parties or easily determinable by the
judge and there are no doctrinal complications involved that will
require an extended discussion of the laws involved. The memorandum
decision may be employed in simple litigations only, such as ordinary
collection cases, where the appeal is obviously groundless and deserves
no more than the time needed to dismiss it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</blockquote>
It is obvious that the decision rendered by respondent judge failed to
conform to this requirement. The cryptic decision simply referenced the
appealed decision of the MTCC and forthwith found the same as compliant
with procedural due process under the Rules of Summary Procedure.
Nowhere in the decision does respondent judge make a statement of the
facts which led to the filing of the appeal. More importantly, the
decision does not contain respondent judge’s factual findings, albeit
affirming those of the MTCC, from which she based her conclusions of
law. Ineluctably, respondent judge transgressed the constitutional
directive.<br><br>
The transgression is compounded by respondent judge’s insistence that
her decision conformed to our ruling on memorandum decisions. It is not
amiss to remind respondent judge of our final words in the case which
she invokes:
<blockquote>Henceforth, all memorandum decisions shall comply with the
requirements herein set forth as to the form prescribed and the
occasions when they may be rendered. Any deviation will summon the
strict enforcement of Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution and
strike down the flawed judgment as a lawless disobedience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>
Although not every judicial error signifies ignorance of the law which
warrants administrative sanction, this holds true only in instances of
tolerable misjudgment. Where, however, an elementary constitutional
mandate is violated, the blunder constitutes ignorance of the law.<br><br>



From the foregoing disquisition, we find that an imposition of a fine of <s>P</s>20,000.00 upon respondent judge is in order.<br><br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, respondent Judge
Juanita C. Tienzo is hereby found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law,
and is ordered to pay a FINE of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (<s>P</s>20,000.00)
upon notice. She is sternly WARNED that a repetition of the same
offense will be dealt with more severely. The other charge is DISMISSED
for lack of merit.<br><br>

<blockquote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the applicant is the owner of the
property claimed, particularly describing it, or is entitled to the

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 6</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Disposition of property by sheriff</span>.—
If within five (5) days after the taking of the property by the
sheriff, the adverse party does not object to the sufficiency of the
bond, or of the surety or sureties thereon; or if the adverse party so
objects and the court affirms its approval of the applicant’s bond or
approves a new bond, or if the adverse party requires the return of the
property but his bond is objected to and found insufficient and he does
not forthwith file an approved bond, the property shall be delivered to
the applicant. If for any reason the property is not delivered to the
applicant, the sheriff must return it to the adverse party.<br><br>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 7</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Proceedings where property claimed by third person</span>.—
If the property taken is claimed by any person other than the party
against whom the writ of replevin had been issued or his agent, and
such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto, or right to the
possession thereof, stating the grounds therefore, and serves such
affidavit upon the sheriff while the latter has possession of the
property and a copy thereof upon the applicant, the sheriff shall not
be bound to keep the property under replevin or deliver it to the
applicant unless the applicant or his agent, on demand of said sheriff,
shall file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party
claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property under
replevin as provided under Section 2 hereof. In case of disagreement as
to such value, the court shall determine the same. No claim for damages
for the taking or the keeping of the property may be enforced against
the bond unless the action therefore is filed within one hundred twenty
(120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<br><br>
The sheriff shall not be liable for damages, for the taking or keeping
of such property, to any such third-party claimant if such bond shall
be filed. Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any
third person from vindicating his claim to the property, or prevent the
applicant from claiming damages against a third-party claimant who
filed a frivolous or plainly spurious claim, in the same or separate
action.<br><br>
When the writ of replevin is issued in favor of the Republic of the
Philippines, or any officer duly representing it, the filing of such
bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff is sued for damages
as a result of the replevin, he shall be represented by the Solicitor
General, and if held liable therefor, the actual damages adjudged by
the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of the funds to
be appropriated for the purpose.<br><br>
