				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before Us are two communications, 1) a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 23 August 2007, of Hon. Cancio C. Garcia, Associate Justice of this Court; and 2) a <span style="font-style: italic;">Memorandum</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
dated 29 August 2007 of Corazon G. Ferrer-Flores, Deputy Clerk of Court
and Chief of Office, Fiscal Management and Budget Office (FMBO), also
of this Court. Both communications, addressed to Chief Justice Reynato
S. Puno, embody a request for clarification whether or not to tack
earned leave credits in the computation of Longevity Pay upon
compulsory retirement of Justices and Judges. Justice Garcia’s letter
reads in part –
<blockquote>I am ending my more than 45 years of government service by
midnight of 19 October 2007, 30 years, 10 months and 26 days of which
were with the judiciary x x x.<br><br>
I am presently receiving monthly longevity pay computed at thirty
percent (30%) of my basic salary, conformably with Sec. 42 of BP 129
which pertinently provides:
<blockquote>Sec. 42. <span style="font-style: italic;">Longevity Pay</span>.
– A monthly longevity pay equivalent to 5% of the monthly basic pay
shall be paid to the Justices and Judges of the courts herein created
for each five years continuous, efficient and meritorious service
rendered in the judiciary x x x.</blockquote>



As of 19 October 2007, my <span style="font-weight: bold;">earned leave credits</span> would have reached a total of 1,499.5 days which would be equivalent to 5 years, 8 months, and 3.5 days x x x.<br><br>



x x x x<br><br>



Under <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative Circular No. 58-2003</span>,
my retirement pay, and God-willing, my monthly pension five (5) years
later, shall have to be computed by tacking my leave credits of 5
years, 8 months and 3.5 days to my total years of service in the
judiciary (30 years, 10 months and 26 days), making a total of 36
years, 6 months 29.5 days or 36.58 years, thus, increasing my monthly
longevity pay to thirty six percent (36%). It will be noted that the
Circular makes no distinction as to what branch of the government the
leave credits were earned for purposes of increasing the longevity pay
of Justices and Judges who reach the age of compulsory retirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</blockquote>




In connection thereto, the FMBO Chief, in her Memorandum, relates that –



<blockquote>Upon the request of Justice Gutierrez and Justice Garcia,
we have computed their estimated retirement benefits under Republic Act
No. 910 (RA 910), as amended. The computation of their retirement
benefits did not consider the tacking of earned leave credits in the
computation of longevity pay provided under Administrative Circular No.
58-2003. [Citation omitted.]<br><br>
Associate Justice Renato C. Dacudao, who retired from the Court of
Appeals on June 19, 2007, likewise requests, in his letter dated August
6, 2007 [citation omitted], that his earned leave credits be tacked for
the purpose of computing his longevity pay in accordance with
Administrative Circular No. 58-2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</blockquote>
To recall, a similar situation arose sometime in 2003, prior to the
compulsory retirement of then Senior Associate Justice Josue N.
Bellosillo, also of this Court. In a letter-request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated 25 September 2003, docketed as A.M. No. 03-9-20-SC entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">Re: Request of Senior Associate Justice Josue N. Bellosillo for Computation of His Longevity Pay upon Compulsory Retirement</span>,”
then Senior Associate Justice Bellosillo asked this Court that his
earned leave credits be tacked to his judicial service to increase his
longevity pay. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
dated 7 October 2003, this Court resolved to grant said request.
Consequently, on 11 November 2003, this Court approved and adopted
Administrative Circular (A.C.) No. 58-2003 entitled “<span style="font-style: italic;">ALLOWING
THE TACKING OF EARNED LEAVE CREDITS IN THE COMPUTATION OF LONGEVITY PAY
UPON COMPULSORY RETIREMENT OF JUSTICES AND JUDGES</span>,” which, in whole, provides that:



<blockquote>WHEREAS, The Court has studied proposals to allow the
tacking of earned leave credits to the length of judicial service for
computation of the longevity pay.<br><br>
WHEREAS, Section 42 of Batas Pambansa (BP) 129 provides for a monthly
longevity pay equivalent to 5% of the monthly basic pay for every five
years of service rendered in the judiciary;<br><br>
WHEREAS, it is true that vacation and sick leave credits earned during
the period of employment are, by their nature and purpose, generally
enjoyed during employment; however, the law does not preclude the
accumulation of these leave credits, not to be paid while one is
working, but to be reserved for senior age;<br><br>
WHEREAS, retirement laws are liberally interpreted in favor of the
retiree because their intention is to provide for his sustenance, and
hopefully even comfort, when he no longer has the stamina to continue
earning his livelihood and the liberal approach aims to achieve the
humanitarian purposes of the law in order that the efficiency,
security, and well-being of government personnel may be enhanced;<br><br>
WHEREAS, laws pertaining to retiring government personnel should be
liberally construed to benefit retiring personnel, following an
interpretation that rightly expresses the nation’s gratitude towards
the women and men who have tirelessly and faithfully served the
government;<br><br>
WHEREAS, earned leave credits, computed in accordance with Section 40,
Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, should accordingly be allowed
to increase the longevity pay of Justices and Judges reaching the age
of compulsory retirement;<br><br>
NOW, THEREFORE, the COURT RESOLVED, as it hereby RESOLVES, that earned
leave credits shall be allowed to be tacked to the length of judicial
service for the purpose of increasing the longevity pay of Justices and
Judges who reach the age of compulsory retirement. The computation
should also include the additional percentage of longevity pay that
corresponds to any fraction of a five-year period in the total number
of years of continuous, efficient and meritorious service rendered,
considering that the retiree would no longer be able to complete the
period because of his compulsory retirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</blockquote>
With the foregoing issuances, it is manifestly directed that earned
leave credits ought to be included in the computation of the longevity
pay of Justices and Judges upon their compulsory retirement.<br><br>
At present, however, as the FMBO explains, the non-inclusion of earned
leave credits in the computation of the longevity pay of Supreme Court
Associate Justices Gutierrez and Garcia, as well as Retired Court of
Appeals Associate Justice Dacudao, upon their compulsory retirement,
even in the face of A.C. No. 58-2003, and the edicts by this Court in
A.M. No. 03-9-20-SC, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, 1) Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 7 October 2003, granting the request of Senior Justice Bellosillo to tack his earned leave credits; and 2) Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
dated 11 November 2003, approving and adopting A.C. No. 58-2003, is the
consequence of its apprehension as to the non-sustainability of
charging payments of longevity pays, computed in accordance with A.C.
No. 58-2003, to the savings of the court concerned. According to the
FMBO, the longevity pay of retired Senior Associate Justice Bellosillo
was charged to the savings of this Court in view of the prior refusal
of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to pay the amount due
him, computed in accordance with the subject circular, notwithstanding
this Court’s Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 26 July 2005 in A.M. No. 03-9-20-SC, enjoining said department to disburse payment thereof, to wit:



<blockquote>SC Administrative Circular No. 58-2003 allows earned leave
credits of Justices and Judges who reach the age of compulsory
retirement to be tacked to the length of judicial service for the
purpose of increasing their longevity pay, on the basis of a liberal
interpretation of retirement legislation in line with previous
jurisprudence for the benefit of deserving retirees. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The
observations of the Secretary of Budget and Management are, therefore,
noted but she is enjoined to pay the amount due to retired Senior
Associate Justice Josue N. Bellosillo in the implementation of said
Circular</span></span>.<br><br>
WHEREFORE, the payment of longevity pay in accordance with
Administrative Circular No. 58-2003 to retired Justice Josue N.
Bellosillo is hereby DIRECTED. (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</blockquote>




The negative response to the implementation of A.C. No. 58-2003 by the DBM, was conveyed to this Court by way of a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 6 May 2004. In said letter, then Secretary of the DBM, Emilia T. Boncodin observed that:



<blockquote>First, Section 42 clearly states as a condition to grant
longevity pay, the rendition of five years continuous service. It
expressly grants longevity pay for “each” five years of continuous
service. Thus, longevity pay may only be granted if the condition has
been complied with, i.e., at the end of every five-year period. It
cannot be granted before expiration of the five-year period.<br><br>
Second, the use of the words ”continuous, efficient and meritorious
service” clearly refers to the actual service. Therefore, earned leave
credits, not being actual service, cannot be considered as part of
“continuous, efficient and meritorious service.” Tacking-in of leave
credits will therefore run counter to the expressed intent of the law.<br><br>
Third, we are fully aware that laws pertaining to retiring government
personnel should be liberally construed in favor of the retiring
personnel, if the law is vague and capable of more than one
construction. Section 42 of B.P. 129, however, is quite clear on its
intent.<br><br>
Besides, retirees are already given due recognition and award for their
services to the nation under Section 42 of B.P. 129 which entitles
retirees to longevity pay. Furthermore, retirees who did not avail of
their leave privileges are allowed to accumulate and commute unused
leave credits as terminal leave upon their retirement. The intent of
the law, which is to award retirees for their untiring service to the
nation, continues to be served.<br><br>
For these reasons, we believe we have complied with the provisions of
R.A. 910 (sic) as amended in the computation and release of funds for
the retirement and terminal leave benefits of Justice Bellosillo.
</blockquote>


Hence, the twin prayers for clarification by Supreme Court Associate Justice Garcia and FMBO Chief Corazon G. Ferrer-Flores.<br><br>The
seeming necessity for clarification founded on the preceding factual
milieu is declared, thus, by Supreme Court Associate Justice Garcia:
<blockquote>The undersigned seeks a clarificatory resolution from the
Court on this matter for the future guidance of all persons, agencies,
and offices concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>



Likewise, the FMBO implores, to wit:



<blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, may we respectfully request clarification
if the tacking of leave credits to the length of judicial service for
the purpose of computing the longevity pay as prescribed in
Administrative Circular No. 58-2003 should be made applicable to all
justices and judges retiring under RA 910, as amended. In the
affirmative, may we respectfully recommend that the DBM be directed to
comply with the provisions of Administrative Circular No. 58-2003. In
case of non-compliance by the DBM, may we further respectfully
recommend that the payment of the retirement benefit corresponding to
the longevity pay based on tacked leave credits to be sourced from
savings of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan,
the Court of Tax Appeals and the lower courts, as the case may be, be
made subject to availability of savings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>
In fine, illumination is allegedly needed respecting the issue of
whether or not longevity pay of Justices and Judges upon compulsory
retirement shall be computed in accordance with A.C. No. 58-2003, which
provides for the tacking of earned leave credits.<br><br>
The foregoing letter of the DBM notwithstanding, this Court is of the
view that the uncertainty is more ostensible than real. There is
nothing that needs to be clarified as A.C. No. 58-2003, as well as all
the other Resolutions issued by this Court in A.M. No. 03-9-20-SC,
explicitly dictates the tacking or inclusion of earned leave credits to
the computation of longevity pay of Justices and Judges upon their
compulsory retirement. This Court agrees with Associate Justice Garcia
that A.C. No. 58-2003, “just like all Court issuances which are made
pursuant to its constitutional power to interpret laws, has the force
and effect of law,” and that, “all concerned government agencies like
the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and our very own Budget
Division, included, are thereby duty-bound to comply x x x”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> therewith exclusive of any written appeal, demand or request of its prospective beneficiaries.<br><br>



Anent the recommendations of the FMBO, to quote again:



<blockquote>In the affirmative, may we respectfully recommend that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">DBM be directed to comply</span></span>
with the provisions of Administrative Circular No. 58-2003. In case of
non-compliance by the DBM, may we further respectfully recommend that
the payment of the retirement benefit corresponding to the longevity
pay based on tacked leave credits to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">be sourced from savings</span></span>
of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the
Court of Tax Appeals and the lower courts, as the case may be, be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">made subject to availability of savings</span></span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>
This Court approves the recommendation insofar as the FMBO proposes
that the DBM be directed to comply with the provisions of A.C. No.
58-2003.<br><br>
The suggestion, however, that, in the event the DBM refuses to comply
with a prospective directive from this Court, payment of subject
retirement benefit be made subject to availability of the savings of
the court concerned, is without merit. To conform thereto would make
payment of such retirement benefit conditional, defeating its
compulsory nature, not to mention the very wisdom behind the issuance
of A.C. No. 58-2003, which is to ensure the comfort and security of
retired Justices and Judges who have tirelessly and faithfully served
the government. In other words, compliance by the DBM with the
directive contained herein is the only option available to it, bearing
in mind that this Court, after due and painstaking consideration, has
sufficiently made clear its position on the matter.<br><br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</span>, as it is hereby Resolved, that, in accordance with Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 58-2003 and Supreme Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> Resolutions dated 7 October 2003, 11 November 2003, and 26 July 2005, in Administrative Matter No. 03-9-20-SC, <span style="font-style: italic;">henceforth</span>,
the Fiscal Management and Budget Office of this Office is DIRECTED to
include in the computation of the longevity pay of Justices and Judges,
upon compulsory retirement, their total earned leave credits. The
Department of Budget and Management is, likewise, <span style="font-style: italic;">heretofore </span>ENJOINED
to release such payment to Justices and Judges, upon compulsory
retirement, representing their longevity pay computed on the basis of
Administrative Circular No. 58-2003.<br><br>
