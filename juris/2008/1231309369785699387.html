				<BR><BR><div align="justify">LITIGANTS should not trifle with decisions of the highest court of the land, the final arbiter of legal controversies.<br><br>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) denying petitioners' motion to dismiss appeal and motion to order the trial court to issue a writ of execution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Antecedents</b><br></div><br>Sometime in the 1940s, Cayetano Ludo took petitioner Gertrudes Nabua as his common law wife and had ten children with her, namely: George, Alex, Cayetano, Jr., Julieta, Crispin alias "Douglas," Evangeline, Marilyn, Bernardita, Edwin, and Cresencio, all surnamed Lu. Alex, Cayetano, Jr., and Julieta join Gertrudes as petitioners against respondent Douglas in this case.<br><br>Cayetano, together with his brothers Paterno and Cipriano, founded the now famous Ludo and Lu Ym Corporation which owns the biggest single crushing plant in the world.&nbsp; Aside from commercial endeavors in the Philippines and abroad, Cayetano acquired numerous real and personal properties, e.g., beach resorts, condominium units, agricultural and commercial lots, private jet, sports cars, and shares of stocks.<br><br>In the 1970s, respondent Douglas, also known as Crispin N. Lu, took active part in the management of all the properties owned by Cayetano.&nbsp; In the late '70s and early '80s when Cayetano was already old and sickly, his shares of stocks were transferred to respondent. When Cayetano's death was impending, respondent explained to his brothers and sisters the need to execute a simulated last will and testament to evade payment of excessive inheritance taxes.<br><br>Indeed, a simulated last will and testament was supposedly executed by Cayetano under respondent's supervision and guidance.&nbsp; At that time, Cayetano was already dependent on respondent's decision-making.&nbsp; After Cayetano's death, respondent informed petitioners of the need to have the simulated last will and testament of their father probated.&nbsp; Petitioners (plaintiffs) all signed without any opposition because they were made to believe that it was for the purpose of keeping the properties of their father intact for the benefit of the family.<br><br>Respondent managed the 50% share of petitioner Gertrudes Nabua in the estate of Cayetano.&nbsp; Likewise, respondent managed and held in trust the other 50% of the properties of Cayetano due his children.&nbsp; This included the properties of the unwilling co-plaintiffs, namely: Evangeline, Marilyn, Bernardita, Edwin, and Cresencia.&nbsp; In the course of administering and managing the properties entrusted to him, respondent abandoned his own mother, petitioner Gertrudes Nabua, and stopped giving support to her.<br><br>Petitioners demanded an accounting from respondent when they learned that their cousins, children of Paterno Lu Ym, were given a similar accounting of the sale of shares of stocks in Philippine Bank of Communications and Crown Oil Corporation.&nbsp; Their demand was, however, ignored by respondent.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>RTC Proceedings</b><br></div><br>Respondent's motion to dismiss was denied by the Regional Trial Court (RTC).&nbsp; On appeal, this Court remanded the motion to the RTC for further proceedings.&nbsp; Meanwhile, respondent was declared in default by the RTC for failure to file his answer.<br><br>Because of respondent's refusal to render an accounting, petitioners, as plaintiffs, were constrained to file a complaint for accounting with prayer for temporary restraining order and injunction with the RTC, Branch 24, in Cebu City.<br><br>On August 16, 2002, respondent, as defendant, filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the complaint on the following grounds: (a) plaintiffs' claims are barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations; (b) plaintiffs have no legal capacity&nbsp; to&nbsp; sue&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; do not&nbsp; have a cause of action; (c) fraud and equity; and (d) docket fees were not paid, therefore, a condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent's omnibus motion was denied by the RTC.&nbsp; His motion for reconsideration was rejected.&nbsp; Repairing to the CA, the appellate court on August 20, 2003 denied respondent's petition to reverse the order of the RTC denying his motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, respondent went up to this Court in G.R.

The RTC laid down its bases for denying the motion as follows:<br><blockquote> The prayer to set aside herein judgment cannot be sustained for lack of legal basis.&nbsp; The record will show that proceedings in this case was conducted regularly: <ol> <li>Per Motion, defendant Douglas was given until June 15, 2002 to submit responsive pleading (May 30, 2002 order) on August 2, 2002, defendant Douglas was given 15 days to file answer to the amended complaint;<br><br></li><li>Another extension of&nbsp; 15&nbsp; days or&nbsp; until&nbsp; November 8, 2002 was given as prayed for (October 28, 2002 order);<br><br></li><li>Another extension was requested on November 7, 2002 which was granted in the order dated November 12, 2002;<br><br></li><li>Due to the filing of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, this Court on its own, suspended further proceedings for sixty (60) days (November 29, 2002 order);<br><br></li><li>On February 7, 2003, plaintiffs prayed that principal defendant be declared in default;<br><br></li><li>On February 10, 2003, said defendant was again reminded to submit answer;<br><br></li><li>Defendant Douglas was declared in default (May 25, 2003 order);<br><br></li><li>Plaintiff Gertrudes Nabua testified on June 27, 2003;<br><br></li><li>Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Court of Appeals was received on September 4, 2003;<br><br></li><li>On&nbsp; August 20, 2003,&nbsp; the Court of Appeals dismissed the <i>Certiorari</i> petition and affirmed the two assailed orders (received on September 11, 2003);<br><br></li><li>Defendant Douglas appealed the Court of Appeals decision to the Supreme Court by way of Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.<br></li></ol>Meanwhile, as there was no restraining order from the Supreme Court, plaintiffs continued to present evidence.&nbsp; Exhibit was formally offered on March 31, 2004 which was admitted in evidence in an Order dated April 30, 2004.&nbsp; Until this Court entered judgment in the main case.<br><br>In the light also of a recent Supreme Court Circular, wherein defendant in a civil case is directed to observe restraint in filing a Motion to Dismiss and instead allege the grounds thereof as defenses in the answer, this Court was confident that its ruling in the Motion to dismiss which was upheld by the Court of Appeals is in accord with the said rule. It has already reached a point of no return.&nbsp; Had the Honorable Supreme Court dismissed the main case, which is one of the reliefs in a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, it would have been different.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>CA Proceedings</b><br></div><br>On May 25, 2005, respondent filed a notice of appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> from the RTC order denying his motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; On May 26, 2005, the RTC gave due course to the notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the order giving due course to the notice of appeal with motion for entry of judgment and writ of execution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> emphasizing that the notice of appeal of respondent is not an appeal from the decision in Civil Case No. CEB 27717 dated March 16, 2005 but from the Order dated May 20, 2005.<br><br>The RTC resolved the motion for reconsideration of petitioners in the following manner:<br><blockquote> Due to the fact that this Court recognizes the right of appeal, it failed to realize that what was the subject of the notice of appeal is the Order of this Court dated May 20, 2005 order denying the Motion for Reconsideration and not the decision rendered on March 16, 2005.<br><br>At any rate, transmit the records of this case to the Court of Appeals as directed in the May 26, 2005 Order and leave it to the higher court to determine whether or not the appeal was filed out of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Supreme Court Proceedings</b><br></div><br>While his appeal was pending before the CA, respondent filed a petition for contempt of court before this Court against the counsel of petitioners and the RTC presiding judge, entitled <i>Lu Ym v.

No. 161309.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The pertinent portion of the decision states:<br><blockquote> In the present case, the assailed acts of respondents do not constitute disobedience to, or defiance of the decision in G.R. No. 161309.&nbsp; <i>The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; never stated&nbsp; therein that the March 16, 2005</i><i> decision of respondent Judge, or any judgment on the merits rendered pending decision of the Court, should be set aside</i>.&nbsp; Note that no TRO or injunction was issued to restrain the proceedings below. Unrestrained, the trial, presentation of evidence and rendition of judgment would logically take their course, and respondent Judge could not be faulted for proceeding with the rendition of judgment.<br><br><i>Moreover, the main thrust of the Court's decision in G.R. No. 161309 was to order the trial court to rule on the issues raised by petitioner in the motion to dismiss. This had already been substantially satisfied by the respondent Judge in his </i><i>March 16, 2005</i><i> decision</i>.&nbsp; In holding that the probated will of Cayetano did not, in fact, settle his estate as the same was simulated and intended merely to evade payment of taxes, respondent Judge in effect debunked the claim of valid assignment of rights over the properties in favor of petitioner and the Lu Ym Corporation as well as petitioner's assertion that the probate of Cayetano's will constituted <i>res judicata</i> and a bar to the relitigation of the same properties.&nbsp; So also, the pronouncement of respondent Judge that Gertrudes is the common law wife of Cayetano is recognition of Gertrudes' capacity to sue.&nbsp; In the same vein, the full faith and credence accorded by respondent Judge on the allegations and testimonies of Gertrudes and her witnesses addressed the issue of fraud invoked by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>CA Disposition</b><br></div><br>Back in the CA, petitioners filed a motion to order the trial court to issue a writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; They&nbsp; reiterated their position that the Supreme Court ruling in G.R.

In holding that the probated will of Cayetano did not, in fact, settle his estate as the same was simulated and intended merely to evade payment of taxes, respondent Judge in effect debunked the claim of valid assignment of rights over the properties in favor of petitioner and the Lu Ym Corporation as well as petitioner's assertion that the probate of Cayetano's will constituted <i>res judicata</i> and a bar to the relitigation of the same properties.&nbsp; So also, the pronouncement of respondent Judge that Gertrudes is the common law wife of Cayetano is recognition of Gertrudes' capacity to sue.&nbsp; In the same vein, the full faith and credence accorded by respondent Judge on the allegations and testimonies of Gertrudes and her witnesses addressed the issue of fraud invoked by petitioner.<br><br>It is therefore clear that to nullify the March 16, 2005 decision of respondent Judge and to conduct anew the proceedings before the trial court for the sole purpose of ruling on the motion to dismiss, would be a waste of time which would further delay the resolution of this case.&nbsp; <b>Furthermore, the assailed </b><b>March 16, 2005</b><b> decision of the trial court is now on appeal before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; therefore before the latter court where the issue of the nullification of the trial court's decision should be addressed</b>.<br><br>In sum, we find that respondents did not commit any act amounting to indirect contempt.&nbsp; To reiterate, respondent Judge's March 16, 2005 Decision and May 20, 2005 Order do not constitute defiance of the Court's verdict in G.R. No. 161309.&nbsp; It follows therefore that the pleadings filed by respondent Atty. Mahinay in reliance of the aforesaid decision and order of the trial court are not as well contumacious.&nbsp; Indeed, an act to be considered contemptuous must be clearly contrary or prohibited by the order of the Court.&nbsp; A person cannot, for disobedience, be punished for contempt unless the act which is forbidden or required to be done is clearly and exactly defined, so that there can be no reasonable doubt or uncertainty as to what specific act or thing is forbidden or required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>When respondent was declared in default, the proper remedy would have been to file a motion to set aside the order of default upon a proper showing that his failure to answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, and that he has a meritorious defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; This respondent failed to do.<br><br>In the recent case of <i>Martinez v. Republic</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> this Court stressed that a party declared in default loses his standing in court and his right to adduce evidence and to present his defense.&nbsp; He, however, has the right to appeal from the judgment by default on the ground, <i>inter alia</i>, that the amount of the judgment is excessive or is different in kind from that prayed for, or that plaintiff failed to prove the material allegations of his complaint, or that the decision is contrary to law.&nbsp; He may not seek the reversal of the decision on the basis of evidence submitted in the appellate court.&nbsp; Otherwise, his right to adduce evidence would have been returned to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; We expect therefore, that the CA disposition of his pending appeal will almost certainly be based on evidence presented by petitioners <i>ex parte</i>.<br><br>We note the length of time this action has been pending with the courts, and the number of times the parties have appealed to the CA and to this Court, resulting in delay in the execution of the trial court decision.
