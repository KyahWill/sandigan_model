				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 31 July 2007 of the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which affirmed with modification the judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Sorsogon, Sorsogon, Branch 53,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> finding appellant Budoy Gonzales y Lacdang guilty of arson.<br><br>On 4 March 1997, an information for arson was filed against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Two (2) days later, the information was amended to specify the charge as destructive arson under Article 320, Section 10, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1613 and Republic Act No.&nbsp; 7659 committed as follow:<br><blockquote>That on or about October 4, 1996, at Barangay Piot, Municipality of Sorsogon, Province of Sorsogon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously did then and there burn the building/residential house of Salvacion Salvacion by setting fire on the anahaw roof of said house which was then inhabited, the same being used as the dwelling cum store and boarding house of said private offended party, her family and her boarders, and being then situated in a populated and congested area, which destruction caused damage amounting to P50,000.00 to the prejudice of the private offended party.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Trial commenced following appellant's entry of a "not guilty" plea.<br><br>The prosecution presented Salvacion Loresto (Salvacion), private complainant and lone eyewitness, to give her account of the events that transpired on 4 October 1996. She lives with her family in a house a part of which is being rented out to boarders, and owns a store located in the same house. She narrated that on 3 October 1996,&nbsp; at&nbsp; around 1:15 p.m.,&nbsp; appellant went to her store and threatened&nbsp; her&nbsp; with the&nbsp;&nbsp; following&nbsp; words:&nbsp; "[If] You&nbsp; did&nbsp; not stop reporting to the police, I am going to kill you and set your house on fire."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The threats purportedly stemmed from a suspicion that Salvacion was the one reporting the <i>jueteng</i> operations in the area.&nbsp; Appellant apparently works for the suspected <i>jueteng</i> operator.&nbsp; After she was threatened, Salvacion sought assistance from the police. Captain Clet and two other policemen were dispatched to Salvacion's house to monitor the activities of appellant.&nbsp; At around 8:00 p.m., one of the policemen ordered Salvacion to close her store because appellant was then at a drinking session few houses away. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At 3:30 the following morning, Salvacion saw appellant emerge from the house where the latter was last seen drinking.&nbsp; She then saw him cross the street and proceed to her house. She claimed that appellant picked something up which he then wrapped inside an <i>anahaw</i> palm, left it by the corner of her store and set her house on fire.&nbsp; She immediately woke the occupants of the house and shouted for help.&nbsp; At that time, the policemen, who were positioned five (5) meters away from the house, ran after appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; while the house was totally being razed by fire. The damage was estimated at P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The other witness for the prosecution was PO3 Edgardo Balaoro (PO3 Balaoro), representing the chief of police, who brought the police blotter to the court.&nbsp; The blotter, however, was not formally offered in evidence.<br><br>In his defense, appellant denied having burned the house of Salvacion and having delivered threats against the latter.&nbsp; He accused Salvacion of holding a grudge against him because she suspected him of hurling stones at her house.&nbsp; He also presented pictures to show that Salvacion's house was not burned. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After trial, appellant was found guilty by the trial court of arson in a decision dated 28 February 2001, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Budoy Gonzales y Lacdang alias Manuel Jebulan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Arson, defined and penalized under Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Sec. 2 of P.D. No. 1613 and further amended by Sec. 10(1) of R.A. No. 7659, and there is no aggravating neither mitigating circumstance attendant thereto, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to pay the sum of P50,000.00 as damages without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.<br><br>Since the accused has been previously detained before he was bonded, his previous detention shall be taken in full in the service of his sentence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court gave full credence to the testimony of Salvacion on the grounds that it was corroborated by the police blotter and that there was no showing of any motive on her part to falsely testify against appellant.<br><br>In view of the penalty imposed, the case was elevated to this Court for review.&nbsp; However, conformably with our decision in <i>People v. Mateo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The appellate court affirmed the factual findings of the trial court and held that the prosecution's lone witness was positive and direct in identifying appellant as the assailant and in narrating the circumstances surrounding the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court also did not give weight to the pictures presented by the defense to prove that the house of Salvacion was not burned.&nbsp; It explained that there was no proof off when the pictures were taken. Neither was the person who took the picture presented as witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court however deleted the award of actual damages for failure of the prosecution to prove the actual amount of loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On 13 February 2008, this Court resolved to accept the present case and to require the parties to simultaneously submit their respective supplemental briefs. Appellant and the Office of the Solicitor General both filed their manifestations stating that they would no longer file any supplemental briefs and instead adopt their respective briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that the trial court should not have completely disregarded his defense of alibi and denial considering that he was able to prove that Salvacion's house was not burned by the photographs he presented during the trial. Moreover, the conflicting testimonies of Salvacion relating to the fire weakened the case for the prosecution as they were not corroborated by any witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Essentially, appellant maintains that his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, avers that the evidence established the <i>corpus delicti</i> as well as the identity of the perpetrator, <i>i.e.</i>, that a fire gutted the house of Salvacion and that it was intentionally set on fire by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is indispensable in the prosecution of arson, as in all kinds of criminal offenses.&nbsp; <i>Corpus delicti</i> means the substance of the crime; it is the fact that a crime has actually been committed.&nbsp; In arson, the <i>corpus delicti</i> rule is generally satisfied by proof of the bare occurrence of the fire, <i>e.g.</i>, the charred remains of a house burned down and of its having been intentionally caused. Even the uncorroborated testimony of a single eyewitness, if credible, may be enough to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> and to warrant conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the trial court found the testimony of Salvacion worthy of credence, thus:<br><blockquote>Resultantly guided by the jurisprudence laid down by the Supreme Court in many cases including the above-mentioned cases, this Court is inclined to give credence and weight to the testimony of the private offended party, Salvacion Loresto that she saw the accused that early morning of October 4, 1996 crossed the street and went near their house and got something and placed it inside the anahaw palm and set their house on fire.&nbsp; Thereafter, she woke up the occupants of the house and her neighbors and shouted for assistance.&nbsp; The two policemen detailed in her house that night ran after the accused and he was apprehended and brought to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Worthy of reiteration is the doctrine that on matters involving the credibility of witnesses, the trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses since it has observed firsthand their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination. Absent any showing of a fact or circumstance of weight and influence which would appear to have been overlooked and, if considered, could affect the outcome of the case, the factual findings and assessment on the credibility of a witness made by the trial court remain binding on an appellate tribunal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Appellant has utterly failed to convince this Court to depart from the rule stated above.&nbsp; Indeed, the testimony of Salvacion that she saw appellant set her house on fire is positive and categorical.&nbsp; She testified in a straightforward manner:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Madam witness, on October 4, 1996 at around 3:30 o'clock in the morning, do you remember where you were?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.

Appellant asserts that Salvacion initially claimed that her house was totally burned<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> only to retract later and concede that only half of the house was burned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The point of appellant's contention dwells merely on the extent of burning, not on the occurrence of the fire itself.&nbsp; Therefore, there is no dispute that the fire really occurred.&nbsp; Appellant also points out to the supposed inconsistency in the manner by which the fire was extinguished.&nbsp; Salvacion may have been confused during the direct and cross-examination but the discrepancies in her testimony do not relate directly to the crime charged. As a rule, inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses which refer to trivial and insignificant details do not destroy their credibility. Minor inconsistencies serve to strengthen rather than diminish the prosecution's case as they tend to erase suspicion that the testimonies have been rehearsed, thereby negating any misgivings that the same were perjured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The photographs presented by the defense to prove that Salvacion's house was not burned, were correctly disregarded by the lower courts as having no probative value.&nbsp; Indeed, photographs, when presented in evidence, must be identified by the photographer as to its production and he must testify as to the circumstances under which they were produced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; While appellant claimed that the photographs were taken after the alleged fire, he could not completely identify the person who had taken them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither did he even claim that he was present when the photographs were shot.<br><br>Appellant was found liable under Article 320(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 10 of R.A. No. 7659, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>Art. 320. <i>Destructive Arson</i>.—The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death shall be imposed upon any person who shall burn:<br><ol><li>One (1) or more buildings or edifices, consequent to one single act of burning, or as a result of simultaneous burnings, or committed on several or different occasions.<br></li></ol>x x x<br></blockquote>The lower courts correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; Furthermore, we sustain the deletion of the award of actual damages by the appellate court.&nbsp; To seek recovery of actual damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Aside from bare allegations, no receipts were presented to prove the actual losses suffered, hence such actual damages cannot be awarded.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision finding appellant Budoy Gonzales y Lacdang guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of arson and sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Rollo</i>, pp. 3-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>Penned by Associate Justice Normandie B.
