Thus, appellant was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to the four counts of rape.<br><br>The trial court asked appellant questions to determine the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his pleas of guilty to a capital offense in accordance with Sec. 3, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Notwithstanding the pleas of guilty, trial was held to determine the guilt of appellant.<br><br>The evidence presented by the prosecution consisted of private complainant's testimony, sworn statement, medical certificate and birth certificate.<br><br>Private complainant's birth certificate showed that she was born on August 10, 1987 and that the name of her father is Luisito Baun.<br><br>Private complainant testified that she was only 13 years old when appellant first raped her on July 21, 2001 and again on August 9, 2001 in their home in Mabitac, Laguna.  Thereafter, she was again raped on August 15, 2001 and September 30, 2001, when private complainant was 14 years old. The four counts of rape were committed at night when everyone was asleep, and private complainant's mother was in Manila. Appellant had carnal knowledge of her in the same room where her 15-year-old brother was sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Private complainant stated that she did not tell her brother about the rape incidents because she was afraid that appellant would beat her.  But she confided in her friends and they advised her to report the matter to their teacher, which she did. Her teacher advised her to report the matter to the sister of her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On October 7, 2001, private complainant, accompanied by her mother, reported the rape incidents to the police at the Mabitac Municipal Police Station where she executed a sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, private complainant proceeded to General Cailles Memorial District Hospital of Pakil, Laguna, for medical examination.

Hence, all exhibits were admitted by the trial court.<br><br>On August 12, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding accused LUISITO MERCADO BAUN guilty beyond reasonable doubt of not only one but four (4) cases of rape on his own daughter, [AAA], he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH for each case.<br><br>Similarly, he is hereby ordered to pay the above complainant-offended party the sum of P75,000.00 as actual damages for each case or the total amount of P300,000.00 and moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00 for each case or the total sum of P200,000.00.<br><br>No exemplary damages was proven, hence, nothing is awarded to her.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The case was elevated to this Court for automatic review.  The Court transferred the case to the Court of Appeals for intermediate review following <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the Decision promulgated on February 15, 2005, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Decision of the RTC with modification.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Siniloan, Laguna, Branch 33 dated August 12, 2002 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the accused-appellant is ordered to pay the private complainant for each count of rape, the amount of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in addition to the moral damages and civil indemnity awarded by the trial court.<br><br>In accordance with A.M. No. 00-5-03-SC which took effect on October 15, 2004, amending Section 13, Rule 124 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, let the entire records of this case be elevated to the Supreme Court for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>In a Resolution dated May 10, 2005, the Court accepted this case from the Court of Appeals and required the parties to simultaneously submit supplemental briefs if they so desired. Appellant, through counsel (Public Attorney's Office), submitted his supplemental brief on July 7, 2005, while appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General, submitted its brief on August 9, 2005.<br><br>Appellant assigned these errors:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The Court of Appeals erred in affirming appellant's conviction of the crimes charged despite his improvident plea of guilty.<br><br></li><li>The Court of Appeals erred in finding that appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant contends that the trial court failed to observe the rules when an accused enters a plea of guilty to a capital offense.  It failed to conduct a searching inquiry to determine whether appellant's plea of guilty was voluntary, with full comprehension of the consequences thereof, and to inquire whether appellant wished to present evidence on his own behalf.<br><br>The conduct of a searching inquiry is provided for in Sec. 3, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, thus:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <i>Plea of guilty to capital offense; reception of evidence</i>.--When the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his plea and shall require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability. The accused may present evidence in his behalf.<br></blockquote><i>People v. Aguilar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> reiterated the guidelines prescribed by the Court in the conduct of a searching inquiry, thus:<br><blockquote>(1) Ascertain from the accused himself (a) how he was brought into the custody of the law; (b) whether he had the assistance of a competent counsel during the custodial and preliminary investigations; and (c) under what conditions he was detained and interrogated during the investigations.  This is intended to rule out the possibility that the accused has been coerced or placed under a state of duress either by actual threats of physical harm coming from malevolent quarters or simply because of the judge's intimidating robes.<br><br>(2) Ask the defense counsel a series of questions as to whether he had conferred with, and completely explained to, the accused the meaning and consequences of a plea of guilty.<br><br>(3) Elicit information about the personality profile of the accused, such as his age, socio-economic status, and educational background, which may serve as a trustworthy index of his capacity to give a free and informed plea of guilty.<br><br>(4) Inform the accused of the exact length of imprisonment or nature of the penalty under the law and the certainty that he will serve such sentence.  For not infrequently, an accused pleads guilty in the hope of a lenient treatment or upon bad advice or because of promises of the authorities or parties of a lighter penalty should he admit guilt or express remorse.  It is the duty of the judge to ensure that the accused does not labor under these mistaken impressions because a plea of guilty carries with it not only the admission of authorship of the crime proper but also of the aggravating circumstances attending it, that increase punishment.<br><br>(5) Inquire if the accused knows the crime with which he is charged and to fully explain to him the elements of the crime which is the basis of his indictment.  Failure of the court to do so would constitute a violation of his fundamental right to be informed of the precise nature of the accusation against him and a denial of his right to due process.<br><br>(6) All questions posed to the accused should be in a language known and understood by the latter.<br><br>(7) The trial judge must satisfy himself that the accused, in pleading guilty, is truly guilty.  The accused must be required to narrate the tragedy or reenact the crime or furnish its missing details.<br><br>The full text of the trial's court searching inquiry reads:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">Interpreter :</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Criminal Cases Nos.

Derilo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> held:<br><blockquote><blockquote>While it may be argued that appellant entered an improvident plea of guilty when re-arraigned, we find no need, however, to remand a case to the lower court for further reception of evidence.  As a rule, this Court has set aside convictions based on pleas of guilty in capital offenses because of improvidence thereof and when such plea is the sole basis of the condemnatory judgment.  However, <b>where the trial court receives evidence to determine precisely whether or not the accused has erred in admitting his guilt, the manner in which the plea of guilty is made (improvidently or not) loses legal significance, for the simple reason that the conviction is based on the evidence proving the commission by the accused of the offense charged</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The Court carefully reviewed the records of this case and found private complainant's straightforward narration of the rape incidents to be credible. Moreover, the medical certificate showed that private complainant's vaginal orifice "[a]dmits 1 finger with ease; with hymenal lacerations; old, healed, complete at 3 and 9 o'clock positions; incomplete at 4 and 8 o'clock positions," which corroborated her testimony that she was raped.<br><br>Paragraph 1(a) of Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides that rape is committed by a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat or intimidation.<br><br>Settled is the ruled that in incestuous rape, the father's moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The ascendancy or influence necessarily flows from the father's parental authority, which the constitution and the laws recognize, support and enhance, as well as from the children's duty to obey and observe reverence and respect towards their parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Such reverence and respect are deeply ingrained in the minds of Filipino children and are recognized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Abuse of both by a father can subjugate his daughter's will, thereby forcing her to do whatever he wants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  The record fully bears out the incidents of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The rule is that when an alleged victim of rape says she was violated, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her, and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on that basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It was noted in the transcript of stenographic notes that private complainant, then 14 years old, was crying while she was testifying before the trial court. It has been held in several cases that the crying of a victim during her testimony is evidence of the truth of the rape charges, for the display of such emotion indicates the pain that the victim feels when she recounts the detail of her traumatic experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>No sane girl would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and subject herself to public trial or ridicule if she has not in truth, been a victim of rape and impelled to seek justice for the wrong done to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  It is against human nature for a girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself and her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially where her charges would mean the death or the long-term imprisonment of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The weight of such testimony may be countered by physical evidence to the contrary, or indubitable proof that the accused could not have committed the rape, but in the absence of such countervailing proof, the testimony shall be accorded utmost value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded by the argument of appellant's counsel that private complainant's testimony was not free from doubt because her brother was sleeping in the same room where the rape incidents happened.  It is contended that it was highly improbable for private complainant's  brother not to tell his mother that he saw his father naked on top of his sister doing something since it is customary for children to disclose unusual things or events they see.  They are not known to keep a secret all to themselves as they normally find ways to relate it to anybody.<br><br>The argument is without merit.<br><br>Private complainant's brother did not testify in court, and it was not stated in the transcript of stenographic notes that his sworn statement was offered in evidence. Hence, his sworn statement cannot be given any evidentiary value by this Court. Even if the trial court considered his sworn statement in its Decision, the argument raised by appellant's counsel cannot detract from the credible testimony of private complainant that she was raped by appellant.<br><br>Further, appellant's counsel contends that the medical finding showing hymenal lacerations is not a conclusive proof that appellant raped private complainant. He stressed that sexual intercourse is not the sole and exclusive reason for hymenal rapture.<br><br>The Court is well aware of such fact.  However, a medical examination and a medical certificate are merely corroborative and are not indispensable to the prosecution of a rape case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The credible disclosure of a minor that the accused raped her is the most important proof of the sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In fine, the Court agrees with the finding of the Court of Appeals that appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed four times against private complainant.  The first two incidents of rape were committed when she was 13 years old, while the third and fourth incidents of rape were committed when she was 14 years old.<br><br>Under Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  the crime of rape committed by appellant against his own daughter is punished with the death penalty, thus:<br><blockquote>Article 266-B. <i>Penalties</i>.--Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article  shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx   xxx   xxx<br></div><br><b>The death penalty shall also be imposed</b> if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1) <b>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent</b>, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br></blockquote>The concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender are special qualifying circumstances that are needed to be alleged in the complaint or information for the penalty of death to be decreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The Constitution guarantees to be inviolable the right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is a requirement that renders it essential for every element of the offense with which he is charged to be properly alleged in the complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which took effect on December 1, 2000, requires qualifying and aggravating circumstances to be stated in the Complaint or Information.<br><br>In this case, the minority of private complainant and her relationship to appellant were alleged in the four Informations and proven in court, warranting the imposition of the death penalty.<br><br>However,  the imposition of the death penalty  has been prohibited by Republic Act No. 9346<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which took effect on June 30, 2006. Sections 2 and 3 of the Act provide:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2.

Civil indemnity is automatically awarded upon proof of the commission of the crime by the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  Private complainant is entitled to moral damages for having suffered mental and emotional injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also correctly awarded private complainant exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000 for each case due to the presence of the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
