				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The perceived advantages of the Torrens system of registration of land titles have helped stabilize land ownership in the Philippines. Its underlying principle is security with facility in dealing with land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Its fundamental purpose is to quiet title to land, to perpetually enjoin any question in the legality of the title,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> hence, the titles issued under the system are indefeasible. Yet the Torrens system is imperfect in that it remains susceptible to fraud, either in the original registration proceedings or in subsequent transactions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>These petitions feature apparently fraudulent practices relating to the attempts at registration of the subject property. Necessarily, they call for the correct application of entrenched principles in land registration. At the same time, they afford this Court the opportunity to again defend the Torrens system against unscrupulous elements who use its formalities to actualize the theft of property, and to exert judicial might in ensuring that fraud does not prevail in the end.<br><br>These petitions were referred to the Court <i>en banc </i>by the Special First Division which had initially ruled on them, most comprehensively in a Decision dated 12 December 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> They were accepted by the Court <i>en banc</i> in a Resolution dated 26 July 2006. Subsequently, the parties presented their various contentions before the Court in an oral argument held on 24 July 2007, followed by the submission of their respective memoranda. While the cases were under consideration of the Court <i>en banc</i>, the participation of the Office of the Solicitor General was required,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and a set of new parties was allowed leave to intervene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts are stated in full in our 2005 Decision, but are summarized herein for convenience.<br><br>On 11 June 1988, a fire gutted portions of the Quezon City Hall, immolating, among others, records stored in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. That fire has attained notoriety due to the numerous certificates of title on file with that office, which were destroyed as a consequence. The resulting effects of that blaze on specific property registration controversies have been dealt with by the Court in a number of cases since then.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> These petitions are perhaps the most heated, if not the most contentious of those cases thus far.<br><br>Respondents Heirs of Homer Barque (the Barques) filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the Land Registration Authority (LRA) for administrative reconstitution of the original of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 210177 (the Barque title) issued in the name of Homer Barque. They alleged that the Barque title was among the records destroyed by the 1988 fire. In support of their petition, the Barques submitted copies of the alleged owner's duplicate of the Barque title, real estate tax receipts, tax declarations and a Plan FLS 3168-D covering the property.<br><br>Learning of the Barques' petition, Severino M. Manotok IV, et al. (the Manotoks) filed their opposition thereto. The Manotoks claimed that the lot covered by the Barque title  formed part of the land covered by their reconstituted title TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] (the Manotok title) in the name of Severino Manotok, et. al. They further alleged that the Barque title  was spurious.<br><br>A brief description of the property involved is in order. Both the Barques' and the Manotoks' titles advert to land belonging to Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate situated in the then Municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal. The Barque title actually involves two parcels of land as part of Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate, with an aggregate area of 342,945 square meters, while the Manotok title concerns only one parcel of land, but with a similar area of 342,945 square meters.<br><br>On 30 June 1997, Atty. Benjamin M. Bustos, as reconstituting officer of the LRA, denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the petition for reconstitution of the Barque title, declaring that:<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><ol><li>Lots 823-A and 823-B, Fls-3168-D, containing areas of 171,473 Sq. Mtrs. and 171,472 Sq. Mtrs., respectively, covered by TCT No. 210177, appear to duplicate Lot 823 Piedad Estate, containing an area of 342,945 Sq. Mtrs., covered by TCT No. 372302 registered in the name of Severino M. Manotok, et. al., reconstituted under Adm. Reconstitution No. Q-213 dated February 01, 1991;<br><br></li><li>The submitted plan Fls-3168-D is a spurious document as categorically stated by Engr. Privadi J.G. Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Surveys Division, Land Management Bureau, in his letter dated February 19, 1997.<br></li></ol><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote>The Barques' motion for reconsideration was denied by Atty. Bustos in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 10 February 1998; hence, the Barques appealed to the LRA.<br><br>The LRA reversed Atty. Bustos on appeal. It ruled that the reconstituting officer should not have required the submission of documents other than the owner's duplicate certificate of title as basis for denying the petition and should have confined himself to the owner's duplicate certificate of title. The LRA further found anomalies in the Manotoks' title.  It observed that:<br><blockquote>Based on the documents presented, petitioners have established by clear and convincing evidence that TCT NO. 210177 was, at the time of the destruction thereof, valid, genuine, authentic and effective. Petitioners duly presented the original of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 210177 .... The logbook of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City lists TCT No. 210177 as among the titles lost .... The Register of Deeds of Quezon City himself acknowledged the existence and authenticity of TCT No. 210177 when he issued a certification to the effect that TCT No. 210177 was one of the titles destroyed and not salvaged from the fire that gutted the Quezon City Hall on 11 June 1988 ....<br><br>It is likewise noteworthy that the technical description and boundaries of the lot reflected in TCT No. 210177 absolutely conform to the technical description and boundaries of Lot 823 Piedad Estate ... as indicated in the B. L. Form No. 28-37-R dated 11-8-94 and B. L. Form No. 31-10 duly issued by the Bureau of Lands ....<br><br>It therefore becomes evident that the existence, validity, authenticity and effectivity of TCT No. 210177 was established indubitably and irrefutably by the petitioners. Under such circumstances, the reconstitution thereof should be given due course and the same is mandatory....<br><br>It would be necessary to underscore that the certified copy of Plan FLS 3168 D was duly issued by the office of Engr. Ernesto Erive, Chief, Surveys Division LMS-DENR-NCR whose office is the lawful repository of survey plans for lots situated within the National Capital Region including the property in question. Said plan was duly signed by the custodian thereof, Carmelito Soriano, Chief Technical Records and Statistics Section, DENR-NCR. Said plan is likewise duly supported by Republic of the Philippines Official Receipt No. 2513818 Q dated 9-23-96 .... Engr. Erive in his letter dated 28 November 1996 addressed to Atty. Bustos ... confirmed that a microfilm copy of Plan FLS 3168D is on file in the Technical Records and Statistics Section of his office. Engr. Dalire, in his letter dated 2 January 1997 addressed to Atty. Bustos even confirmed the existence and authenticity of said plan. ...<br><br>....<br><br>The claim of Engr. Dalire in his letter dated 19 February 1997 that his office has no records or information about Plan FLS 3168-D is belied by the certified copy of the computer print-out duly issued by the Bureau of Lands indicating therein that FLS 3168D is duly entered into the microfilm records of the Bureau of Lands and has been assigned Accession Number 410436 appearing on Page 79, Preliminary Report No. 1, List of Locator Cards and Box Number 0400 and said computer print-out is duly supported by an Offical Receipt ....<br><br>The said Plan FLS 3168D is indeed authentic and valid coming as it does from the legal repository and duly signed by the custodian thereof. The documentary evidence presented is much too overwhelming to be simply brushed aside and be defeated by the fabricated statements and concoctions made by Engr. Dalire in his 19 February 1997 letter. ...<br></blockquote>Notwithstanding its conclusion that the Manotok title was fraudulently reconstituted, the LRA noted that only the Regional Trial Court (RTC) could cancel the Manotok title as a Torrens title. It thus ruled,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L. Barque, Sr. shall be given due course after cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of Manotoks upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>The Manotoks filed a motion for reconsideration, which was opposed by the Barques with a prayer that the reconstitution be ordered immediately. The LRA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Manotoks' motion for reconsideration and the Barques' prayer for immediate reconstitution.<br><br>Both the Manotoks and the Barques appealed the LRA decision to the Court of Appeals (CA). The Barques' petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> was docketed  as  CA-G.R.  SP  No.  66700, while the Manotoks' petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66642.  The Barques prayed that the LRA be directed to immediately reconstitute the Barque title without being subjected to the condition that the Manotok title should first be cancelled by a court of competent jurisdiction. On the other hand, the Manotoks argued in their own petition that the LRA erred in imputing that the Manotok title was spurious and fake.<br><br>Meanwhile, in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, Felicitas Manahan filed a motion for leave to intervene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  She sought the dismissal of the cases in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and CA-G.R. SP No. 66642 and claimed ownership over the subject property.<br><br>On 13 September 2002, the Second Division of the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, denying the Barques' petition and affirming the LRA Resolution. The Barques filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Subsequently, the Special Division of Five of the Former Second Division rendered an Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated 7 November 2003 wherein it held that:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, our decision dated 13 September 2002 is hereby reconsidered. Accordingly, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is hereby directed to cancel TCT No. RT-22481 of private respondents and the LRA is hereby directed to reconstitute forthwith petitioners' valid, genuine and existing Certificate of Title No. T-210177.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The Manotoks filed a motion for the reconsideration of the amended decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, but this was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, as to the Manotoks' petition, CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, the Third Division of the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on 29 October 2003 which affirmed the resolution of the LRA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The appellate court held that the LRA correctly deferred in giving due course to the Barques' petition for reconstitution, since there was as yet no final judgment upholding or annulling the Barque title. The Barques filed a motion for reconsideration of this ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As had occurred with the Barques' petition, the Third Division of the Court of Appeals granted the Barques' motion for reconsideration and on 24 February 2004, promulgated its Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> wherein it held that:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Decision of this Court dated 29 October 2003 is RECONSIDERED and a new one is entered ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 and directing the LRA to reconstitute forthwith respondents' TCT No. T-210177.<br></blockquote>Aggrieved with the twin decisions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, both ordering the cancellation of the Manotok title, the Manotoks filed separate petitions for review before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 162605 and G.R. No. 162335, respectively. On 2 August 2004, the Court ordered the consolidation of G.R. No. 162605 with G.R. No. 162335.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On 12 December 2005, the Court's First Division rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> affirming the two decisions of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Manotoks filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court's First Division denied in a Resolution dated 19 April 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thereafter, the Manotoks' filed a Motion for Leave to File a Second Motion for Reconsideration, with their Motion for Reconsideration attached. The Court denied the same in a Resolution dated 19 June 2006, and the Court further ordered that entry of judgment be made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus on 2 May 2006, entry of judgment was made in the Book of Entries of Judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Barques filed multiple motions with the Court's First Division concerning the execution of the judgment, including a Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession or For Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In response, the Manotoks filed an Urgent Motion to Refer Motion for Possession to the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> (with prayer to set motion for oral argument). In a Resolution dated 19 July 2006, the Special First Division referred these cases to the Court <i>en banc</i>, and on 26 July 2006, the Court <i>en banc</i> promulgated a Resolution accepting the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On 7 September 2006, Felicitas Manahan and Rosendo Manahan filed a motion to intervene, to which was attached their petition in intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  Movants alleged that the property subject of the petition in G.R. No. 162335 and G.R. No. 162605 was owned by them. They claimed that their predecessor-in-interest, Vicente Manahan, was issued Sales Certificate No. 511 which covered lot 823 of the Piedad Estate. Moreover, they attached to their petition the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) that the documents of the Manotoks were not as old as they were purported to be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Director of the Legal Division of the Land Management Bureau (LMB) recommended to the Director of the LMB that:<br><blockquote>...steps be taken in the proper court for the cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481(372302) and all its derivative titles so that the land covered may be reverted to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>Ultimately, the Court found it necessary to involve the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in these cases, directing the OSG to file its Comment. The OSG filed its Comment on 04 April 2007. Oral arguments were eventually held on 24 July 2007.<br><br>After the oral arguments, the Court required the parties, the intervenors, and the Solicitor General to submit their respective memoranda.<br><center><br><i>I</i><br></center><br>As can be gleaned from the foregoing statement of facts, these petitions are attended by a few procedural unorthodoxies, such as, for example,  the Court <i>en banc</i>s move on the Special First Division's referral  for reevaluation of these petitions when an entry of judgment had already been made in favor of the Barques. Yet the prevailing consensus within the Court <i>en banc</i> was to proceed with the reevaluation of these cases on a <i>pro hac vice</i> basis. There are good reasons for the Court to act in such rare manner in these cases. Most urgently, the Court had felt that the previous rulings by the First Division and the Special First Division warranted either affirmation or modification by the Court acting <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>It is a constitutional principle that "no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the [C]ourt in a decision rendered <i>en banc</i> or in division may be modified or reversed except by the court sitting <i>en banc</i>." It has been argued that the 2005 Decision of the First Division is inconsistent with precedents of the Court, and leaving that decision alone without the imprimatur of the Court <i>en banc</i> would lead to undue confusion within the bar and bench, with lawyers, academics and judges quibbling over whether the earlier ruling of the Division constitutes the current standard with respect to administrative reconstitution of titles. Our land registration system is too vital to be stymied by such esoteric wrangling, and the administrators and courts which implement that system do not deserve needless hassle.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General correctly pointed out that this Court before had sanctioned the recall entries of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The power to suspend or even disregard rules of procedure can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The militating concern for the Court <i>en banc </i>in accepting these cases is not so much the particular fate of the parties, but the stability of the Torrens system of registration by ensuring clarity of jurisprudence on the field.<br><br>It is beyond contention, even by the parties, that since the Court <i>en banc</i> resolved to accept these petitions in 2006, we have effectively been reviewing the 12 December 2005 Decision of the Court's First Division, as well as the Resolutions dated 19 April and 19 June 2006 of that same Division. This Resolution is the result of that review. As earlier stated, we have opted to do so on a <i>pro hac vice</i> basis to lend much needed jurisprudential clarity as only the Court <i>en banc</i> can constitutionally provide.<br><center><br><i>II</i><br></center><br>In the context of an administrative reconstitution proceeding before the LRA, the Barques have sought that the LRA exercise the power to cancel the Manotok title and forthwith cause the reconstitution of their own title. The LRA refused to do so, although it did rule that the Manotok title was spurious and thus subject to cancellation through the proper judicial proceeding. Upon appellate review of that LRA decision, the Court of Appeals initially upheld the LRA's position, but ultimately, upon motion for reconsideration, directed the cancellation of the Manotok title and the reconstitution of the Barque title.<br><br>Our succeeding discussion centers on the ordered mechanism for the cancellation of Torrens titles in the Philippines.<br><br>To recall, both assailed Amended Decisions of the Court of Appeals notably directed the cancellation of the Manotok title even as it mandated the reconstitution of the Barque title.  The obvious question is whether the Court of Appeals was empowered to direct the annulment of the Manotok title through the petitions raised before it by the Barques and the Manotoks. It could not.<br><br>Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, also known as the Property Registration Decree, provides that "[a] certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack [...and] cannot be altered, modified, or cancelledexcept in a direct proceeding in accordance with law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Clearly, the cancellation of the Manotok title cannot arise incidentally from the administrative proceeding for reconstitution of the Barque title even if the evidence from that proceeding revealed the Manotok title as fake. Nor could it have emerged incidentally in the appellate review of the LRA's administrative proceeding.<br><br>There is no doubt that the Court of Appeals does not have original jurisdiction to annul Torrens titles or to otherwise adjudicate questions over ownership of property. Its exclusive original jurisdiction is determined by law, particularly by Batas Pambansa (B.P. 129). Section 9 of that law restricts the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to special civil actions and to actions for annulment of judgments of the regional trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Still, the Court of Appeals did acquire jurisdiction over the Barques' and the Manotoks' petitions, albeit in the exercise of its exclusive appellate jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> over the ruling of the LRA, also pursuant to Section 9 of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended. Thus, for the appellate court to be able to direct the cancellation of a Torrens title in the course of reviewing a decision of the LRA, the LRA itself must have statutory authority to cancel a Torrens title in the first place.<br><br>Note that the Office of the Solicitor General, which acts as counsel for the government and its agencies including the LRA, refutes the contention that the LRA has jurisdiction to cancel the Manotok title, much less jurisdiction to rule on the validity of a certificate of title.  It invokes the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC under Paragraph 2, Section 19 of B.P. Blg. 129, conferring jurisdiction on the RTC over "all civil actions which involve the title to or possession of real property, or any interest therein x x x." That the RTC has "exclusive original jurisdiction" over actions seeking the cancellation of title to real property is so cardinal in our remedial law that it is reflected in hundreds if not thousands of examples in jurisprudence.<br><br>Nonetheless, we may inquire whether, notwithstanding the statutory delineation of "exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC," there is statutory basis for the LRA to exercise jurisdiction over the cancellation of Torrens titles. If there is, we can perhaps assess such law separately from B.P. Blg. 129.<br><br>Section 6 of P.D. No. 1529 enumerates the general functions of the Land Registration Commissioner, as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6.

Indeed, the Barques are unable to point to any basis in law that confirms the power of the LRA to effect such cancellation, even under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 26 as amended by Rep. Act No. 6732, which authorizes the administrative reconstitution of titles in limited cases. In fact, as we shall see shortly such laws take great care to ensure that a petition for administrative reconstitution of title will not disturb existing Torrens titles.<br><br>It is thus clear that neither the Court of Appeals nor the LRA had jurisdiction to cancel the Manotok title. The next matter of inquiry is whether the LRA had acted correctly in ordering, conditional as it may have been, the administrative reconstitution of the Barque title.<br><br>Under Rep. Act No. 26 as amended by Rep. Act No. 6732, administrative reconstitution of titles is permitted where the certificates of titles have been lost due to "flood, fire and other <i>force majeure.</i>" The petitioner in such a case is required to execute an affidavit, containing the following averments:<br><blockquote>(1) That no deed or other instrument affecting the property had been presented for registration, or, if there be any, the nature thereof, the date of its presentation, as well as the names of the parties, and whether the registration of such deed or instrument is still pending accomplishment;<br><br>(2) That the owner's duplicate certificate or co-owner's duplicate is in due form without any apparent intentional alterations or erasures;<br><br><b>(3) That the certificate of title is not the subject of litigation or investigation, administrative or judicial, regarding its genuineness or due execution or issuance;</b><br><br>(4) That the certificate of title was in full force and effect at the time it was lost or destroyed;<br><br>(5) That the certificate of title is covered by a tax declaration regularly issued by the Assessor's Office; and<br><br>(6) That real estate taxes have been fully paid up to at least two (2) years prior to the filing of the petition for reconstitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 19 of Rep. Act No. 26, as amended by Rep. Act  No. 6732, further provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 19. If the certificate of title considered lost or destroyed, and subsequently found or recovered, is not in the name of the same person in whose favor the reconstituted certificate of title has been issued, the Register of Deeds or the party concerned should bring the matter to the attention of the proper regional trial court, which, after due notice and hearing, shall order the cancellation of the reconstituted certificate of title and render, with respect to the memoranda of new liens and encumbrances, if any, made in the reconstituted certificate of title, after its reconstitution, such judgment as justice and equity may require: Provided, however, That if the reconstituted certificate of title has been cancelled by virtue of any deed or instrument, whether voluntary or involuntary, or by an order of the court, and a new certificate of title has been issued, the procedure prescribed above, with respect to the memorandum of new liens and encumbrances made on the reconstituted certificate of title, after its reconstitution, shall be followed with respect to the new certificate of title, and to such new liens and encumbrances, if any, as may have been on the latter, after the issuance thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>Rep. Act No. 6732 itself also states:<br><blockquote><b>Section 11.</b> A reconstituted title obtained by means of fraud, deceit or other machination is void <i>ab initio</i> as against the party obtaining the same and all persons having knowledge thereof.<br><br><b>Section 12.</b> Any person who by means of fraud, deceit or other machination obtains or attempts to obtain a reconstituted title shall be subject to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, shall be liable for imprisonment for a period of not less than two years but not exceeding five years or the payment of a fine of not less than Twenty thousand pesos but not exceeding Two hundred thousand pesos or both at the discretion of the court.<br><br>Any public officer or employee who knowingly approves or assists in securing a decision allowing reconstitution in favor of any person not entitled thereto shall be subject to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, shall be liable for imprisonment of not less than five years but not exceeding ten years or payment of a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos but not exceeding One hundred thousand pesos or both at the discretion of the court and perpetual disqualification from holding public office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>These provisions indubitably establish that the administrative reconstitution of Torrens titles is intended for non-controversial cases, or especially where the subject property is not covered by an existing title in favor of a person other than the applicant. Such an implication is consonant with the rule that the reconstitution proceedings are not the venue for confirmation or adjudication of title, but merely a means by which a previously adjudicated title whose original has been lost or destroyed may be reissued to its owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General pertinently cites the rule in <i>Alabang Development Corporation v. Valenzuela</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45] </sup>which we held that "[t]he courts simply have no jurisdiction over petitions by such third parties for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles over lands that are already covered by duly issued subsisting titles in the names of their duly registered owners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> That such doctrine was established for cases of judicial reconstitution does not bar its application to cases of administrative reconstitution. None of the provisions pertaining to administrative reconstitution in Rep. Act No. 26 or 6732 extraordinarily empowers the LRA to exercise jurisdiction over a petition for reconstitution, where the property is already covered by a Torrens title. After all, the LRA in such case is powerless to void the previous title or to diminish its legal effect. Even assuming that the previously issued title is obviously fraudulent or attended by flaws and as such cannot be countenanced by the legal system, the corrective recourse lies with the courts, and not with the LRA.<br><br>If a petition for administrative reconstitution is filed with the LRA, and it appears from the official records that the subject property is already covered by an existing Torrens title in the name of another person, there is nothing further the LRA can do but to dismiss the petition. The dismissal of such petition is subject to judicial review, but the only relevant inquiry in such appellate proceeding is on whether or not there is a previously existing title covering that property. Neither the LRA nor the Court of Appeals at that point may inquire into the validity of the title or the competing claims over the property. The only remedy is an action before the RTC for the cancellation of the existing title, whether by the competing claimant or by the OSG on behalf of the Republic.<br><center><br><i>III</i><br></center><br>The 2005 Decision placed heavy reliance on <i>Ortigas &amp; Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> where in the course of reviewing an action for judicial reconstitution of title, the Court opted not to remand the reconstitution case filed by Molina to the court of origin in order to permit the appeals of Ortigas and the Solicitor General, which had been  improvidently disallowed by the trial court. Instead, owing to the "fatal infirmities" of Molina's cause of action, the Court itself nullified the reconstituted titles issued by the trial court. <i>Ortigas</i> had been cited by the Court of Appeals and also by the 2005 Decision, in ruling on the Barques' petition.<br><br>The unusual "shortcut" that occurred in <i>Ortigas</i> had become necessary  because in that case the trial court had denied or stricken out the notices of appeal respectively filed by Ortigas and the Solicitor General from the order for reconstitution of Molina's titles. Had these notices of appeal been allowed, the Court of Appeals would have then reviewed the trial court's decision on appeal, with the ultimately correct resolution which was the annulment of Molina's titles. Ortigas was forced to institute a special civil action of certiorari and mandamus with this Court, praying for either of these alternative results—the more prudent recourse of directing the trial court to act on the notices of appeal and to forward the case records to the Court of Appeals, or the more immediate remedy of bypassing the appellate process and the Court itself by directly annulling Molina's titles.<br><br>The Court of Appeals herein could not have equated its annulment of the Manotok title with that undertaken by the Court in <i>Ortigas</i> since, unlike in <i>Ortigas</i>, the Court of Appeals was not endowed with the proper appellate jurisdiction to annul the Manotok title.<i> </i>As earlier pointed out, since the LRA had no original jurisdiction to cancel the Manotok title, it follows that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdictional competence to extend the same relief, even while reviewing the LRA's ruling. Clearly, <i>Ortigas</i> cannot be applied as a binding precedent to these cases. The fundamental jurisdictional defects that attended the actions of both Divisions of the Court of Appeals have effectively diminished <i>Ortigas</i> as a persuasive authority.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>IV</i><br></div><br>The 2005 Decision accepted the findings of the LRA and the Court of Appeals that the Manotok title was spurious and accordingly sanctioned its cancellation, even though no direct attack on the title had been initiated before a trial court. That the 2005 Decision erred in that regard is a necessary consequence following our earlier explanation of why the mere existence of the Manotok title necessarily barred the LRA from inquiring into the validity of that title.<br><br>Moreover, it would have been pointless for the LRA or the Court of Appeals to have ruled definitively on the validity of the Barques' claim to title. After all, since neither the LRA nor the Court of Appeals could cause the cancellation of the Manotok title, any declaration that the Barque claim was valid would be inutile and inoperable. Still, in order to effectively review and reverse the assailed rulings, it would be best for this Court to <b>test the premises under which the LRA and the Court of Appeals had concluded that the Barques had a valid claim to title</b>. The available record before the Court is comprehensive enough to allow us to engage in that task.<br><br>The Barque title, or TCT No. 210177, under which the Barques assert title to Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, states that it was transferred from TCT No. 13900.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The Barques assert that they bought the subject property from a certain Setosta. Thus, it could be deduced that TCT No. 13900 should have been registered under the name of Setosta. However, it was not. TCT No. 13900 was registered under the name of Manotok Realty, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This detracts from the Barques' claim that the Manotoks do not have title to the property, as in fact the Barque title was a transfer from a title registered under the name of the Manotoks. The Barques have failed to explain the anomaly.<br><br>The Barques hinge their claim on a purported subdivision plan, FLS-3168-D, made in favor of Setosta. However, based on the records, it appears that there is a conflict as to its actual existence in the files of the government. Revelatory is the exchange of correspondence between the LMB and the LRA. The LMB did not have any  copy  of FLS-3168-D  in  the EDP listing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> nor did the LMB have a record of the plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  However, a microfilm copy of FLS-3168-D was on file in the Technical Records and Statistical Section of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Capital Region (DENR-NCR).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The copy with the Technical Records and Statistical Section, which bore the stamp of the LMB, was denied by the LMB as having emanated from its office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Further, the letter dated 2 January 1997 from the LMB stated that the copy of FLS-3168-D as verified from its microfilm file was the same as the copy sent by the Technical Records and Statistics Section of the National Capital Region Lands Management Sector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The LMB, however, denied issuing such letter and stated that it was a forged document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> To amplify the forged nature of the document, the LMB sent a detailed explanation to prove that it did not come from its office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In a letter to the administrator of the LRA, the hearing officer concluded that "it is evident that there is an attempt to mislead us into favorable action by submitting forged documents, hence it is recommended that this case [be] referred to the PARAC for investigation and filing of charges against perpetrators as envisioned by this office under your administration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>There are significant differences between the technical description of Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate as stated in FLS-3168-D, the subdivision plan relied on by the Barques, and the technical description provided by the DENR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The DENR-confirmed technical description reads:<br><blockquote>Bounded on the E., along line-2  by <b>Payatas Estate</b>; on the SE., by <b>Tuazon Estate</b>; along line 3-4 by Lot 824; along line 4-5 by Lot <b>818</b>; and on the N., along line 5-1 by Lot 822, all of Piedad Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>However, if we examine the subdivision plan, there are critical changes with respect to the boundaries named therein. In effect, the boundaries as described in the subdivision plan would read:<br><blockquote>Bounded on the E., along line-2  by <b>Diez Francisco</b>; on the SE., by <b>Diez Francisco</b>; along line 3-4 by Lot 824; along line 4-5 by Lot <b>826</b>; and on the N., along line 5-1 by Lot 822, all of Piedad Estate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>The Barques offered no credible explanation  for the discrepancy between the subdivision plan it relies on and the DENR record. They also do not contradict the finding of the National Archives that there is no copy in its files of the deed of sale allegedly executed between Setosta and Barque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Lastly, in the 1<sup>st</sup> indorsement issued by the Land Projection Section of the LRA dated 23 August 2006, that Section stated that upon examination it was found out that the land as described in the Barque title "when plotted thru its tie line falls outside Quezon City." This is material, since Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate is within the boundaries of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> A similar finding was made by the Land Management Bureau (LMB). It attested that the line or directional azimuth of Lot No. 823 per the Barque title locates it at 5,889 meters away from point 1 of Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>These discrepancies highlight the error of the LRA and the Court of Appeals in acknowledging the right of the Barques to seek reconstitution of their purported Barque title.  Even assuming that the petition for reconstitution should not have been dismissed due to the Manotok title, it is apparent that the Barques' claim of ownership is exceedingly weak.<br><center><br><i>V</i><br></center><br>In the course of fully reevaluating these cases, the Court could not turn a blind eye on the evidence and points raised against the Manotok title. The apparent flaws in the Manotoks' claim are considerable and disturbing enough. The Court, as the ultimate citadel of justice and legitimacy, is a guardian of the integrity of the land registration system of the Philippines. We will be derelict in our duty if we remain silent on  the apparent defects of the Manotok title, reflective as they are of a scourge this Court is dedicated to eliminate.<br><br>Many of these flaws have especially emerged through the petition-for-intervention of Felicitas and Rosendo Manahan, whom we have allowed to intervene in these cases. The Manahans had filed a petition with the OSG seeking that it initiate cancellation/reversion proceedings against the Manotok title. That petition was referred by the OSG to the LMB of the DENR, which duly investigated the claim of the Manahans. The Chief of the Legal Division of the LMB recommended that the appropriate proceedings be taken in the proper court for the cancellation of the Manotok title, through a Memorandum dated 17 April 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Around the same time, the LMB referred to the DENR Undersecretary for Legal Affairs Roseller S. dela Peña a query on whether a deed of conveyance could be issued to Felicitas Manahan. The DENR Undersecretary, in answering that query through a Memorandum dated 6 July 2000, pointed out that the titles of the Manotoks could not have been derived from OCT No. 614, the mother title of Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The chain of transfers leading from OCT No. 614 to the Manotok title was a TCT No. 22813, purportedly issued by the Office of the Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal. The copy of said TCT No. 22813 submitted to the Court is truncated in the upper half, to the point that it is not visually discernible what year the same was issued. More crucially, a certification was issued by the Register of Deeds of Rizal dated 7 January 2000 stating thus:<br><blockquote>After a thorough verification from the files of this Office, it appears that the documents leading to the issuance of TCT No. 22813, Blk. T-92 cannot be found from the files of this Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>These findings were twice verified with due diligence and reconfirmed by the DENR, according to Undersecretary Dela Peña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The DENR also requested the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in conducting the said investigation. The NBI examined various sales certificates and assignment of sales certificates in the names of the purported predecessors-in-interest of the Manotoks Regina Geronimo, Modesto Zacarias, and Felicisimo Villanueva—certificates that were all dated prior to 1930. In its Chemistry Report No. C-99-152 dated 10 June 1999, the Forensic Chemistry Division of the NBI concluded that the said documents "could not be as old as it (<i>sic</i>) purports to be."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>According to the Manahans, the LMB did eventually forward to the Office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City a Deed of Conveyance for registration and mandatory issuance of title to Felicitas Manahan as grantee, pursuant to Section 122 of the Land Registration Act. The registration of said Deed of Conveyance was referred to the Administrator of the Land Registration Authority <i>en consulta</i> in 2001.<br><br>Also on record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> is an Investigation Report on Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate dated 5 July 1989, authored by Evelyn C. dela Rosa, Land Investigator of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO), NCR-North Sector and addressed to the CENRO Officer, North CENRO. It was narrated therein that Lot No. 823 had actually been in the possession of a Valentin Manahan beginning in 1908. In 1939, Valentin Manahan applied for the purchase of the land, and he was issued Sales Certificate No. 511. The Investigation Report stated:<br><blockquote>Records show that the Sale Certificate No. 511 covering Lot 823, Piedad Estate, was issued to Valentin Manahan as purchaser and transferred to Hilaria de Guzman Manahan as (Assignee) and sold to Felicitas Manahan by way of Deed of Absolute Sale dated August 23, 1974. Based on my research at the Land Management Bureau (LMB), Central Office, it appears that original claimant of lot 823 was Valentin Manahan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>All told, these apparent problems with the Manotoks' claim dissuade us from being simply content in reflexively dismissing the administrative petition for reconstitution filed by the Barques. Indeed, we have to take further action.<br><center><br><i>VI</i><br></center><br>The most formidable impediment to the Court reacting to the problems apparent in the Manotok title is the fact that we are not engaged in the review of an original action for the cancellation of such title. If, as in <i>Ortigas</i>, the validity of the questionable title were now properly at issue, the Court would without hesitancy rule on such question. Because it is not, the matter of how next to proceed warrants more deliberation.<br><br>The conservative approach would be to still affirm the continuing validity of the Manotok title until the proper case for its cancellation is filed with the regional trial court. Within that context, it would also be a plausible recourse for us is to direct the Solicitor General to duly investigate the circumstances behind the transmission of Lot No. 823, formerly a Friar Land, to private persons. Thereafter, the Solicitor General can file the appropriate proceedings for cancellation if warranted. However, it is already apparent, following the evaluation of these cases, that there is evidence—unrefuted thus far—indicating that the Manotoks' claim to title is just as flawed as that of the Barques.<br><br>Can the Court declare the Manotok title void? In the 2002 decision in <i>Alonso v. Cebu Country Club</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the subject property therein had originally formed part of the Banilad Friar Lands. Cebu Country Club had undertaken the administrative reconstitution of the title to the property, leading Alonso to file a complaint for nullification of such title in order to vindicate his own claims to the property. Alonso's complaint was dismissed by the trial court and the Court of Appeals. While the case was pending with this Court, the Solicitor General was required to comment on the validity of Cebu Country Club's administratively reconstituted title. Ultimately, the Court concluded that Cebu Country Club had not been able to establish a clear title over the contested estate, and in the dispositive portion of its decision declared "that Lot No. 727 D-2 of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate covered by Original Certificate of Title Nos. 251, 232, and 253 legally belongs to the Government of the Philippines."<br><br>The following year, the Court, acting on the motions for reconsideration in <i>Alonso</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> extensively discussed why it had taken that extraordinary step even though the Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor General, had not participated or intervened in that case before the lower courts.<br><blockquote>It must be borne in mind that the disputed property is part of the "Friar Lands" over which the Government holds title and are not public lands but private or patrimonial property of the Government and can be alienated only upon proper compliance with the requirements of Act No. 1120 or the Friar Lands Act.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>It was thus primordial for the respondent to prove its acquisition of its title by clear and convincing evidence in view of the nature of the land. In fact, it is essential for both respondent and petitioners to establish that it had become private property. Both parties failed to do so. As we have held earlier, petitioners have not succeeded to prove their claim of ownership over the subject property.<br><center><br>x x x<br></center><br>Neither may the rewards of prescription be successfully invoked by respondent, as it is an iron-clad dictum that prescription can never lie against the Government. Since respondent failed to present the paper trail of the property's conversion to private property, the lengthy possession and occupation of the disputed land by respondent cannot be counted in its favor, as the subject property being a friar land, remained part of the patrimonial property of the Government. Possession of patrimonial property of the Government, whether spanning decades or centuries, can not ipso facto ripen into ownership. Moreover, the rule that statutes of limitation do not run against the State, unless therein expressly provided, is founded on "the great principle of public policy, applicable to all governments alike, which forbids that the public interests should be prejudiced by the negligence of the officers or agents to whose care they are confided."<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Finally, our declaration that Lot 727-D-2 of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate legally belongs to the Government does not amount to reversion without due process of law insofar as both parties are concerned. The disputed property is a Friar Land and both parties failed to show that it had ceased to belong to the patrimonial property of the State or that it had become private property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote>The <i>Alonso </i>approach especially appeals to us because, as in this case, the subject property therein was a Friar Land which under the Friar Lands Law (Act No. 1120) may be disposed of by the Government only under that law. Thus, there is greater concern on the part of this Court to secure its proper transmission to private hands, if at all.<br><br>At the same time, the Court recognizes that there is not yet any sufficient evidence for us to warrant the annulment of the Manotok title. All that the record indicates thus far is evidence not yet refuted by clear and convincing proof that the Manotoks' claim to title is flawed. To arrive at an ultimate determination, the formal reception of evidence is in order. This Court is not a trier of fact or otherwise structurally capacitated to receive and evaluate evidence <i>de novo</i>. However, the Court of Appeals is sufficiently able to undertake such function.<br><br>The remand of cases pending with this Court to the Court of Appeals for reception of further evidence is not a novel idea. It has been undertaken before - in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and more recently in our 2007 Resolution in <i>Manotok v. Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  Our following explanation in <i>Manotok</i> equally applies to this case:<br><blockquote>Under Section 6 of Rule 46, which is applicable to original cases for certiorari, the Court may, whenever necessary to resolve factual issues, delegate the reception of the evidence on such issues to any of its members or to an appropriate court, agency or office. 80 The delegate need not be the body that rendered the assailed decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals generally has the authority to review findings of fact. Its conclusions as to findings of fact are generally accorded great respect by this Court. It is a body that is fully capacitated and has a surfeit of experience in appreciating factual matters, including documentary evidence.<br><br>In fact, the Court had actually resorted to referring a factual matter pending before it to the Court of Appeals. In <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>, this Court commissioned the former Thirteenth Division of the Court of Appeals to hear and receive evidence on the controversy, more particularly to determine "the actual area reclaimed by the Republic Real Estate Corporation, and the areas of the Cultural Center Complex which are 'open spaces' and/or `areas reserved for certain purposes,' determining in the process the validity of such postulates and the respective measurements of the areas referred to." The Court of Appeals therein received the evidence of the parties and rendered a "Commissioner's Report" shortly thereafter. Thus, resort to the Court of Appeals is not a deviant procedure.<br><br>The provisions of Rule 32 should also be considered as governing the grant of authority to the Court of Appeals to receive evidence in the present case. Under Section 2, Rule 32 of the Rules of Court, a court may, <i>motu proprio</i>, direct a reference to a commissioner when a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, arises upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of a case, or for carrying a judgment or order into effect. The order of reference can be limited exclusively to receive and report evidence only, and the commissioner may likewise rule upon the admissibility of evidence. The commissioner is likewise mandated to submit a report in writing to the court upon the matters submitted to him by the order of reference. In <i>Republic</i>, the commissioner's report formed the basis of the final adjudication by the Court on the matter. The same result can obtain herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>The primary focus for the Court of Appeals, as an agent of this Court, in receiving and evaluating evidence should be whether the Manotoks can trace their claim of title to a valid alienation by the Government  of  Lot  No. 823  of  the  Piedad  Estate, which was a Friar Land. On that evidence, this Court may ultimately decide whether annulment of the Manotok title is warranted, similar to the annulment of the Cebu Country Club title in <i>Alonso</i>. At the same time, the Court recognizes that the respective claims to title by other parties such as the Barques and the Manahans, and the evidence they may submit on their behalf, may have an impact on the correct determination of the status of the Manotok title. It would thus be prudent, in assuring the accurate evaluation of the question, to allow said parties, along with the OSG, to participate in the proceedings before the Court of Appeals. If the final evidence on record definitively reveals the proper claimant to the subject property, the Court would take such fact into consideration as it adjudicates final relief.<br><br>For the purposes above-stated, the Court of Appeals is tasked to hear and receive evidence, conclude the proceedings and submit to this Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within three (3) months from notice of this Resolution.<br><br>To assist the Court of Appeals in its evaluation of the factual record, the Office of the Solicitor General is directed to secure all the pertinent  relevant records  from  the Land Management Bureau and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and submit the same to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decision dated 12 June 2005, and the Resolutions dated 19 April and 19 June 2006 of the Court's First Division are hereby SET ASIDE, and the Entry of Judgment recorded on 2 May 2006 is RECALLED.

No. Q-547-A <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[97]</span>.<br><br><center> <u><b>The Ruling of the Land Registration Authority</b></u><br></center><br>In a Resolution dated 24 June 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the LRA gave due course to the appeal. The LRA ruled that under LRA Circular No. 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> only the owner's or co-owner's duplicate of an original or transfer certificate of title may be used as a source of administrative reconstitution. Hence, Atty. Bustos erred in requiring the submission of documents other than the owner's duplicate TCT. The LRA further ruled that Engineer Dalire failed to deny or question the genuineness of his signature in the letter of 2 January 1997. The LRA held that the 2 January 1997 letter is an official communication from Engineer Dalire. The LRA Administrator <b>personally opined</b> that the Manotoks' TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] is sham and spurious. Thus:<br><blockquote> It is undisputed that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, the property in question, is located at Barrio Matandang Balara, Quezon City. Several documents submitted by oppositors particularly the several Deeds of Sale and Unilateral Deed of Conveyance including the real estate tax receipts would show that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate is located at Barrio Payong, and/or Barrio Culiat [Annexes "2" to "77" inclusive "79", "84" and "85" of Opposition] which is grossly inaccurate. The map of Quezon City [Annex "N" of Petitioners' Position Paper] would show that there is no such barrio as Payong. It must likewise be noted that there is a Barrio Culiat but the same is separate and distinct from Barrio Matandang Balara and they do not adjoin each other. Quite perplexing though is the fact that the real estate tax receipts for payments made after the Quezon City Hall was gutted by fire on 11 June 1988 would show that the property covered thereby is already situated at Barrio Matandang Balara [Annexes "91" to "104" inclusive of Opposition], while in other tax payment receipts [Annexes "103" to "114" inclusive of Opposition], Barrio Capitol is indicated as the location of the property in question. This is highly questionable and likewise highly irregular. The said real estate tax receipts also reflect the tax declaration of the property covered thereby. It is highly irregular that the tax declaration numbers indicated therein would vary and those tax declarations which appear to have been canceled would again be revived.<br><br>The claim of the oppositors that the property in question per TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] covers only one <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1]</span> lot is also inaccurate and without any basis. Plan FLS 3168D shows that the property in question indeed consists of two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots, Lot 823-A and Lot 823-B. The same is being buttressed and corroborated by the certified copy of the tax map over the property in question issued by the Quezon City Assessor's Office [annex "H" of Petitioners Position Paper]. Said tax map shows that similar to TCT No. 210177 and Plan FLS 3168D, the property in question covers two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots, Lot 823-A and Lot 823-B. Granting arguendo that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate has not yet been subdivided into two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots from the date of original survey in 1907, it is highly irregular that TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] would have Lot 822-A Psd 2498, Lot 818-A and Lot 818-C Psd 2507 as boundaries when at the time of the original survey, there were no such Psd's yet.<br><br>Examination of the technical decription and boundaries appearing in TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] would show that the same do not, in all respects, conform to the certified technical description and boundaries of Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate [property in question] which are the B. L. Form No. 28-37-R and B. L. Form No. 31-10 issued by the Bureau of Lands [Annexes "I" and "J" of Petitioners' Position Paper]. There was never any mention of Payatas Estate nor Tuazon Estate as the boundaries of the lot in question. The lot in question does not at all adjoin the Payatas Estate which was surveyed only on January 12, 1923 as per certification issued by the LMS-DENR-NCR [Annex "L" Petitioners' Position Paper]. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, Lot 822 was mentioned as one of the boundaries of TCT No. RT-22481 [372302].

The dissenting opinion states that there is no compelling reason to depart from the doctrine of immutability and unalterability of decisions.<br><br>On the contrary, the 12 December 2005 Decision never became final and executory. The doctrine of immutability and unalterability of decisions <b>necessarily</b> <b>applies only to final and executory decisions</b>. If the decision never became final and executory, the doctrine of immutability and unalterability of decisions has no application. Before finality of a decision, a court has "plenary power to alter, modify or even set aside, its own decisions, and even order a new trial, at any time before the decision becomes final."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>There are <b>two compelling jurisdictional reasons</b> why the 12 December 2005 Decision of the First Division never became final and executory. First, the First Division has no jurisdiction to overturn a doctrine laid down by the Court <i>en banc</i> or in division. The Court <i>en banc</i> has ruled in <i>Group Commander, Intelligence and Security Group, Philippine Army v. Dr. Malvar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> that a decision of a division is void if it overturns a doctrine established by the <i>en banc</i> or another division. There, the Court held:<br><blockquote> Section 4, sub-paragraph (3), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, provides:<br><blockquote> "x x x no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the (Supreme) Court en banc or its Divisions may be modified or reversed except by the Court sitting en banc."<br></blockquote><b> A Decision rendered by a Division of this Court in violation of the above constitutional provision would be in excess of jurisdiction and, therefore, invalid</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A void decision vests no right, creates no obligation, grants no title, and settles no issue. A void decision protects no one and is subject to attack, directly or collaterally,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> at any time. A void decision has no existence in law. Therefore, a void decision cannot become final and executory against, or in favor of, any one.<br><br>Second, the doctrine of immutability and unalterability of decisions applies only if the trial court or hearing officer has jurisdiction over the subject matter. A decision rendered by a trial court or hearing officer without jurisdiction over the subject matter is void and cannot become final and executory. Such decision cannot even become <i>res judicata</i> because there can be no conclusiveness of judgment if the trial court or hearing officer has no jurisdiction over the subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In these cases, the LRA has no jurisdiction to reconstitute administratively the title of the Barques because such reconstitution constitutes an indirect or collateral attack on the <b>pre-existing</b> Torrens title of the Manotoks over the same property. <b>Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><b> states that a "certificate of title shall not be subject to a collateral attack."</b> The LRA, or even any court for that matter, has no jurisdiction to entertain a collateral attack<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> on a Torrens title. The Manotoks' <b>prior title</b> must be deemed valid and subsisting as it cannot be assailed through collateral attack in the reconstitution proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><center> <b>THE MANOTOKS' PRIOR TITLE NULLIFIES <br>RECONSTITUTION PROCEEDINGS OF BARQUES</b><br></center><br>In fact, the existence of a prior Torrens title over the same property in the name of another person <i>ipso facto</i> nullifies the reconstitution proceedings and renders the reconstituted title void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <i>Demetriou v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><i> </i>penned by Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, is instructive and summarizes the law on this matter:<br><blockquote> But a judgment otherwise final may be annulled not only on the ground of extrinsic fraud but also because of lack of jurisdiction of the court which rendered it. In <i>Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals</i>, on facts analogous to those involved in this case, <b>this Court already held that if a certificate of title has not been lost but is in fact in the possession of another person, the reconstituted title is void and the court rendering the decision has not acquired jurisdiction</b>. <b>Consequently, the decision may be attacked any time</b>. Indeed, Rep. Act No. 26, § 18 provides that "in case a certificate of title, considered lost or destroyed be found or recovered, the same shall prevail over the reconstituted certificate of title." It was, therefore, error for the Court of Appeals to dismiss the petition for annulment of judgment of the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Even before <i>Demetriou</i>, this Court had already ruled in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> that the existence of a prior Torrens title <i>ipso facto</i> nullifies the reconstitution proceedings, thus:<br><blockquote> <b>The existence of the two titles of the Government for Lots Nos. 915 and 918 <i>ipso facto</i> nullified the reconstitution proceedings</b> and signified that the evidence in the said proceedings as to the alleged ownership of Laborada and Bombasi cannot be given any credence. The two proceedings were sham and deceitful and were filed in bad faith.

The Barques justified the authenticity of the copy they presented by claiming that their copy was "initialed in each and every page."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> However, the Barques' copy of Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) differed from the original of Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) that the LRA reconstituting officer himself signed on 27 January 1997. <b>To repeat, t</b><b>he original of Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) was an order issued and signed by the LRA reconstituting officer, Atty.

Bustos, handling the Barques' then pending petition for administrative reconstitution.<br><br>The Barques also failed to explain why they still pursued their petition for administrative reconstitution of their title if indeed they had already obtained an approved reconstitution on 27 January 1997 under their copy of Administrative Reconstitution Order No. Q-535(96). On 13 August 1998, the LRA reconstituting officer filed before the LRA Administrator the following Comment:<br><blockquote> 2. That we maintain our position denying the reconstitution of TCT No. 210177, on the grounds stated in our Order dated June 30, 1997, and on the following additional grounds, to wit:<br><blockquote> 2.1 If the late Homer L. Barque, really purchased the subject property in the year 1975, why did he not take possession of it upon purchase, and up to now his descendants, the Petitioners, are not in possession of the property, but the Oppositors?;<br><br>2.2 Why was the property declared, and realty taxes were paid in the name of Barque, only in the year 1996? Whereas, the Oppositors and their predecessors have been paying realty taxes on the property since the year 1965;<br><br><b>2.3 Why did the Petitioner try to mislead us by submitting a tampered copy of Adm. Reconstitution Order No. Q-535(96)?</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The LRA reconstituting officer ended his Comment by urging the LRA Administrator that "<b>this case be referred to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission for investigation</b>."<br><br>In their Memorandum dated 6 September 2007, the Barques explained the circumstances of the order of reconstitution they submitted to the LRA in this manner:<br><blockquote> The said resolution was issued on January 27, 1997 when there was, as yet, no opposition from anyone to the Barques' petition for reconstitution and after the Barque had already submitted their Owner's Duplicate Copy of TCT No. 210177 which entitled them, like the several other petitioners listed in Mr. Bustos' aforesaid Resolution, to a reconstitution thereof under R.A. 6732.<br><br>In his letter, Atty. Turgano surmised that:<br><blockquote> "The animosity and bias of Mr. Bustos against petitioners may be explained by the fact that he was responsible in giving due course and approving with dispatch the administrative reconstitution of the Manotok title which is TCT No. RT-22481 (372302).<br></blockquote>Mr. Bustos' bias was likewise shown when he alerted the Manotoks of the Barques' Petition for Reconstitution which prompted them to file their opposition to the Barques' petition on April 14, 1997. <b>He, therefore, apparently had the motive to delete the title and name of the Barques from his resolution</b>.<br><br>At any rate, said resolution of Bustos was completely irrelevant to the LRA proceedings since it is his Order denying Barques' petition for reconstitution that was raised on appeal before the LRA Administrator. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In short, the Barques represent to this Court that their copy of Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96), listing their TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L. Barque, Sr. as one of the titles approved for reconstitution by Atty. Bustos, is authentic, genuine and untampered. This is contrary to the categorical declaration of Atty. Bustos that the copy of Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) submitted by the Barques is a "<b>tampered document</b>," and <b>that the original Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) that Atty. Bustos himself signed, which original is on file in his office in the LRA, does not include TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L. Barque, Sr. </b><br><br>Ironically, the Barques put the blame on Atty. Bustos for "<b>delet(ing) the title and name of the Barques from the resolution</b>." The Barques are now accusing Atty. Bustos of falsification by deleting the Barques' name and title in Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96). Before such deletion, the Barques insist that Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) included the Barques' name and title, which is the copy that the Barques submitted to the LRA Administrator.<br><br>In the first place, there was no reason whatsoever for Atty. Bustos to include the Barques' title and name in Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96). When Atty. Bustos signed the order on 27 January 1997, he was still corresponding with Engineer Dalire on the forgery found in the Barques' plan Fls-3168-D. The last letter of Engineer Dalire to Atty. Bustos was on 31 January 1997. On 14 February 1997, Atty. Bustos even wrote the LRA Administrator about the "attempt to mislead us (LRA) into favorable action by submitting forged documents." Clearly, Atty. Bustos could not have included the Barques' title and name in Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96).<br><br>In their Memorandum dated 6 September 2007, the Barques gave the lame excuse that Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96) is now "completely irrelevant" because what was raised on appeal to the LRA was the order of Atty. Bustos denying the Barques' petition for reconstitution. If their copy of Administrative Reconstitution Order No. Q-535(96) is truly authentic and untampered, the Barques should insist that their petition for administrative reconstitution was in fact approved by the reconstituting officer Atty. Bustos. The Barques do not claim or even mention this now, instead they agree that Atty. Bustos denied their petition, contrary to their claim that Atty. Bustos granted their petition by including the Barques' title and name in Administrative Reconstitution No. Q-535(96).<br><br>The Barques cannot simply brush aside their submission of tampered or forged documents. These <b>patent forgeries</b> are grounds to render the Barques' reconstituted title <b>void <i>ab initio</i></b>. Section 11 of Republic Act No. 6732 (RA 6732),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the law allowing administrative reconstitution of titles, provides:<br><blockquote> SEC. 11.

The claim of the Barques that Setosta purchased the property directly from the Government in the 1940s is belied by the 1927 Annual Report of the Director of Lands, stating that:<br><blockquote> With the exception of the estates of Calamba, Imus, Isabela, Lolomboy, Naic, San Francisco de Malabon, Santa Cruz de Malabon, Santa Maria de Pandi, and Talisay-Minglanilla, where there are still some vacant lands, <b>all the others of the 23 Friar land estates had already been entirely disposed of</b>. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>At the end of 1927, the Government had already sold all of the Piedad Estate, a Friar land. <b>Thus, the Government could not have sold directly to Setosta the disputed property in the 1940s. </b><br><br><b><i><u>Twelfth: Lands Management Bureau Relocation Survey Shows Barques' Property Located 5.6 Kilometers from Piedad Estate</u></i></b><br><br>Intervenors Felicitas and Rosendo Manahan (Manahans) have submitted a <b>relocation survey</b> made by the Lands Management Bureau NCR Regional Office of the Barques' plan Fls-3168-D showing that the Barques' property is located "<b>some 5.6 kilometers away from Lot No. 823 of the Piedad Estate, outside of Quezon City</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The relocation survey plan is signed by Ludivina L.

The dissenting opinion claims that the Barques' title was already existing at the time of the reconstitution of the Manotoks' title in 1991. This is an egregious error. When the Manotoks' title was reconstituted in 1991, the Barques' title had not been reconstituted, and even up to now the reconstitution of the Barques' title is still pending resolution in the instant case. In contrast, when the Barques filed their reconstitution in 1996, the Manotoks' title had already been finally reconstituted and existing. Clearly, it is the Barques' still pending reconstitution that can no longer proceed because of the existing title of the Manotoks.<br><br>In <i>Alabang</i>, the Court held that a "<b>duly issued existing Torrens title x x x cannot be the subject of petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles by third parties without first securing by final judgment the cancellation of such existing titles." </b>The phrase "duly issued existing Torrens title" simply means a title <b>verifiably issued by the proper Register of Deeds</b>. The validity or invalidity of the title is not material at that point. What is material is whether the Register of Deeds actually issued the title as part of his regular functions.<br><br>Clearly, at the time of the reconstitution of the Manotoks' title, the Barques had no "duly issued existing Torrens title" from the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. When the Barques filed the reconstitution of their title, the Manotoks already had a prior title, which was the only "duly issued existing Torrens title" over the property issued by the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. The Manotoks' title could be verified against the reconstituted original title on file with the Register of Deeds. In fact, the LRA Administrator has admitted that the Manotoks' title "is existing as a reconstituted title at the Office of the Register of Deeds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>The Barques could not produce even up to now a "duly issued existing Torrens title" from the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. The Barques' owner's duplicate certificate of title could not be verified with the Register of Deeds of Quezon City because the Barques' title has no corresponding original title, whether reconstituted or not, on file with the Register of Deeds. Thus, the reconstitution of the Barques' title, which is still pending in this case, can no longer proceed.<br><br>Once the reconstituting court or officer establishes that the Register of Deeds has in fact issued an existing title in the name of another person, the proper step is to file an action before the Regional Trial Court to annul such title. <b>It is in such proceeding before the regional trial court that the validity or invalidity of the title is determined</b>. In such proceeding, any party may introduce in evidence the LRA Administrator or the NBI's findings. <b>In the meantime, no reconstitution proceeding can prosper until after the cancellation by final judgment of such existing title.</b><br><br>The <i>Alabang</i> ruling necessarily involves a situation where there is an existing title issued by the Register of Deeds at the time of filing of a petition to reconstitute <b>another title</b> over the same property in the name of another person. The <i>Alabang</i> ruling states that in such a situation the reconstituting authority has no jurisdiction to proceed with the reconstitution until a final judgment cancels the other title. This is clear from the Court's ruling in <i>Alabang</i>: <br><blockquote> <b>The Court stresses once more that lands already covered by duly issued existing Torrens titles</b> (which become incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from their issuance under Section 38 of the Land Registration Act) <b>cannot be the subject of petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by third parties without first securing by final judgment the cancellation of such existing titles.</b> (And as the Court reiterated in the recent case of Silvestre vs. Court of Appeals, "in cases of annulment and/or reconveyance of title, a party seeking it should establish not merely by a preponderance of evidence but by clear and convincing evidence that the land sought to be reconveyed is his.") The courts simply have no jurisdiction over petitions by such third parties for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles over lands that are already covered by duly issued subsisting titles in the names of their duly registered owners. <b>The very concept of stability and indefeasibility of titles covered under the Torrens System of registration rules out as anathema the issuance of two certificates of title over the same land to two different holders thereof.</b> A fortiori, such proceedings for "reconstitution" without actual notice to the duly registered owners and holders of Torrens Titles to the land are null and void. Applicants, land officials and judges who disregard these basic and fundamental principles will be held duly accountable therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>The Decision of the First Division misapplies the <i>Alabang</i> ruling by holding that the LRA Administrator can adjudicate on the validity of a Torrens title by a finding that the title was not "duly issued." Even the Register of Deeds, who physically issues a Torrens title as part of his regular functions, cannot adjudicate on the validity of a title. The Decision states that the "function of the (LRA) is adjudicatory in nature — it can properly deliberate on the validity of the titles submitted for reconstitution." This is grave error.<br><br><b>Time and again, this Court has ruled that reconstitution, even judicial reconstitution, does not confirm or adjudicate ownership over a property</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Reconstitution merely restores a missing certificate of title in the same condition that it was when lost or destroyed, nothing more. If the original title had a legal defect at the time of the loss or destruction, as when the land covered is part of the public forest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> the reconstituted title does not cure such defect. As this Court held in <i>Director of Lands v. Gan Tan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107] </sup><br><blockquote> But the lower court claims that petitioner, even if he complied with all the requirements of the law, is <b>not entitled to have his title reconstituted for the reason that, being an alien, he is not qualified to acquire the land covered by said title under our Constitution. However, we find this claim untenable in the light of the theory that a </b><b>Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. The rule on this matter is that this issue can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose</b> (Legarda vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil., 590). Moreover, it is a well known doctrine that a Torrens title, as a rule, is irrevocable and indefeasible (Bachrach Motor Co. vs. Kane, 61 Phil., 504), and <b>our duty is to see to it that this title is maintained and respected unless challenged in a direct proceeding</b>.<br><br>To our mind, the only issue here is whether there is a title to be reconstituted. That is the only purpose of the law (Rep. Act No. 26). If there is, then it is the duty of the court to comply with its mandate. <b><u>Whether the petitioner has the right to acquire the land or not, is beyond the province of this proceeding.

The original jurisdiction to adjudicate or to decide the validity of a Torrens title is vested by law <b>exclusively</b> in the Regional Trial Court pursuant to Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree. Section 19 of the Judiciary Act vests in the Regional Trial Court the "<b>exclusive original jurisdiction</b>" to decide factual and legal issues "<b>which involve the title to x x x real property</b>." This means the Regional Trial Court <b>first decides</b> the validity of the Torrens title, and this power to first decide is to the exclusion of all other organs of the State. Not even the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court can usurp this exclusive original power of the Regional Trial Court. Any judgment resulting from such usurpation is void.<br><br><b>What the LRA Administrator or agencies like the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) can issue are administrative, non-adjudicatory findings on whether a Torrens title is spurious or authentic. These findings are mere evidences that must be submitted to the Regional Trial Court, which alone has the power to adjudicate whether the title is void. Findings by the LRA or the NBI that a title is spurious are merely administrative opinions, not a judicial determination that settles rights and obligations between parties over a disputed property. These findings are merely evidences, not the judgment itself of validity or invalidity which can only come from the Regional Trial Court. These findings do not become <i>res judicata</i>, while the judgment of the Regional Trial Court can become <i>res judicata</i>.</b><br><br><b>Clearly, the grant of a reconstituted title is not an adjudication of the title's validity</b>. The Barques received an undeserved windfall when the First Division declared their reconstituted title valid when the only relief they sought in the administrative reconstitution was the restoration of their title in its condition at the time of the alleged loss or destruction. This Court has ruled in <i>Alonso v. Cebu Country Club, Inc</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109] </sup><br><blockquote> Respondent relies solely on its reconstituted title which, by itself, does not determine or resolve the ownership of the land covered by the lost or destroyed title. <b><i>The reconstitution of a title is simply the re-issuance of a lost duplicate certificate of title in its original form and condition.

Section 19 of the Judiciary Act vests in courts of justice the "<b>exclusive original jurisdiction</b>" to decide factual and legal issues involving "<b>the title to x x x real property</b>."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>EQUITY JURISDICTION DOES NOT APPLY</b><br></div><br>The dissenting opinion further argues that the Manotoks are estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the LRA Administrator or the LRA reconstituting officer. The dissenting opinion asserts that the Manotoks failed to question in the proceedings before these LRA officials their jurisdiction to reconstitute administratively the Barques' title. This invocation of equity jurisdiction in favor of the LRA Administrator and the LRA reconstituting officer — for the benefit of the Barques - is grossly erroneous.<br><br><i>First</i>, the settled doctrine is "<b>he who seeks equity must come to court with clean hands</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The Barques have submitted <b>patently forged documents</b> to the LRA reconstituting officer. In the development of equity jurisdiction through the ages, the constant principle from which there was no deviation was that equity could never be used to reward those who commit fraud. This Court should not depart from the noble intention that motivated the development and use of equity jurisdiction. As this Court aptly stated in <i>Pagasa Industrial Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112] </sup><br><blockquote> Pagasa cannot rely on equity because he who comes into equity must come with clean hands. <b>Equity refuses to lend its aid in any manner to one seeking its active interposition who has been guilty of unlawful or inequitable conduct in the matter with relation to which he seeks relief</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> (30 C.J.S. 1009). (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote><i>Second</i>, the principle of jurisdiction by estoppel applies only to those who have sought<b> </b>affirmative relief<b> </b>in the wrong court, lost there, and then assail the adverse decision of that court. This estoppel applies against a party "<b>who has invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape an adverse decision</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> However, it was the Barques, not the Manotoks, who sought the <b>affirmative relief</b> of a reconstituted title. In their Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> before the LRA reconstituting officer, the Manotoks sought a defensive, <b>negative relief</b> - that the Barques' petition "be dismissed for lack of merit." It was also the Barques, not the Manotoks, who invoked the jurisdiction of the LRA, which had no jurisdiction over the Barques' petition because of the pre-existing title of the Manotoks. Moreover, it was the Barques, not the Manotoks, who lost before the LRA reconstituting officer and who assailed the adverse decision before the LRA Administrator. The Barques even lost before the LRA Administrator who refused to reconstitute the Barques' title without the intervention of a "court of competent jurisdiction." Clearly, jurisdiction by estoppel cannot apply to the Manotoks.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the LRA Administrator and the LRA reconstituting officer refused to assume jurisdiction to reconstitute administratively the Barques' title. The LRA Administrator denied the Barques' petition because of the existence of the Manotoks' title, which in the words of the LRA Administrator must first be cancelled by<b> </b>"<b>a court of competent jurisdiction</b>" before the Barques' petition may be given due course. The LRA reconstituting officer also denied the Barques' petition because of the existence of the Manotoks' title which the LRA had already reconstituted. <b>In short, these LRA officials admitted that they had no jurisdiction over the Barques' petition</b>. Since these LRA officials refused to assume jurisdiction, there was no assumption of equity jurisdiction that the Manotoks could have questioned. For the same reason, there is no assumption of jurisdiction that this Court can now recognize and validate through equity principles.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, the principle of <b>equity jurisdiction</b> arising from estoppel or any other reason <b>applies only to courts of justice</b>. The jurisdiction of courts of justice arises from either statute or equity, or both. In legal systems which recognize equity jurisdiction, <b>equity is an inherent power of courts</b> by virtue of their duty to dispense justice to the full extent possible. <b>Equity jurisdiction is a judicial power</b>. Administrative agencies or officers exercising administrative, executive, or ministerial functions cannot assume equity jurisdiction because they do not exercise judicial functions. Thus, it is gross error to invest on the LRA Administrator and the LRA reconstituting officer equity jurisdiction because these LRA officers perform administrative or executive functions in petitions for <b>administrative</b> reconstitution of titles.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, the Manotoks did in fact raise the issue of the LRA Administrator's jurisdiction in relation to the LRA Administrator's opinion that the Manotoks' title was "sham and spurious." In their Motion for Reconsideration dated 27 August 1998 before the LRA Administrator,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> the Manotoks stated:<br><blockquote> Moreover, it is not disputed that herein oppositors are the holder of an existing valid and effective TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) covering the same land embraced by TCT No. 210177 in question found which, as stated, is non-existing and spurious. <b>Given said fact, no administrative reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 should proceed</b>. As held by the Supreme Court, to wit: <br><blockquote> So too, this Court has stressed "<b>that lands already covered by duly issued existing Torrens titles</b> (which become incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from their issuance under section 38 of the Land Registration Act) <b>cannot be the subject of petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by third parties without first securing by final judgment the cancellation of such existing titles</b>."

Thus, the Court declared in <i>People v. Casiano</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118] </sup><br><blockquote>4.The operation of the principle of estoppel on the question of jurisdiction seemingly depends upon whether the lower court actually had jurisdiction or not. <b>If it had no jurisdiction, but the case was tried and decided upon the theory that it had jurisdiction, the parties are not barred, on appeal, from assailing such jurisdiction, for the same "must exist as a matter of law, and may not be conferred by consent of the parties or by estoppel"</b> (5 C.J.S., 861-863). <b>However, if the lower court had jurisdiction, and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for instance, as that the court had no jurisdiction, the party who induced it to adopt such theory will not be permitted, on appeal, to assume an inconsistent position — that the lower court had jurisdiction. Here, the principle of estoppel applies</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>The LRA never had jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the Torrens title of the Manotoks. Jurisdiction, as ruled in <i>People v. Casiano</i>, "<b>must exist as a matter of law, and may not be conferred by consent of the parties or by estoppel</b>." It is axiomatic that only the law can confer jurisdiction. No amount of estoppel can vest jurisdiction on an officer or court that the law has not conferred jurisdiction.<br><br>The LRA Administrator expressly admitted that only the proper Regional Trial Court has the jurisdiction to cancel the Torrens title of the Manotoks. Only the Barques insist that the LRA has jurisdiction to cancel a Torrens title of a third party in an administrative reconstitution proceedings filed by another party, a contention that is patently baseless.<br><br><i>Seventh</i>, and <b>most important of all</b>, equity jurisdiction can never be used to violate the law. Equity jurisdiction aims to attain complete justice in cases where a court of law is unable to render judgment to meet the special circumstances of a case because of the limitations of its statutory jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> <b>However,</b> <b>equity follows the law, and courts exercising equity jurisdiction must still apply the law and have no discretion to disregard the law</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Where the law prescribes a particular remedy with fixed and limited boundaries, the court cannot, by exercising equity jurisdiction, extend the boundaries further than the law allows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Thus, this Court has ruled: <br><blockquote> <b>As for equity</b>, which has been aptly described as `a justice outside legality,' <b>this is applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law or, as in this case, judicial rules of procedure</b>. <i>Aequetas nunquam contravenit legis</i>. The pertinent positive rules being present here, they should pre-empt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote><b>Hence, no court can extend equity jurisdiction to the LRA where the law has <i>expressly reserved exclusive original jurisdiction</i> to the Regional Trial Court</b>. <b>No court, invoking equity jurisdiction, can</b> <b>also allow a collateral attack on a Torrens title, either before the LRA or before itself, in gross violation of Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree <i>expressly prohibiting collateral attacks </i>on Torrens titles. </b><br><br>This rule has special application to Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree, <b>enacted specifically to foreclose any possible collateral attack on a Torrens title, as well as any possible cancellation or modification of a Torrens title without a proceeding in the Regional Trial Court directly assailing the validity of the title</b>. Strict compliance with Section 48 is what gives Torrens titles enduring stability, preventing confusion and fraud in land ownership. To extend equity jurisdiction to LRA officers to allow them to entertain collateral attacks on a Torrens title is a gross and blatant violation of the clear and express command of a positive law. Any extension of equity jurisdiction that operates to negate Section 48 will destroy the most basic safeguard in the Property Registration Decree. Certainly, equity jurisdiction cannot be used for this purpose.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>WHETHER ASSAILED AS FRAUDULENTLY ISSUED OR <br>NOT, A TORRENS TITLE CAN ONLY BE CANCELLED IN <br>ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 48 OF THE PROPERTY <br>REGISTRATION DECREE</b><br></div><br>In cancelling the Manotoks' Torrens title without any trial before any court, the First Division of this Court completely disregarded Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree and Section 19 of the Judiciary Act. Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree provides that a Torrens title "cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding <b>in accordance with law</b>."<br><br>That law is Section 19 of the Judiciary Act which states that the "<b>Regional Trial Court shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction x x x in all civil actions, which involve the title to x x x real property</b>." These two provisions mandate that no Torrens title can be cancelled unless there is a proceeding in the proper Regional Trial Court directly assailing the validity of such title.<br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals committed a gross violation of Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree and Section 19 of the Judiciary Act when it ordered the cancellation of the Torrens title of the Manotoks without a prior proceeding before the proper Regional Trial Court directly assailing the validity of the Manotoks' title. Likewise, the First Division of this Court committed the same violation — totally disregarding Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree and Section 19 of the Judiciary Act, <b>and in the process overturning well-entrenched doctrines of this Court</b>.<br><br>The validity of a Torrens title, <b>whether fraudulently issued or not</b>, can be assailed only in a direct proceeding before the proper Regional Trial Court in accordance with Section 48.

The <i>ponente</i> has obviously misread <i>Rexlon Realty</i>. <i>Rexlon Realty</i> was a petition filed with the Court of Appeals for <b><i>annulment of judgment of the Regional Trial Court</i></b> on the ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the reconstitution of lost owner's duplicates of titles to respondent Alex David. Rexlon Realty proved that the titles were not lost but were in its possession as the first buyer of the properties from Alex David who had later sold again the properties to Paramount Development Corporation. Rexlon Realty also proved that Alex David delivered the titles to Rexlon Realty pursuant to the sale.<br><br><i>Rexlon Realty</i> does not involve two conflicting titles over the same property, which is the situation in the present case. In <i>Rexlon Realty</i>, the opposing parties agreed that there was only one set of titles covering the same properties. The only issue in <i>Rexlon Realty </i>was whether the titles were lost, and if so, the trial court had jurisdiction to grant the reconstitution of the titles; but if the titles were not lost, then the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the reconstitution of titles.<br><br>Rexlon Realty did not question the validity of the titles of Alex David, which covered properties that Rexlon Realty had purchased from Alex David. <b>Rexlon Realty's obvious interest was to maintain the validity of the titles to the properties it had purchased, the titles to which were in Rexlon Realty's possession. </b> Thus, Rexlon Realty did not invoke Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree, the law requiring a direct proceeding in the proper regional trial court in any attack assailing the validity of a Torrens title. <b>To reiterate, the validity of a Torrens title, which is at issue in direct proceedings under Section 48, is a separate and distinct issue from the propriety of a reconstitution of title</b>.<br><br>What Rexlon Realty questioned was the jurisdiction of the trial court in issuing<b> replacement titles</b> to the properties in the name of Alex David who claimed that he lost the titles. In assailing as void the trial court's judgment, Rexlon Realty invoked, as stated by the Court, "Section 2, of Rule 47 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure," which provides "the grounds to annul a judgment of a lower court x x x [based on] fraud and lack of jurisdiction." Thus, the Court in <i>Rexlon Realty</i> ruled: <br><blockquote> x x x In the <i>Strait Times</i> case and in <i>Demetriou v. Court of Appeals</i>, also on facts analogous to those involved in this case,<b> we held that if an owner's duplicate copy of a certificate of title has not been lost but is in fact in the possession of another person, the reconstituted title is void and the court rendering the decision has not acquired jurisdiction.</b> Consequently, the decision may be attacked any time. In the case at bar, the authenticity and genuineness of the owner's duplicate of TCT Nos. T-52537 and T-52538 in the possession of petitioner Rexlon and the Absolute Deed of Sale in its favor have not been disputed. As there is no proof to support actual loss of the said owner's duplicate copies of said certificates of title, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction and the new titles issued in replacement thereof are void.<br><br>x x x<br><br>In this case at bar, we simply annulled the decision of the RTC, acting as a land registration court in L.R.C. Record No. 8843, to issue new owner's duplicate copies of TCT Nos. T-52537 and T-52538, for lack of jurisdiction. <b>The dispute between petitioner Rexlon and respondent David regarding ownership over the parcels of land will have to be threshed out or determined in a more appropriate proceeding. In a petition for the issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy of a certificate of title in lieu of one allegedly lost, the RTC, acting only as a land registration court, has no jurisdiction to pass upon the question of actual ownership of the land covered by the lost owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title. Possession of a lost owner's duplicate copy of a certificate of title is not necessarily equivalent to ownership of the land covered by it. The certificate of title, by itself, does not vest ownership; it is merely an evidence of title over a particular property</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>Indeed, <i>Rexlon Realty</i> supports the Manotoks' contention that once it is shown that there is a pre-existing title duly issued by the Register of Deeds over the same property which is the subject of reconstitution proceedings, the reconstitution cannot proceed for either of two reasons. First, the reconstituting officer or court has no jurisdiction to reconstitute a title that has never been lost or destroyed. Second, the reconstituting officer or court has no authority to decide which of two conflicting titles is valid. Thus, <i>Rexlon Realty</i> categorically ruled that in reconstitution proceedings, whether administrative or judicial, the reconstituting officer or court has no jurisdiction "<b>to pass upon the question of actual ownership of the land</b>" covered by the lost title because the "certificate of title, by itself, does not vest ownership."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>GUARANTY OF STABILITY OF THE TORRENS SYSTEM</b><br></div><br>Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree is the cornerstone of our land registration system providing stability to land titles. Without Section 48, our land registration system will crumble. Section 48 guarantees every landowner with a Torrens title that his title can never be cancelled unless the validity of his title is first directly assailed in court where he can adduce evidence in his favor. The Decision of the First Division erases this guarantee. In one stroke, the Decision of the First Division has overturned over a century of jurisprudence fortifying a guarantee essential to the stability of our land registration system.<br><br>In 1915, after the introduction in 1903<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> of the Torrens system in this country, this Court waxed poetic in <i>Legarda and Prieto v. Saleeby</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> in describing the cornerstone of the then new system of land registration. Declared the Court: <br><blockquote> x x x The real purpose of that system is to quiet title to land; to put a stop forever to any question of the legality of the title, except claims which were noted at the time of registration, in the certificate, or which may arise subsequent thereto. That being the purpose of the law, it would seem that<b> once a title is registered the owner may rest secure, without the necessity of waiting in the portals of the court, or sitting in the "<i>mirador de su casa</i>," to avoid the possibility of losing his land</b>. x x x<br><br>x x x <b>The title once registered, with very few exceptions, should not thereafter be impugned, altered, changed, modified, enlarged, or diminished,</b> <b><u>except in some direct proceeding permitted by law</u>. Otherwise, all security in registered titles would be lost</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied) <br></blockquote>This Court has reiterated the doctrine in <i>Legarda and Prieto v. Saleeby</i>, now embodied in Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree, in innumerable decisions. In the 2003 case of <i>Heirs of Santiago v. Heirs of Santiago</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> <b>a decision penned by Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago</b>, this Court declared: <br><blockquote>Section 48 of P.D. 1529, the Property Registration Decree, provides that <b>a certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack and can not be altered, modified, or canceled except in a direct proceeding.</b> An action is an attack on a title when the object of the action is to nullify the title, and thus challenge the judgment or proceeding pursuant to which the title was decreed. <b>The attack is direct when the object of an action is to annul or set aside such judgment, or enjoin its enforcement.</b> <b>On the other hand, the attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment or proceeding is nevertheless made as an incident thereof</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>The Decision of the First Division cancels a Torrens title without any proceeding in a trial court directly attacking the title as required by law. What this Court warned against in <i>Legarda and Prieto v. Saleeby</i> is now before us — a situation where "<b>all security in registered titles [is] lost</b>." Every landowner holding a Torrens title will now have to camp in the corridors of the courts, or constantly watch in the balcony of his house, just to avoid losing his titled land. The Decision of the First Division, by destroying the stability of land titles, will usher in an era of land disputes, which before the advent of the Torrens system were often violent and bloody.<br><br>The Decision of the First Division denies to the Manotoks a basic guarantee under the Constitution — that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> The Decision deprives the Manotoks of their P1.7 billion property without any trial in any court <b>contrary to the clear and express mandate of Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree</b>.

With this in mind, I respectfully submit the following opinion. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE COURT OF APPEALS MAY, IN PROPER <br>INSTANCES, ORDER THE CANCELLATION OF A <br>CERTIFICATE OF TITLE IN AN APPEAL OF THE <br>LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY'S DECISION IN <br>AN ADMINISTRATIVE RECONSTITUTION <br>PROCEEDING</span><br><br>In resolving controversies, this Court's duty is to apply or interpret the law. It cannot make or amend the law without treading the perilous waters of judicial legislation. It is not within the Court's power to enlarge or abridge laws; otherwise, the Court will be guilty of usurping the exclusive prerogative of Congress.<br><br>Jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It cannot be (1) granted by the agreement of the parties; (2) acquired, waived, enlarged or diminished by any act or omission of the parties or (3) conferred by the acquiescence of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>I submit that the First Division, in its December 12, 2005 decision, enlarged the scope of the authority of the Land Registration Authority (LRA) in administrative reconstitution proceedings when it recognized the authority of the LRA to rule that petitioners' certificate of title was a sham, spurious and not duly issued.<br><br>Section 6 of PD<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 1529<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> limits the LRA's functions to the following: <br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>General Functions</i>. –<br><br>(1) The Commissioner of Land Registration shall have the following functions:<br><br>(a) Issue decrees of registration pursuant to final judgments of the courts in land registration proceedings and cause the issuance by the Register of Deeds of the corresponding certificate of title;<br><br>(b) Exercise supervision and control over all Register of Deeds and other personnel of the Commission;<br><br>(c) Resolve cases elevated <i>en consulta</i> by, or on appeal from decision of, Register of Deeds;<br><br>(d) Exercise executive supervision over all clerks of court and personnel of the [RTCs] throughout the Philippines with respect to the discharge of their duties and functions in relation to the registration of lands;<br><br>(e) Implement all orders, decisions, and decrees promulgated relative to the registration of lands and issue, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Justice, all needful rules and regulations therefore;<br><br>(f) Verify and approve subdivision, consolidation, and consolidation-subdivision survey plans of properties titled under Act No. 496 except those covered by PD No. 957. <br><br>(2) The [LRA] shall have the following functions:<br><br>(a) Extend speedy and effective assistance to the Department of Agrarian Reform, the Land Bank, and other agencies in the implementation of the land reform program of the government;<br><br>(b) Extend assistance to courts in ordinary and cadastral land registration proceedings; and<br><br>(c) Be the central repository of records relative to original registration of lands titled under the Torrens system, including subdivision and consolidation plans of titled lands. </blockquote>Thus, under PD 1529, the LRA has no authority to rule on the authenticity and validity of a certificate of title. While Section 9<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of RA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 6732 vested the LRA with the quasi-judicial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> power to "review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm any decision of the reconstituting officer or Register of Deeds" on appeal in administrative reconstitution proceedings, the LRA nonetheless did not acquire any authority to declare a certificate of title void. Such power properly and exclusively pertains to the Regional Trial Court (RTC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the separate opinions on the December 12, 2005 decision recognized that these cases should have been tried by the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, the said opinions stated that to remand these cases for trial at this stage would only be "a time-consuming and pointless exercise." With due respect, justice should not be sacrificed for expediency. After all, more important than anything else is that this Court be right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup><br><br>Nonetheless, while the LRA cannot rule on the authenticity and validity of a certificate of title, the Court of Appeals possesses such power when presented with an appeal of the decision of the LRA in a case such as this where the validity and authenticity of a certificate of title covering a particular property is challenged in the course of and in connection with the administrative reconstitution of another certificate of title purportedly covering the same property.<br><br>In this connection, it is noteworthy that while Section 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of PD 1529 provides that a certificate of title "cannot be altered, modified, or <b>cancelled</b> except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law," it is silent as to the specific court where the petition for cancellation of a certificate of title should be instituted. In contrast, Section 108<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of PD 1529 expressly states that petitions for amendment or alteration of a certificate of title covering a particular property after original registration of that property should be filed in the then Court of First Instance, now the RTC. This difference in the treatment between cancellation of a certificate of title and the alteration or amendment/modification thereof shows the legislative intent to distinguish between these actions. Thus, <b>courts other than the RTC, such as the Court of Appeals, have the authority and jurisdiction to order the cancellation of a certificate of title which may be found to be false or fraudulent when this is necessary in the adjudication of a controversy brought before them</b>.<br><br>Specifically, the Court of Appeals is vested under Section 9(3) of BP 129 (in connection with RA 5434) with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of the LRA in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. This is reflected in Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. However, while its jurisdiction to review the judgment, decision, resolution or award of the LRA is designated under BP 129 as "appellate," the Court of Appeals actually exercises original jurisdiction (in its traditional sense) as it is the first time that the said case becomes the subject of a judicial action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This is the proper character of the authority exercised by the Court of Appeals in an appeal of the judgment, decision, resolution, order or award of the LRA in an administrative reconstitution proceeding. This also supports the view that the Court of Appeals has the power to pass upon the authenticity and validity of a certificate of title covering a particular property (and to order its cancellation) when the same is put in issue in connection with the reconstitution of another certificate of title covering the same property.<br><br>This neither runs counter to nor encroaches on the power of the RTC under Section 19(2) of BP 129, as amended, to exercise exclusive original jurisdiction "[i]n all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property or any interest therein." <b>In so canceling a certificate of title, the Court of Appeals does not resolve a civil action involving title to real property</b>. "Title" to real property is not the same as the "certificate of title"; the certificate of title is distinct from the title itself. The certificate of title may get lost, burned or destroyed and later on reconstituted but the title subsists all the while and remains unaffected unless transferred or conveyed to another or subjected to a lien or encumbrance.<br><br>Title is the "union of all the elements (as ownership, possession and custody) constituting the legal right to control and dispose of property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It is the "legal link between a person who owns property and the property itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup><br><blockquote> Though employed in various ways, title is generally used to describe either the manner in which a right to real property is acquired, or the right itself. In the first sense, it refers to the conditions necessary to acquire a valid claim to land; in the second, it refers to the legal consequences of such conditions. These two senses are not only interrelated, but inseparable: given the requisite conditions, the legal consequences or rights follow as of course; given the rights, conditions necessary for the creation of those rights must have been satisfied. Thus, when the word `title' is used in one sense, the other sense is necessarily implied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] <br></sup></blockquote>On the other hand, a Torrens certificate of title is the certificate of ownership issued under the Torrens system of registration by the government thru the Register of Deeds naming and declaring the owner in fee simple of the real property described therein, free from all liens and encumbrances except such as may be expressly noted thereon or otherwise reserved by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Legally defined, a certificate of title is the transcript of the decree of registration made by the Registrar of Deeds in the registry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Whereas title is the claim, right or interest in land, a certificate of title is the document evidencing that right. The issuance of a certificate of title does not give the owner any better title than what he actually has. He secures his certificate of title by virtue of the fact that he has a fee simple title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> To reiterate, the loss or destruction and subsequent reconstitution of a certificate of title does not affect the subsistence of the title unless it (the title) is transferred or conveyed to another or subjected to a lien or encumbrance.<br><br><b>THESE CASES SHOULD BE REMANDED TO THE <br>COURT OF APPEALS FOR CONSIDERATION OF <br>CONTENTIOUS FACTUAL ISSUES</b><br><br>Having affirmed the authority of the Court of Appeals to order the cancellation of a certificate of title in this instance, does it follow that this Court should uphold the December 12, 2005 decision of the First Division? I do not believe so.<br><br>Considering the serious and grave imputations against the respective certificates of titles of the contending parties, it would be precipitate as well as imprudent for the Court to simply adopt the findings of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP Nos. 66642 and 66700. A "surfeit of forgeries, badges of fraud and other dubious circumstances"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> is alleged to have attended respondents' administrative petition for reconstitution of their TCT No. T-210177. Similarly, significant irregularities and fatal defects<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> have been cast on petitioners' reconstituted TCT No. RT-22481. Indeed, the parties trade serious accusations of fraud and deceit. Similarly, both parties invoke Section 11 of RA 6732 in support of their respective positions: <br><blockquote> SEC. 11. A reconstituted title obtained by means of fraud, deceit or other machination is void <i>ab initio</i> as against the party obtaining the same and all persons having knowledge thereof. <br></blockquote>Any decision in favor of one party at this moment will be a declaration (express or implied) that there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the other party obtained or sought to obtain his certificate of title by means of fraud, deceit or other machination. <b>Such statement will give this Court no legal option but to order the criminal prosecution of the losing party pursuant to Section 12 of RA 6732</b>: <br><blockquote> SEC. 12. Any person who by means of fraud, deceit or other machination obtains or attempts to obtain a reconstituted title shall be subject to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, shall be liable for imprisonment for a period of not less than two years but not exceeding five years or the payment of a fine of not less than Twenty thousand pesos but not exceeding Two hundred thousand pesos or both at the discretion of the court.<br><br>Any public officer or employee who knowingly approves or assists in securing a decision allowing reconstitution in favor of any person not entitled thereto shall be subject to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, shall be liable for imprisonment of not less than five years but not exceeding ten years or payment of a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos but not exceeding One hundred thousand pesos or both at the discretion of the court and perpetual disqualification from holding public office. <br></blockquote>Since any declaration of fraud or deceit on the part of one party will expose that party to criminal prosecution, this Court should refrain from making any such declaration until and unless the complicated and contentious maze of factual matters is clearly resolved. While these matters have been brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R. SP Nos. 66642 and 66700, the Court of Appeals at that time was not able to exhaustively evaluate and analyze them.<br><br>The controversial factual matters were, however, brought to light extensively and in great detail during the oral arguments of these cases as well as in the respective memoranda submitted by the parties and by Office of the Solicitor General after the oral arguments.<br><br>To reiterate, what is crucial and critical in these cases is the complete determination of contentious factual issues.<br><br>However, the investigation and appreciation of facts is beyond the province of this Court as it is neither a trier of fact nor capacitated to appreciate evidence at the first instance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On the other hand, the Court of Appeals has the competence to perform that task. Indeed, we stated in <i>Manotok Realty, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corporation</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24] </sup><br><blockquote> Under Section 6 of Rule 46, which is applicable to original cases for certiorari, the Court may, whenever necessary to resolve factual issues, delegate the reception of the evidence on such issues to any of its members or to an appropriate court, agency or office. The delegate need not be the body that rendered the assailed decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals generally has the authority to review findings of fact. Its conclusions as to findings of fact are generally accorded great respect by this Court. It is a body that is fully capacitated and has a surfeit of experience in appreciating factual matters, including documentary evidence.</blockquote>There are indeed many factual questions looming over the respective certificates of title of the contending parties. These can only be threshed out in a remand to the Court of Appeals. Hence, I respectfully submit that the proper and prudent course now is for the Court to constitute a special division of the Court of Appeals to be composed of three associate justices to be designated by us for the purpose of hearing these cases on remand. The special division will hear and receive evidence, conclude the proceedings and submit to this Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within three months from finality of the Court's resolution in this case.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote that these cases be <b>REMANDED</b> to a special division of the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Concurring and dissenting opinion of Justice Renato C.

However, this allegation was belied upon presentation of a photocopy of the tracing cloth plan of Fls-3168-D duly certified by Teofilo R. Laguardia, Chief of the Technical Records and Statistics Section of the LMB-NCR.<br><br>Dalire next claimed that plan Fls-3168-D was not included in their computer list of plans available for decentralization. However, this claim was categorically debunked by the LRA, thus:<br><blockquote> The claim of Engr.

However, as noted by the LRA, after the fire that burned the records of the Quezon City Register of Deeds on June 11, 1988, the receipts for realty taxes of the property covered by petitioners' title already indicated the location of the property as Barrio Matandang Balara.  However, no basis or explanation, whether in the form of official documents or otherwise, was shown or presented by the petitioners before the LRA, the Court of Appeals and this Court, why the location of the property supposedly covered by their title was transferred from Barrio Payong and Barrio Culiat to Barrio Matandang Balara.

Since petitioners presented the said documentary evidence to prove their ownership of the property and the source of their title, they have thereby judicially admitted that the location of the property covered by their title, as  shown in said exhibits, is Payong, Culiat, or Barrio Payong, or simply Barrio Culiat, Quezon City.  They are, therefore, bound by said admissions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> especially since they have neither alleged nor proven that said admissions were made through palpable mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>It is also important to note that, except for Tax Declarations and realty tax payments that were issued after the fire that gutted the records of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City, petitioners did not present any credible evidence showing that the property they are occupying and covered by their reconstituted TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) is located in Barrio Matandang Balara.<br><br>Consequently, since the property covered by petitioners' reconstituted title is not the property in Matandang Balara that they are occupying as clearly shown by their own documentary evidence, it necessarily follows that they are not the owners of such property.

Thus:<br><blockquote> Documents proving ownership such as transfer and original certificates of title are the legs on which petitioners' case stands.

Having also affirmed the LRA finding that respondents' title, TCT No. 210177, is genuine, valid and existing, the Court of Appeals likewise had the authority to order its reconstitution since this was the final step in the administrative reconstitution process.<br><br>It must be noted that Section 48 of Presidential Decree (P.D.)

Thus, under Section 48, courts <b><u>other</u></b> than the Regional Trial Court, such as the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, are possessed with authority and jurisdiction to order the cancellation of a Torrens title which they confirmed to be spurious, as in this case, when this is necessary in the disposition of a case elevated before them on appeal.<br><br>Moreover, there has been a change in the traditional concept of "original jurisdiction" on account of Rule 43, Rules of Court, where the Court of Appeals has the power to take judicial cognizance of a case for the first time through its review powers.

Furthermore, the technical description of respondents' title shows that it covers two lots while petitioners' title covers only one lot.<br><br>The claim that the LRA has no authority to pass upon the genuineness of a certificate of title in an administrative reconstitution proceeding is an absurdity.  Will the LRA just accept any title and order its reconstitution although it is facially void?  Such an absurd interpretation would necessarily result in the reconstitution of a patently fake and spurious title and the consequent proliferation of fake titles, a situation that the legislature could not have contemplated when it enacted R.A. No. 6732 authorizing the administrative reconstitution of titles.<br><br>It is, therefore, misleading and baseless for petitioners to assert that their previously reconstituted title, TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) covers the same property as that identified and described in respondents' TCT No. 210177 so as to deprive the LRA of jurisdiction over respondents' petition for reconstitution.<br><br>However, even assuming that both petitioners' and respondents' titles cover the same property, the LRA would still have jurisdiction over respondents' petition for reconstitution.<br><br>As petitioners themselves admit, they caused the administrative reconstitution of their TCT No. RT 22481 in 1991 under R.A.

Its existence was likewise confirmed by the LRA in its Resolution of June 24, 1998 based on the logbook of the Register of Deeds, which contains the list of titles lost during the fire that destroyed its records in 1988.<br><br>Respondents' TCT No. 210177 was, therefore, in existence at the time petitioners filed their petition for reconstitution.

We ruled in <i>Salva v.

Estoppel does not apply only as against plaintiffs who sought affirmative reliefs. It equally applies to defendants who actively participate in the proceedings, thus:<br><blockquote> Public policy dictates that this Court must strongly condemn any double-dealing by parties who are disposed to trifle with the courts by taking inconsistent positions, in utter disregard of elementary principles of right dealing and good faith.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">This applies not only to parties who are plaintiffs, complainants or others who initiated the case by actually filing the action, but also to parties who are defendants or respondents, if the latter fail to timely raise the jurisdictional issue and instead actively participate in the proceedings.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>There is, therefore, no further need to require another proceeding for the cancellation of petitioners' reconstituted title before the LRA can proceed to reconstitute respondents' TCT No. 210177.<br><br><b><i><u>Jurisdiction of the LRA to adjudicate<br>on the validity of petitioners'<br>reconstituted TCT No. RT-22481<br>(372302) in the administrative<br>reconstitution case filed by<br>respondents.</u></i></b><br><br>In its comment dated March 30, 2007, the Office of the Solicitor General categorically declared that: <span><span></span></span><blockquote> While it is true that the Register of Deeds and the <b>Administrator of the LRA, in the exercise of their quasi-judicial powers over petitions for administrative reconstitution, have the authority to receive evidence, </b>it is limited<b> for the purpose of determining whether or not the certificates of title sought to be reconstituted are valid, authentic, genuine and in force at the time they were lost or destroyed, and to the end of either granting or denying the prayer of the petition.</b> Also, their jurisdiction to hear administrative petitions for reconstitution does not encompass any other title except that which is the subject matter of the petition. Otherwise, they exceed their jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the technical expertise of the LRA with regard to reconstitution of titles is such that the Court has long directed the lower courts to strictly observe the LRA circulars on reconstitution and land registration cases.  It said: <span><span></span></span><blockquote> In recognition of these developments that have placed under a cloud the integrity of the once unassailable Torrens Title, spawned the proliferation of fake land titles and encouraged the mushrooming of land grabbers and squatters on legitimately-titled lands, Chief Justice Andres R.

Thus: <span><span></span></span><blockquote> <b>[W]hen an administrative agency or body is conferred quasi-judicial functions, all controversies relating to the subject matter pertaining to its specialization are deemed to be included within the jurisdiction of said administrative agency or body. </b><b>Split</b><b> jurisdiction is not favored</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, even assuming that petitioners are correct in claiming that the LRA had no jurisdiction to resolve the issue of validity of title in a petition for reconstitution, nonetheless, since petitioners opposed respondents' petition for reconstitution and, in fact, ventilated before the LRA the issue of validity or genuineness of their title and submitted evidence in support thereof, instead of going to the courts to enjoin the LRA proceedings on account of their possession of a purported reconstituted title over the same property covered by respondents' TCT No. 210177, petitioners are estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction.  We ruled in <i>Laxina, Sr. v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that:<br><blockquote> Petitioner is also estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. A perusal of the records shows that he participated in the proceedings by filing his counter-affidavit with supporting evidence. x x x Thus, it has been held that participation in the administrative proceedings without raising any objection thereto bars the parties from raising any jurisdictional infirmity after an adverse decision is rendered against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45] </sup><span><span></span></span></blockquote>Again, even assuming that the Regional Trial Court should have had a first chance at resolving the issue of validity of the title, nonetheless, under the circumstances, this Court, upon elevation of the issue before it, had the unquestionable jurisdiction to declare petitioners' reconstituted title void and order its cancellation, under the same rationale relied upon by this Court in <i>Board of Commissioners (CID) v. Dela Rosa</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote> Ordinarily, the case would then be remanded to the Regional Trial Court. But not in the case at bar. <b>Considering the voluminous pleadings submitted by the parties and the evidence presented, We deem it proper to decide the controversy right at this instance.</b> And this course of action is not without precedent for "it is a cherished rule of procedure for this Court to always strive to settle the entire controversy in a single proceeding leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation. <b>No useful purpose will be served if this case is remanded to the trial court only to have its decision raised again to the Court of Appeals and from there to this Court</b> x x x.<br></blockquote>The ruling in <i>Islamic Directorate of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is likewise applicable, to wit:<br><blockquote>The resolution of the question as to whether or not the SEC had jurisdiction to declare the subject sale null and void is rendered moot and academic by the <b>inherent nullity</b> of the highly dubious sale due to lack of consent of the IDP, owner of the subject property. <b>No end of substantial justice will be served if we reverse the SEC's conclusion on the matter, and remand the case to the regular courts for further litigation over an issue which is already determinable based on what we have in the records.</b></blockquote>Beyond all that, however, is the unalterable fact that this Court's First Division had already resolved in its Decision of December 12, 2005, the jurisdictional issues raised by petitioners.<br><br><b><i><u>Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals<br>or the LRA to decide the ownership<br>of the disputed property in the<br>administrative reconstitution of title<br>filed by respondents.</u></i></b><br><br>Petitioners raised the issue of ownership before the LRA when they presented evidence in the form of a Deed of Sale, five (5) Unilateral Deeds of Conveyance, tax declarations, and realty tax receipts to prove their ownership of the property allegedly covered by their reconstituted TCT RT No. 22481.  Petitioners supported their claim of genuineness of their reconstituted title with documentary evidence showing their supposed acquisition of ownership of the land.<br><br>However, the LRA gave no credence to the evidence of ownership submitted by the petitioners, mainly because the property described therein appears to be located in a barrio different and far from the barrio where the property in dispute is actually located.<br><br>In their appeal to the Court of Appeals, petitioners again adverted to the same documentary evidence they presented before the LRA in support of their claim of ownership of the property covered by their TCT No. RT 22481 and to buttress their contention that their title is genuine and authentic.<br><br>However, the Court of Appeals affirmed in <i>toto</i> the Resolution of the LRA which found their reconstituted title a sham and spurious and respondents' title, genuine, authentic and existing.  In addition, the Court of Appeals also ordered the cancellation of petitioners' TCT No. RT22481 and the reconstitution of respondents' TCT No. 210177.<br><br>In short, since petitioners themselves laid before the LRA and the Court of Appeals all their evidence to prove the genuineness of their reconstituted title and their ownership of the property in dispute, the Court of Appeals had the corresponding authority and jurisdiction to pass upon these issues.<br><br>In <i>Yusingco v. Ong Hing Lian</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court ruled, thus:<br><blockquote> Therefore, it appearing from the records that in the previous petition for reconstitution of certificates of title, the parties acquiesced in submitting the issue of ownership for determination in the said petition, that they were given the full opportunity to present their respective sides of the issues and evidence in support thereof, and that the evidence presented was sufficient and adequate for rendering a proper decision upon the issue, the adjudication of the issue of ownership was valid and binding. It being a valid judgment, <i>res judicata</i> applies.<span><span></span></span></blockquote>Indeed, petitioners are barred from thereafter impugning the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to rule on these issues.  In the leading case of <i>Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> it was stressed that:<br><blockquote> It has been held that a party can not invoke the jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question the same jurisdiction x x x.<br><br>Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or the power of the court. x x x  [I]t is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty.<br><br>x x x [W]e frown upon the "undesirable practice" of a party submitting his case for decision and then accepting the judgment, only if favorable, and attacking it for lack of jurisdiction when adverse x x x.<br></blockquote>In the light of all the foregoing, I find no compelling reason or overriding consideration to further require the referral of these cases to the Regional Trial Court or the Court of Appeals for a re-litigation of the issues already raised and resolved by the two divisions of the Court of Appeals and affirmed by the Court's First Division in its final and executory Decision dated December 12, 2005.<br><br>More importantly, the doctrine of immutability of final and executory decisions which became part of our legal system almost a century ago and reiterated time and again by this Court precludes the Court from taking this unprecedented action.<br><br>As held in <i>Anuran v. Aquino and Ortiz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> every consideration of expediency and justice is opposed to the uncontrolled exercise of discretion by the courts in opening up cases after judgments entered therein have become final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  The interest of the individual, as well as of the community, demands there should be a definite end to every litigation; and nothing could be more impolitic than to leave it to the discretion of every court to revise and review and reconsider its judgments without limit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the question of whether the Court can reopen a final and executory judgment has constitutional implications since a reopening of the final and executory December 12, 2005 Decision would violate the prevailing parties' right to due process.  As the Court said in <i>Insular Bank of Asia and America Employees' Union (IBAAEU) v. Inciong</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote> A final judgment vests in the prevailing party a right recognized and protected by law under the due process clause of the Constitution.      x x x.<br></blockquote>Thereafter, in <i>Fortich v. Corona</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court ruled against a reopening of a final and executory judgment since this is not a mere question of technicality but that of substance and merit, thus: <span><span></span></span><blockquote> It should be stressed that <b>when the March 2, 1996 OP Decision was declared final and executory, <i>vested rights were acquired by the herein petitioners </i>x x x.  Thus, we repeat, the issue here is not a question of technicality but that of substance and merit.</b> x x x<br></blockquote>Considering all the foregoing and the fact that these cases do not involve an issue of transcendental importance, such as life, liberty or the security of the state, no compelling reason exists to depart from this well-settled doctrine, nor to ignore the fundamental public policy behind it.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote that these cases be referred back to the Court's Special First Division for final disposition in accordance with its Decision of December 12, 2005.<br><br><span><span></span></span><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago and concurred in by Chief Justice Hilario G.

SP No. 66642, ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 and directing the Land Registration Authority to reconstitute respondents' TCT No. 210177; and in <i>G.R.

SP No. 66700 directing the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481, and the Land Registration Authority to reconstitute respondents' TCT No. T-210177 and the March 12, 2004 Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration, are AFFIRMED[,]<br></blockquote>had become <b>FINAL AND EXECUTORY.</b>  The two Motions for Reconsideration of the petitioners were both denied in Resolutions dated 19 April 2006 and 19 June 2006. The Entry of Judgment was already made on 2 May 2006.<br><br>Nothing is more settled in law than that when a final judgment is executory, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable.  The judgment may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest Court of the land.  The doctrine is founded on considerations of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments must become final at some definite point in time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Litigation must at some time be terminated, even at the risk of occasional errors.  Public policy dictates that once a judgment becomes final, executory and unappealable, the prevailing party should not be denied the fruits of his victory by some subterfuge devised by the losing party.  Unjustified delay in the enforcement of a judgment sets at naught the role of courts in disposing justiciable controversies with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Apparent from the foregoing are the two-fold purposes for the doctrine of the immutability and inalterability of a final judgment: <i>first</i>, to avoid delay in the administration of justice and thus, procedurally, to make orderly the discharge of judicial business; and, <i>second</i>, to put an end to judicial controversies, at the risk of occasional errors, which is precisely why courts exist.  Obviously, the first purpose is in line with the <i>dictum</i> that justice delayed is justice denied. But said <i>dictum</i> presupposes that the court properly appreciates the facts and the applicable law to arrive at a judicious decision.  The end should always be the meting out of justice.  As to the second purpose, controversies cannot drag on indefinitely. The rights and obligations of every litigant must not hang in suspense for an indefinite period of time.  It must be adjudicated properly and seasonably to better serve the ends of justice and to place everything in proper perspective. In the process, the possibility that errors may be committed in the rendition of a decision cannot be discounted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The only recognized exceptions to the foregoing doctrine are the corrections of clerical errors or the making of the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries, which cause no prejudice to any party, and, where the judgment is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Void judgments may be classified into two groups: those rendered by a court without jurisdiction to do so and those obtained by fraud or collusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Petitioners assert, and the majority opinion effectively sustains, that the Decision dated 12 December 2005 of the First Division of this Court, affirming the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the LRA rendered without jurisdiction, may be set aside for belonging to the first group of void judgments.  I cannot subscribe to such a view.<br><br>It is argued that the Land Registration Authority (LRA) has no jurisdiction to reconstitute administratively the respondents' title because such reconstitution supposedly constitutes an indirect or collateral attack on the petitioners' pre-existing Torrens title over the same property.<br><br>It is worthy to note that the LRA itself, despite finding clear and convincing evidence that respondents' title was valid, genuine, authentic, and effective, while concluding that petitioners' title was fraudulently reconstituted, held back from actually canceling the petitioners' title. According to the dispositive portion of the LRA Decision –<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 in the name of [herein respondents' predecessor] Homer L. Barque, Sr. shall be given due course after cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of [herein petitioners] Manotoks upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<br></blockquote>From the said LRA Decision, the parties filed separate appeals with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Respondents' petition for review was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, which the Special Division of Five of the Former Second Division of the Court of Appeals, in its Amended Decision, dated 7 November 2003, resolved as follows –<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, our decision dated 13 September 2002 is hereby reconsidered.  Accordingly, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is hereby directed to cancel TCT No. RT-22481 of [herein petitioners] and the LRA is hereby directed to reconstitute forthwith [herein respondents'] valid, genuine and existing Certificate of Title No. T-210177.<br></blockquote>Petitioners' petition for review, on the other hand, was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, disposed by the Third Division of the Court of Appeals in its Amended Decision, dated 24 February 2004, in the following manner –<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED.  The Decision of this Court dated 29 October 2003 is RECONSIDERED and a new one entered ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel [herein petitioners'] TCT No. RT-22481 and directing the LRA to reconstitute forthwith [herein respondents'] TCT No. T-210177.<br></blockquote>It was not the LRA which ordered the cancellation of petitioners' title but the two Divisions of the Court of Appeals which separately decided CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and CA-G.R. SP No. 66642.  Petitioners contend, however, that even the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to order the cancellation of their title.  They maintain that their title can only be attacked in a direct action before the Regional Trial Court (RTC).  The Decision, dated 12 December 2005, of the First Division of the Court already addressed the said arguments, thus – <span><span></span></span><blockquote> Indeed, it would be needlessly circuitous to remand the case to the RTC to determine anew which of the two titles is sham or spurious and thereafter appeal the trial court's ruling to the Court of Appeals.  After all, the LRA and the two divisions of the appellate court have already declared that petitioners' title is forged. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>No useful purpose will be served if a case or the determination of an issue in a case is remanded to the trial court only to have its decision raised again to the Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court.  The remand of the case or of an issue to the lower court for further reception of evidence is not necessary where the Court is in a position to resolve the dispute based on the records before it and particularly where the ends of justice would not be subserved by the remand thereof.<br></blockquote>While the Court, when it finds that a lower court or quasi-judicial body is in error, may simply and conveniently nullify the challenged decision, resolution or order and remand the case thereto for further appropriate action, it is well within the conscientious exercise of its broad review powers to refrain from doing so and instead choose to render judgment on the merits when all material facts have been duly laid before it as would buttress its ultimate conclusion, in the public interest and for the expeditious administration of justice, such as where the ends of justice would not be subserved by the remand of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Such a course of action is not without precedent for "it is a cherished rule of procedure for this Court to always strive to settle the entire controversy in a single proceeding leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation.  No useful purpose will be served if this case is remanded to the trial court only to have its decision raised again to the Court of Appeals and from there to this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  Sound practice seeks to accommodate the theory which avoids waste of time, effort and expense, both to the parties and the government, not to speak of delay in the disposal of the case.  A marked characteristic of the judicial set-up in this country is that where the dictates of justice so demand, the Supreme Court should act, and act with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The decisions of the LRA, the two Divisions of the Court of Appeals, as well as the First Division of the Court, consistently finding that it is respondents' title to the land which is authentic and genuine, and that of the petitioners is false and fraudulent, are sufficiently supported by the evidence on record.  Petitioners' evidence to prove their title to the land was already considered and weighed by the LRA and the courts as against the respondents' evidence.  There is no showing that petitioners had any other significant evidence that they can only present before the RTC in another proceeding directly attacking their title.  Thus, although the proceedings canceling petitioners' title to the land did not follow the ordinary course, which should have been initiated with the RTC, the Court of Appeals and the First Division of the Court had all the material facts before them and evidence on record to already render judgment on the merits in the instant cases.<br><br>Moreover, when petitioners opposed respondents' petition for reconstitution of title, on the basis of their prior existing title to the same piece of land, petitioners submitted their title to the scrutiny of the LRA.  The LRA could not dismiss respondents' petition for reconstitution of title on the mere presentation by petitioners of their supposed title.  It was still incumbent upon the LRA to determine the existence, genuineness and authenticity of petitioners' title, so as to preclude the reconstitution of respondents' title over the same piece of land.  To make such a determination, the LRA had to examine and weigh the evidence of both the respondents and the petitioners in support of their own respective titles; and as a result thereof, the LRA came to the conclusion that petitioners' title was fraudulently reconstituted.<br><br>Given the foregoing, it cannot be simply said that the issuance by the LRA of reconstituted titles is a purely executive function.  Before the LRA can issue a decision, either granting or denying petitions for reconstitution of title, it must consider and weigh the arguments and evidence presented by those seeking and those opposing the reconstitution; irrefragably, a quasi-judicial function.  An act by an executive agency or officer becomes quasi-judicial in nature when the parties involved are given the opportunity to be heard and to produce evidence, and such evidence is weighed before a decision is rendered thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  The fact that the LRA is a quasi-judicial agency exercising quasi-judicial function becomes incontestable especially considering that its decisions are among those explicitly identified in the Supreme Court Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 as appealable to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Again, it must be stressed that, despite its finding that petitioners' title was fraudulent, the LRA left the cancellation of their title to a court of competent jurisdiction.  While under ordinary circumstances, such a court of competent jurisdiction would have been the RTC, the First Division of the Court properly found, in accordance with public policy and the dictates of justice, that the instant cases need no longer be remanded to the RTC for further proceedings. The two Divisions of the Court of Appeals, in promulgating their respective Amended Decisions, already had all the material facts and evidence before it to render judgment on the validity of petitioners' title.  Hence, the Decision, dated 12 December 2005, of the First Division of the Court, declining to remand the instant cases to the RTC and affirming the Amended Decisions of the Court of Appeals therein, is a valid decision which could and had, in fact, attained finality.<br><br>It is time that the Court finally put an end to the controversies between petitioners and respondents in these cases, and thwart further attempts by any party to still prolong the same.  Unfortunately, the Resolution of the majority opinion has the contrary effect.  It not only protracts the litigation, but also complicates the same by giving undue consideration to the evidence and points raised by Felicitas and Resendo Manahan (Manahans) in their much delayed petition-in-intervention.<br><br>When the Court <i>en banc</i> reopened the present cases, it expressly delineated the four issues to be resolved and upon which the parties were to be heard in the oral arguments. These issues were: <span><span></span></span><blockquote><ol><li>Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 without a trial before the proper Regional Trial Court in the proceeding directly assailing the validity of petitioners' title?<br><br></li><li>Does the Land Registration Authority [LRA] have jurisdiction to administratively reconstitute the allegedly lost TCT No. 210177 in the name of respondents despite the previously reconstituted TCT No. RT-22481 of the petitioners over the same property?<br><br></li><li>Does the LRA have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the validity of petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 in the administrative reconstitution case filed by respondents with the LRA?<br><br></li><li>Does the Court of Appeals or the LRA have jurisdiction to decide the ownership of the disputed property in the administrative reconstitution of title filed by respondents?<br></li></ol></blockquote>Even just a cursory reading of the foregoing issues would readily reveal that these are mainly legal and jurisdictional issues. The parties, namely, the petitioners and the respondents, have the right to rely on the adherence by the Court <i>en banc</i> to the said issues in its determination of whether or not to still subject the said parties to more litigation proceedings.  For the Court <i>en banc</i> to consider and rule upon issues which are outside of the four afore-stated and on which the parties were heard during the oral arguments is a denial of due process.<br><br>The matter of whether or not the factual issues in the instant cases should again be relitigated cannot be anchored on the factual allegations of the parties, moreso, when such allegations were made by the Manahans.  The Manahans were not even allowed to intervene in the oral arguments nor submit issues for the oral arguments.  Thus, the majority opinion palpably erred in remanding the cases to the Court of Appeals for further reception of evidence on the basis of the assertions of the Manahans, which contradict the claims of both the petitioners and the respondents, the original parties in the cases at bar.  The courts are bound to look no further than the record and cannot even consider contrary evidence to determine where the preponderance thereof lies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> These cases must be resolved upon the evidence submitted to the LRA, since a judicial review of executive decisions does not import a trial <i>de novo</i>, but only an ascertainment of whether the executive findings are not in violation of the Constitution or of the laws, and are free from fraud or imposition, and whether they find reasonable support in the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>   Further proceedings before the Court of Appeals following the remand of the instant cases thereto, would undoubtedly be tantamount to a new trial and investigation.<br><br>Wherefore, I vote to <b>DENY</b> all motions and prayers of the petitioners for the setting aside of the Decision dated 12 December 2005 of the First Division of this Court and the remand of the present cases to the Court of Appeals for the reception of further evidence, in my firm belief that the said Decision must stand and be honored for already being final and executory. I also vote to <b>GRANT</b> the motions for execution and possession filed by the respondents pursuant to the same Decision.<br><br><span><span></span></span><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Mayon Estate Corporation v.
