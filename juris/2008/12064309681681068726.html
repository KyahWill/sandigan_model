				<BR><BR><div align="justify">After we promulgated our decision in this case on March 7, 2007, Chevron Philippines Inc. (Chevron), Petron Corporation (Petron) and Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (Shell) (collectively, the oil companies) and the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Energy (DOE), filed their respective motions for leave to intervene and for reconsideration of the decision.<br><br>Chevron<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is engaged in the business of importing, distributing and marketing of petroleum products in the Philippines while Shell and Petron are engaged in the business of manufacturing, refining and likewise importing, distributing and marketing of petroleum products in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The DOE is a governmental agency created under Republic Act (RA) No. 7638<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and tasked to prepare, integrate, coordinate, supervise and control all plans, programs, projects and activities of the government relative to energy exploration, development, utilization, distribution and conservation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The facts are restated briefly as follows:<br><br>Petitioners Social Justice Society, Vladimir Alarique T. Cabigao and Bonifacio S. Tumbokon, in an original petition for <i>mandamus</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, sought to compel respondent Hon. Jose L. Atienza, Jr., then mayor of the City of Manila, to enforce Ordinance No. 8027. This ordinance was enacted by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of Manila on November 20, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> approved by respondent Mayor on November 28, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and became effective on December 28, 2001 after publication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Sections 1 and 3 thereof state:<br><blockquote> SECTION 1. For the purpose of promoting sound urban planning and ensuring health, public safety, and general welfare of the residents of Pandacan and Sta. Ana as well as its adjoining areas, the land use of [those] portions of land bounded by the Pasig River in the north, PNR Railroad Track in the east, Beata St. in the south, Palumpong St. in the southwest, and Estero de Pandacan in the west[,] PNR Railroad in the northwest area, Estero de Pandacan in the [n]ortheast, Pasig River in the southeast and Dr. M.L. Carreon in the southwest. The area of Punta, Sta. Ana bounded by the Pasig River, Marcelino Obrero St., Mayo 28 St., and F. Manalo Street, are hereby reclassified from Industrial II to Commercial I.<br><center>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br>SEC. 3. Owners or operators of industries and other businesses, the operation of which are no longer permitted under Section 1 hereof, are hereby given a period of six (6) months from the date of effectivity of this Ordinance within which to cease and desist from the operation of businesses which are hereby in consequence, disallowed.<br></blockquote>Ordinance No. 8027 reclassified the area described therein from industrial to commercial and directed the owners and operators of businesses disallowed under the reclassification to cease and desist from operating their businesses within six months from the date of effectivity of the ordinance. Among the businesses situated in the area are the so-called “Pandacan Terminals” of the oil companies.<br><br>On June 26, 2002, the City of Manila and the Department of Energy (DOE) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the oil companies. They agreed that “the scaling down of the Pandacan Terminals [was] the most viable and practicable option.” The <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> ratified the MOU in Resolution No. 97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the same resolution, the <i>Sanggunian</i> declared that the MOU was effective only for a period of six months starting July 25, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereafter, on January 30, 2003, the <i>Sanggunian</i> adopted Resolution No. 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> extending the validity of Resolution No. 97 to April 30, 2003 and authorizing the mayor of Manila to issue special business permits to the oil companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>This was the factual backdrop presented to the Court which became the basis of our March 7, 2007 decision. We ruled that respondent had the ministerial duty under the Local Government Code (LGC) to “enforce all laws and ordinances relative to the governance of the city,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> including Ordinance No. 8027. We also held that we need not resolve the issue of whether the MOU entered into by respondent with the oil companies and the subsequent resolutions passed by the <i>Sanggunian</i> could amend or repeal Ordinance No. 8027 since the resolutions which ratified the MOU and made it binding on the City of Manila expressly gave it full force and effect only until April 30, 2003. We concluded that there was nothing that legally hindered respondent from enforcing Ordinance No. 8027.<br><br>After we rendered our decision on March 7, 2007, the oil companies and DOE sought to intervene and filed motions for reconsideration in intervention on March 12, 2007 and March 21, 2007 respectively. On April 11, 2007, we conducted the oral arguments in Baguio City to hear petitioners, respondent and movants-intervenors oil companies and DOE.<br><br>The oil companies called our attention to the fact that on April 25, 2003, Chevron had filed a complaint against respondent and the City of Manila in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 39, for the annulment of Ordinance No. 8027 with application for writs of preliminary prohibitory injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The case was docketed as civil case no. 03-106377. On the same day, Shell filed a petition for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> likewise assailing the validity of Ordinance No. 8027 and with application for writs of preliminary prohibitory injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This was docketed as civil case no. 03-106380. Later on, these two cases were consolidated and the RTC of Manila, Branch 39 issued an order dated May 19, 2003 granting the applications for writs of preliminary prohibitory injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, upon the filing of a total bond of TWO MILLION (Php 2,000,000.00) PESOS, let a Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction be issued ordering [respondent] and the City of Manila, their officers, agents, representatives, successors, and any other persons assisting or acting in their behalf, during the pendency of the case, to REFRAIN from taking steps to enforce Ordinance No. 8027, and let a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction be issued ordering [respondent] to issue [Chevron and Shell] the necessary Business Permits to operate at the Pandacan Terminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Petron likewise filed its own petition in the RTC of Manila, Branch 42, also attacking the validity of Ordinance No. 8027 with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order (TRO). This was docketed as civil case no. 03-106379. In an order dated August 4, 2004, the RTC enjoined the parties to maintain the status quo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, in 2006, the city council of Manila enacted Ordinance No. 8119, also known as the Manila Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance of 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This was approved by respondent on June 16, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved anew, Chevron and Shell filed a complaint in the RTC of Manila, Branch 20, asking for the nullification of Ordinance No. 8119.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This was docketed as civil case no. 06-115334. Petron filed its own complaint on the same causes of action in the RTC of Manila, Branch 41.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This was docketed as civil case no. 07-116700.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The court issued a TRO in favor of Petron, enjoining the City of Manila and respondent from enforcing Ordinance No. 8119.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, in civil case no. 03-106379, the parties filed a joint motion to withdraw complaint and counterclaim on February 20, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In an order dated April 23, 2007, the joint motion was granted and all the claims and counterclaims of the parties were withdrawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Given these additional pieces of information, the following were submitted as issues for our resolution:<br><blockquote> <ol><li>whether movants-intervenors should be allowed to intervene in this case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br></li><li>whether the following are impediments to the execution of our March 7, 2007 decision:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Ordinance No. 8119, the enactment and existence of which were not previously brought by the parties to the attention of the Court and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td><div align="justify">writs of preliminary prohibitory injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction and status quo order issued by the RTC of Manila, Branches 39 and 42 and</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></li><li>whether the implementation of Ordinance No. 8027 will unduly encroach upon the DOE’s powers and functions involving energy resources.</li></ol></blockquote>During the oral arguments, the parties submitted to this Court’s power to rule on the constitutionality and validity of Ordinance No. 8027 despite the pendency of consolidated cases involving this issue in the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The importance of settling this controversy as fully and as expeditiously as possible was emphasized, considering its impact on public interest. Thus, we will also dispose of this issue here. The parties were after all given ample opportunity to present and argue their respective positions. By so doing, we will do away with the delays concomitant with litigation and completely adjudicate an issue which will most likely reach us anyway as the final arbiter of all legal disputes.<br><br>Before we resolve these issues, a brief review of the history of the Pandacan Terminals is called for to put our discussion in the proper context.<br><br><b>HISTORY OF THE PANDACAN OIL TERMINALS</b><br><br>Pandacan (one of the districts of the City of Manila) is situated along the banks of the Pasig river. At the turn of the twentieth century, Pandacan was unofficially designated as the industrial center of Manila. The area, then largely uninhabited, was ideal for various emerging industries as the nearby river facilitated the transportation of goods and products. In the 1920s, it was classified as an industrial zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Among its early industrial settlers were the oil companies. Shell established its installation there on January 30, 1914.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Caltex (now Chevron) followed suit in 1917 when the company began marketing its products in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In 1922, it built a warehouse depot which was later converted into a key distribution terminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The corporate presence in the Philippines of Esso (Petron’s predecessor) became more keenly felt when it won a concession to build and operate a refinery in Bataan in 1957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It then went on to operate a state-of-the-art lube oil blending plant in the Pandacan Terminals where it manufactures lubes and greases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On December 8, 1941, the Second World War reached the shores of the Philippine Islands. Although Manila was declared an open city, the Americans had no interest in welcoming the Japanese. In fact, in their zealous attempt to fend off the Japanese Imperial Army, the United States Army took control of the Pandacan Terminals and hastily made plans to destroy the storage facilities to deprive the advancing Japanese Army of a valuable logistics weapon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The U.S. Army burned unused petroleum, causing a frightening conflagration. Historian Nick Joaquin recounted the events as follows:<br><blockquote> After the USAFFE evacuated the City late in December 1941, all army fuel storage dumps were set on fire. The flames spread, enveloping the City in smoke, setting even the rivers ablaze, endangering bridges and all riverside buildings. … For one week longer, the “open city” blazed—a cloud of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>The fire consequently destroyed the Pandacan Terminals and rendered its network of depots and service stations inoperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>After the war, the oil depots were reconstructed. Pandacan changed as Manila rebuilt itself. The three major oil companies resumed the operation of their depots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> But the district was no longer a sparsely populated industrial zone; it had evolved into a bustling, hodgepodge community. Today, Pandacan has become a densely populated area inhabited by about 84,000 people, majority of whom are urban poor who call it home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Aside from numerous industrial installations, there are also small businesses, churches, restaurants, schools, daycare centers and residences situated there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Malacañang Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines and the seat of governmental power, is just two kilometers away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> There is a private school near the Petron depot. Along the walls of the Shell facility are shanties of informal settlers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> More than 15,000 students are enrolled in elementary and high schools situated near these facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> A university with a student population of about 25,000 is located directly across the depot on the banks of the Pasig river.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The 36-hectare Pandacan Terminals house the oil companies’ distribution terminals and depot facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The refineries of Chevron and Shell in Tabangao and Bauan, both in Batangas, respectively, are connected to the Pandacan Terminals through a 114-kilometer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> underground pipeline system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Petron’s refinery in Limay, Bataan, on the other hand, also services the depot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The terminals store fuel and other petroleum products and supply 95% of the fuel requirements of Metro Manila,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> 50% of Luzon’s consumption and 35% nationwide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Fuel can also be transported through barges along the Pasig river or tank trucks via the South Luzon Expressway.<br><br>We now discuss the first issue: whether movants-intervenors should be allowed to intervene in this case.<br><br><b>INTERVENTION OF THE OIL COMPANIES AND THE DOE SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE</b><br><br>Intervention is a remedy by which a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant therein to enable him, her or it to protect or preserve a right or interest which may be affected by such proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The pertinent rules are Sections 1 and 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote> SEC. 1. Who may intervene. — A person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action. The court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor’s rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding.<br><br>SEC. 2. Time to intervene. — The motion to intervene may be filed at any time before rendition of judgment by the trial court. A copy of the pleading-in-intervention shall be attached to the motion and served on the original parties.<br></blockquote>Thus, the following are the requisites for intervention of a non-party:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(1)</td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Legal interest</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">in the matter in controversy; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">in the success of either of the parties; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I against both parties; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">person is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of rights of original parties;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3) </td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Intervenor’s rights may not be fully protected in a separate proceeding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(4)</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">The motion to intervene may be filed at any time before rendition of judgment by the trial court.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>For both the oil companies and DOE, the last requirement is definitely absent. As a rule, intervention is allowed “before rendition of judgment” as Section 2, Rule 19 expressly provides. Both filed their separate motions after our decision was promulgated. In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Gingoyon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> a recently decided case which was also an original action filed in this Court, we declared that the appropriate time to file the motions-in-intervention was before and not after resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The Court, however, has recognized exceptions to Section 2, Rule 19 in the interest of substantial justice:<br><blockquote> The rule on intervention, like all other rules of procedure, is intended to make the powers of the Court fully and completely available for justice. It is aimed to facilitate a comprehensive adjudication of rival claims overriding technicalities on the timeliness of the filing thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>The oil companies assert that they have a legal interest in this case because the implementation of Ordinance No. 8027 will directly affect their business and property rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote> [T]he interest which entitles a person to intervene in a suit between other parties must be in the matter in litigation and of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by direct legal operation and effect of the judgment. Otherwise, if persons not parties to the action were allowed to intervene, proceedings would become unnecessarily complicated, expensive and interminable. And this would be against the policy of the law. The words “an interest in the subject” means a direct interest in the cause of action as pleaded, one that would put the intervenor in a legal position to litigate a fact alleged in the complaint without the establishment of which plaintiff could not recover.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>We agree that the oil companies have a direct and immediate interest in the implementation of Ordinance No. 8027. Their claim is that they will need to spend billions of pesos if they are compelled to relocate their oil depots out of Manila. Considering that they admitted knowing about this case from the time of its filing on December 4, 2002, they should have intervened long before our March 7, 2007 decision to protect their interests. But they did not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Neither did they offer any worthy explanation to justify their late intervention.<br><br>Be that as it may, although their motion for intervention was not filed on time, we will allow it because they raised and presented novel issues and arguments that were not considered by the Court in its March 7, 2007 decision. After all, the allowance or disallowance of a motion to intervene is addressed to the sound discretion of the court before which the case is pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Considering the compelling reasons favoring intervention, we do not think that this will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of rights of the original parties. In fact, it will be expedited since their intervention will enable us to rule on the constitutionality of Ordinance No. 8027 instead of waiting for the RTC’s decision.<br><br>The DOE, on the other hand, alleges that its interest in this case is also direct and immediate as Ordinance No. 8027 encroaches upon its exclusive and national authority over matters affecting the oil industry. It seeks to intervene in order to represent the interests of the members of the public who stand to suffer if the Pandacan Terminals’ operations are discontinued. We will tackle the issue of the alleged encroachment into DOE’s domain later on. Suffice it to say at this point that, for the purpose of hearing all sides and considering the transcendental importance of this case, we will also allow DOE’s intervention.<br><br><b>THE INJUNCTIVE WRITS ARE NOT IMPEDIMENTS TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF ORDINANCE NO. 8027</b><br><br>Under Rule 65, Section 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of the Rules of Court, a petition for <i>mandamus</i> may be filed when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station. According to the oil companies, respondent did not unlawfully fail or neglect to enforce Ordinance No. 8027 because he was lawfully prevented from doing so by virtue of the injunctive writs and status quo order issued by the RTC of Manila, Branches 39 and 42.<br><br>First, we note that while Chevron and Shell still have in their favor the writs of preliminary injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction, the status quo order in favor of Petron is no longer in effect since the court granted the joint motion of the parties to withdraw the complaint and counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Second, the original parties failed to inform the Court about these injunctive writs. Respondent (who was also impleaded as a party in the RTC cases) defends himself by saying that he informed the court of the pendency of the civil cases and that a TRO was issued by the RTC in the consolidated cases filed by Chevron and Shell. It is true that had the oil companies only intervened much earlier, the Court would not have been left in the dark about these facts. Nevertheless, respondent should have updated the Court, by way of manifestation, on such a relevant matter.<br><br>In his memorandum, respondent mentioned the issuance of a TRO. Under Section 5 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, a TRO issued by the RTC is effective only for a period of 20 days. This is why, in our March 7, 2007 decision, we presumed with certainty that this had already lapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Respondent also mentioned the grant of injunctive writs in his rejoinder which the Court, however, expunged for being a prohibited pleading. The parties and their counsels were clearly remiss in their duties to this Court.<br><br>In resolving controversies, courts can only consider facts and issues pleaded by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Courts, as well as magistrates presiding over them are not omniscient. They can only act on the facts and issues presented before them in appropriate pleadings. They may not even substitute their own personal knowledge for evidence. Nor may they take notice of matters except those expressly provided as subjects of mandatory judicial notice.<br><br>We now proceed to the issue of whether the injunctive writs are legal impediments to the enforcement of Ordinance No. 8027.<br><br>Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court enumerates the grounds for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction:<br><blockquote> SEC. 3. Grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction. â€• A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">That the commission, continuance or nonperformance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>There are two requisites for the issuance of a preliminary injunction: (1) the right to be protected exists <i>prima facie</i> and (2) the acts sought to be enjoined are violative of that right. It must be proven that the violation sought to be prevented will cause an irreparable injustice.<br><br>The act sought to be restrained here was the enforcement of Ordinance No. 8027. It is a settled rule that an ordinance enjoys the presumption of validity and, as such, cannot be restrained by injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Nevertheless, when the validity of the ordinance is assailed, the courts are not precluded from issuing an injunctive writ against its enforcement. However, we have declared that the issuance of said writ is proper only when:<br><blockquote> ... the petitioner assailing the ordinance <b>has made out a case of unconstitutionality strong enough to overcome, in the mind of the judge, the presumption of validity</b>, in addition to a showing of a clear legal right to the remedy sought....<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Judge Reynaldo G. Ros, in his order dated May 19, 2003, stated his basis for issuing the injunctive writs:<br><blockquote> The Court, in resolving whether or not a Writ of Preliminary Injunction or Preliminary Mandatory Injunction should be issued, is guided by the following requirements: (1) a clear legal right of the complainant; (2) a violation of that right; and (3) a permanent and urgent necessity for the Writ to prevent serious damage. The Court believes that these requisites are present in these cases.<br><br>There is no doubt that the plaintiff/petitioners have been legitimately operating their business in the Pandacan Terminal for many years and they have made substantial capital investment therein. Every year they were issued Business Permits by the City of Manila. Its operations have not been declared illegal or contrary to law or morals. In fact, because of its vital importance to the national economy, it was included in the Investment Priorities Plan as mandated under the “Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1988 (R.A. 8479). As a lawful business, the plaintiff/petitioners have a right, therefore, to continue their operation in the Pandacan Terminal and the right to protect their investments. This is a clear and unmistakable right of the plaintiff/petitioners.<br><br>The enactment, therefore, of City Ordinance No. 8027 passed by the City Council of Manila reclassifying the area where the Pandacan Terminal is located from Industrial II to Commercial I and requiring the plaintiff/petitioners to cease and desist from the operation of their business has certainly violated the rights of the plaintiff/petitioners to continue their legitimate business in the Pandacan Terminal and deprived them of their huge investments they put up therein. Thus, before the Court, therefore, determines whether the Ordinance in question is valid or not, a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and a Writ of Mandatory Injunction be issued to prevent serious and irreparable damage to plaintiff/petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Nowhere in the judge’s discussion can we see that, in addition to a showing of a clear legal right of Chevron and Shell to the remedy sought, he was convinced that they had made out a case of unconstitutionality or invalidity strong enough to overcome the presumption of validity of the ordinance.</b> Statutes and ordinances are presumed valid unless and until the courts declare the contrary in clear and unequivocal terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The mere fact that the ordinance is alleged to be unconstitutional or invalid will not entitle a party to have its enforcement enjoined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The presumption is all in favor of validity.

The “O-PUD” classification merely made Pandacan a “project site ... comprehensively planned as an entity via unitary site plan which permits flexibility in planning/design, building siting, complementarity of building types and land uses, usable open spaces and the preservation of significant natural land features....”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Its classification as “R-3/MXD” means that it should “be used primarily for high-rise housing/dwelling purposes and limited complementary/supplementary trade, services and business activities.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> There is no conflict since both ordinances actually have a common objective, i.e., to shift the zoning classification from industrial to commercial (Ordinance No. 8027) or mixed residential/commercial (Ordinance No. 8119).<br><br>Moreover, it is a well-settled rule in statutory construction that a subsequent general law does not repeal a prior special law on the same subject unless it clearly appears that the legislature has intended by the latter general act to modify or repeal the earlier special law. <i>Generalia specialibus non derogant</i> (a general law does not nullify a specific or special law).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> This is so even if the provisions of the general law are sufficiently comprehensive to include what was set forth in the special act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> The special act and the general law must stand together, one as the law of the particular subject and the other as the law of general application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The special law must be taken as intended to constitute an exception to, or a qualification of, the general act or provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><blockquote> The reason for this is that the legislature, in passing a law of special character, considers and makes special provisions for the particular circumstances dealt with by the special law.

Repealing Clause. – All ordinances, rules, regulations in conflict with the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby repealed; PROVIDED, That the rights that are vested upon the effectivity of this Ordinance shall not be impaired.<br></blockquote>They cited <i>Hospicio de San Jose de Barili, Cebu City v.

But with such clause contained in the subsequent general law, the prior special law will be deemed repealed, as the clause is a clear legislative intent to bring about that result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>This ruling in not applicable here. The repealing clause of Ordinance No. 8119 cannot be taken to indicate the legislative intent to repeal all prior inconsistent laws on the subject matter, including Ordinance No. 8027, a special enactment, since the aforequoted minutes (an official record of the discussions in the <i>Sanggunian</i>) actually indicated the clear intent to preserve the provisions of Ordinance No. 8027.<br><br>To summarize, the conflict between the two ordinances is more apparent than real. The two ordinances can be reconciled.

Again, we disagree. A party need not go first to the DILG in order to compel the enforcement of an ordinance.

Towards this objective, the Sanggunian reclassified the area defined in the ordinance from industrial to commercial.<br><br>The following facts were found by the Committee on Housing, Resettlement and Urban Development of the City of Manila which recommended the approval of the ordinance:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(1) </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">the depot facilities contained 313.5 million liters of highly flammable and highly volatile products which include petroleum gas, liquefied petroleum gas, aviation fuel, diesel, gasoline, kerosene and fuel oil among others;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td> <div align="justify">the depot is open to attack through land, water or air;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td> <div align="justify">it is situated in a densely populated place and near Malacañang Palace and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(4)</td> <td> <div align="justify">in case of an explosion or conflagration in the depot, the fire could spread to the neighboring communities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>The ordinance was intended to safeguard the rights to life, security and safety of all the inhabitants of Manila and not just of a particular class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> The depot is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a representation of western interests which means that it is a terrorist target. As long as it there is such a target in their midst, the residents of Manila are not safe. It therefore became necessary to remove these terminals to dissipate the threat. According to respondent:<br><br><blockquote> Such a public need became apparent after the 9/11 incident which showed that what was perceived to be impossible to happen, to the most powerful country in the world at that, is actually possible. The destruction of property and the loss of thousands of lives on that fateful day became the impetus for a public need. In the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, the threats of terrorism continued [such] that it became imperative for governments to take measures to combat their effects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Wide discretion is vested on the legislative authority to determine not only what the interests of the public require but also what measures are necessary for the protection of such interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Clearly, the <i>Sanggunian</i> was in the best position to determine the needs of its constituents.<br><br>In the exercise of police power, property rights of individuals may be subjected to restraints and burdens in order to fulfill the objectives of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Otherwise stated, the government may enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty, property, lawful businesses and occupations to promote the general welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> However, the interference must be reasonable and not arbitrary. And to forestall arbitrariness, the methods or means used to protect public health, morals, safety or welfare must have a reasonable relation to the end in view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>The means adopted by the <i>Sanggunian</i> was the enactment of a zoning ordinance which reclassified the area where the depot is situated from industrial to commercial. A zoning ordinance is defined as a local city or municipal legislation which logically arranges, prescribes, defines and apportions a given political subdivision into specific land uses as present and future projection of needs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> As a result of the zoning, the continued operation of the businesses of the oil companies in their present location will no longer be permitted. The power to establish zones for industrial, commercial and residential uses is derived from the police power itself and is exercised for the protection and benefit of the residents of a locality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Consequently, the enactment of Ordinance No. 8027 is within the power of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of the City of Manila and any resulting burden on those affected cannot be said to be unjust:<br><br>There can be no doubt that the City of Manila has the power to divide its territory into residential and industrial zones, and to prescribe that offensive and unwholesome trades and occupations are to be established exclusively in the latter zone.<br><br><blockquote> “The benefits to be derived by cities adopting such regulations (zoning) may be summarized as follows: They attract a desirable and assure a permanent citizenship; they foster pride in and attachment to the city; they promote happiness and contentment; they stabilize the use and value of property and promote the peace, [tranquility], and good order of the city. We do not hesitate to say that the attainment of these objects affords a legitimate field for the exercise of the police power. He who owns property in such a district is not deprived of its use by such regulations. He may use it for the purposes to which the section in which it is located is dedicated. That he shall not be permitted to use it to the desecration of the community constitutes no unreasonable or permanent hardship and results in no unjust burden.”<br><br><center>Xxx xxx xxx</center><br><br>“The 14th Amendment protects the citizen in his right to engage in any lawful business, but it does not prevent legislation intended to regulate useful occupations which, because of their nature or location, may prove injurious or offensive to the public.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></blockquote><br><br>We entertain no doubt that Ordinance No. 8027 is a valid police power measure because there is a concurrence of lawful subject and lawful method.<br><br><b>ORDINANCE NO. 8027 IS NOT UNFAIR, OPPRESSIVE OR CONFISCATORY WHICH AMOUNTS TO TAKING WITHOUT COMPENSATION</b><br><br>According to the oil companies, Ordinance No. 8027 is unfair and oppressive as it does not only regulate but also absolutely prohibits them from conducting operations in the City of Manila. Respondent counters that this is not accurate since the ordinance merely prohibits the oil companies from operating their businesses in the Pandacan area.<br><br>Indeed, the ordinance expressly delineated in its title and in Section 1 what it pertained to. Therefore, the oil companies’ contention is not supported by the text of the ordinance. Respondent succinctly stated that:<br><br><blockquote> The oil companies are not forbidden to do business in the City of Manila. They may still very well do so, except that their oil storage facilities are no longer allowed in the Pandacan area. Certainly, there are other places in the City of Manila where they can conduct this specific kind of business. Ordinance No. 8027 did not render the oil companies illegal. The assailed ordinance affects the oil companies business only in so far as the Pandacan area is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The oil companies are not prohibited from doing business in other appropriate zones in Manila. The City of Manila merely exercised its power to regulate the businesses and industries in the zones it established:<br><br><blockquote> As to the contention that the power to regulate does not include the power to prohibit, it will be seen that the ordinance copied above does not prohibit the installation of motor engines within the municipality of Cabanatuan but only within the zone therein fixed. If the municipal council of Cabanatuan is authorized to establish said zone, it is also authorized to provide what kind of engines may be installed therein. In banning the installation in said zone of all engines not excepted in the ordinance, the municipal council of Cabanatuan did no more than regulate their installation by means of zonification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The oil companies aver that the ordinance is unfair and oppressive because they have invested billions of pesos in the depot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Its forced closure will result in huge losses in income and tremendous costs in constructing new facilities.<br><br>Their contention has no merit. In the exercise of police power, there is a limitation on or restriction of property interests to promote public welfare which involves no compensable taking. Compensation is necessary only when the state’s power of eminent domain is exercised. In eminent domain, property is appropriated and applied to some public purpose. Property condemned under the exercise of police power, on the other hand, is noxious or intended for a noxious or forbidden purpose and, consequently, is not compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> The restriction imposed to protect lives, public health and safety from danger is not a taking. It is merely the prohibition or abatement of a noxious use which interferes with paramount rights of the public.<br><br>Property has not only an individual function, insofar as it has to provide for the needs of the owner, but also a social function insofar as it has to provide for the needs of the other members of society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> The principle is this:<br><br><blockquote> Police power proceeds from the principle that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his use of it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the right of the community. Rights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject to reasonable limitations in their enjoyment as shall prevent them from being injurious, and to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law as the legislature, under the governing and controlling power vested in them by the constitution, may think necessary and expedient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In the regulation of the use of the property, nobody else acquires the use or interest therein, hence there is no compensable taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> In this case, the properties of the oil companies and other businesses situated in the affected area remain theirs. Only their use is restricted although they can be applied to other profitable uses permitted in the commercial zone.<br><br><b>ORDINANCE NO. 8027 IS NOT PARTIAL AND DISCRIMINATORY</b><br><br>The oil companies take the position that the ordinance has discriminated against and singled out the Pandacan Terminals despite the fact that the Pandacan area is congested with buildings and residences that do not comply with the National Building Code, Fire Code and Health and Sanitation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>This issue should not detain us for long. An ordinance based on reasonable classification does not violate the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> The requirements for a valid and reasonable classification are: (1) it must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) it must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited to existing conditions only and (4) it must apply equally to all members of the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br>The law may treat and regulate one class differently from another class provided there are real and substantial differences to distinguish one class from another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> Here, there is a reasonable classification. We reiterate that what the ordinance seeks to prevent is a catastrophic devastation that will result from a terrorist attack. Unlike the depot, the surrounding community is not a high-value terrorist target. Any damage caused by fire or explosion occurring in those areas would be nothing compared to the damage caused by a fire or explosion in the depot itself. Accordingly, there is a substantial distinction. The enactment of the ordinance which provides for the cessation of the operations of these terminals removes the threat they pose. Therefore it is germane to the purpose of the ordinance. The classification is not limited to the conditions existing when the ordinance was enacted but to future conditions as well. Finally, the ordinance is applicable to all businesses and industries in the area it delineated.<br><br><b>ORDINANCE NO. 8027 IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH RA 7638 AND RA 8479</b><br><br>The oil companies and the DOE assert that Ordinance No. 8027 is unconstitutional because it contravenes RA 7638 (DOE Act of 1992)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> and RA 8479 (Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Law of 1998).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> They argue that through RA 7638, the national legislature declared it a policy of the state “to ensure a continuous, adequate, and economic supply of energy”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> and created the DOE to implement this policy. Thus, under Section 5 I, DOE is empowered to “establish and administer programs for the exploration, transportation, marketing, distribution, utilization, conservation, stockpiling, and storage of energy resources.” Considering that the petroleum products contained in the Pandacan Terminals are major and critical energy resources, they conclude that their administration, storage, distribution and transport are of national interest and fall under DOE’s primary and exclusive jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>They further assert that the terminals are necessary for the delivery of immediate and adequate supply of oil to its recipients in the most economical way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Local legislation such as Ordinance No. 8027 (which effectively calls for the removal of these terminals) allegedly frustrates the state policy of ensuring a continuous, adequate, and economic supply of energy expressed in RA 7638, a national law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Likewise, the ordinance thwarts the determination of the DOE that the terminals’ operations should be merely scaled down and not discontinued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> They insist that this should not be allowed considering that it has a nationwide economic impact and affects public interest transcending the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>According to them, the DOE’s supervision over the oil industry under RA 7638 was subsequently underscored by RA 8479, particularly in Section 7 thereof:<br><br><blockquote> SECTION 7. Promotion of Fair Trade Practices. â€• The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and DOE shall take all measures to promote fair trade and prevent cartelization, monopolies, combinations in restraint of trade, and any unfair competition in the Industry as defined in Article 186 of the Revised Penal Code, and Articles 168 and 169 of Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the “Intellectual Property Rights Law”.<b> The DOE shall continue to encourage certain practices in the Industry which serve the public interest and are intended to achieve efficiency and cost reduction, ensure continuous supply of petroleum products,</b> and enhance environmental protection. These practices may include borrow-and-loan agreements, rationalized depot and manufacturing operations, hospitality agreements, joint tanker and pipeline utilization, and joint actions on oil spill control and fire prevention. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Respondent counters that DOE’s regulatory power does not preclude LGUs from exercising their police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>Indeed, ordinances should not contravene existing statutes enacted by Congress. The rationale for this was clearly explained in <i>Magtajas vs. Pryce Properties Corp., Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br><blockquote> The rationale of the requirement that the ordinances should not contravene a statute is obvious. Municipal governments are only agents of the national government. Local councils exercise only delegated legislative powers conferred on them by Congress as the national lawmaking body. The delegate cannot be superior to the principal or exercise powers higher than those of the latter. It is a heresy to suggest that the local government units can undo the acts of Congress, from which they have derived their power in the first place, and negate by mere ordinance the mandate of the statute.<br><br>“Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. As it creates, so it may destroy. As it may destroy, it may abridge and control. Unless there is some constitutional limitation on the right, the legislature might, by a single act, and if we can suppose it capable of so great a folly and so great a wrong, sweep from existence all of the municipal corporations in the State, and the corporation could not prevent it. We know of no limitation on the right so far as to the corporation themselves are concerned. They are, so to phrase it, the mere tenants at will of the legislature.”<br><br>This basic relationship between the national legislature and the local government units has not been enfeebled by the new provisions in the Constitution strengthening the policy of local autonomy. Without meaning to detract from that policy, we here confirm that Congress retains control of the local government units although in significantly reduced degree now than under our previous Constitutions. The power to create still includes the power to destroy. The power to grant still includes the power to withhold or recall. True, there are certain notable innovations in the Constitution, like the direct conferment on the local government units of the power to tax, which cannot now be withdrawn by mere statute. By and large, however, the national legislature is still the principal of the local government units, which cannot defy its will or modify or violate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The question now is whether Ordinance No. 8027 contravenes RA 7638 and RA 8479. It does not.<br><br>Under Section 5 I of RA 7638, DOE was given the power to “establish and administer programs for the exploration, transportation, marketing, distribution, utilization, conservation, stockpiling, and storage of energy resources.” On the other hand, under Section 7 of RA 8749, the DOE “shall continue to encourage certain practices in the Industry which serve the public interest and are intended to achieve efficiency and cost reduction, ensure continuous supply of petroleum products.” Nothing in these statutes prohibits the City of Manila from enacting ordinances in the exercise of its police power.<br><br>The principle of local autonomy is enshrined in and zealously protected under the Constitution. In Article II, Section 25 thereof, the people expressly adopted the following policy:<br><br><blockquote> Section 25. The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments.</blockquote><br><br>An entire article (Article X) of the Constitution has been devoted to guaranteeing and promoting the autonomy of LGUs. The LGC was specially promulgated by Congress to ensure the autonomy of local governments as mandated by the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote> Sec. 2. Declaration of Policy. â€• (a) <b>It is hereby declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals.</b> Toward this end, the State shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the National Government to the local government units. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>We do not see how the laws relied upon by the oil companies and DOE stripped the City of Manila of its power to enact ordinances in the exercise of its police power and to reclassify the land uses within its jurisdiction. To guide us, we shall make a brief survey of our decisions where the police power measure of the LGU clashed with national laws.<br><br>In <i>Tan v. Pereña</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> the Court ruled that Ordinance No. 7 enacted by the municipality of Daanbantayan, Cebu allowing the operation of three cockpits was invalid for violating PD 449 (or the Cockfighting Law of 1974) which permitted only one cockpit per municipality.<br><br>In <i>Batangas CATV, Inc. v.

The Court held that the LGU did not have the authority to grant franchises to operate a CATV system because it was the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) that had the power under EO Nos. 205 and 436 to regulate CATV operations. EO 205 mandated the NTC to grant certificates of authority to CATV operators while EO 436 vested on the NTC the power to regulate and supervise the CATV industry.<br><br>In <i>Lina, Jr. v. Paño</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> we held that <i>Kapasiyahan Bilang 508, Taon 1995</i> of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Laguna could not be used as justification to prohibit lotto in the municipality of San Pedro, Laguna because lotto was duly authorized by RA 1169, as amended by BP 42. This law granted a franchise to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and allowed it to operate lotteries.<br><br>In <i>Magtajas v. Pryce Properties Corp., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of Cagayan de Oro City passed Ordinance Nos. 3353 and 3375-93 prohibiting the operation of casinos in the city. We ruled that these ordinances were void for contravening PD 1869 or the charter of the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corporation which had the power to operate casinos.<br><br>The common dominator of all of these cases is that the national laws were clearly and expressly in conflict with the ordinances/resolutions of the LGUs. The inconsistencies were so patent that there was no room for doubt. This is not the case here.<br><br>The laws cited merely gave DOE general powers to “establish and administer programs for the exploration, transportation, marketing, distribution, utilization, conservation, stockpiling, and storage of energy resources” and “to encourage certain practices in the [oil] industry which serve the public interest and are intended to achieve efficiency and cost reduction, ensure continuous supply of petroleum products.” These powers can be exercised without emasculating the LGUs of the powers granted them. When these ambiguous powers are pitted against the unequivocal power of the LGU to enact police power and zoning ordinances for the general welfare of its constituents, it is not difficult to rule in favor of the latter. Considering that the powers of the DOE regarding the Pandacan Terminals are not categorical, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the City of Manila:<br><blockquote> SECTION 5. Rules of Interpretation. â€• In the interpretation of the provisions of this Code, the following rules shall apply:<br><br>(a) Any provision on a power of a local government unit shall be liberally interpreted in its favor, and in case of doubt, any question thereon shall be resolved in favor of devolution of powers and of the lower local government unit. Any fair and reasonable doubt as to the existence of the power shall be interpreted in favor of the local government unit concerned;<br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; xxx</center><br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IThe general welfare provisions in this Code shall be liberally interpreted to give more powers to local government units in accelerating economic development and upgrading the quality of life for the people in the community xxxx<br></blockquote>The least we can do to ensure genuine and meaningful local autonomy is not to force an interpretation that negates powers explicitly granted to local governments. To rule against the power of LGUs to reclassify areas within their jurisdiction will subvert the principle of local autonomy guaranteed by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> As we have noted in earlier decisions, our national officials should not only comply with the constitutional provisions on local autonomy but should also appreciate the spirit and liberty upon which these provisions are based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><br><b>THE DOE CANNOT EXERCISE THE POWER OF CONTROL OVER LGUS</b><br><br>Another reason that militates against the DOE’s assertions is that Section 4 of Article X of the Constitution confines the President’s power over LGUs to one of general supervision: <blockquote> SECTION 4. The President of the Philippines shall exercise general supervision over local governments. Xxxx</blockquote> Consequently, the Chief Executive or his or her alter egos, cannot exercise the power of control over them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> Control and supervision are distinguished as follows:<br><blockquote> [Supervision] means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer ha[s] done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br></blockquote>Supervisory power, when contrasted with control, is the power of mere oversight over an inferior body; it does not include any restraining authority over such body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> It does not allow the supervisor to annul the acts of the subordinate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> Here, what the DOE seeks to do is to set aside an ordinance enacted by local officials, a power that not even its principal, the President, has. This is because:<br><blockquote> Under our present system of government, executive power is vested in the President. The members of the Cabinet and other executive officials are merely alter egos. As such, they are subject to the power of control of the President, at whose will and behest they can be removed from office; or their actions and decisions changed, suspended or reversed. In contrast, the heads of political subdivisions are elected by the people. Their sovereign powers emanate from the electorate, to whom they are directly accountable. By constitutional fiat, they are subject to the President’s supervision only, not control, so long as their acts are exercised within the sphere of their legitimate powers. By the same token, the President may not withhold or alter any authority or power given them by the Constitution and the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the President and his or her alter egos, the department heads, cannot interfere with the activities of local governments, so long as they act within the scope of their authority. Accordingly, the DOE cannot substitute its own discretion for the discretion exercised by the <i>sanggunian</i> of the City of Manila. In local affairs, the wisdom of local officials must prevail as long as they are acting within the parameters of the Constitution and the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br><b>ORDINANCE NO. 8027 IS NOT INVALID FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RA 7924 AND EO 72</b><br><br>The oil companies argue that zoning ordinances of LGUs are required to be submitted to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for review and if found to be in compliance with its metropolitan physical framework plan and regulations, it shall endorse the same to the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB).

This was only found in its implementing rules which made a reference to EO 72. EO 72 expressly refers to comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs) only. Ordinance No. 8027 is admittedly not a CLUP nor intended to be one. Instead, it is a very specific ordinance which reclassified the land use of a defined area in order to prevent the massive effects of a possible terrorist attack. It is Ordinance No. 8119 which was explicitly formulated as the “Manila [CLUP] and Zoning Ordinance of 2006.” CLUPs are the ordinances which should be submitted to the MMDA for integration in its metropolitan physical framework plan and approved by the HLURB to ensure that they conform with national guidelines and policies.<br><br>Moreover, even assuming that the MMDA review and HLURB ratification are necessary, the oil companies did not present any evidence to show that these were not complied with. In accordance with the presumption of validity in favor of an ordinance, its constitutionality or legality should be upheld in the absence of proof showing that the procedure prescribed by law was not observed. The burden of proof is on the oil companies which already had notice that this Court was inclined to dispose of all the issues in this case. Yet aside from their bare assertion, they did not present any certification from the MMDA or the HLURB nor did they append these to their pleadings. Clearly, they failed to rebut the presumption of validity of Ordinance No. 8027.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup><br><br><b>CONCLUSION</b><br><br>Essentially, the oil companies are fighting for their right to property. They allege that they stand to lose billions of pesos if forced to relocate. However, based on the hierarchy of constitutionally protected rights, the right to life enjoys precedence over the right to property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> The reason is obvious: life is irreplaceable, property is not. When the state or LGU’s exercise of police power clashes with a few individuals’ right to property, the former should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup><br><br>Both law and jurisprudence support the constitutionality and validity of Ordinance No. 8027. Without a doubt, there are no impediments to its enforcement and implementation. Any delay is unfair to the inhabitants of the City of Manila and its leaders who have categorically expressed their desire for the relocation of the terminals. Their power to chart and control their own destiny and preserve their lives and safety should not be curtailed by the intervenors’ warnings of doomsday scenarios and threats of economic disorder if the ordinance is enforced.<br><br>Secondary to the legal reasons supporting the immediate implementation of Ordinance No. 8027 are the policy considerations which drove Manila’s government to come up with such a measure:<br><blockquote> ... [The] oil companies still were not able to allay the apprehensions of the city regarding the security threat in the area in general. No specific action plan or security measures were presented that would prevent a possible large-scale terrorist or malicious attack especially an attack aimed at Malacañang. The measures that were installed were more directed towards their internal security and did not include the prevention of an external attack even on a bilateral level of cooperation between these companies and the police and military.<br><br><center>Xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; xxx</center><br><br>It is not enough for the city government to be told by these oil companies that they have the most sophisticated fire-fighting equipments and have invested millions of pesos for these equipments. The city government wants to be assured that its residents are safe at any time from these installations, and in the three public hearings and in their position papers, not one statement has been said that indeed the absolute safety of the residents from the hazards posed by these installations is assured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup><br></blockquote>We are also putting an end to the oil companies’ determination to prolong their stay in Pandacan despite the objections of Manila’s residents. As early as October 2001, the oil companies signed a MOA with the DOE obliging themselves to:<br><blockquote> ... undertake a comprehensive and comparative study ... [which] shall include the preparation of a Master Plan, whose aim is to determine the scope and timing of the feasible location of the Pandacan oil terminals and all associated facilities and infrastructure including government support essential for the relocation such as the necessary transportation infrastructure, land and right of way acquisition, resettlement of displaced residents and environmental and social acceptability which shall be based on mutual benefit of the Parties and the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup><br></blockquote>Now that they are being compelled to discontinue their operations in the Pandacan Terminals, they cannot feign unreadiness considering that they had years to prepare for this eventuality.<br><br>Just the same, this Court is not about to provoke a crisis by ordering the immediate relocation of the Pandacan Terminals out of its present site. The enforcement of a decision of this Court, specially one with far-reaching consequences, should always be within the bounds of reason, in accordance with a comprehensive and well-coordinated plan, and within a time-frame that complies with the letter and spirit of our resolution. To this end, the oil companies have no choice but to obey the law.<br><br><b>A WARNING TO PETITIONERS’ COUNSEL</b><br><br>We draw the attention of the parties to a matter of grave concern to the legal profession.<br><br>Petitioners and their counsel, Atty. Samson Alcantara, submitted a four-page memorandum that clearly contained either substance nor research. It is absolutely insulting to this Court.<br><br>We have always tended towards judicial leniency, temperance and compassion to those who suffer from a wrong perception of what the majesty of the law means. But for a member of the bar, an officer of the court, to file in this Court a memorandum of such unacceptable quality is an entirely different matter.<br><br>It is indicative less of a personal shortcoming or contempt of this Court and more of a lawyer’s sorry descent from a high sense of duty and responsibility. As a member of the bar and as an officer of the court, a lawyer ought to be keenly aware that the chief safeguard of the body politic is respect for the law and its magistrates.<br><br>There is nothing more effective than the written word by which counsel can persuade this Court of the righteousness of his cause. For if truth were self-evident, a memorandum would be completely unnecessary and superfluous.<br><br>The inability of counsel to prepare a memorandum worthy of this Court’s consideration is an ejemplo malo to the legal profession as it betrays no genuine interest in the cause he claims to espouse. Or did counsel think he can earn his moment of glory without the hard work and dedication called for by his petition?<br><br>A Final Word<br><br>On Wednesday, January 23, 2008, a defective tanker containing 2,000 liters of gasoline and 14,000 liters of diesel exploded in the middle of the street a short distance from the exit gate of the Pandacan Terminals, causing death, extensive damage and a frightening conflagration in the vicinity of the incident.
