The said lessees were not even joined as parties in this case, much less were they given a chance to air their side before their houses were demolished, in gross violation of the due process clause provided for in Sec. 1[,] Art. III of the Constitution . . .<br><br>. . . <i>in upholding as gospel truth the report and conclusion of Nimrod Vaño, the supposed handwriting expert</i>[,] that signatures and thumb marks appearing on all documents of sale presented by the defendants are forgeries, and not mindful that Nimrod Vaño was not cross-examined thoroughly by the defense counsel as he was prevented from doing so by the trial judge, in violation of the law more particularly Sec. 6, Rule 132, Rules of Court and/or the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings and is therefore not admissible in evidence.<br><br>. . . [when it] . . . wittingly or unwittingly, again <b><u>overlooked</u></b> the vital facts, the circumstances, the laws and rulings of the Supreme Court, which are of much weight, substance and influence which, if considered carefully, undoubtedly uphold that the defendants and their predecessors in interests, have long been in continuous, open, peaceful and adverse, and notorious possession against the whole world of Lot No. 3781, Cebu Cad., in concept of absolute owners for 46 years, a period more than sufficient to sustain or uphold the defense of prescription, provided for in Art. 1137 of the Civil Code even without good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring in the original;  italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondents admit that Teodulfo Padigos (Teodulfo), an heir of Simplicio, was not impleaded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  They contend, however, that the omission did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction because Article 487 of the Civil Code states that "[a]ny of the co-owners may bring an action in ejectment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respondents' contention does not lie.  The action is for quieting of title, declaration of nullity of documents, recovery of possession and ownership, and damages.  <i>Arcelona v.

The general rule with reference to the making of parties in a civil action requires, of course, the joinder of all necessary parties where possible, and the joinder of all indispensable parties under any and all conditions, their presence being a <i>sine qua non</i> for the exercise of judicial power. It is precisely "when an indispensable party is not before the court (that) the action should be dismissed." <u>The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.</u><br><br>Petitioners are co-owners of a fishpond . . .

On the other hand, respondents' expert witness Vaño used, as standards, the questioned signatures themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  He identified characteristics of the signatures indicating that they may have been forged. Vaño's statement of the purpose of the examination is revealing:<br><blockquote>x x x [t]o x x x discover, classify and determine the authenticity of every document that for any reason requires examination be [<i>sic</i>] scrutinized in every particular that <b>may possibly</b> throw any light upon its origin, its age or upon quality element or condition that <b>may </b>have a bearing upons [<i>sic</i>] its genuineness or spuriousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court also notes that Vaño also analyzed the signatures of the witnesses to the questioned documents, the absence of standard specimens with which those signatures could be compared notwithstanding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  On the other hand, Espina refrained from making conclusions on signatures which could not be compared with established genuine specimens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Specifically with respect to Vaño's finding that Maximo's thumbprint on Exhibit "7" is spurious, the Court is not persuaded, no comparison having been made of such thumbprint with a genuine thumbprint established to be Maximo's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Vaño's testimony should be received with caution, the trial court having abruptly cut short his cross-examination conducted by petitioners' counsel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>COURT:<br><br>You are just delaying the proceedings in this case if you are going to ask him about the documents one by one.

You do not have to ask the witness one by one on the document,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>thereby depriving this Court of the opportunity to determine his credibility. Espina, on the other hand, withstood thorough cross-examination, re-direct and re-cross examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The value of the opinion of a handwriting expert depends not upon his mere statements of whether a writing is genuine or false, but upon the assistance he may afford in pointing out distinguishing marks, characteristics and discrepancies in and between genuine and false specimens of writing which would ordinarily escape notice or detection from an unpracticed observer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> While differences exist between Gaudencio's signatures appearing on Exhibits "3"-"3-D" and his signatures appearing on the affidavits accompanying the pleadings in this case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the gap of more than 30 years from the time he affixed his signatures on the questioned document to the time he affixed his signatures on the pleadings in the case could explain the difference.  Thus Espina observed:<br><blockquote><center>x x x x<br></center><br>4.  Both questioned and standard signatures exhibited the same style and form of the movement impulses in its execution;<br><br>5.  Personal habits of the writer were established in both questioned and standard signatures such as misalignment of the whole structure of the signature, heavy penpressure [<i>sic</i>] of strokes from initial to the terminal, formation of the loops and ovals, poor line quality and spacing between letters are all repeated;<br><br>6.  Both questioned and standard signatures [show] no radical change in the strokes and letter formation in spite o[f] their wide difference in dates of execution considering the early writing maturity of the writer;<br><br>7.

The children of registered owner Wenceslao Padigos are:  Wenceslao Padigos, Demetrio Padigos and Nelly Padigos.

Not only is Gaudencio's self-serving testimony uncorroborated; it contradicts itself on material points. For instance, on direct examination, he testified that Ignacio is his father and Fortunata is his grandmother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>   On cross-examination, however, he declared that his father Ignacio is the brother of Fortunata.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  On direct examination, he testified that his co-plaintiffs Victoria and Lilia are already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  On cross-examination, however, he denied knowledge whether the two are already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  Also on direct examination, he identified Expedito, Henry, and Enrique as the children of Felix.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  Expedito himself testified, however, that he is the son of a certain Mamerto Padigos, the son of a certain Apolonio Padigos who is in turn the son of Felix.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>At all events, respondents are guilty of laches - the negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it has either abandoned it or declined to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  While, by express provision of law, no title to registered land in derogation of that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession, it is an enshrined rule that even a registered owner may be barred from recovering possession of property by virtue of laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><b><b><i><br><br></i></b></b>Respondents insist, however, that they only learned of the deeds of sale in 1994, the year that Alipio, Sr. allegedly commenced possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  The record shows, however, that although petitioners started renting out the land in 1994, they have been tilling it since the 1950s,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and Rosendo's house was constructed in about 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>  These acts of possession could not have escaped respondents' notice given the following unassailed considerations, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>:  Gaudencio testified that he lived on the lot from childhood until 1985, after which he moved to a place three kilometers away, and after he moved, a certain Vicente Debelos lived on the lot with his permission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>  Petitioners' witness Marina Alcoseba, their employee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> testified that Gaudencio and Domingo used to cut <span style="font-style: italic;">kumpay</span> planted by petitioners' tenant on the lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>  The tax declarations in Alipio, Sr.'s name for the years 1967-1980 covering a portion of the lot indicate Fortunata's share to be the north and east boundaries of Alipio, Sr.'s;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> hence, respondents could not have been unaware of the acts of possession that petitioners exercised over the lot.<br><br>Upon the other hand, petitioners have been vigilant in protecting their rights over the lot, which their predecessor-in-interest Alipio, Sr. had declared in his name for tax purposes as early as 1960, and for which he had been paying taxes until his death in 1994, by continuing to pay the taxes thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Respondents having failed to establish their claim by preponderance of evidence, their action for quieting of title, declaration of nullity of documents, recovery of possession, and damages must fail.<br><br>A final word.
