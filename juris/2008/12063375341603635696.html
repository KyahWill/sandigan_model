Javier Street jostled even more just to get close to the lower rate pedestrian gate.&nbsp; The mad rush of the unruly mob generated much force, triggering the horde to surge forward with such momentum that led others to stumble and get trampled upon by the approaching waves of people right after the gate opened.&nbsp; This fatal stampede claimed 71 lives, 69 of whom were women, and left hundreds wounded<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which necessitated emergency medical support and prompted the cancellation of the show’s episode.<br><br>The Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), through then Secretary Angelo Reyes, immediately created an inter-agency fact-finding team<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to investigate the circumstances surrounding the stampede.&nbsp; The team submitted its report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to the DOJ on February 7, 2006.<br><br>By Department Order No. 90 of February 8, 2006, respondent DOJ Secretary Raul Gonzalez (Gonzalez) constituted a Panel (Evaluating Panel)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to evaluate the DILG Report and “determine whether there is sufficient basis to proceed with the conduct of a preliminary investigation on the basis of the documents submitted.”<br><br>The Evaluating Panel later submitted to Gonzalez a February 20, 2006 Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> concurring with the DILG Report <u>but</u> <u>concluding</u> <u>that</u> <u>there</u> <u>was</u> <u>no</u> <u>sufficient</u> <u>basis</u> <u>to</u> <u>proceed</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>conduct</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>preliminary</u> <u>investigation</u> in view of the following considerations:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="15%">a) &nbsp;</td><td width="85%"><div align="justify">No formal complaint/s had been filed by any of the victims and/or their relatives, or any law enforcement agency authorized to file a complaint, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>b) </td><td><div align="justify">While it was mentioned in the Fact-Finding Report that there were 74 deaths and 687 injuries, no documents were submitted to prove the same, e.g. death certificates, autopsy reports, medical certificates, etc.;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>c)</td><td><div align="justify">The Fact-Finding Report did not indicate the names of the persons involved and their specific participation in the “Ultra Incident”;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>d) </td><td><div align="justify">Most of the victims did not mention, in their sworn statements, the names of the persons whom they alleged to be responsible for the “Ultra Incident”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Respondent National Bureau of Investigation-National Capital Region (NBI-NCR), acting on the Evaluating Panel’s referral of the case to it for further investigation, in turn submitted to the DOJ an investigation report, by a March 8, 2006 transmittal letter (NBI-NCR Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>), with supporting documents <u>recommending</u> <u>the</u> <u>conduct</u> <u>of</u> <u>preliminary</u> <u>investigation</u> for Reckless Imprudence resulting in Multiple Homicide and Multiple Physical Injuries<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> against petitioners and seven others<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> as respondents.<br><br>Acting on the recommendation of the NBI-NCR, Gonzalez, by Department Order No. 165 of March 8, 2006, designated a panel of state prosecutors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Investigating Panel) to conduct the preliminary investigation of the case, docketed as I.S.

PCGG</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> &nbsp;They posit that in <i>Cojuangco</i>, the reshuffling of personnel was not considered by this Court which ruled that the entity which conducted the criminal investigation is disqualified from conducting a preliminary investigation in the same case.&nbsp; They add that the DOJ cannot circumvent the prohibition by simply creating a panel to conduct the first, and another to conduct the second.<br><br>In insisting on the arbitrariness of the two Department Orders which, so they claim, paved the way for the DOJ’s dual role, petitioners trace the basis for the formation of the five-prosecutor Investigating Panel to the NBI-NCR Report which was spawned by the supposed criminal investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Evaluating Panel the members of which included two, albeit different, prosecutors.&nbsp; While petitioners do not assail the constitution of the Evaluating Panel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> they claim that it did not just evaluate the DILG Report but went further and conducted its own criminal investigation by interviewing witnesses, conducting an ocular inspection, and perusing the evidence.<br><br>Petitioners’ position does not lie.&nbsp; Cojuangco was borne out of a different factual milieu.<br><br>In Cojuangco, this Court prohibited the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) from conducting a preliminary investigation of the complaints for graft and corruption since it had earlier found a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case – basis of its issuance of sequestration/freeze orders and the filing of an ill-gotten wealth case involving the same transactions.&nbsp; The Court therein stated that it is “difficult to imagine how in the conduct of such preliminary investigation the PCGG could even make a turn about and take a position contradictory to its earlier findings of a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case,” and so held that “the law enforcer who conducted the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">criminal</span> investigation,<br><br>gathered the evidence and thereafter filed the complaint for the purpose of preliminary investigation cannot be allowed to conduct the preliminary investigation of his own complaint.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The present case deviates from <i>Cojuangco</i>.<br><br>The measures taken by the Evaluating Panel do not partake of a criminal investigation, they having been done in aid of evaluation in order to relate the incidents to their proper context.&nbsp; Petitioners’ own video footage of the ocular inspection discloses this purpose.&nbsp; Evaluation for purposes of determining whether there is sufficient basis to proceed with the conduct of a preliminary investigation entails not only reading the report or documents in isolation, but also deems to include resorting to reasonably necessary means such as ocular inspection and physical evidence examination.&nbsp; For, ultimately, any conclusion on such sufficiency or insufficiency needs to rest on some basis or justification.<br><br>Had the Evaluating Panel carried out measures partaking of a criminal investigation, it would have gathered the documents that it enumerated as lacking.&nbsp; <i>Notatu dignum</i> is the fact that the <u>Evaluating</u> <u>Panel</u> <u>was</u> <u>dissolved</u> <i><u>functus</u> <u>oficio</u></i> <u>upon</u> <u>rendering</u> <u>its </u><u>report</u>.&nbsp; It was the NBI, a constituent unit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the DOJ, which conducted the criminal investigation.&nbsp; It is thus foolhardy to inhibit the entire DOJ from conducting a preliminary investigation on the sheer ground that the DOJ’s constituent unit conducted the criminal investigation.<br><br>Moreover, the improbability of the DOJ contradicting its prior finding is hardly appreciable.&nbsp; It bears recalling that the Evaluating Panel found no sufficient basis to proceed with the conduct of a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Since the Evaluating Panel’s report was not adverse to petitioners, prejudgment may not be attributed “vicariously,” so to speak, to the rest of the state prosecutors.&nbsp; Partiality, if any obtains in this case, in fact weighs heavily in favor of petitioners.<br><br><b>On the Alleged Defects of the Complaint</b><br><br>On the two succeeding issues, petitioners fault the appellate court’s dismissal of their petition despite, so they claim, respondents’ commission of grave abuse of discretion in proceeding with the preliminary investigation given the fatal defects in the supposed complaint.<br><br>Petitioners point out that they cannot be compelled to submit their counter-affidavits because the NBI-NCR Report, which they advert to as <u>the</u> complaint-affidavit, was not under oath.&nbsp; While they admit that there were affidavits attached to the NBI-NCR Report, the same, they claim, were not executed by the NBI-NCR as the purported complainant, leaving them as “orphaned” supporting affidavits without a sworn complaint-affidavit to support.<br><br>These affidavits, petitioners further point out, nonetheless do not qualify as a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> within the scope of Rule 110 of the Rules of Court as the allegations therein are insufficient to initiate a preliminary investigation, there being no statement of specific and individual acts or omissions constituting reckless imprudence.&nbsp; They bewail the assumptions or conclusions of law in the NBI-NCR Report as well as the bare narrations in the affidavits that lack any imputation relating to them as the persons allegedly responsible.<br><br>IN FINE, petitioners contend that absent any act or omission ascribed to them, it is unreasonable to expect them to confirm, deny or explain their side.<br><br>A complaint for purposes of conducting a preliminary investigation differs from a complaint for purposes of instituting a criminal prosecution.&nbsp; Confusion apparently springs because two complementary procedures adopt the usage of the same word, for lack of a better or alternative term, to refer essentially to a written charge.&nbsp; There should be no confusion about the objectives, however, since, as intimated during the hearing before the appellate court, preliminary investigation is conducted precisely to elicit further facts or evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Being generally inquisitorial, the preliminary investigation stage is often the only means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged with a crime, to enable the preparation of a complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Consider the following pertinent provision of Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3.&nbsp; <i>Procedure.</i>&nbsp; – The preliminary investigation shall be conducted in the following manner:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; <u>The</u> <b><u>complaint</u></b> <u>shall</u> <u>state</u> <u>the</u> <u>address</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>and</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <b><u>accompanied</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>affidavits</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>complainant</u> <u>and</u> <u>his</u> <u>witnesses,</u> <u>as</u> <u>well</u> <u>as</u> <u>other</u> <u>supporting</u> <u>documents</u> <u>to</u> <u>establish</u> <u>probable</u> <u>cause</u>.&nbsp;</b> They shall be in such number of copies as there are respondents, plus two (2) copies for the official file.&nbsp; The affidavits shall be subscribed and sworn to before any prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oath, or, in their absence or unavailability, before a notary public, each of whom must certify that he personally examined the affiants and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily executed and understood their affidavits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As clearly worded, the complaint is not entirely the affidavit of the complainant, for the affidavit is treated as a component of the complaint.&nbsp; The phraseology of the above-quoted rule recognizes that all necessary allegations need not be contained in a single document.&nbsp; It is unlike a criminal “complaint or information” where the averments must be contained in one document charging only one offense, non-compliance with which renders it vulnerable to a motion to quash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Court is not unaware of the practice of incorporating all allegations in one document denominated as “complaint-affidavit.” It does not pronounce strict adherence to only one approach, however, for there are cases where the extent of one’s personal knowledge may not cover the entire gamut of details material to the alleged offense.&nbsp; The private offended party or relative of the deceased may not even have witnessed the fatality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> in which case the peace officer or law enforcer has to rely chiefly on affidavits of witnesses.&nbsp; The Rules do not in fact preclude the attachment of a referral or transmittal letter similar to that of the NBI-NCR.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Soriano v. Casanova</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court held:<br><blockquote>A close scrutiny of the <u>letters</u> <u>transmitted</u> by the BSP and PDIC to the DOJ shows that these <u>were</u> <u><b>not</b></u> <u>intended</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u><b>the</b></u> <u>complaint</u> <u>envisioned</u> <u>under</u> <u>the</u> <u>Rules</u>.&nbsp; It may be clearly inferred from the tenor of the letters that the officers merely intended to transmit the affidavits of the bank employees to the DOJ.&nbsp; Nowhere in the transmittal letters is there any averment on the part of the BSP and PDIC officers of personal knowledge of the events and transactions constitutive of the criminal violations alleged to have been made by the accused.&nbsp; In fact, the letters clearly stated that what the OSI of the BSP and the LIS of the PDIC did was to respectfully transmit to the DOJ for preliminary investigation the affidavits and personal knowledge of the acts of the petitioner.&nbsp; These affidavits were subscribed under oath by the witnesses who executed them before a notary public.&nbsp; <u>Since</u> <u>the</u> <u>affidavits,</u> &nbsp;<u>not</u> &nbsp;<u>the</u> &nbsp;<u>letters</u> &nbsp;<u>transmitting</u>&nbsp; <u>them,</u> <u>were</u> <u>intended</u> <u>to</u> <u><b>initiate</b></u> <u>the</u> <u>preliminary</u> <u>investigation,</u> <u>we</u> <u>hold</u> <u>that</u> <u>Section</u> <u>3(a),</u> <u>Rule</u> <u>112</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Rules</u> <u>of</u> <u>Court</u> <u>was</u> <u>substantially</u> <u>complied</u> <u>with.</u><br><br>Citing the ruling of this Court in <i>Ebarle v. Sucaldito</i>, the Court of Appeals correctly held that <u>a</u> <u>complaint</u> <u>for</u> <u>purposes</u> <u>of</u> <u>preliminary</u> <u>investigation</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>fiscal</u> <u>need</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>filed</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>offended</u> <u>party.</u>&nbsp; <u>The</u> <u>rule</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>that,</u> <b><u>unless</u> <u>the</u> <u>offense</u> <u>subject</u> <u>thereof</u> <u>is</u> <u>one</u> <u>that</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>prosecuted</u> <i><u>de</u> <u>oficio</u></i></b>, <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>filed,</u> <u>for</u> <u>preliminary</u> <u>investigation</u> <u>purposes,</u> <u>by</u> <b><u>any</u> <u>competent</u> <u>person</u></b>.&nbsp; The crime of estafa is a public crime which can be initiated by “any competent person.”&nbsp; The witnesses who executed the affidavits based on their personal knowledge of the acts committed by the petitioner fall within the purview of “any competent person” who may institute the complaint for a public crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>A preliminary investigation can thus validly proceed on the basis of an affidavit of any competent person, without the referral document, like the NBI-NCR Report, having been sworn to by the law enforcer as the nominal complainant.&nbsp; To require otherwise is a needless exercise.&nbsp; The cited case of <i>Oporto, Jr. v. Judge Monserate</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> does not appear to dent this proposition.&nbsp; After all, what is required is to <b>reduce the evidence into affidavits</b>, for while reports and even raw information may justify the initiation of an investigation, the preliminary investigation stage can be held only after sufficient evidence has been gathered and evaluated which may warrant the eventual prosecution of the case in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the present case, there is no doubt about the existence of affidavits.&nbsp; The appellate court found that “certain complaint-affidavits were already filed by some of the victims,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a factual finding to which this Court, by rule, generally defers.<br><br>A complaint for purposes of conducting preliminary investigation is not required to exhibit the attending structure of a “complaint or information” laid down in Rule 110 (Prosecution of Offenses) which already speaks of the “<i>People of the Philippines</i>” as a party,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> an “accused” rather than a respondent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and a “court” that shall pronounce judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;If a “complaint or information” filed in court does not comply with a set of constitutive averments, it is vulnerable to a motion to quash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;The filing of a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit is proscribed by the rule on preliminary investigation, however.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The investigating officer is allowed to dismiss outright the complaint only if it is not sufficient in form and substance or “no ground to continue with the investigation”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> &nbsp;is appreciated.<br><blockquote><u>The</u> <u>investigating</u> <u>fiscal</u>, to be sure, has discretion to determine the specificity and adequacy of averments of the offense charged.&nbsp; He <u>may</u> <u>dismiss</u> <u>the</u> <u>complaint</u> forthwith if he finds it to be <u>insufficient</u> <u>in</u> <u>form</u> <u>or</u> <u>substance</u> <u>or</u> <u>if</u> <u>he</u> <u>otherwise</u> <u>finds</u> <u>no</u> <u>ground</u> <u>to</u> <u>continue</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>inquiry</u>, or proceed with the investigation if the complaint is, in his view, in due and proper form.&nbsp; It certainly is not his duty to require a more particular statement of the allegations of the complaint merely upon the respondents’ motion, and specially where after an analysis of the complaint and its supporting statements he finds it sufficiently definite to apprise the respondents of the offenses which they are charged. Moreover, the procedural device of a bill of particulars, as the Solicitor General points out, appears to have reference to informations or criminal complaints filed in a competent court upon which the accused are arraigned and required to plead, and strictly speaking has no application to complaints initiating a preliminary investigation which cannot result in any finding of guilt, but only of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Italics and ellipses in the original omitted; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners’ claims of vague allegations or insufficient imputations are thus matters that can be properly raised in their counter-affidavits to negate or belie the existence of probable cause.<br><br><b>On the Claim of Bias and Prejudgment</b><br><br>On the remaining issues, petitioners charge respondents to have lost the impartiality to conduct the preliminary investigation since they had prejudged the case, in support of which they cite the “indecent” haste in the conduct of the proceedings. &nbsp;Thus, they mention the conduct of the criminal investigation within 24 working days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the issuance of subpoenas immediately following the creation of the Investigating Panel.<br><br>Petitioners likewise cite the following public declarations made by Gonzalez as expressing his conclusions that a crime had been committed, that the show was the proximate cause, and that the show’s organizers are guilty thereof:<br><blockquote>February 6, 2006:&nbsp; “[ ] should have anticipated it because one week <i>na iyan e</i>.&nbsp; The crowds started gathering since one week before.&nbsp; This is simply <b>negligence x x x on the part of the organizers.</b>”<br><br>February 14, 2006: “I think <b>ABS-CBN is trying to minimize its own responsibility</b> and it’s discernible from the way by which talk shows <i>nila</i> being conducted on people who talk about liabilities of others.<br><br>“<b>The reason for this incident was the program.</b> If there was no program, there would have been no stampede.&nbsp; There would have been no people.&nbsp; There would have been no attempt by people to queue there for days and rush for the nearest entry point.”<br><br>March 20, 2006:&nbsp; “<b>I’ll bet everything I have that they are responsible</b> at least on the civil aspect.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> &nbsp;(Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Continuing, petitioners point out that long before the conclusion of any investigation, Gonzalez already ruled out the possibility that some other cause or causes led to the tragedy or that someone else or perhaps none should be made criminally liable; and that Gonzalez had left the preliminary investigation to a mere determination of who within ABS-CBN are the program’s organizers who should be criminally prosecuted.<br><br>Petitioners even cite President Arroyo’s declaration in a radio interview on February 14, 2006 that “<i>[y]ang stampede na iyan, Jo, ay isang trahedya na pinapakita yung kakulangan at pagkapabaya… nagpabaya ng organisasyon na nag</i>-organize <i>nito</i>.”<br><br>To petitioners, the declarations admittedly<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> made by Gonzalez tainted the entire DOJ, including the Evaluating and Investigating Panels, since the Department is subject to the direct control and supervision of Gonzalez in his capacity as DOJ Secretary who, in turn, is an alter ego of the President.<br><br>Petitioners thus fault the appellate court in not finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Investigating Panel members who “refused to inhibit themselves from conducting the preliminary investigation despite the undeniable bias and partiality publicly displayed by their superiors.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Pursuing, petitioners posit that the bias of the DOJ Secretary is the bias of the entire DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> &nbsp;They thus conclude that the DOJ, as an institution, publicly adjudged their guilt based on a pre-determined notion of supposed facts, and urge that the Investigating Panel and the entire DOJ for that matter should inhibit from presiding and deciding over such preliminary investigation because they, as quasi-judicial officers, do not possess the “cold neutrality of an impartial judge.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Responding to the claim of prejudgment, respondents maintain that the above-cited statements of Gonzalez and the President merely indicate that the incident is of such nature and magnitude as to warrant a natural inference that it would not have happened in the ordinary course of things and that any reasonable mind would conclude that there is a causal connection between the show’s preparations and the resultant deaths and injuries.<br><br>Petitioners’ fears are speculatory.<br><br>Speed in the conduct of proceedings by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer cannot <i>per se</i> be instantly attributed to an injudicious performance of functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp;

This, petitioners failed to discharge.&nbsp; The swift completion of the Investigating Panel’s initial task cannot be relegated as shoddy or shady without discounting the presumably regular performance of not just one but five state prosecutors.<br><br>As for petitioners’ claim of undue haste indicating bias, proof thereof &nbsp;is wanting. The pace of the proceedings is anything but a matter of acceleration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without any objection from the parties, respondents even accorded petitioners a preliminary investigation even when it was not required since the case involves an alleged offense where the penalty prescribed by law is below Four Years, Two Months and One Day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Neither is there proof showing that Gonzalez exerted undue pressure on his subordinates to tailor their decision with his public declarations and adhere to a pre-determined result.&nbsp; The Evaluating Panel in fact even found no sufficient basis, it bears emphatic reiteration, &nbsp;to proceed with the conduct of a preliminary investigation, and one member of the Investigating Panel even dissented to its October 9, 2006 Resolution.<br><br>To follow petitioner’s theory of institutional bias would logically mean that even the NBI had prejudged the case in conducting a criminal investigation since it is a constituent agency of the DOJ.&nbsp; And if the theory is extended to the President’s declaration, there would be no more arm of the government credible enough to conduct a criminal investigation and a preliminary investigation.<br><br>On petitioners citation of <i>Ladlad v.

Gonzalez’s actuations may leave much to be desired; petitioners’ are not, however, totally spotless as circumstances tend to show that they were asking for or fishing from him something that could later be used against him to favor their cause.<br><br>A FINAL WORD.&nbsp; The Court takes this occasion to echo its disposition in <i>Cruz v.
