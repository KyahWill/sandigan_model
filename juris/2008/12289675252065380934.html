AAA responded by showing her four fingers.&nbsp; In addition, when AAA told BBB that she had intercourse a long time ago, BBB asked if it happened again on that day and the answer was "<i>wen</i>" or yes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Cuaresma followed BBB after five minutes.&nbsp; Upon reaching the house of appellant, he saw AAA sitting and perspiring and her hair entangled.&nbsp; Cuaresma observed that AAA looked as if she was out of her mind.&nbsp; Cuaresma asked AAA what appellant did to her and the latter answered, "<i>Iniyot</i><i> nak.</i>"&nbsp; When asked how many times, AAA raised her four fingers.&nbsp; Cuaresma asked AAA who molested her and the latter answered that it was appellant.&nbsp; Cuaresma then told BBB to bring AAA home and that he would look for CCC, the father of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Upon locating CCC, Cuaresma told him that he should go home because something happened to AAA.&nbsp; Later, BBB told CCC that AAA was raped by appellant. CCC asked AAA if she was raped by appellant and the latter answered, "Yes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>BBB and CCC immediately brought AAA to the XXX police station. SPO3 Loreto Gavina (SPO3 Gavina) told the group to bring AAA to a doctor for a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA was then brought to the YYY Memorial Hospital where Dr. Rodolfo V. Eligio (Dr. Eligio) conducted the examination.&nbsp; Dr. Eligio found that there were incomplete lacerations of the hymen at the 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions, but the same were old.&nbsp; Dr. Eligio concluded that AAA could have been "used" a week or two earlier and that in the absence of seminal fluid he could not tell whether AAA was raped on the day she was examined.&nbsp; However, Dr. Eligio clarified that if the ejaculation took place outside the vagina, it would explain why there was no sperm inside the vagina.&nbsp; Furthermore, Dr. Eligio manifested that if a woman had sex three times before and subsequently engages in sex for more than three times, the lacerations caused by the first intercourse would be healed; it does not mean that the subsequent intercourse would not anymore produce lacerations if the penis is big, but if the penis is of normal size, the subsequent intercourse would no longer cause lacerations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Dr. Eligio put into writing his findings in a "medico legal certificate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After Dr. Eligio conducted his examination, BBB and CCC brought AAA back to the XXX police station at 5:15 p.m.&nbsp; They told SP03 Gavina that AAA was really raped which prompted the group to look for appellant.&nbsp; Appellant was brought to the municipal building.&nbsp; While AAA and appellant were facing each other, SP03 Gavina asked AAA several times whether she was raped by appellant. AAA answered "yes."&nbsp; SP03 Gavina also asked AAA how many times appellant abused her; AAA raised her four fingers.&nbsp; According to SP03 Gavina, CCC, the father of AAA, was not dictating to her when she was answering his questions.&nbsp; However, SP03 Gavina noticed that AAA had difficulty in speech, that was why her companions were helping her to talk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; SP03 Gavina then executed a <i>Sinumpang</i><i> Salayaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in connection with the investigation he conducted.<br><br>On November 17, 1999, Nimia C. de Guzman (De Guzman), a clinical psychologist, administered several examinations on AAA without the assistance of any relative.&nbsp; As a result of the examinations, De Guzman found out that while AAA was then 14 years old, her mental capacity was only that of a 4-5-year old child.&nbsp; De Guzman put her findings in a Psychological Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>For the defense, evidence is as follows:<br><br>Kathleen, 12 years old, testified that on October 23, 1999, she did not call AAA to play; that she was at the house of her uncle on October 22, 1999 because her grandmother died, and that she went home in the morning of October 23, 1999 to get some clothes; and that appellant, her father, was not at their house in the morning of October 23, 1999.&nbsp; In addition, Kathleen claimed that she did not see AAA inside their house nor did she see AAA on her way home that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant testified as follows: on October 22, 1999, he and his three children were in the house of his brother-in-law because his mother-in-law died.&nbsp; He helped in preparing the tent, repaired the light, and along with Cuaresma, made the coffin of his mother-in-law.&nbsp; Appellant and Cuaresma did not sleep and stayed in the house.&nbsp; On October 23, 1999, appellant brought Cuaresma home at around 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; When appellant reached his house nobody was there and so appellant slept on the <i>papag</i><i>.</i> When appellant woke up, he saw AAA inside the house.&nbsp; He asked AAA to leave, but she refused.&nbsp; Appellant went back to sleep because he trusted AAA and was confident that nothing would get lost in the house.<br><br>Appellant was awakened when BBB called AAA.&nbsp; He then realized that AAA was lying on his left arm.&nbsp; Appellant went down the house and told AAA to leave.&nbsp; AAA went out through the window because she was probably afraid of her aunt.&nbsp; Appellant told BBB that AAA was not there, but BBB did not believe him since she saw the slippers of AAA.&nbsp; Appellant claimed that it was not true that he had sexual intercourse with AAA for four times on October 23, 1999 because he was too tired and sleepy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On April 30, 2002, the RTC rendered a decision finding appellant guilty of the crime of rape, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, this Court finds accused Nestor Veluz <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape defined under Article 266-A, par. 1(d) and punished under Article 266-B (10) and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <b>Death</b>; and to pay victim AAA the amount of Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (Php75,000.00) by way of civil indemnity; and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant appealed to the CA.<br><br>The CA affirmed the RTC decision with modification as to damages, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote> x x x x<br><br>This Court finds accused-appellant Nestor Veluz <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape defined under Article 266-A, par. 1(d) and punished under Article 266-B (10).

(b) the complainant's testimony must be scrutinized with extreme caution since, by the very nature of the crime, only two persons are normally involved; and (c) if the complainant's testimony is convincingly credible, the accused may be convicted of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims that the testimony of AAA is incredible and inconsistent.&nbsp; However, it is settled that when credibility is in issue, the Supreme Court generally defers to the findings of the trial court considering that it was in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In the instant case, the Court finds nothing on record to justify a departure from the findings of the trial court.&nbsp; The testimony of AAA leaves no doubt that appellant had in fact raped her, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When you were already inside their house, did you see Nesty inside their house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No answer sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was Nesty in the sala?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><b>Q. </b></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">What did Nesty do when you were there?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><b>A. </b></div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">Iniyot po niya ako sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><p align="justify">x x x x</p></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Where did he had [sic] sexual intercourse with you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> In the upper part of their house sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> Before he had sexual intercourse with you, what did he do to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> No answer</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">When you went to the house of Nesty what were you wearing then?

And so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility and unless the same is controverted by competent physical and testimonial evidence, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In his Brief, appellant contends that the testimony of AAA are general statements and constitute the standard and stereotypical narration of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; The Court does not agree.&nbsp; Studies show that children, particularly very young children, make "perfect victims" of rape.&nbsp; Certainly, children have more problems in providing accounts of events because they do not understand everything they experience.&nbsp; Moreover, children have a very limited vocabulary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Although AAA was 13 years old, she had the mental capacity of a 4-5-year old child.&nbsp; The lower courts, and this Court as well, could therefore not expect AAA to narrate and describe the exact details of how she was raped the way a 13-year old child could do.<br><br>Moreover, the Court does not agree with appellant's argument that the reply of AAA, "<i>Inilagay</i><i> po niya sa aking oki,</i>" cannot be automatically be taken to mean that appellant placed his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp;

Rivera, on the other hand, testified that he and AAA were lying on their side and facing each other during the sexual intercourse.&nbsp; It must be remembered that a rape victim, most especially in case of a retarded person, cannot be expected to remember or recount in utmost clarity and consistency the details of her harrowing and humiliating experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, victims of rape are not expected to have an errorless recollection of the incident which was so humiliating, and painful that they might in fact be trying to obliterate it from their memory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, inaccuracies and inconsistencies are to be expected in the rape victim's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This Court agrees with the finding of the CA that the testimony of BBB was not incredible simply because she first sought the help of a <i>barangay</i><i> kagawad</i> instead of immediately helping AAA.&nbsp; As repeatedly stressed, there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Witnessing a crime is an unusual experience that elicits different reactions from the witnesses and for which no clear-cut standard form of behavior can be drawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The same observation can be applied to the reaction of Rivera who instead of immediately calling for help, opted to watch appellant and AAA for three minutes.<br><br>Appellant contends that there was nothing in the testimony of BBB which corroborated AAA's testimony that appellant had carnal knowledge of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The foregoing is inconsequential, considering that AAA positively identified appellant as her assailant.&nbsp; Likewise, the testimony of Kathleen to the effect that she did not call AAA to go to appellant's house on October 23, 1999 does not demolish the credibility of AAA.&nbsp; What is important is that, based on the prosecution evidence, the testimonies of AAA and Rivera have established the fact of carnal knowledge.<br><br>Furthermore, appellant questions the discrepancy between BBB's sworn statement and her testimony in open court as to the fact of her seeing appellant sucking the breast of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant cites Rivera's testimony that when BBB looked into the window after having been fetched by Rivera, appellant and AAA had already left the place where Rivera saw them earlier and had gone down (<i>bumaba</i><i> na sila</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, appellant argues that BBB could not have seen appellant sucking the breast of AAA.<br><br>Such argument must fail.&nbsp; Inconsistencies in the narration of the prosecution witnesses on minor details do not affect the weight of their testimonies.&nbsp; Testimonies of the prosecution witnesses cannot be expected to be uniform to the last details.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the testimonies of witnesses to a crime could not be expected to be error-free all throughout.&nbsp; Different persons have different impressions and recollections of the same incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Even the most truthful witnesses can make mistakes or innocent lapses that do not necessarily affect their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, findings of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great weight on appeal, and the rule is not changed simply because of some inconsequential inconsistencies that are discovered upon a fault-finding scrutiny of the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Likewise, this Court is not persuaded by appellant's contention that there should have been visible signs of intercourse on the vagina of AAA such as discoloration of the inner lips or redness of the labia minora, none of which were found by Dr. Eligio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant argues that Dr. Eligio only found healed lacerations which belie AAA's claim that she was raped two hours prior to the medical examination.&nbsp; In addition, appellant argues that there should have been welts, marks or even bruises on the body of AAA resulting from her lying down on the bamboo floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>It is well settled that proof of hymenal laceration is not an element of rape, neither is a medico-legal report indispensable in the prosecution of a rape case, it being merely corroborative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; More importantly, a freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape, and healed lacerations do not negate rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> neither does the absence of spermatozoa negate rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, absence of external signs of physical injuries does not cancel out the commission of rape, since proof of injuries is not an essential element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; It must be borne in mind that AAA has a mental capacity of a 4-5-year old.&nbsp; Most likely, she did not put up a resistance that could bring about physical injuries.&nbsp; Moreover, prosecution witness Dr. Eligio testified that AAA could have been "used" once or twice before in view of the presence of healed lacerations; and that if the penis is of normal size, subsequent intercourse would no longer cause lacerations.<br><br>Appellant relies heavily on this Court's pronouncement in <i>People of the Philippines v. Cartuano, Jr.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><i> </i>that there must be proper historical and physical examination to determine the existence of mental retardation. However, in <i>People of the </i><i>Philippines</i><i> v.

No. 9346 entitled "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines" on June 24, 2006, the imposition of the penalty of death has been prohibited.&nbsp; Thus, the proper penalty to be imposed on appellant as provided in Section 2, paragraph (a) of said law, is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The applicability of R.A. No. 9346 is undeniable in view of the principle in criminal law that <i>favorabilia</i><i> sunt amplianda adiosa restrigenda. </i> Penal laws which are favorable to the accused are given retroactive effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><i> </i><br><br>In addition, appellant is not eligible for parole pursuant to Section 3 of R.A.
