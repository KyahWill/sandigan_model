				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On different dates from July 14, 1999 to March 20, 2000, petitioner-spouses Wilfredo N. Ong and Edna Sheila Paguio-Ong obtained several loans from Roban Lending Corporation (respondent) in the total amount of P4,000,000.00.&nbsp; These loans were secured by a real estate mortgage on petitioners' parcels of land located in Binauganan, Tarlac City and covered by TCT No. 297840.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On February 12, 2001, petitioners and respondent executed an Amendment to Amended Real Estate Mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> consolidating their loans inclusive of charges thereon which totaled P5,916,117.50.&nbsp; On even date, the parties executed a Dacion in Payment Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> wherein petitioners assigned the properties covered by TCT No. 297840 to respondent in settlement of their total obligation, and a Memorandum of Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> reading:<br><blockquote> That the FIRST PARTY [Roban Lending Corporation] and the SECOND PARTY [the petitioners] agreed to consolidate and restructure all aforementioned loans, which have been all past due and delinquent since April 19, 2000, and outstanding obligations totaling P5,916,117.50.&nbsp; The SECOND PARTY hereby sign [<i>sic</i>] another promissory note in the amount of P5,916,117.50 (a copy of which is hereto attached and forms xxx an integral part of this document), with a promise to pay the FIRST PARTY in full within one year from the date of the consolidation and restructuring, otherwise the SECOND PARTY agree to have their "DACION IN PAYMENT" agreement, which they have executed and signed today in favor of the FIRST PARTY be enforced[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>In April 2002 (the day is illegible), petitioners filed a Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> docketed as Civil Case No. 9322, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tarlac City, for declaration of mortgage contract as abandoned, annulment of deeds, illegal exaction, unjust enrichment, accounting, and damages, alleging that the Memorandum of Agreement and the Dacion in Payment executed are void for being <i>pactum commissorium</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioners alleged that the loans extended to them from July 14, 1999 to March 20, 2000 were founded on several uniform promissory notes, which provided for 3.5% monthly interest rates, 5% penalty per month on the total amount due and demandable, and a further sum of 25% attorney's fees thereon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; and in addition, respondent exacted certain sums denominated as "EVAT/AR."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Petitioners decried these additional charges as "illegal, iniquitous, unconscionable, and revolting to the conscience as they hardly allow any borrower any chance of survival in case of default."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further alleged that they had previously made payments on their loan accounts, but because of the illegal exactions thereon, the total balance appears not to have moved at all, hence, accounting was in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Petitioners thus prayed for judgment:<br><blockquote> a) Declaring the Real Estate Mortgage Contract and its amendments x x x as null and void and without legal force and effect for having been renounced, abandoned, and given up;<br><br>b) Declaring the "Memorandum of Agreement" xxx and "Dacion in Payment" x x x as null and void for being <i>pactum commissorium</i>;<br><br>c) Declaring the interests, penalties, Evat [<i>sic</i>] and attorney's fees assessed and loaded into the loan accounts of the plaintiffs with defendant as unjust, iniquitous, unconscionable and illegal and therefore, stricken out or set aside;<br><br>d) Ordering an accounting on plaintiffs' loan accounts to determine the true and correct balances on their obligation against legal charges only; and<br><br>e) Ordering defendant to [pay] to the plaintiffs: --<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">e.1&nbsp; Moral damages in an amount not less than P100,000.00 and exemplary damages of P50,000.00;<br><br>e.2&nbsp;

However, <u>a judgment on the pleadings would not have been proper in this case as the answer tendered an issue</u>, i.e. the validity of the MOA and DPA.&nbsp; On the other hand, a summary judgment may be rendered by the court if the pleadings, supporting affidavits, and other documents show that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>Nevertheless, finding the error in nomenclature "to be mere semantics with no bearing on the merits of the case",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court of Appeals upheld the RTC decision that there was no <i>pactum commissorium</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> petitioners filed the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; faulting the Court of Appeals for having committed a clear and reversible error<br><blockquote><ol type="I"> <li>. . .

WHEN IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THAT THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT (MOA) AND THE DACION EN PAGO (DPA) ARE NULL AND VOID FOR BEING CONTRARY TO LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Both parties admit the execution and contents of the Memorandum of Agreement and Dacion in Payment.&nbsp; They differ, however, on whether both contracts constitute <i>pactum commissorium</i> or <i>dacion en pago</i>.<br><br>This Court finds that the Memorandum of Agreement and Dacion in Payment constitute <i>pactum commissorium</i>, which is prohibited under Article 2088 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote> The creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them. Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void."</blockquote>The elements of <i>pactum commissorium</i>, which enables the mortgagee to acquire ownership of the mortgaged property without the need of any foreclosure proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> are:&nbsp; (1) there should be a property mortgaged by way of security for the payment of the principal obligation, and (2) there should be a stipulation for automatic appropriation by the creditor of the thing mortgaged in case of non-payment of the principal obligation within the stipulated period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the Memorandum of Agreement and the Dacion in Payment contain no provisions for foreclosure proceedings nor redemption.&nbsp; Under the Memorandum of Agreement, the failure by the petitioners to pay their debt within the one-year period gives respondent the right to enforce the Dacion in Payment transferring to it ownership of the properties covered by TCT No. 297840. Respondent, in effect, automatically acquires ownership of the properties upon petitioners' failure to pay their debt within the stipulated period.<br><br>Respondent argues that the law recognizes <i>dacion en pago</i> as a special form of payment whereby the debtor alienates property to the creditor in satisfaction of a monetary obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; This does not persuade.&nbsp; In a true <i>dacion en pago</i>, the assignment of the property extinguishes the monetary debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, the alienation of the properties was by way of security, and not by way of satisfying the debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The Dacion in Payment did not extinguish petitioners' obligation to respondent.&nbsp; On the contrary, under the Memorandum of Agreement executed on the same day as the Dacion in Payment, petitioners had to execute a promissory note for P5,916,117.50 which they were to pay within one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Respondent cites <i>Solid Homes, Inc. v.
