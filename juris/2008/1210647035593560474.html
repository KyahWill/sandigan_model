				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review is the Decision dated 30 June 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02054,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> affirming <i>in toto</i> the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 29 November 2002 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 88, in Criminal Case No. Q-95-63787, finding accused-appellant Angelo Zeta and his wife, Petronilla Zeta (Petronilla), guilty of murder.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>On 6 November 1995, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> was filed before the RTC charging appellant and Petronilla of Murder, thus:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 28<sup>th</sup> day of October 1995, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring together, confederating with and mutually helping each other, with intent to kill, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with evident premeditation, treachery, assault, attack and employ personal violence upon the person of RAMON GARCIA y LOPEZ by then and there shooting the latter with the use of a .45 cal. pistol hitting him on the different parts of his body, thereby causing the instant and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said RAMON GARCIA Y LOPEZ.</blockquote>When arraigned on 20 December 1995, appellant and Petronilla, assisted by their respective counsels <i>de parte</i>, pleaded "Not Guilty" to the charge of murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses Aleine Mercado (Aleine), Dr. Maria Cristina Freyra (Dr. Freyra), Police Inspector Solomon Segundo (Inspector Segundo), Rey Jude Naverra (Rey), Edwin Ronk (Edwin), Francisco Garcia (Francisco), SPO1 Carlos Villarin (SPO1 Villarin), and SPO2 Wakab Magundacan (SPO2 Magundacan). Their testimonies, taken together, bear the following:<br><br>On 28 October 1995, at around 12:00 midnight, Edwin, Rey and a certain Melvin Castillo (Melvin) had a drinking spree outside the house of Rey located at No. 30-B Tacio Street, La Loma, Quezon City. At about 2:00 in the morning of the same date, a car stopped in front of the three. Appellant was driving the car while Petronilla was seated beside him. Petronilla opened the car's window and asked Edwin if he knows Ramon and the latter's address at No. 25-C General Tinio Street, La Loma, Quezon City. Edwin replied that he did not know Ramon or his address. Thereafter, appellant and Petronilla left on board the car and proceeded to General Tinio Street, La Loma, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At about 2:15 in the morning of the same date, the car boarded by appellant and Petronilla stopped in front of Ramon's house at No. 25-C General Tinio Street, La Loma, Quezon City. After parking nearby, appellant and Petronilla alighted from the car and proceeded to Ramon's house. Petronilla repeatedly called Ramon. Aleine (niece of Cristina Mercado, Ramon's common-law wife) was awakened by the repeated calls and opened the door. Petronilla requested Aleine to call Ramon. Aleine told Petronilla that she would wake up Ramon who was then sleeping with Cristina at the second floor of the house. Aleine invited appellant and Petronilla inside the house but the two replied that they would just wait for Ramon outside. Aleine proceeded to the second floor of the house and knocked at the door of Ramon's room. Ramon woke up. Subsequently, Aleine went downstairs and proceeded to the dining table. While Ramon was walking down the stairs, appellant suddenly entered the house and shot Ramon several times on different parts of the body with a caliber .45 Llama pistol. Upon seeing appellant shooting Ramon, Aleine hid inside the restroom. When the gunshots ceased, Aleine went out of the restroom and saw Ramon sprawled and bloodied on the ground floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Edwin, Rey and Melvin were still drinking when they heard the gunshots. They rushed to the direction of Ramon's house. When they were nearing Ramon's house, Petronilla suddenly stepped out of the main door of Ramon's house followed by appellant. Melvin uttered, <i>"Mamamatay tao."</i> Petronilla merely looked at them and entered the car. Appellant also proceeded inside the car and thereafter the car sped away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Aleine went out of the house and called for help. Edwin, Rey and Melvin approached her. They carried Ramon and placed him inside a vehicle owned by a neighbor. While they were on their way to the Chinese General Hospital, Ramon told Aleine that the one who shot him was <i>"asawa ni Nellie na kapitbahay namin sa Las Piñas."</i> Ramon died due to gunshot wounds while being operated on at the Chinese General Hospital. Thereafter, the police arrived at the crime scene and recovered several empty bullet shells and slugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At about 10:55 the following morning, SPO2 Magundacan received a report that a carnapped vehicle was parked along Lakandula Street, P. Tuazon Blvd., Quezon City. SPO2 Magundacan proceeded thereat and saw appellant about to board a car armed with a gun visibly tucked in his waist. SPO2 Magundacan approached appellant and asked him for a license and/or registration papers of the gun but appellant did not show any. SP02 Magundacan also inquired from Petronilla, who was inside the car also armed with a gun tucked in her waist, if she had a license but Petronilla likewise failed to show any. Thus, SPO2 Magundacan brought appellant and Petronilla to Police Precinct 8, Project 4, Quezon City, for investigation. Subsequently, appellant and Petronilla, upon the request of the La Loma police, were turned over to the police station for investigation as regards the killing of Ramon. Appellant and Petronilla were thereafter charged with murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also adduced documentary and object evidence to buttress the testimonies of its witnesses, to wit: (1) death certificate of Ramon;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (2) sworn statement of Aleine;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (3) request for autopsy examination of Ramon's body;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (4) medico-legal report issued and signed by Dr. Freyra stating that Ramon died due to gunshot wounds;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (5) anatomical sketch of a human body signed by Dr. Freyra indicating the location of the gunshot wounds on Ramon's body;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (6) physical science report stating that a paraffin test was conducted on both hands of Ramon and they were found negative for gunpowder nitrates;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (7) handwritten sketch made by Edwin depicting the streets of Tacio and General Tinio;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (8) request for ballistic examination of the object evidence recovered from the crime scene;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (9) ballistic report issued and signed by Inspector Segundo stating that the bullet extracted from Ramon's body and other bullets recovered from the crime scene were similar to the bullets of the caliber .45 Llama pistol seized from appellant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (10) certification from the Personnel Division of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) affirming that Ramon was its regular employee from 14 February 1981 up to 27 October 1995 and that he was receiving a monthly salary of P13,687.00 plus other benefits;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (11) summary of expenses and receipts for the wake of Ramon;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (12) joint affidavit of SPO2 Magundacan and a certain PO2 Ronald Zamora;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (13) photographs showing the spot where appellant and Petronilla stood while waiting for Ramon, the stairs where Ramon walked down shortly before he was shot several times by appellant, the area inside Ramon's house where appellant positioned himself while shooting at Ramon, and the location where Ramon fell down after he was shot several times by appellant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (14) nine empty shells and seven deformed slugs fired from a caliber .45 pistol which were recovered by SPO1 Villarin from the crime scene;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (15) a deformed slug fired from a caliber .45 pistol which was extracted from Ramon's body; (16) test bullets fired from the caliber .45 Llama pistol seized from appellant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (17) the caliber .45 Llama pistol with Serial Number C-27854 seized from appellant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and (18) a calling card recovered from Ramon with the print label "Cristine Rent A Car," "Angelo D. Zeta" and with telephone numbers and addresses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense presented the testimonies of appellant, Petronilla, and Annabelle Vergara (Annabelle) to refute the foregoing allegations. Their version of the incident is as follows:<br><br>On 27 October 1995, at about 10:00 in the evening, appellant, Petronilla and Annabelle (housemaid of the couple) were in the couple's house at Cainta, Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Later, appellant took Petronilla's caliber .38 pistol and went to his brother's (Jose Zeta, Jr.) house in Marikina arriving therein at around 12:00 midnight. Jose was out of the house so appellant waited for him. At about 2:30 in the morning of 28 October 1995, Jose arrived. Thereafter, appellant demanded from Jose the return of his three firearms, one of which is a caliber .45 pistol. Jose, however, handed only the caliber .45 pistol to appellant. Appellant berated Jose for refusing to return the two other firearms. Irked, Jose drew a gun. Appellant also drew the caliber .45 pistol and shot Jose four times. Jose fell down on the ground. Afterwards, appellant left the house, took Jose's car which was parked near the house, and proceeded to Police Precinct 8, Project 4, Quezon City, where he waited for a certain Tony Tolentino whom he claims to be a policeman assigned at the Southern Police District. At about 9:00 in the morning of 28 October 1995, the policeman on duty at Precinct 8 informed appellant that the latter's car parked inside the precinct was a carnapped vehicle. The policemen searched the car and found several guns including the caliber .45 and the caliber .38. Appellant was thereupon detained and charged with illegal possession of firearms and carnapping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>At about 10:00 in the morning of 28 October 1995, Petronilla received a telephone call informing her that appellant was at Police Precinct 8, Project 4, Quezon City. She immediately proceeded thereat and presented documents relative to her ownership and license of the caliber .38 seized from appellant. Thereafter, she went home at about 11:00 in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 2 November 1995, Petronilla visited appellant at Precinct 8. During the visit, Aleine arrived at Precinct 8 and pointed to appellant and Petronilla. Subsequently, appellant and Petronilla were informed by the police that they were suspects in the killing of Ramon. Thereafter, they were charged with murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision on 29 November 2002 convicting appellant and Petronilla of murder. It held that appellant and Petronilla conspired in killing Ramon. It also ruled that Ramon's killing was attended by the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and nocturnity. In conclusion, it imposed the death penalty on appellant while Petronilla was merely sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> "owing to her being a mother and her lesser degree of participation in the killing of Ramon." The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, based on the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense and finding both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER attended by the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and nocturnity without being offset by any mitigating circumstances, the accused Angelo Zeta is hereby sentenced to death by lethal injection. The wife and co-accused Petronilla Zeta, although a co-conspirator in the commission of the offense charged, is hereby sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA owing to her being a mother and her lesser degree of participation in the act of murder.<br><br>The accused Angelo Zeta and Petronilla Zeta are also sentenced to indemnify in SOLIDUM the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 for the death of Ramon Garcia; P146,000.00 for the hospital and burial expenses; and P1,642,440.00 for the lost income of the deceased reckoned at 10 years of productive life, plus costs.<br><br>The .45 caliber Llama pistol with Serial Number C-27854 is confiscated in favor of the Government to be kept by the Philippine National Police as mandated by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>On 9 December 2002, the RTC issued an Order forwarding the records of the instant case to Us for automatic review because of the death penalty imposed on appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On 24 December 2002, Petronilla filed a Notice of Appeal with the RTC stating that she would appeal her conviction to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On 28 April 2004, Petronilla, through counsel, filed a Motion to Withdraw Appeal before us<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> stating that:<br><blockquote>After a thorough review of the available stenographic notes obtained by the close relatives of the accused-appellant from the Regional Trial Court, the undersigned counsel found out that there are no testimonial and/or documentary evidence presented before the lower Trial Court that could sufficiently serve as justifiable basis to warrant the reversal of the appealed decision rendered insofar as PETRONILLA ZETA is concerned.<br><br>Moreover, the undersigned counsel sustained serious physical injuries that render difficult to further handle the appeal that will require lengthy preparation of appellant's brief and other legal pleadings as may be required under the Rules of Court.<br><br>Consequently, after discussion with accused-appellant PETRONILLA ZETA, the undersigned counsel informed her that he is now constrained to withdraw his appearance in the above-entitled appealed case.<br><br>Upon being informed of the health predicament of the undersigned counsel and after being enlightened about the weakness of the appeal, accused-appellant PETRONILLA ZETA willfully and voluntarily decided to WITHDRAW the appeal and do hereby signify to the Honorable Court that she is no longer interested in the further prosecution of her appeal. She, likewise, has no objection to the withdrawal of the appearance of Atty. Alfredo E. Anasco, as her counsel in the above-entitled case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the above-entitled appeal be ordered withdrawn and the MOTION TO WITHDRAW APPEAL be GRANTED, and the withdrawal of appearance of counsel be given due course.</blockquote>On 28 September 2004, we issued a Resolution granting Petronilla's motion to withdraw appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On 22 November 2005, we issued a Resolution remanding the instant case to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On 30 June 2006, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision affirming <i>in toto</i> the Decision of the RTC. Thus:<br><blockquote>Thus, after finding that the trial court's conclusions are supported by the evidence presented and in full accord with existing law and jurisprudence, We find no reason to set it aside.<br><br>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED. The November 29, 2002 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 88 in Criminal Case No. Q-95-63787 is AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>Appellant elevated the present case before us on the following grounds:<br><br><center>I.</center><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES DID NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFY HIM;<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE OF DENIAL AND ALIBI INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT;<br><br><center>III.</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS GUILT WAS UNDER A SHADOW OF DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><i>Apropos</i> the first issue, appellant claims that although Edwin and Rey positively identified Petronilla as the one who asked them about Ramon and his address shortly before the incident occurred, the two, nevertheless, failed to identify appellant as Petronilla's companion during the said questioning. He also argues that Aleine's testimony identifying him as the one who shot Ramon during the incident is not morally certain because Aleine narrated that she saw only the side portion of his face and the color of the shirt he wore during the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It appears that Edwin and Rey did not actually see appellant shoot Ramon during the incident. Nonetheless, Aleine saw appellant shoot Ramon on that fateful night. Her positive identification of appellant and direct account of the shooting incident is clear, thus:<br><br><table width="100%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">ATTY.

as in the case of Aleine, is sufficient to support a conviction even in the charge of murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Appellant's argument that Aleine's testimony identifying him as the one who shot Ramon is not morally certain because she saw only the side portion of his face and the color of the shirt he wore during the incident, deserves scant consideration. A person can still be properly identified and recognized even by merely looking at the side portion of his face. To be sure, Aleine recognized and identified appellant in the police line-up and during trial as the one who shot Ramon. Experience dictates that precisely because of the unusual acts of violence committed right before their eyes, witnesses can remember with a high degree of reliability the identity of criminals at any given time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> A startling or frightful experience creates an indelible impression in the mind that can be recalled vividly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It bears stressing that Aleine was less than one meter away from appellant when the latter shot Ramon. The crime scene was also well-lighted during the incident because there was a fluorescent bulb inside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The testimonies of Aleine and of the other prosecution witnesses are in harmony with the documentary and object evidence submitted by the prosecution. The RTC and the Court of Appeals found their testimonies to be credible and trustworthy. The rule is that the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings are accorded respect if not conclusive effect. This is more true if such findings were affirmed by the appellate court. When the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Anent the second and third issues, appellant contends that his conviction is unwarranted based on the following reasons: (1) the prosecution failed to establish any possible motive for the appellant to kill Ramon; (2) there is an inconsistency in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses regarding the type and color of the car boarded by appellant and Petronilla before and after the incident. Edwin testified that appellant and Petronilla left the scene on board a <b>gold-colored Mitsubishi Lancer</b>; while SPO2 Magundacan narrated that he apprehended appellant while the latter was about to board a <b>blue Toyota Corona Macho</b>; (3) Jose could have been the one who fatally shot Ramon and appellant could have been mistakenly identified as Jose because they have the same physical appearance and facial features; (4) if appellant was indeed the one who shot Ramon, he could have immediately confessed such crime to the police just like what he did after killing Jose; and (5) there is no proof that appellant is the husband of a certain "Mely." Ramon's dying declaration to Aleine was that it was the husband of "Mely," his former neighbor in Las Pinas, who shot him. Further, Petronilla's nickname could either be "Nellie" or "Nelia" and not "Mely" as referred to by Ramon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and the participation of the accused in the crime are definitely shown, particularly when we consider that it is a matter of judicial knowledge that persons have killed or committed serious offenses for no reason at all. Motive gains importance only when the identity of the culprit is doubtful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Where a reliable eyewitness has fully and satisfactorily identified the accused as the perpetrator of the felony, motive becomes immaterial to the successful prosecution of a criminal case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is obvious from the records that Aleine positively and categorically identified appellant as the person who shot Ramon during the incident. Her testimony was corroborated on relevant points by Edwin and Rey.<br><br>There is no inconsistency in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses regarding the car boarded by appellant and Petronilla in leaving the crime scene and, subsequently, at the time they were apprehended. Edwin testified that appellant and Petronilla left the scene after the incident which was between 2:15 and 2:30 in the morning on board a <b>gold-colored Mitsubishi Lancer</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> SPO2 Magundacan told the court that he apprehended appellant at around 10:55 in the morning of the same day while the latter was about to board a <b>blue Toyota Corona Macho</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In his affidavit attached to the records, Jan Ryan Zeta, son of Jose, narrated that Jose was shot by appellant at about 4:00 in the morning of the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Appellant admitted that after shooting Jose on the early morning of 28 October 1995, he took the latter's Toyota Corona Macho and left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, it is probable that after leaving the crime scene at La Loma on board a gold Mitsubishi Lancer at about 2:15 or 2:30 in the morning, appellant and Petronilla then proceeded to Marikina and took Jose's blue Toyota Corona Macho. This explains why the car of appellant and Petronilla used in leaving the crime scene was different from that which they used at the time of their apprehension.<br><br>Appellant's theory of alibi that it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene in La Loma when the incident occurred because he was in Marikina, and that Jose could have been the one who fatally shot Ramon is flimsy and cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of Aleine. Appellant was mistakenly identified as Jose because they have the same physical appearance and facial feature. In addition, the empty bullet shells and slugs recovered from the crime scene were found to have the same characteristics as those of the bullets of appellant's caliber .45 Llama pistol. Further, there is no testimonial or documentary proof showing that it was Jose who shot Ramon. Appellant himself testified that he met Jose in the latter's house in Marikina at about 2:30 in the morning of 28 October 1995. On the other hand, the shooting of Ramon at La Loma, Quezon City occurred at about 2:15 in the morning of the same date. Hence, it was impossible for Jose to be at La Loma, Quezon City and to have shot Ramon at such time and place.<br><br>It is insignificant whether Petronilla was referred to by Ramon in his dying declaration as "Mely" or "Nellie." As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, Ramon sustained twelve gunshot wounds and was catching his breath when he uttered the name or nickname of Petronilla as the wife of appellant. Thus, understandably, he could not have spoken clearly in such a difficult situation. Moreover, Ramon referred to "Nellie" or "Mely" as his former neighbor in Las Piñas. Likewise, appellant and Petronilla admitted that Ramon was their former neighbor in Las Piñas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>We now go to the propriety of the penalty imposed and the damages awarded by the RTC which the Court of Appeals affirmed.<br><br>The RTC held that the killing of Ramon qualifies as murder because of the presence of the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and nighttime or nocturnity. It is a rule of evidence that aggravating circumstances must be proven as clearly as the crime itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Evident premeditation qualifies the killing of a person to murder if the following elements are present: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit clung to his resolve; and (3) a sufficient interval of time between the determination or conception and the execution of the crime to allow him to reflect upon the consequence of his act and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution of his will if he desired to hearken to its warning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The first two elements of evident premeditation are present in the case at bar.<br><br>The time manifesting Petronilla and appellant's determination to kill Ramon was when they, at about 2:00 in the morning of 28 October 1995, repeatedly asked Edwin about Ramon and the latter's address, and when they subsequently proceeded to the house of Ramon.<br><br>The fact that appellant and Petronilla waited for Ramon, and appellant's subsequent act of shooting him at around 2:15-2:30 in the morning of 28 October 1995 indicate that they had clung to their determination to kill Ramon.<br><br>The third element of evident premeditation, however, is lacking in the instant case. The span of thirty minutes or half an hour from the time appellant and Petronilla showed their determination to kill Ramon (2:00 in the morning of 28 October 1995) up to the time appellant shot to death Ramon (2:15-2:30 in the morning of 28 October 1995) could not have afforded them full opportunity for meditation and reflection on the consequences of the crime they committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> We have held that the lapse of thirty minutes between the determination to commit a crime and the execution thereof is insufficient for a full meditation on the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The essence of premeditation is that the execution of the criminal act must be preceded by cool thought and reflection on the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment. To justify the inference of deliberate premeditation, there must be a period sufficient in a judicial sense to afford full opportunity for meditation and reflection and to allow the conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will if he desires to hearken to its warning. Where no sufficient lapse of time is appreciable from the determination to commit the crime until its execution, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, we find that treachery attended the killing of Ramon.<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against a person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from any defensive or retaliatory act which the victim might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The essence of treachery is a deliberate and sudden attack that renders the victim unable and unprepared to defend himself by reason of the suddenness and severity of the attack. Two essential elements are required in order that treachery can be appreciated: (1) the employment of means, methods or manner of execution that would ensure the offender's safety from any retaliatory act on the part of the offended party who has, thus, no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation; and (2) a deliberate or conscious choice of means, methods or manner of execution. Further, this aggravating circumstance must be alleged in the information and duly proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, treachery was alleged in the information and all its elements were duly established by the prosecution.<br><br>It has been established that Ramon, still groggy after having been awakened by Aleine, was walking down the stairs when appellant suddenly shot him. The suddenness and unexpectedness of the appellant's attack rendered Ramon defenseless and without means of escape. Appellant admitted that he was a member of a gun club and was proficient in using his caliber .45 Llama pistol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In fact, he was good at shooting a moving target during his practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> He also stated that he owned five firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Evidently, appellant took advantage of his experience and skill in practice shooting and in guns to exact the death of Ramon. There is no doubt that appellant's use of a caliber .45 Llama pistol, as well as his act of positioning himself in a shooting stance and of shooting Ramon several times on the chest area and on other parts of body, were obviously adopted by him to prevent Ramon from retaliating or escaping. Considering that Ramon was unarmed, groggy from sleep, and was casually walking down narrow stairs unmindful of the danger that lurked behind, there was absolutely no way for him to defend himself or escape.<br><br>As regards the appreciation by the RTC of the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, it should be underscored that nocturnity or nighttime is, by and of itself, not an aggravating circumstance. It becomes so only when (1) it was especially sought by the offender; or (2) it was taken advantage of by him; or (3) it facilitated the commission of the crime by ensuring the offender's immunity from capture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Although the crime in the instant case was committed between 2:15 and 2:30 in the morning, no evidence was presented showing that nighttime was especially and purposely sought by appellant to facilitate the commission of the crime, or that it was availed of for the purpose of impunity. Moreover, the crime scene was well-lighted by a fluorescent bulb. We have held that nocturnity is not aggravating where the place of the commission of the crime was well-illuminated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Even if we were to assume that nocturnity was present in the case at bar, this cannot still be appreciated in view of the presence of treachery that attended the killing of Ramon. Nighttime cannot be considered an aggravating circumstance separate from treachery, since nighttime is absorbed in treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the death penalty imposed by the RTC on appellant should be modified. Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code states that murder is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Article 63 of the same Code provides that if the penalty is composed of two indivisible penalties, as in the instant case, and there are no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the lesser penalty shall be applied. Since there is no mitigating or aggravating circumstance in the instant case, and treachery cannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance as it was already considered as a qualifying circumstance, the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> should be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The award of damages and its corresponding amount rendered by the RTC should also be modified in line with current jurisprudence.<br><br>In addition to the civil indemnity of P50,000.00 for Ramon's death, the award of moral damages amounting to P50,000.00 is also proper since it is mandatory in murder cases, without need of proof and allegation other than the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The heirs of Ramon are also entitled to exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00, since the qualifying circumstance of treachery was firmly established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The amount of actual damages should be reduced from P146,000.00 to P115,473.00 per computation of the official receipts attached to the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The heirs of Ramon should also be indemnified for loss of earning capacity pursuant to Article 2206 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Consistent with our previous decisions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the formula for the indemnification of loss of earning capacity is:<br><br>Net Earning Capacity = Life Expectancy x Gross Annual Income (GAI) - Living Expenses<br><br>= 2/3 (80 - age of deceased) x (GAI - 50% of GAI).<br><br>Ramon's death certificate states that he was 37 years old at the time of his demise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> A certification from Ramon's employer, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, shows that Ramon was earning an annual gross income of P164,244.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Applying the above-stated formula, the indemnity for the loss of earning capacity of Ramon is P2,354,163.99, computed as follows:<br><br>Net Earning Capacity = 2/3 (43) x (P164,244.00 - P82,122.00)<br><br>= 28.66 x P82,122.00<br><br>= P2,354,163.99<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, after due deliberation, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 June 2006 in CA-G.R.
