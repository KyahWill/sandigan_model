				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The controversy between the parties started in August 1999 when respondent Chinatrust (Phils.) Commercial Bank Corporation (Chinatrust) demanded from the petitioners the payment of their outstanding loan totaling P89,426,732.29,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and, on account of the latter's failure to pay, extra-judicially foreclosed the mortgaged real property and its improvements under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 18718.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> To keep the respondent notary public from carrying out the public auction sale of the subject property, petitioners instituted Civil Case No. 67620 for injunction, specific performance, and damages, with prayer for the issuance of an injunctive relief, before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 67.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In its September 28, 1999 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the trial court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing the respondents from selling the property. It later issued a writ of preliminary injunction on October 15, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Several months after respondent Chinatrust filed its December 9, 1999 Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the trial court, on motion of the respondent, dismissed the complaint, on June 26, 2000, for petitioners' failure to prosecute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, it issued the August 21, 2000 Clarificatory Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> stating that, with the dismissal of the case, the writ of preliminary injunction earlier issued had been automatically dissolved. The trial court, in its November 23, 2000 Omnibus Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> further denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners, on December 4, 2000, filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> questioning the June 26, 2000 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the August 21, 2000 Clarificatory Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and the November 23, 2000 Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the RTC. Their appeal was consequently docketed as <b>CA-G.R. CV No. 69892</b> with the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>On January 28, 2001, petitioners also filed with the CA, a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and mandamus assailing the same Orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the trial court. This was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 62915</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Later, the appellate court, in the assailed June 22, 2001 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dismissed for lack of merit the petition for extraordinary writ in CA-G.R. SP No. 62915.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It also denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration in the further challenged September 5, 2001 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, on August 30, 2001, respondent Chailease Finance Corporation, the highest bidder in the auction sale, registered in its name the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, on May 16, 2002, the CA, in CA-G.R. CV No. 69892, rendered the challenged Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dismissing petitioners' appeal for forum shopping and for the absence in the appellants' brief of page references to the record as required in Section 13(c) and (d) of Rule 44 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The appellate court, on August 23, 2002, in the further assailed Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Rejected repeatedly by the appellate court, petitioners instituted two petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> before us: (1) <b>G.R. No. 149984</b> questioning the June 22, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and the September 5, 2001 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 62915; and (2) <b>G.R. No.</b> <b>154991</b> assailing the May 16, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and the August 23, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 69892. On December 2, 2002, we resolved to consolidate the two petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The petitions are denied. The present controversy is on all fours with <i>Young v. Sy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in which we ruled that the successive filing of a notice of appeal and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> both to assail the trial court's dismissal order for non-suit constitutes forum shopping. Thus,<br><blockquote>Forum shopping consists of filing multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment.<br><br>There is forum shopping where there exist:  (a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the pending case, regardless of which party is successful would amount to res judicata.<br><br>Ineluctably, the petitioner, by filing an ordinary appeal and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA, engaged in forum shopping.  When the petitioner commenced the appeal, only four months had elapsed prior to her filing with the CA the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 and which eventually came up to this Court by way of the instant Petition (re: Non-Suit). The elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present between the two suits.  As the CA, through its Thirteenth Division, correctly noted, both suits are founded on exactly the same facts and refer to the same subject matter--the RTC Orders which dismissed Civil Case No. SP-5703 (2000) for failure to prosecute. In both cases, the petitioner is seeking the reversal of the RTC orders.  The parties, the rights asserted, the issues professed, and the reliefs prayed for, are all the same.  It is evident that the judgment of one forum may amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The remedies of appeal and <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 are mutually exclusive and not alternative or cumulative. This is a firm judicial policy. The petitioner cannot hedge her case by wagering two or more appeals, and, in the event that the ordinary appeal lags significantly behind the others, she cannot <i>post facto</i> validate this circumstance as a demonstration that the ordinary appeal had not been speedy or adequate enough, in order to justify the recourse to Rule 65.  This practice, if adopted, would sanction the filing of multiple suits in multiple <i>fora</i>, where each one, as the petitioner couches it, becomes a "precautionary measure" for the rest, thereby increasing the chances of a favorable decision.  This is the very evil that the proscription on forum shopping seeks to put right. In <i>Guaranteed Hotels, Inc. v. Baltao</i>, the Court stated that the grave evil sought to be avoided by the rule against forum shopping is the rendition by two competent tribunals of two separate and contradictory decisions.  Unscrupulous party litigants, taking advantage of a variety of competent tribunals, may repeatedly try their luck in several different <i>fora</i> until a favorable result is reached. To avoid the resultant confusion, the Court adheres strictly to the rules against forum shopping, and any violation of these rules results in the dismissal of the case.<br><br>Thus, the CA correctly dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and the petition for review (G.R. No. 157745) filed with this Court must be denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>We also made the same ruling in <i>Candido v. Camacho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> when the respondent therein assailed identical court orders through both an appeal and a petition for an extraordinary writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioners questioned the June 26, 2000 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the August 21, 2000 Clarificatory Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and the November 23, 2000 Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of the RTC via ordinary appeal (CA-G.R. CV No. 69892) and through a petition for <i>certiorari </i>(CA-G.R. SP No. 62915) in different divisions of the same court. The actions were filed with a month's interval from each one. Certainly, petitioners were seeking to obtain the same relief in two different divisions with the end in view of endorsing whichever proceeding would yield favorable consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, following settled jurisprudence, both the appeal and the <i>certiorari</i> petitions should be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> are <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez,&nbsp; Chico-Nazario, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Reyes, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
