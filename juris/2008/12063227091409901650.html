				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to annul and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated February 13, 1997 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA- G.R. SP No. 34359, as well as its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 30, 1999, denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration. The questioned decision lifted the orders of preventive suspension issued by petitioner Governor Democrito O. Plaza against private respondents. The appellate court then ordered the reinstatement of private respondents to their former positions with right to backwages but without prejudice to the continuation of the administrative proceedings against them.<br><br>The relevant facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>A few months after his assumption as Governor of Agusan del Sur in 1992, petitioner Democrito O. Plaza received separate administrative complaints against the following:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; <b>Gil Pol Tan</b>, Provincial Budget Officer, on the ensuing grounds:<br><blockquote><ol><li>For having drawn cash advance out of the Local Government Funds (General Funds) of the Provincial Government of Agusan del Sur amounting to <u>ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND (P117,935.00) PESOS ONLY</u> for allege [<i>sic</i>] <u>OPERATIONAL EXPENSES</u> of the Provincial Government of Agusan del Sur barely three (3) days before the May 11, 1992 synchronized elections, without passing the same to pre-audit as one of the requirements under Commission on Audit Circular No. 86-257 which states among others “<u>ALL CASH ADVANCES</u>, except those granted for the payment of salaries and wages of officers or employees, <u>shall be pre-audited.</u>”<br><br></li><li>For making again a cash advance <u>in an increasing</u> amount to liquidate his <u>previous</u> cash advance, which is a clear violation again of COA Circular No. 86-257 which states among others “A cash advance for miscellaneous expenses shall be reported on and liquidated as soon as, but not later than thirty (30) days after, the purpose of which it was served” and “<u>No cash advance shall be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous cash advance given to him is first settled</u> or a proper accounting thereof is made for the full amount of the cash advance” and “<u>No cash advance shall be granted for the purpose of liquidating a previous cash advance.</u>”<br><br></li><li>For making cash advances <u>beyond his approved cash bond</u>, again, a violation to COA Memorandum Circular No. 86-257 which states that “No Officer and employee shall be granted a cash advance unless he is properly bonded in accordance with law or regulations. The amount of cash advance which may be granted shall not exceed the maximum amount covered by his bond.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>(b)&nbsp; <b>Emmanuel S.

Tan allegedly committed a conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Gilsano was charged with neglect in the performance of duty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and Quismundo was allegedly liable for technical malversation, an act prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Private respondents were required to answer in writing under oath within 72 hours from receipt together with the affidavits of their witnesses, if any, and to state whether they would opt for a formal investigation or would waive such right.<br><br>Instead of filing their answers, private respondents filed separate Motions to Inhibit/Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> seeking to inhibit Samson on the ground that he had no authority under the law to conduct the administrative investigations because his appointment as Provincial Legal Officer had not been acted upon by the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Agusan del Sur, which concurrence is of utmost necessity to confer upon his appointment by the Provincial Governor the imprimatur of legality and validity. Another issue raised by private respondents was that they could not expect to be given due process and the cold neutrality of an impartial committee.<br><br>On October 26, 1992, Samson issued an Omnibus Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> denying private respondents’ motions to dismiss/inhibit. The <i>fallo</i> of the order reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Motions to Dismiss/Inhibit filed by the respondents is hereby DENIED.<br><br>Respondents however, is [<i>sic</i>] given an extension of time of five (5) days after receipt of this order to file their Answer under oath not Motion for Reconsideration.

PLAZA (Sgd.)<br>Provincial Governor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>On January 18, 1993, the RTC issued a writ of preliminary injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> “to temporarily stop the administrative fact finding until after the principal action shall have been resolved.”<br><br>A motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the RTC order dated January 18, 1993 was filed by private respondents arguing that the act of imposing a preventive suspension had become a <i>fait accompli</i> since the 60-day period from November 9, 1992, private respondents’ receipt of the orders of preventive suspension, had already elapsed. They prayed for the nullification of the orders of preventive suspension and the lifting of the legal effects of the Memorandum dated January 5, 1993. This was denied by the trial court in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated March 15, 1993.<br><br>Meantime, Resolution No. 11, Series of 1993<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> was issued by the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Agusan del Sur on February 11, 1993 reiterating the rejection of the appointment of Samson as Provincial Legal Officer of the province for lack of the required 5-year law practice.<br><br>On June 18, 1993, the trial court dismissed the petition, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, this Petition is, as it is hereby ordered DISMISSED for having been filed prematurely and precipitately.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC reasoned that private respondents failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies since the proper forum to decide the dispute is the Civil Service Commission (CSC) pursuant to Section 87 of R.A. No. 7160.<br><br>The trial court later denied private respondents’ motion for reconsideration in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated November 19, 1993.<br><br>Feeling aggrieved, private respondents immediately filed a notice of appeal to the CA. The appeal was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 34359</b> by the appellate court. In their Memorandum filed before the CA, private respondents raised the lone assignment of error that the controversy falls within the well-settled exceptions to the principle of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies.<br><br>On February 13, 1997, the appellate court in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 34359</b> rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is SET ASIDE and in lieu thereof, judgment is rendered lifting the orders of preventive suspension issued by then Gov. Democrito Plaza against appellants. Appellants are reinstated to their previous positions with right to backwages but without prejudice to the continuation of the administrative proceedings against them.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA opined that Samson’s authority as chairman of the PIC is not invalidated by the lack of concurrence of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> in his appointment as the Provincial Legal Officer. Moreover, the preventive suspension of private respondents may be ordered even without a hearing as such suspension is not a penalty but only a preliminary step in an administrative investigation. It likewise ruled that the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition before the RTC was not a delay which would interrupt the running of the period of preventive suspension. Lastly, the CA pronounced that to sanction preventive suspension pending resolution of an administrative case is equivalent to indefinite suspension which the Constitution prohibits.<br><br>On March 30, 1999, the CA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> for lack of merit the motion for reconsideration filed by private respondents.<br><br>Meanwhile, a series of events occurred during the pendency of the appeal and even after the promulgation of the appellate court’s decision. On August 5, 1993, the members of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Agusan del Sur discovered the existence of CSC Resolution No. 93-1765 dated May 17, 1993, designating petitioner Fe Tan-Cebrian as substitute Provincial Government Department Head of the Office of the Provincial Planning and Development Coordinator. The members of the <i>sanggunian</i> then filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> before the CSC seeking to set aside the aforesaid resolution and to order the immediate reinstatement of Quismundo and the payment of his backwages. Similar petitions were also filed by the members of the <i>sanggunian</i> praying for the immediate reinstatement of private respondents Tan and Gilsano with payment of back salaries.<br><br>On January 28, 1997, the CSC issued Resolution No. 970686<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> directing the incumbent Governor of Agusan del Sur to immediately reinstate private respondents to their former positions without prejudice to the continuance of the administrative cases against them. A motion for reconsideration was filed by the Governor of Agusan del Sur but the same was denied in CSC Resolution No. 974065<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28] </sup> dated October 14, 1997.<br><br>Undaunted, the provincial governor filed before the CA a petition for review with temporary restraining order and injunction docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 46650</b> praying that an order be issued enjoining the CSC from implementing Resolutions Nos. 970686 and 974065.<br><br>By virtue of CSC Resolution No. 974065, private respondents wrote<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the incumbent governor informing the latter that they are assuming office on December 1, 1997.

It is likewise their contention that the undue delay in the investigation of private respondents was caused by them and shall be deducted from the period of their suspension as provided in Section 85(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of R.A. No. 7160. In addition, petitioners explain that Section 88 of R.A. No. 7160 provides that a suspended respondent is entitled to all the rights and privileges appurtenant to his position only when he is exonerated.<br><br>In their Amended Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> filed on September 16, 1999, and subsequently in the Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> filed on May 2, 2000, petitioners argue that the only pertinent issue to be resolved is whether or not the CA’s <i><u>award of backwages</u></i> is in accordance with law and the applicable jurisprudence because of the following developments:<br><blockquote><ol><li><u>On July 26, 1999, petitioner Governor Valentina G. Plaza through Provincial Administrator Dante Luz Viacrucis sent respondents a letter, certified copy attached as Annex “M”, stating that “pursuant to the Resolution of the Civil Service Commission, you are again hereby enjoined to report for work not later than August 2, 1999.”</u><br><br></li><li><u>On August 2, 1999, respondents complied by reporting for work, formally notifying the Governor that “in compliance to your Memorandum dated July 26, 1999, we are respectfully informing you that we, the undersigned, are assuming the duties and responsibilities of our respective offices today, August 2, 1999.” A copy of said letter is hereto attached as Annex “N”.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Similarly, the appellate court issued, on November 26, 1999, a Decision in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 46650</b>, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, finding herein petition to be meritorious, the Resolution No. 97-0686 of the Civil Service Commission, dated January 28, 1997 is hereby SET ASIDE and a new one is entered as follows:<br><ol><li>Ordering that the counting of the sixty (60) day preventive suspension of the private respondents Elisa O. Gilsano, Gil Pol Tan and Emmanuel Quizmundo [<i>sic</i>] shall start from the day the decision of the Court of Appeals on [<i>sic</i>] CA-G.R. SP No. 34359 dated June 6, 1991 [<i>sic</i>] have become final and executory.<br><br></li><li>Ordering further, thereafter, that suspension of the said employees shall be lifted and the incumbent Provincial Governor is directed to reinstate the above mentioned private respondents to their former positions as Provincial Accountant, Provincial Budget Officer, and Provincial Planning and Development Coordinator, respectively, without prejudice to the continuance of the administrative cases against them.<br></li></ol>No pronouncement as to cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>As correctly raised by the petitioners, the only remaining issues to be determined by the Court are whether the private respondents are entitled to backwages during the entire period of their suspension and, concomitantly, whether the CA erred in ruling that the preventive suspension was unjustified. The other issues, as conceded by the parties, have become moot and academic in view of the actual reinstatement of private respondents last August 2, 1999.<br><br>The Court rules that private respondents’ claim for back salaries is untenable because their suspension was authorized by law and they have not been absolved of the administrative charges filed against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38] </sup> In <i>Gloria v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court had the occasion to clarify that the payment of salaries corresponding to the period when an employee is not allowed to work may be decreed if he is found <b>innocent</b> of the charges which caused his suspension <b>and</b> when the suspension is <b>unjustified</b>.<br><br>Stated otherwise, the preventive suspension of the private respondents is authorized by R.A. No. 7160. Section 85 (a) of the LGC of 1991 states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 85. <i>Preventive Suspension of Appointive Local Officials and Employees.</i> — (a) The local chief executives may preventively suspend for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days any subordinate official or employee under his authority pending investigation if the charge against such official or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty, or if there is reason to believe that the respondent is guilty of the charges which would warrant his removal from the service.<br></blockquote>Clearly, the law provides for the preventive suspension of appointive local officials and employees pending investigation of the charges against them. The suspension given to private respondents cannot, therefore, be considered unjustified for it is one of those sacrifices which holding a public office requires for the public good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup> To be entitled to back salaries, private respondents must not only be found innocent of the charges, but their suspension must likewise be unjustified.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 13, 1997 in CA-G.R.
