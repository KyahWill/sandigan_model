Moreover, written contracts such as the documents executed by the parties in the present case, are presumed to have been entered into for a sufficient consideration.&nbsp; (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote>In the aforecited case — as in the present case — the bank presented the testimony of its account officer who processed the loan application, but the Court discarded her testimony for it did not detail how the corporation induced or deceived the bank into granting the loans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Also <i>apropos</i> is <i>Ng Wee v</i><i>. </i><i>Tankiansee</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> where the appellate court was questioned for discharging a writ of preliminary attachment to the extent that it affected the properties of respondent Tankiansee, a corporate officer of Wincorp, both defendants in the complaint for damages which petitioner Ng Wee had filed with the trial court.&nbsp; In holding that the appellate court correctly spared respondent Tankiansee from the writ of preliminary attachment, the Court cited the following basis:<br><blockquote>In the instant case, petitioner's October 12, 2000 Affidavit is bereft of any factual statement that respondent committed a fraud. The affidavit narrated only the alleged fraudulent transaction between Wincorp and Virata and/or Power Merge, which, by the way, explains why this Court, in G.R. No. 162928, affirmed the writ of attachment issued against the latter.<b><i> As to the participation of respondent in the said transaction, the affidavit merely states that respondent, an officer and director of Wincorp, connived with the other defendants in the civil case to defraud petitioner of his money placements. No other factual averment or circumstance details how respondent committed a fraud or how he connived with the other defendants to commit a fraud in the transaction sued upon. In other words, petitioner has not shown any specific act or deed to support the allegation that respondent is guilty of fraud. </i></b><br><br>The affidavit, being the foundation of the writ, must contain such particulars as to how the fraud imputed to respondent was committed for the court to decide whether or not to issue the writ. Absent any statement of other factual circumstances to show that respondent, at the time of contracting the obligation, had a preconceived plan or intention not to pay, or without any showing of how respondent committed the alleged fraud, the general averment in the affidavit that respondent is an officer and director of Wincorp who allegedly connived with the other defendants to commit a fraud, is insufficient to support the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment x x x. <b><i>Verily, the mere fact that respondent is an officer and director of the company does not necessarily give rise to the inference that he committed a fraud or that he connived with the other defendants to commit a fraud. While under certain circumstances, courts may treat a corporation as a mere aggroupment of persons, to whom liability will directly attach, this is only done when the wrongdoing has been clearly and convincingly established</i></b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Indeed,&nbsp; a writ of preliminary attachment is too harsh a provisional remedy to<br><br>be issued based on mere abstractions of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Rather, the rules require that for the writ to issue, there must be a recitation of clear and concrete factual circumstances manifesting that the debtor practiced fraud upon the creditor at the time of the execution of their agreement in that said debtor had a pre-conceived plan or intention not to pay the creditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Being a state of mind, fraud cannot be merely inferred from a bare allegation of non-payment of debt or non-performance of obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>As shown in <i>Ng Wee</i>, the requirement becomes all the more stringent when the application for preliminary attachment is directed against a defendant officer of a defendant corporation, for it will not be inferred from the affiliation of one to the other that the officer participated in or facilitated in any fraudulent practice attributed to the corporation.&nbsp; There must be evidence clear and convincing that the officer committed a fraud or connived with the corporation to commit a fraud; only then may the properties of said officer, along with those of the corporation, be held under a writ of preliminary attachment.<br><br>There is every reason to extend the foregoing rule, by analogy, to a mere surety of the defendant.&nbsp; A surety's involvement is marginal to the principal agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff; hence, in order for the surety to be subject to a proceeding for issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment, it must be shown that said surety participated in or facilitated the fraudulent practice of the defendant, such as by offering a security solely to induce the plaintiff to enter into the agreement with the defendant.<br><br>There is neither allegation nor innuendo in the Complaint of respondent or the Affidavit of Elumbaring that petitioners as sureties or officers of Foremost participated in or facilitated the commission of fraud by Foremost, et al. against respondent.&nbsp; In fact, there is no mention of petitioners, much less a recital of their role or influence in the execution of the loan agreements.&nbsp; The RTC cited an allegation that petitioners are disposing/concealing their properties with intent to defraud respondent, but there is no hint of such scheme in the five paragraphs of the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> or in the four corners of the Affidavit of <span>Elumbaring.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; All that is alleged is that Foremost obtained loans from respondent but failed to pay the same, but as the Court has repeatedly held, no fraud can be inferred from a mere failure to pay a loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In fine, there was no factual basis for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment against the properties of petitioners.&nbsp; The immediate dissolution of the writ is called for.<br><br>In so ruling, however, the Court does not go so far as to grant petitioners' claim for moral damages.&nbsp; A wrongful attachment may give rise to liability for moral damages but evidence must be adduced not only of the torment and humiliation brought upon the defendant by the attaching party but also of the latter's bad faith or malice in causing the wrongful attachment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> such as evidence that the latter deliberately made false statements in its application for attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup>Absent such evidence of malice, the attaching party cannot be held liable for moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioners cite the allegations made by respondent in its application for attachment as evidence of bad faith.&nbsp; However, the allegations in question contain nothing but the stark truth that Foremost obtained loans and that it failed to pay.&nbsp; The Court fails to see any malice in such bare allegations as would make respondent liable to petitioners for moral damages.<br><br>To recapitulate, the Court partly dissolves the writ of preliminary attachment for having wrongfully issued against the properties of petitioners who were not shown to have committed fraud in the execution of the loan agreements between Foremost and respondent, but declines to award moral damages to petitioners in the absence of evidence that respondent acted with malice in causing the wrongful issuance of the writ.<br><br>The second issue involves that portion of the August 3, 2001 RTC Decision awarding respondent "(7) US $379,000.00, plus 9.5% interest per annum from 12 February 1997 to 8 December 1997, 11.4% interest per annum from 9 December 1997 until fully paid, and 1% penalty per month on the amount due from maturity date until fully paid" under Promissory Note No. 0051-97-03696, and "(8) P7,582,945.85, plus 28.5% interest per annum, and 3% penalty per month, from the foreclosure sale on 10 August 1998 until fully paid" under Promissory Note No. 0051-97-03688.<br><br>Petitioners argue that respondent is barred from claiming any amount under the Promissory Notes, Exhibits "G" and "H", because it had already elected to foreclose on the mortgage security, and it failed to allege in its pleadings that a deficiency remained after the public auction sale of the securities and that what it is seeking is the payment of such deficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>There is no question that a mortgage creditor has a single cause of action against a mortgagor debtor, which is to recover the debt; but it has the option of either filing a personal action for collection of sum of money or instituting a real action to foreclose on the mortgage security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; An election of the first bars recourse to the second; otherwise, there would be multiplicity of suits in which the debtor would be tossed from one venue to another, depending on the location of the mortgaged properties and the residence of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, a creditor who elects to foreclose on the mortgage may yet file an independent civil action for recovery of whatever deficiency may remain in the outstanding obligation of the debtor, after deducting the price obtained in the sale of the mortgaged properties at public auction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]&nbsp; </sup>The complaint, though, must specifically allege that what is being sought is the recovery of the deficiency,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> or that in the pre-trial, such claim be raised as an issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioners' argument, it is clear from the allegations in the Complaint that what respondent sought was the payment of the deficiency amount under the subject promissory notes.&nbsp; In particular, while the Promissory Note, Exhibit "H", is for the amount of Php16,500,000.00, what respondent sought to recover was only Php7,582,945.85, consistent with the fact that part of said promissory note has been satisfied from the proceeds of the extra-judicial foreclosure. While the exact phrase "deficiency account" is not employed in the Complaint, the intention of respondent to recover the same is borne out by its allegations.<br><br>More importantly, in the Pre-trial Order issued by the RTC, the right of respondent to recover the deficiency account under the subject promissory notes was raised as a specific issue.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY</b> <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The June 15, 2004 Decision<sup> </sup>of the Court of Appeals is <b>MODIFIED</b> to the effect that the November 3, 1998 Writ of Preliminary Attachment is <b>LIFTED</b> and <b>DISSOLVED</b> insofar as it affects the properties of petitioners Spouses Santiago and Rufina Tanchan.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Chico-Nazario, Nachura,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Mariano C. del Castillo, and concurred in by Associate Justices Roberto A.
