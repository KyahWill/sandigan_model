				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AZCUNA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This administrative case stemmed from the verified Letter-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of Mary Ann Estoque against Reynaldo O. Girado, Sheriff IV of Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, Davao City, for dereliction of duty in connection with the latter’s alleged unreasonable failure and refusal to implement the writ of execution in Civil Case No. 23-242-94 entitled <i>“Marcela A. Estoque et al. v. Apo View Hotel, et al.”</i><br><div align="justify"><br>In the letter-complaint received by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) on April 3, 2006, complainant Estoque averred:<br><blockquote>I am one of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 23,248-94, entitled “MARCELA A.

RTC 33 granted the said motion in its order dated April 14, 2000, and an alias writ of execution was issued on July 7, 2000.<br><br>My complaint is about the unreasonable failure and refusal of the sheriff assigned at RTC 33 in the person of <span style="font-weight: bold;">SHERIFF REYNALDO O.

Once the writ is placed in his hands, it is his duty, unless restrained by the court, to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to properly execute it according to its mandate, ensuring at all times that the enforcement of a judgment is not unduly delayed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Thus, a sheriff should know by heart his order to make a return of the writ of execution to the clerk/judge issuing it or if the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within 30 days after his receipt of the writ, to report to the court and state the reason/s therefor. In the latter case, he is further tasked to make a report to the court every 30 days on the proceedings followed until the judgment is satisfied in full or its effectivity expires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The submission of the return and periodic reports by the sheriffs is not a duty that must be taken lightly. It serves to update the court as to the status of the execution and to give it an idea as to why the judgment was not satisfied. It also provides insights for the court as to how efficient court processes are after judgment has been promulgated. The overall purpose of the requirement is to ensure speedy execution of decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondent admittedly failed to implement the alias writ of execution issued on July 7, 2000, to submit a sheriff’s return on execution, and to make a monthly report as to the proceedings taken to satisfy in full what had been amicably settled by the parties. He would excuse himself by arguing that complainant Estoque already knew that defendant E.B. Villarosa &amp; Partner Co. Ltd. already ceased its operation when she was furnished a copy of the sheriff’s progress report on August 18, 1999 and that, in his “humble understanding,” he could not fully implement the alias writ due to such fact and since the whereabouts of its officers were totally unknown to him.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded. Good faith or lack of it in proceeding to execute the writ is inconsequential, for a sheriff is chargeable with the knowledge that being an officer of the court it behooves him to make compliance in due time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Hence, granting for argument’s sake that respondent indeed entertained an honest belief that enforcing the writ would only be a futile attempt, the rules still do not give him the prerogative not to implement the alias writ.<br><br>Moreover, respondent simply brushed aside and trivialized the orders issued by the trial court. From what appears on record, even the court was seemingly helpless to enjoin immediate compliance by respondent for he repeatedly refused, without any justification, to comply with its five directives, to wit: on February 1, 2001 (to submit his sheriff’s return of the alias writ of execution); on April 27, 2001 (to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt of court for continued failure to submit his sheriff’s return); on October 26, 2001 (to file his comment to the motion to cite him for contempt of court and to assign a substitute sheriff); on January 14, 2002 (to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt of court for failure to implement the alias writ of execution and to comply with the three previous court orders); and on June 15, 2004 (to submit his explanation why he should not be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the January 14, 2002 Order). Nothing was practically heard from respondent until this case was filed. His constant indifference on the matter belies his representation that he had not the slightest intention to disobey the court orders.<br><br>Under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> respondent is guilty of simple neglect of duty which is defined as the failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him and signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference. It is classified as a less grave offense which carries the penalty of suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense and dismissal for the second offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As it appears that respondent has not been previously administratively faulted and so as not to hamper the performance of the duties of his office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> instead of suspending him, he should be fined in an amount equivalent to his salary for one month.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Sheriff Reynaldo O.
