No. 00416 MIN dated 25 October 2006, affirming <i>in toto</i> the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Davao City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 17, in Criminal Cases No. 43,<b>381</b>-99 and No. 43,<b>382</b>-99, finding accused-appellant Hilario Tañesa Opong guilty of two counts of simple rape.<br><br>The factual antecedents are as follows:<br><br>On 23 June 1999, two separate informations were filed before the RTC charging appellant with rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 43, <b>381</b>-99</u><br><br>That on or about <b>May 2, 1999</b> in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with <b>AAA</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> who is fifteen (15) years of age against her will.<br><br><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 43, <b>382</b>-99</u><br><br>That on or about <b>May 9, 1999</b> in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with <b>AAA</b>, who is fifteen (15) years of age against her will. (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote>Subsequently, the cases were consolidated for joint trial. When arraigned on 26 November 1999, appellant, with the assistance of counsel <i>de oficio</i>, pleaded "Not guilty" to each of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses AAA, Dr. Danilo Ledesma (Dr. Ledesma), and PO2 Jocris Sarenas (PO2 Sarenas). Their testimonies, taken together, present the following narrative:<br><br>Sometime in the year 1999, AAA was employed as a stay-in housemaid by Philippine National Police (PNP) Senior Superintendent Palawan Macadingdang (Supt. Macadingdang) in the latter's family residence at Tagum City, Davao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 20 March 1999, per instruction of Mrs. Macadingdang (wife of Supt. Macadingdang), AAA went to Camp Catitipan, Panacan, Davao City, to serve as stay-in housemaid in the quarters of Supt. Macadingdang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 2 May 1999, at about 7:00 in the evening, AAA, then 15 years of age, was left alone in the quarters of Supt. Macadingdang since the latter was at Tagum City. She went out of the quarters and sat on a bench located outside the Senior Officers Quarters Building (SOQB). Appellant, then working as a grass-cutter in Camp Catitipan, approached her and asked for a glass of cold water. She agreed and told him to wait outside the SOQB. She entered the SOQB and proceeded inside her employer's quarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>While she was filling up a drinking glass with cold water inside the quarters, appellant suddenly barged in. She handed the glass of cold water to appellant who, instead of taking it, held her hands tightly. She shouted for help but appellant covered her mouth and told her to keep quiet otherwise he would kill her. Thereupon, appellant pushed her, causing her to fall on the cemented floor. She tried to resist appellant's advances by kicking and pushing him away, but she was overpowered. Appellant then forcibly removed her panty, put himself on top of her, and repeatedly inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt pain in her vagina. Later that same evening, appellant ravished her again. Appellant warned her not to tell anyone of the incident or he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Again, on 9 May 1999, at about 8:30 in the evening, she was left alone inside the quarters. After washing the dishes, she went out of the quarters. Seeing appellant roaming inside the SOQB, she hurriedly went back to the quarters and locked the door. After several minutes, and thinking that appellant might have already left the building, she opened the door of the quarters. Appellant, who was all the while waiting in front of the door of the quarters, forcibly entered the quarters and pushed her. She knelt and pleaded with him not to touch her but to no avail. Appellant removed her panty, placed himself on top of her, and inserted his penis into her vagina. Afterwards, appellant reiterated his threat to kill her if she would tell anyone of the incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 10 May 1999, Supt. Macadingdang arrived at the quarters but she did not inform him of the incidents because of her fear that appellant would make good his threats to kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 4 June 1999, Mrs. Macadingdang arrived and stayed at the quarters. As days passed by, Mrs. Macadingdang noticed that she was getting weak and was inefficient in her household tasks. Mrs. Macadingdang inquired from her if she had a problem. She cried and told Mrs. Macadingdang that she was raped by appellant. Subsequently, she and Mrs. Macadingdang relayed to Supt. Macadingdang the incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Supt. Macadingdang reported the incidents to the commander of Camp Catitipan, a certain Colonel Velasco. Thereafter, Police Officers Jocris Sarenas and Jesus Mayabason of the Buhangin Police Station, Davao City, arrived at Camp Catitipan and took AAA and appellant to the precinct for investigation. Thereupon, appellant was charged with raping AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Ledesma, Medico-Legal Officer IV of the Medical Service Office of the City of Davao, personally examined AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> His findings, as stated in the medico-legal report, are as follows:<br><br><center>FINDINGS</center><blockquote>GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br><br>Height : 149.0 cms.<br><br>Fairy nourished, normally developed, conscious, coherent, cooperative, ambulatory subject.<br><br>Breasts : Fully developed, hemispherical, firm.

Labia minora, coaptated. Fourchette, lax. Vestibule, pinkish, smooth. Hymen, thick, tall, intact, distensible. Hymenal Orifice, annular, admits a tube, 2.5 cms. in diameter. Vaginal walls, tight. Vaginal rugosities, prominent.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS:<br><br>1) No evident sign of extragenital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination.<br><br>2) Hymen, intact, but distensible and its orifice, wide as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized male organ in erection without causing hymenal injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>The prosecution also proffered documentary evidence to bolster the testimonies of its witnesses, to wit: (1) the medico-legal report with regard to AAA issued and signed by Dr. Ledesma and marked as Exhibit "A";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and (2) certification from the Office of the Civil Registrar of Davao City issued and signed by Civil Registrar Marcelino A. Perandos attesting that AAA's date of birth as stated in the Register of Births was on 1 October 1983, marked as Exhibit "B."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense presented the testimonies of appellant, Evangeline Wilson (Wilson), and Supt. Macadingdang to refute the foregoing accusations.<br><br>Appellant testified that he started working as a grass-cutter at Camp Catitipan on 27 November 1997. He met AAA for the first time on 27 April 1997 in Camp Catitipan when AAA approached and introduced herself to him. AAA liked him because she constantly sent her regards to him through a girl named Baliling. Except for the whole month of January 1999, he never slept inside the premises of Camp Catitipan. He denied raping AAA on 2 and 9 May 1999. He never entered the SOQB and the quarters of Supt. Macadingdang because it was a prohibited area for a civilian like him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Wilson, barangay captain of Pangian, Malita, Davao del Sur, narrated that she had known appellant since birth because they both belong to the Manobo tribe. She verified that appellant had good moral character because he never committed any offense since childhood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Supt. Macadingdang told the court that AAA was his stay-in housemaid at his quarters in Camp Catitipan; that he cannot remember the exact dates of the incidents; that after being informed by his wife and AAA of the incidents, he requested Colonel Velasco to turn over appellant to the police for investigation; and that he cannot remember if he personally asked assistance from the Buhangin Police Station regarding the incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision on 19 July 2000 convicting appellant of two counts of simple rape. In each of the two cases, the trial court imposed on appellant the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and monetary award by way of damages. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of the prosecution more than sufficient to prove the guilt of accused beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 43,381-99 and in Criminal Case No. 43,382-99 above-mentioned pursuant to Art. 355 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act 7659, without any aggravating circumstance attendant in the commission of the offense charged, in the two (2) above-informations, accused, HILARIO OPONG Y TAÑESA, is sentenced to suffer a penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, in each of the above- Criminal Case No. 43,381-99 and Criminal Case No. 43,382-99, together with all accessory penalty as provided for by law.<br><br>Moreover, pursuant to Art. 100 in relation to Art. 104 of the Revised Penal Code, governing civil indemnity, above-accused, is furthermore ordered to pay complainant, AAA the amount of P50,000.00 in each of the two (2) counts of rape or a total amount of P100,000.00 by way of civil indemnity, another amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages or a total amount of P100,000.00; still another amount of P50,000.00 or a total amount of P100,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, to give example to the public as a deterrent in the further commission of said abominable and despicable offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>On 11 August 2000, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal with the RTC stating that he would appeal his conviction to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On 14 August 2000, the RTC issued an Order forwarding the records of the instant case to us for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On 9 March 2005, we issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> remanding the present case to the Court of Appeals for proper disposition pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> On 25 October 2006, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision affirming <i>in toto</i> the Decision of the RTC. Thus:<br><br>Appellant has not shown that departure from the findings of facts of the trial court is proper.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Joint Judgment of the trial court is affirmed <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Before us, appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO PRIVATE COMPLAINANT'S CLAIM THAT SHE WAS RAPED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CHARGE WAS BELIED BY THE RESULT OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIMES CHARGED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT, THE CRIME HE COMMITTED WAS ONLY ATTEMPTED RAPE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>In reviewing rape cases, this Court is guided by three principles, to wit: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As a result of these guiding principles, the credibility of the complainant becomes the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> If the testimony of the victim is credible, convincing and consistent with human nature, and the normal course of things, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>We have carefully examined AAA's court testimony and found it to be credible and trustworthy.

He unzipped first his pants before he inserted his penis into my vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Well-entrenched is the rule that the testimony of a minor rape victim, such as AAA, is given full weight and credence considering that no young woman would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subject to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her. Youth and immaturity are badges of truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>It is also significant to note that the RTC gave full credence to the foregoing testimony of AAA as she relayed her painful ordeal in a candid manner. It found the testimonies of AAA to be "lucid, frank and irrefutable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Jurisprudence instructs that when the credibility of a witness is of primordial consideration, as in this case, the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded respect if not conclusive effect. This is because the trial court has had the unique opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and was in the best position to discern whether they were telling the truth. When the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, as in the present case, said findings are generally binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellant, however, alleges in his first and second assigned errors that AAA liked him and that AAA sent him messages of regards through a girl named Baliling; that AAA was motivated by anger and revenge in charging him with rape because he ignored her show of affection; and that such ill motive on the part of AAA renders her testimony incredible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Motives such as resentment, hatred, or revenge have never swayed this Court from giving full credence to the testimony of a minor rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Further, ill motives become inconsequential if the rape victim gave an affirmative and credible declaration, which clearly established the liability of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>AAA categorically identified appellant as the one who raped her on 2 and 9 May 1999. Her account of the incidents, as found by the RTC, the Court of Appeals, and by this Court, was sincere and honest. On the contrary, appellant was not able to present any proof as to the ill motives of AAA. There is no evidence on record showing that AAA had feelings for appellant and that appellant's disregard of AAA's affection led her to accuse him of rape. The girl named Baliling was not even presented during the trial to confirm appellant's claim that AAA indeed sent him messages of regards.<br><br>Appellant, nonetheless, asseverates that AAA's delay in reporting the incidents to her employers for almost one month from their alleged commission casts serious doubts on the veracity of her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It is not uncommon for young rape victims to conceal for some time the assault on their virtues because of the rapist's threat on their lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, this Court has repeatedly held that delay in reporting an incident of rape due to death threats does not affect the credibility of the complainant nor can it be taken against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The charge of rape is rendered doubtful only if the delay was unreasonable and unexplained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>AAA, who was barely fifteen years old when she was defiled, satisfactorily explained why she did not immediately report the incidents to anybody. She testified that appellant repeatedly threatened to kill her if she would divulge the sexual attacks on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Further, appellant was always present near the quarters where AAA stayed because he worked therein regularly as a grass-cutter. Appellant's constant presence near AAA's quarters evidently intimidated the latter.<br><br>Besides, in several cases we have decided,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the delay in reporting the rape incidents lasted for months and even for years; nevertheless, the victims were found to be credible. Thus, AAA's delay in reporting the incidents for one month, being reasonable and sufficiently explained, should not be taken against her. Neither can it be used to diminish her credibility nor undermine the charge of rape.<br><br>Appellant argues that AAA's accusation of rape is not consistent with the result of Dr. Ledesma's medico-legal report which states that AAA's hymen was unbroken and completely intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and a freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Gabayron</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we sustained the conviction of accused for rape even though the victim's hymen remained intact after the incidents because medical researches show that negative findings of lacerations are of no significance, as the hymen may not be torn despite repeated coitus. It was noted that many cases of pregnancy had been reported about women with unruptured hymens,and that there could still be a finding of rape even if, despite repeated intercourse over a period of years, the victim still retained an intact hymen without signs of injury.<br><br>In <i>People v. Capt. Llanto,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><i> </i>citing <i>People v. Aguinaldo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we likewise affirmed the conviction of the accused for rape despite the absence of laceration on the victim's hymen since medical findings suggest that it is possible for the victim's hymen to remain intact despite repeated sexual intercourse. We elucidated that the strength and dilatability of the hymen varies from one woman to another, such that it may be so elastic as to stretch without laceration during intercourse; on the other hand, it may be so resistant that its surgical removal is necessary before intercourse can ensue.<i> </i><br><br>In<i> People v. Palicte</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><i> </i>and in <i>People v. Castro,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><i> </i>the rape victims involved were minors. The medical examination showed that their hymen remained intact even after the rape. Even then, we held that such fact is not proof that rape was not committed.<br><br>In the case at bar, Dr. Ledesma explained that AAA's hymen remained intact after the incidents because her hymen is <b>elastic</b> and <b>distensible.</b> In fact, it is capable of admitting a test tube 2.5 cm. in diameter which is equivalent to an average-sized adult Filipino male organ. He concluded that an erect average male organ is capable of penetrating such vagina <b>without causing hymenal injury</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>It also bears stressing that a medico-legal report is not indispensable to the prosecution of a rape case, it being merely corroborative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The credible disclosure of AAA that appellant raped her is the most important proof of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Apropos the third issue, appellant claims that his penis did not penetrate AAA's vagina; that AAA did not feel pain when his penis allegedly penetrated her vagina; that no blood came out of AAA's vagina after the alleged penetration; that AAA admitted she did not see his penis when it allegedly penetrated her vagina; that he was still single, twenty-two years of age, and sexually inexperienced during the alleged incidents; and that the foregoing circumstances only show a mere attempt on AAA's virtue and not consummated rape.<br><br>Rape is consummated from the moment the offender has carnal knowledge of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Carnal knowledge is synonymous with sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> There is carnal knowledge if there is the slightest penetration of the sexual organ of the female by the sexual organ of the male.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> All the elements of the offense, namely, (a) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) that the same was committed by using force and intimidation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> were already present and nothing more was left for the offender to do, having performed all the acts necessary to produce the crime and accomplish it. Full penetration of the vagina is not essential; any penetration of the female organ by the male organ, however slight, is sufficient. Entry of the penis into the labia or lips of the female organ, even without rupture of the hymen or laceration of the vagina, is sufficient to warrant conviction for consummated rape. Thus, complete or full penetration of the vagina is not required for rape to be consummated. Any penetration, in whatever degree, is enough to raise the crime to its consummated stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in attempted rape, there was no penetration of the female organ because not all acts of execution were performed as the offender merely commenced the commission of the felony directly by overt acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It is apparent from the records that appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA because his penis penetrated her vagina. During the incidents, appellant pushed her causing her to fall on a cemented floor. She tried to resist appellant's advances by kicking him but to no avail. Appellant then removed her panty, placed himself on top of her, and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> She felt pain during the repeated insertions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The foregoing established facts obviously show that the rape was consummated and not attempted.<br><br>That no blood came out of AAA's vagina after the penetrations and that AAA did not see appellant's penis during the sexual attack does not negate rape, because these facts are not elements of the offense. Appellant's averment that he could not have successfully raped AAA because he was then single, twenty-two years of age, and sexually inexperienced is flimsy and deserves scant consideration. We take judicial notice of the fact that several young adults, such as appellant, and even minors have been charged with and convicted of rape.<br><br>We shall now determine the propriety of the penalties imposed by the RTC as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty for rape committed through force and intimidation, as in this case, is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Hence, the trial court and the appellate court were correct in sentencing appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each of the two counts of rape in Criminal Cases No. 43,<b>381</b>-99 and No. 43,<b>382</b>-99.<br><br>Both courts were also correct in holding that appellant is liable for civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, and moral damages amounting to P50,000.00 for each of the two counts of rape pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, we differ from their ruling that appellant is entitled to exemplary damages.<br><br>Exemplary damages may be awarded only when one or more aggravating circumstances are alleged in the information and proved during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> One of the circumstances which aggravate/qualify the crime of rape is when the victim is a minor and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The <b>minority</b> of the rape victim and her <b>relationship</b> with the offender must be <b>both</b> alleged in the information and proved during the trial in order to be appreciated as an aggravating/qualifying circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Although the information in the instant case alleged that AAA was a minor during the incidents, there was, however, no allegation and proof that appellant was her ascendant or relative, or one who exercised moral ascendancy over her. Since relationship, as contemplated by law, between AAA and appellant was not duly established, the award of exemplary damages is not warranted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
