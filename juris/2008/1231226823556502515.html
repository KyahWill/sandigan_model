(Underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>On appeal to the NLRC, <u>petitioners raised as errors the Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal and the judgment award</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of March 31, 1998, the NLRC denied the appeal and ruled that there was no "intentional or willful conduct on the part of the [respondent] to disregard the rules regarding meal policy."<br><br>After filing a Motion for Reconsideration, petitioners filed a Manifestation and Motion on June 18, 1998 to present three payroll sheets to show that respondent did not render eight (8) hours a day of work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Their Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, petitioners went to the Court of Appeals on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><i> </i>wherein, in addition to imputing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, <u>it raised as new issue the denial of their constitutional right to due process, the Arbiter having failed to set the case for hearing</u>.<br><br>The appellate court, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of May 23, 2002, affirmed the decision of the NLRC, it finding in order the NLRC resolution of the case on the basis of the parties' position papers, responsive pleadings and documentary evidence. It bewailed petitioners' belated presentation of the payroll sheets only when they filed their Motion for Reconsideration of the NLRC decision.<br><br>Hence, the present petition for review, petitioners contending that:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>. . . <u>THE LABOR ARBITER SHOULD HAVE CONDUCTED A CLARIFICATORY HEARING</u> TO RESOLVE THE FACTUAL ISSUES IN THE INSTANT CASE.<br><br>x x x x<br><br></li><li>. . . <u>THE PENALTY IMPOSED UPON RESPONDENT WAS [NOT] EXCESSIVE</u>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br></li><li>. . .

Petitioners' right to due process was thus not violated.<br><br>Respecting petitioner's submission of <i>additional</i> evidence on appeal, the same may be allowed as the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity are not controlling in labor proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; What the Court disallows, however, is the tardy submission of the supposed additional evidence. As reflected above, petitioners presented payroll sheets only when they moved for a reconsideration of the NLRC decision.&nbsp; At any rate, the NLRC did not find those payroll sheets compelling enough to warrant a reversal of its decision.<br><br>Indeed, payroll sheets are inconclusive to disprove respondent's eight-hour-per-day work shift.&nbsp; Instead of payroll sheets, the time cards would have been more reliable.&nbsp; Petitioners, however, did not present the same.&nbsp; When a party has in its power to produce evidence that would overthrow the case made against it but fails to do so, the presumption arises that such evidence, if produced, would operate to its prejudice and support the case of the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On the substantive issue, there is no dispute that respondent violated petitioners' meal policy.&nbsp; The only issue is whether such violation amounts to or borders on "serious or willful" misconduct or willful disobedience, as petitioners posit, to call for respondent's dismissal.&nbsp; By any measure, the Court holds not.<br><br>Under Article&nbsp; 282 (a) of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> willful disobedience to the employer's lawful orders as a just cause for termination of employment needs the concurrence of at least two requisites, <i>viz</i>: (1) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by a "wrongful and perverse attitude;" and (2) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and must pertain to the duties which one has been engaged to discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>With respect to serious misconduct, it is not sufficient that the act or the conduct complained of must have violated some established rules or policies.&nbsp; It must have been performed with wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, on which the onus of proving lawful cause in sustaining the dismissal of respondent lies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> failed to prove that respondent's misconduct was induced by a perverse and wrongful intent, they having merely anchored their claim that she was on her knowledge of the meal policy.<br><br>While petitioners wield a wide latitude of discretion in the promulgation of policies, rules and regulations on work-related activities of its employees, these must, however, be fair and reasonable at all times, and the corresponding sanctions for violations thereof, when prescribed, must be commensurate thereto as well as to the degree of the infraction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Given respondent's claim that she was having stomach pains due to hunger, which is not implausible, the same should have been properly taken into account in the imposition of the appropriate penalty for violation of the meal policy. Respondent's suspension for five days sufficed.&nbsp; With that penalty, the necessity of cautioning other employees who may be wont to violate the same policy was not compromised.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners likewise failed to prove any resultant material damage or prejudice on their part as a consequence of respondent's questioned act. Their claim that the act would cause "irremediable harm to the company's business" is too vague to merit consideration.<br><br>Petitioners finally harp on the supposed checkered employment record of respondent to justify her dismissal, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; Her employment record was marred by numerous infractions of Company rules for which she was repeatedly sanctioned by her superiors, to wit:&nbsp; a written warning for failing to report for work (07 December 1994); a three-day suspension (14 to 16 February 1995) for incurring several absences; two (2) verbal warnings (10 January and 24 March 1995) for incurring cash shortages of P61.00 and P80.00 and a written warning (11 January 1995) for incurring a cash shortage of P52.00.&nbsp; Furthermore, respondent was given five (5) verbal warnings for reporting late for work on 01 December 1993, 25 March, 02 May, 17 July and 05 November, all in the year 1994. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The resort by petitioners to respondent's past conduct is a desultory attempt to explain their drastic action.&nbsp; Previous offenses may be used as valid justification for dismissal from work only if they are <i>related</i> to the subsequent infraction-basis of the termination of employment.&nbsp; Previous infractions, in other words, may be used if they have a bearing on the proximate offense warranting dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; No such bearing exists, however, between the above-detailed alleged infractions with respondent's meal policy violation.<br><br>Parenthetically, the employment record of respondent reflects her fairly outstanding work ethic and performance, which is punctuated by at least 31 counts of commendations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> from the management no less.<br><br>In fine, given the totality of respondent's employment record, the penalty of dismissal is too discordant with the infraction she committed.<br><br>The Court, however, modifies the dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's decision in that the award of full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits, should be reckoned from the time of respondent's dismissal on April 27, 1995 up to the finality of the Court's decision while the award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, should be computed from the time petitioners engaged respondent's services on November 15, 1993 up to the finality of this decision.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of August 22, 1997 of the Labor Arbiter is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> in that the award of full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits, should be reckoned from the time of respondent's dismissal on April 27, 1995 up to the finality of the Court's decision, while the award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, should be computed from the time petitioners engaged the services of respondent on November 15, 1993 up to the finality of this decision.&nbsp; In all other respects, the Labor Arbiter's decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br>There being no data from which the Court can properly assess petitioners' total monetary liability, the case is remanded to the Labor Arbiter only for that purpose.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Tinga, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 50-51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 64; Annex "E" of Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 65; Annex "F" of Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 68; Annex "G" of Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id<i>.</i> at 69; Annex "H" of Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 70; Annex "I" of&nbsp; Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 72; Annex "J" of Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 74.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 126-138.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 144.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 253-262.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, pp. 170-175.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id<i>.</i> at 3-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Penned by Justice Juan Q.
