A Notice of Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  of the cargo handling contract was sent by fax to NIASSI.  It expressly stated that: (1) A ten-year cargo handling contract is awarded to NIASSI in accordance with the terms and proposals contained in its bid; (2) NIASSI must enter into and execute the formal contract with PPA after its compliance to the documentary requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <br><br>The contract, however, was never executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Instead, PPA issued several hold-over permits to enable NIASSI to legally operate its cargo handling services at the Nasipit port.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  The last of the hold-over permits was issued on October 13, 2004, which was set to expire on April 13, 2004, or six months after its issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Yet, barely two months after, PPA revoked the hold-over authority entrusted to NIASSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Through a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  PPA informed the stevedoring company that it would take over the management and operations of the cargo handling services at the port of Nasipit starting December 10, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>Upon takeover, the PPA, through its Port Services-Special Take-over Unit, directly undertook operations at the Nasipit Port.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  However, this composite group continued to utilize NIASSI's manpower and equipment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>At the onset of the PPA takeover, NIASSI filed a petition for injunction with prayer for writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order against PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  It later amended its petition to mandamus with prayer for the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and/or temporary restraining order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The amended petition sought to compel PPA to execute or cause the final execution of the cargo handling contract with NIASSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  It likewise prayed for the return of the management and operations of the cargo handling services at the Nasipit port to NIASSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <br><center><br><b>RTC  and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On March 18, 2005, the RTC issued a resolution granting the petition, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the prayer of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is granted.<br><br>Let a Writ of Preliminary Injunction be issued against respondent PPA, its agents, and commanding respondents to restore, return the management and operations of arrastre stevedoring  services of the Port  of Nasipit to Nasipit Integrated Arrastre and Stevedoring Services, Inc. (NIASSI), and to refrain and desist from further implementing the takeover of the management and operations of the stevedoring and arrastre services of the Port.<br><br>The petitioner is hereby ordered to execute a bond in the amount of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00)  to answer  and pay  such  damages in favor of the respondent PPA by reason of the injunction if the court will really decide that the applicant is not after all entitled thereto.<br><br>Upon approval of the requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued.  The Deputy Sheriff assigned to this Court is hereby ordered to immediately serve this order upon all parties, particularly the respondents, and their counsels, for their compliance.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC recognized the need to protect NIASSI's right to continued cargo handling operations.  It ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>It is undeniable that <b>petitioner spent a considerable capital outlay, in the form of equipment, machineries and appliances in the establishment of its port operation</b>.  Moreover, it has also supplied the necessary manpower to wheel its operation.<br><br>When the PPA took an active part in the management, control and supervision of the port operations, <b>it practically utilized all the available sources supplied by the petitioner</b>.<br><br>What actually happened was that PPA made only adjustment/correction in the port operation to improve the delivery of basic services. No additional capital outlay was spent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The RTC held that the continued takeover of PPA would work injustice and cause irreparable damage to NIASSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  To serve the better ends of justice, the court declared that the state of affairs be maintained prior to the takeover until the main action is resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <br><br>NIASSI posted the required and duly approved surety bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Accordingly, a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction was issued against PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  PPA, in turn, immediately moved for a reconsideration of the resolution granting the prayer for injunctive relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  It likewise filed a supplemental motion alleging that the bond filed was not between NIASSI and the surety company as mandated by the RTC, but with Ramon Calo as principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  PPA thus prayed for the dissolution or quashal of the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  It also filed a manifestation stating its willingness to post a counter bond in connection with its motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The RTC set the hearing on the manifestation and omnibus motion for reconsideration on April 1, 2005 at 2:30 p.m. However,  the  hearing  was subsequently cancelled and moved to March 31, 2005.  The confusion on hearing dates only became worse when the court issued an order on April 1, 2005, which reads:<br><blockquote>Appearances: Atty. James T. Reserva and Atty. Jorge T. Esparagoza, for the petitioner, are absent.  Atty. Francisquiel O. Mancile for the respondents.<br><br>The setting today is for the hearing on the Manifestation and Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration filed by the respondents in this case.  In their motion, respondents originally asked that this case be set for resolution and consideration on April 6.  However, the court noted that since this case involves public interest, it has set this case to be heard today for consideration as to resolve the motion. The records also disclosed that as early as March 10, 2005, the court has already ordered the petitioner to file a comment or reply to the motion to dismiss as well as on the affirmative defenses. The petitioner has filed the necessary reply.  However, the court would like to receive evidence on the new allegation on the motion for reconsideration which consist of certain facts that were not taken during the summary hearing for the issuance of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Set this case anew for consideration of the said motion on April 6, 2005 at 2:30 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Surprisingly, on April 11, 2005, the RTC issued the assailed resolution which, <i>inter alia</i>, dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction it earlier granted NIASSI.  The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion for reconsideration is <b>GRANTED</b>.<br><br>The Writ of Preliminary Injunction dated 28 March 2005 <b>is hereby DISSOLVED</b>.<br><br>The bond is declared cancelled without force and effect.<br><br>The petitioner,  its agents and any or all persons acting under its authority is hereby ordered to peacefully surrender, return the <u>management, operation and control of the arrastre and stevedoring operation of the Port of Nasipit to PPA,</u> and to refrain and desist from disturbing the same.<br><br>The Deputy Sheriff assigned to this Court or in his absence the Deputy Sheriff assigned at the Office of the Provincial and City Sheriff is ordered  to  immediately serve and enforce the order upon all the parties particularly the petitioner and respondents and their counsels for their information and strict compliance.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In dissolving the writ, the trial court held that the State has the power to revoke the temporary permits issued to arrastre and stevedoring operators whenever there is a need to promote the public interest and the welfare of the stevedoring industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Whatever right a private operator may have acquired on the basis of the temporary permit issued to it shall yield to the State's valid exercise of police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br>NIASSI filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  It alleged that the RTC gravely abused its discretion when it dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction it earlier issued and did so without the benefit of a hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  It also pointed out that the second resolution contained orders that were immediately executory which was contrary to law and prejudicial to its interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <br><br>The PPA, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), prayed for the dismissal of the petition on the ground that NIASSI failed to file the necessary  and  appropriate remedy of a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  The OSG contended  that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> can only be resorted to if there is  no  appeal or there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available.  The OSG likewise contended that the RTC correctly reversed itself in the assailed resolution since NIASSI was not entitled to the injunctive relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  NIASSI did not have a cargo handling contract with the PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Instead what it had was a hold-over authority or a mere privilege which can be withdrawn at any time when the public welfare demands it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <br><br>On August 8, 2006, the CA decided in favor of NIASSI, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding merit in the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the same is GRANTED.  Accordingly, the assailed Order dated 11 April 2005 is hereby NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction.  Consequently, the Order dated 18 March 2005 granting the Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction is hereby REINSTATED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA sustained NIASSI's argument that the motion for reconsideration filed by PPA was a mere rehash of the same grounds contained in its opposition to NIASSI's application for preliminary injunction.  As a pro-forma motion, it should not have been entertained.<br><br>More significantly, the appellate court held that the RTC failed to conduct a hearing to enable it to determine whether the continuance of the writ of injunction might cause irreparable damage to PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> <br><br>Finally, the CA held that the non-filing of a motion for reconsideration by NIASSI is justified.  The need for relief was extremely urgent and a motion for reconsideration was not a plain and adequate remedy under the circumstances of the case as the court <i>a quo</i> seemed to have acted with precipitate haste in granting respondent's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  Under the circumstances, the motion for reconsideration would be useless since the assailed resolution was immediately executory.  Furthermore, NIASSI was denied due process and there is apparent extreme urgency for relief.  Hence, the filing of a motion for reconsideration would be an exercise in futility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <br><center><br><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Left with no other recourse, PPA appeals to this Court and ascribes to the CA the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br><u>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DECIDING A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE WHICH IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND THE PREVAILING JURISPRUDENCE.</u><br><center><br>II<br></center><br><u>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT ORDERING THE DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION FOR MANDAMUS FILED WITH THE TRIAL COURT BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE PROPER REMEDY TO ENFORCE RESPONDENT'S ALLEGED RIGHT UNDER ITS ACCEPTED BID PROPOSAL; HENCE, IN ORDERING THE RESTORATION OF THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION ISSUED BY THE TRIAL COURT, THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND/OR IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b>The appellate court committed no reversible error in setting aside the  RTC  resolution</b>.   PPA avers that the failure of NIASSI to file the necessary motion for reconsideration before it could resort to the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> is fatal.  This contention is flawed.   As early as <i>Director of Lands v. Santamaria</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  this Court held that there are notable exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  to the general rule that a motion for reconsideration must first be filed before resort to <i>certiorari</i> can be availed of.   This rule has been applied by this Court in a plethora of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  A motion for reconsideration is no longer necessary when other special circumstances warrant immediate and more direct action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <br><br>Here, the RTC issued the questioned resolution containing orders that were self-executory and harshly prejudicial to NIASSI's interests.  NIASSI stands to lose valuable revenue and investment upon execution of the orders preventing it  from engaging  in  stevedoring operations at  the Nasipit port.  This is true most especially after  it  has  already  received  a notice of award and has started complying with the additional documentation requirements given by PPA.<br><br>Although a motion for reconsideration has often been considered a condition precedent for granting the writ of <i>certiorari</i>, this rule finds exception in this case where execution has been ordered and the need for relief is urgent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Otherwise, a motion for reconsideration of the contested order would have served no purpose.  The rule on exhaustion of remedies does not call for an exercise in futility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  In <i>Gonzales, Jr. v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  this Court said:<br><blockquote>As a general rule, <i>certiorari</i> will not lie, unless an inferior court has, through a motion for reconsideration, a chance to correct the errors imputed to him.  This, however, admits exceptions, namely: (1) when the issue raised is one purely of law; (2) where public interest is involved; and (3) in case of urgency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Too, the RTC failed to observe the procedural requirements when it dissolved the preliminary mandatory injunction without the benefit of a hearing.  Section 6, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>The application for injunction or restraining order may be denied, upon a showing of its insufficiency. The injunction or restraining order may also be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved on other grounds upon affidavits of the party or person enjoined, which may be opposed by the applicant also by affidavits.  It may further be denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, if it appears after hearing that although the applicant is entitled to the injunction or restraining order, the issuance or continuance thereof, as the case may be, would cause irreparable damage to the party or person enjoined while the applicant can be fully compensated for such damages as he may suffer, and the former files a bond in an amount fixed by the court conditioned that he will pay all damages which the applicant may suffer by the denial or the dissolution of the injunction or restraining order.  If it appears that the extent of the preliminary injunction or restraining order granted is too great, it may be modified.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The provision is clear. A hearing is indispensable before an injunction or restraining order may be dissolved.  It is during the hearing that a determination may be made whether or not the continuance of an injunction would cause irreparable damage to the party or person enjoined.<br><br>The observation of the CA in this regard is worth stressing:<br><blockquote>In the course of Our examination of the records, We took note of the procedural lapses committed by respondent judge when he granted the respondent's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>In the first place, contrary to the procedure laid down in Section 6 (supra), the respondent judge did not require the filing of respondent's affidavit nor allow petitioner to submit a counter-affidavit opposing the dissolution of the writ in question.  Likewise, no hearing was conducted to enable the respondent judge to determine whether the continuance of the writ of injunction may cause irreparable damage to the respondent.  And while it may conceded that the court <i>a quo</i> set the hearing on respondent's motion for reconsideration on 01 April 2005, the same was reset to 06 April 2005 for the purpose of receiving evidence on the new allegations that respondent failed to present at the hearing on the application for injunction.  We have gone over the minutes of the proceedings held before the court <i>a quo</i> but <b>there is nothing in the records to show that a hearing was ever conducted on 06 April 2005 or at anytime thereafter to determine the grounds for nullification of the order granting the writ application and  the propriety of  dissolving the writ  previously issued by the court <i>a quo</i></b>.  Such fatal omission notwithstanding, the <b>respondent judge gratuitously issued the resolution granting the motion for reconsideration that resulted in the dissolution of the mandatory injunction</b>.<br><br>Needless to state. <b>The respondent judge gravely abused his discretion when he dissolved the subject Writ without conducting a hearing </b>to assess the prevailing circumstances <b>and without requiring the respondents to file a counter-bond as required in Section 6 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The records are bereft of any order which required PPA to submit an affidavit in support of the injunction relief it sought.  Neither was NIASSI given any chance to oppose the petition through a counter-affidavit.  More importantly, no hearing was conducted to determine whether the writ of injunction earlier issued, indeed, caused irreparable damage to PPA.<br><br>The fact that NIASSI has been deprived due process, taken together with the circumstance that the resulting orders were immediately executory, perforce takes this case outside the purview of the rule requiring a previous motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  The deprivation of NIASSI's right to due process taints the proceedings against it. The court's order which was immediately executory render the matter as one of extreme urgency.  The situation easily falls under one of the recognized exceptions to the rule that a motion for reconsideration should first be availed of before filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Be that as it may, when the rules of procedure are rigid and strict in application, resulting in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote justice, the Court is empowered to suspend them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> <br><br>It would be in the interest of justice to reinstate the preliminary mandatory injunction the RTC has earlier issued in favor of NIASSI.  The stevedoring company has proven  that  it stands to suffer irreparable injury with PPA's continued use of its facilities and takeover of the port.  Even though PPA is a governmental arm, it does not stand above the law in the guise of protecting the public interest.<br><br>It should also be noted that an arrastre contract is not an ordinary agreement involving merely parties therein, as it affects the public in general.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  In all contracts, the law must protect all parties in securing fair play and equity to prevail.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is <b>DENIED </b>and the appealed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><i>Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson),  Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario,</i> and <i>Nachura, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Roosevelt, T., Third Annual Message to Congress (1903).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 461-492.
