However, the CTA First Division, after noting several discrepancies in the Information filed, required the State Prosecutor to clarify and explain the same, and to submit the original copies of the parties' affidavits, memoranda, and all other evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Consequently, Prosecution Attorney Torrevillas, on behalf of respondent People, submitted on 1 December 2005 a Compliance with <i>Ex Parte</i> Motion to Admit Attached Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Prosecution Attorney Torrevillas moved that the documents submitted be admitted as part of the record of the case and the first Information be substituted by the attached second Information.&nbsp; The second Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> addressed the discrepancies noted by the CTA in the first Information, by now reading thus:<br><blockquote>The undersigned Prosecution Attorney of the Department of Justice hereby accuses <b>JUDY ANNE SANTOS y Lumagui</b> of the offense of violation of Section 255, of Republic Act No. 8424, otherwise known as the "Tax Reform Act of 1997," as amended, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 15<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2003, at Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously file a false and fraudulent income tax return for taxable year 2002 by indicating therein a gross income of P8,033,332.70 when in truth and in fact her correct income for taxable year 2002 is P16,396,234.70 or a gross underdeclaration/difference of P8,362,902 resulting to an income tax deficiency of P1,395,116.24 excluding interest and penalties thereon of P1,319,500.94 or a total income tax deficiency of P2,714,617.18 to the damage and prejudice of the government of the same amount.["]<br></blockquote></blockquote>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 8 December 2005, the CTA First Division granted the People's <i>Ex Parte</i> Motion and admitted the second Information.<br><br>The CTA First Division then issued on 9 December 2005 a warrant for the arrest of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The tax court lifted and recalled the warrant of arrest on 21 December 2005 after petitioner voluntarily appeared and submitted herself to its jurisdiction and filed the required bail bond in the amount of P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 10 January 2006, petitioner filed with the CTA First Division a Motion to Quash<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Information filed in C.T.A.

EB. CRIM. No. 001.&nbsp; She filed her Petition for Review with the CTA <i>en banc</i> on 16 June 2006.&nbsp; However, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated 19 June 2006, the CTA <i>en banc</i> denied petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review, ratiocinating that:<br><blockquote>In the case before Us, the petitioner is asking for an extension of time to file her Petition for Review to appeal the denial of her motion to quash in C.T.A. Crim. Case No. 0-012.&nbsp; As stated above, a resolution denying a motion to quash is not a proper subject of an appeal to the Court <i>En Banc</i> under Section 11 of R.A. No. 9282 because a ruling denying a motion to quash is only an interlocutory order, as such, it cannot be made the subject of an appeal pursuant to said law and the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Section 1 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that "no appeal may be taken from an interlocutory order" and Section 1 (i) of Rule 50 provides for the dismissal of an appeal on the ground that "the order or judgment appealed from is not appealable".&nbsp; Time and again, the Supreme Court had ruled that the remedy of the accused in case of denial of a motion to quash is for the accused to enter a plea, go to trial and after an adverse decision is rendered, to appeal therefrom in the manner authorized by law.<br><br>Since a denial of a Motion to Quash is not appealable, granting petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review will only be an exercise in futility considering that the dismissal of the Petition for Review that will be filed by way of appeal is mandated both by law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Ultimately, the CTA <i>en banc</i> decreed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review filed on June 1, 2006 is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Now comes petitioner before this Court raising the sole issue of:<br><blockquote>WHETHER A RESOLUTION OF A CTA DIVISION DENYING A MOTION TO QUASH IS A PROPER SUBJECT OF AN APPEAL TO THE CTA <i>EN BANC</i> UNDER SECTION 11 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9282, AMENDING SECTION 18 OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 1125.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as amended by Republic Act No. 9282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 18. <i>Appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc</i>. -&nbsp; No civil proceedings involving matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code, the Tariff and Customs Code or the Local Government Code shall be maintained, except as herein provided, until and unless an appeal has been previously filed with the CTA and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this Act.<br><br>A party adversely affected by a resolution of a Division of the CTA on a motion for reconsideration or new trial, may file a petition for review with the CTA <i>en banc</i>.<br></blockquote>Petitioner's primary argument is that a resolution of a CTA Division denying a motion to quash is a proper subject of an appeal to the CTA <i>en banc</i> under Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, because the law does not say that only a resolution that constitutes a final disposition of a case may be appealed to the CTA <i>en banc</i>. If the interpretation of the law by the CTA <i>en banc</i> prevails, a procedural void is created leaving the parties, such as petitioner, without any remedy involving erroneous resolutions of a CTA Division.<br><br>The Court finds no merit in the petitioner's assertion.<br><br><b><i>The petition for review under Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, may <br>be new to the CTA, but it is actually a mode of appeal long available in courts of <br>general jurisdiction.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner is invoking a very narrow and literal reading of Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended.<br><br>Indeed, the filing of a petition for review with the CTA <i>en banc </i>from a decision, resolution, or order of a CTA Division is a remedy newly made available in proceedings before the CTA, necessarily adopted to conform to and address the changes in the CTA.<br><br>There was no need for such rule under Republic Act No. 1125, prior to its amendment, since the CTA then was composed only of one Presiding Judge and two Associate Judges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Any two Judges constituted a quorum and the concurrence of two Judges was necessary to promulgate any decision thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The amendments introduced by Republic Act No. 9282 to Republic Act No. 1125 elevated the rank of the CTA to a collegiate court, with the same rank as the Court of Appeals, and increased the number of its members to one Presiding Justice and five Associate Justices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The CTA is now allowed to sit <i>en banc</i> or in two Divisions with each Division consisting of three Justices.&nbsp; Four Justices shall constitute a quorum for sessions <i>en banc</i>, and the affirmative votes of four members of the Court <i>en banc</i> are necessary for the rendition of a decision or resolution; while two Justices shall constitute a quorum for sessions of a Division and the affirmative votes of two members of the Division shall be necessary for the rendition of a decision or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In A.M.

The Court may, for good cause, extend the time for filing of the petition for review for an additional period not exceeding fifteen days.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote>Given the foregoing, the petition for review to be filed with the CTA <i>en banc</i> as the mode for appealing a decision, resolution, or order of the CTA Division, under Section 18 of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, is not a totally new remedy, unique to the CTA, with a special application or use therein.&nbsp; To the contrary, the CTA merely adopts the procedure for petitions for review and appeals long established and practiced in other Philippine courts. Accordingly, doctrines, principles, rules, and precedents laid down in jurisprudence by this Court as regards petitions for review and appeals in courts of general jurisdiction should likewise bind the CTA, and it cannot depart therefrom.<br><br><b><i>General rule: The denial of a motion to quash is an interlocutory order which is not the<br>proper subject of an appeal or a petition for certiorari.</i></b><br><br>According to Section 1, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court, governing appeals from the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) to the Court of Appeals, an appeal may be taken only from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case or of a matter therein when declared by the Rules to be appealable.&nbsp; Said provision, thus, explicitly states that no appeal may be taken from an interlocutory order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Court distinguishes final judgments and orders from interlocutory orders in this wise:<br><blockquote>Section 2, Rule 41 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that "(o)nly final judgments or orders shall be subject to appeal." Interlocutory or incidental judgments or orders do not stay the progress of an action nor are they subject of appeal "until final judgment or order is rendered for one party or the other." The test to determine whether an order or judgment is interlocutory or final is this: "Does it leave something to be done in the trial court with respect to the merits of the case? If it does, it is interlocutory; if it does not, it is final". A court order is final in character if it puts an end to the particular matter resolved or settles definitely the matter therein disposed of, such that no further questions can come before the court except the execution of the order. The term "final" judgment or order signifies a judgment or an order which disposes of the cause as to all the parties, reserving no further questions or directions for future determination. The order or judgment may validly refer to the entire controversy or to some definite and separate branch thereof. "In the absence of a statutory definition, a final judgment, order or decree has been held to be x x x one that finally disposes of, adjudicates, or determines the rights, or some right or rights of the parties, either on the entire controversy or on some definite and separate branch thereof, and which concludes them until it is reversed or set aside."&nbsp; The central point to consider is, therefore, the effects of the order on the rights of the parties. A court order, on the other hand, is merely interlocutory in character if it is provisional and leaves substantial proceeding to be had in connection with its subject.&nbsp; The word "interlocutory" refers to "something intervening between the commencement and the end of a suit which decides some point or matter but is not a final decision of the whole controversy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>In other words, after a final order or judgment, the court should have nothing more to do in respect of the relative rights of the parties to the case. Conversely, "an order that does not finally dispose of the case and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the parties' contentions in determining their rights and liabilities as regards each other, but obviously indicates that other things remain to be done by the Court, is interlocutory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The rationale for barring the appeal of an interlocutory order was extensively discussed in <i>Matute</i><i> v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>It is settled that an "interlocutory order or decree made in the progress of a case is always under the control of the court until the final decision of the suit, and may be modified or rescinded upon sufficient grounds shown at any time before final judgment . . ." Of similar import is the ruling of this Court declaring that "it is rudimentary that such (interlocutory) orders are subject to change in the discretion of the court." Moreover, one of the inherent powers of the court is "To amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice. In the language of Chief Justice Moran, paraphrasing the ruling in <i>Veluz</i><i> vs. Justice of the Peace of Sariaya</i>, "since judges are human, susceptible to mistakes, and are bound to administer justice in accordance with law, they are given the inherent power of amending their orders or judgments so as to make them conformable to law and justice, and they can do so before they lose their jurisdiction of the case, that is before the time to appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected."&nbsp; And in the abovecited <i>Veluz</i> case, this Court held that "If the trial court should discover or be convinced that it had committed an error in its judgment, or had done an injustice, before the same has become final, it may, upon its own motion or upon a motion of the parties, correct such error in order to do justice between the parties. . . . It would seem to be the very height of absurdity to prohibit a trial judge from correcting an error, mistake, or injustice which is called to his attention before he has lost control of his judgment." Corollarily, it has also been held "that a judge of first instance is not legally prevented from revoking the interlocutory order of another judge in the very litigation subsequently assigned to him for judicial action."<br></blockquote>Another recognized reason of the law in permitting appeal only from a final order or judgment, and not from an interlocutory or incidental one, is to avoid multiplicity of appeals in a single action, which must necessarily suspend the hearing and decision on the merits of the case during the pendency of the appeal.&nbsp; If such appeal were allowed, the trial on the merits of the case would necessarily be delayed for a considerable length of time, and compel the adverse party to incur unnecessary expenses, for one of the parties may interpose as many appeals as incidental questions may be raised by him, and interlocutory orders rendered or issued by the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>There is no dispute that a court order denying a motion to quash is interlocutory.&nbsp; The denial of the motion to quash means that the criminal information remains pending with the court, which must proceed with the trial to determine whether the accused is guilty of the crime charged therein. Equally settled is the rule that an order denying a motion to quash, being interlocutory, is not immediately appealable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> nor can it be the subject of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Such order may only be reviewed in the ordinary course of law by an appeal from the judgment after trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court cannot agree in petitioner's contention that there would exist a procedural void following the denial of her Motion to Quash by the CTA First Division in its Resolutions dated 23 February 2006 and 11 May 2006, leaving her helpless.&nbsp; The remedy of an accused from the denial of his or her motion to quash has already been clearly laid down as follows:<br><blockquote>An order denying a Motion to Acquit (like an order denying a motion to quash) is interlocutory and not a final order. It is, therefore, not appealable. Neither can it be the subject of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. Such order of denial may only be reviewed, in the ordinary course of law, by an appeal from the judgment, after trial. As stated in <i>Collins vs. Wolfe</i>, and reiterated in <i>Mill vs. Yatco</i>, the accused, after the denial of his motion to quash, should have proceeded with the trial of the case in the court below, and if final judgment is rendered against him, he could then appeal, and, upon such appeal, present the questions which he sought to be decided by the appellate court in a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>In <i>Acharon</i><i> vs. Purisima</i>, the procedure was well defined, thus:<br><blockquote>"Moreover, when the motion to quash filed by Acharon to nullify the criminal cases filed against him was denied by the Municipal Court of General Santos his remedy was not to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> but to go to trial without prejudice on his part to reiterate the special defenses he had invoked in his motion and, if, after trial on the merits, an adverse decision is rendered, to appeal therefrom in the manner authorized by law.

He or any of his assistants may conduct such investigations by taking oral evidence of reputable witnesses, and for this purpose may issue subpoena, summon witnesses to appear and testify under oath before him, and the attendance or evidence of an absent or recalcitrant witness may be enforced by application to the municipal court or the Court of First Instance. No witness summoned to testify under this section shall be under obligation to give any testimony which tend to incriminate himself.<br></blockquote>Evident from the foregoing is that the City Prosecutor has the power to investigate crimes, misdemeanors, and violations of ordinances committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the city, and which can be prosecuted before the trial courts of the said city.&nbsp; The charge against petitioner, however, is already within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the CTA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> as the Information states that her gross underdeclaration resulted in an income tax deficiency of P1,395,116.24, excluding interest and penalties.&nbsp; The City Prosecutor does not have the authority to appear before the CTA, which is now of the same rank as the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In contrast, the DOJ is the principal law agency of the Philippine government which shall be both its legal counsel and prosecution arm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; It has the power to investigate the commission of crimes, prosecute offenders and administer the probation and correction system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Under the DOJ is the Office of the State Prosecutor whose functions are described as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8. <i>Office of the Chief State Prosecutor.</i> - The Office of the Chief State Prosecutor shall have the following functions:<br><br>(1) Assist the Secretary in the performance of powers and functions of the Department relative to its role as the prosecution arm of the government;<br><br>(2) Implement the provisions of laws, executive orders and rules, and carry out the policies, plans, programs and projects of the Department relative to the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases;<br><br>(3) Assist the Secretary in exercising supervision and control over the National Prosecution Service as constituted under P.D.

Velasquez (Velasquez) were dismissed by the DOJ in its Resolution dated 10 August 2005 in I.S. No. 2005-330 for the reason that Velasquez's tax liability was not yet fully determined when the charges were filed.<br><br>The Court is unconvinced.<br><br>First, a motion to quash should be based on a defect in the information which is evident on its face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; The same cannot be said herein. The Information against petitioner appears valid on its face; and that it was filed in violation of her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws is not evident on the face thereof. As pointed out by the CTA First Division in its 11 May 2006 Resolution, the more appropriate recourse petitioner should have taken, given the dismissal of similar charges against Velasquez, was to appeal the Resolution dated 21 October 2005 of the Office of the State Prosecutor recommending the filing of an information against her with the DOJ Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Second, petitioner cannot claim denial of due process when she was given the opportunity to file her affidavits and other pleadings and submit evidence before the DOJ during the preliminary investigation of her case and before the Information was filed against her.&nbsp; Due process is merely an opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; In addition, preliminary investigation conducted by the DOJ is merely inquisitorial.&nbsp; It is not a trial of the case on the merits. Its sole purpose is to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether the respondent therein is probably guilty of the crime. It is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence. Hence, if the investigating prosecutor is already satisfied that he can reasonably determine the existence of probable cause based on the parties' evidence thus presented, he may terminate the proceedings and resolve the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Third, petitioner cannot likewise aver that she has been denied equal protection of the laws.<br><br>The equal protection clause exists to prevent undue favor or privilege. It is intended to eliminate discrimination and oppression based on inequality. Recognizing the existence of real differences among men, the equal protection clause does not demand absolute equality.&nbsp; It merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions, both as to the privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was not able to duly establish to the satisfaction of this Court that she and Velasquez were indeed similarly situated, <i>i.e.</i>, that they committed identical acts for which they were charged with the violation of the same provisions of the NIRC; and that they presented similar arguments and evidence in their defense - yet, they were treated differently.<br><br>Furthermore, that the Prosecution Attorney dismissed what were supposedly similar charges against Velasquez did not compel Prosecution Attorney Torrevillas to rule the same way on the charges against petitioner. In <i>People v. Dela Piedra</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> this Court explained that:<br><blockquote>The prosecution of one guilty person while others equally guilty are not prosecuted, however, is not, by itself, a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Where the official action purports to be in conformity to the statutory classification, an erroneous or mistaken performance of the statutory duty, although a violation of the statute, is not without more a denial of the equal protection of the laws.&nbsp; The unlawful administration by officers of a statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination. This may appear on the face of the action taken with respect to a particular class or person, or it may only be shown by extrinsic evidence showing a discriminatory design over another not to be inferred from the action itself. <b>But a discriminatory purpose is not presumed, there must be a showing of "clear and intentional discrimination."</b> Appellant has failed to show that, in charging appellant in court, that there was a "clear and intentional discrimination" on the part of the prosecuting officials.<br><br>The discretion of who to prosecute depends on the prosecution's sound assessment whether the evidence before it can justify a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense.&nbsp; <b>The presumption is that the prosecuting officers regularly performed their duties, and this presumption can be overcome only by proof to the contrary, not by mere speculation.</b>Indeed, appellant has not presented any evidence to overcome this presumption. The mere allegation that appellant, a Cebuana, was charged with the commission of a crime, while a Zamboangueña, the guilty party in appellant's eyes, was not, is insufficient to support a conclusion that the prosecution officers denied appellant equal protection of the laws.<br><br>There is also common sense practicality in sustaining appellant's prosecution.<br><br><b>While all persons accused of crime are to be treated on a basis of equality before the law, it does not follow that they are to be protected in the commission of crime.</b> It would be unconscionable, for instance, to excuse a defendant guilty of murder because others have murdered with impunity. <b>The remedy for unequal enforcement of the law in such instances does not lie in the exoneration of the guilty at the expense of society</b> x x x. Protection of the law will be extended to all persons equally in the pursuit of their lawful occupations, but no person has the right to demand protection of the law in the commission of a crime.<br><br>Likewise, [i]f the failure of prosecutors to enforce the criminal laws as to some persons should be converted into a defense for others charged with crime, the result would be that the trial of the district attorney for nonfeasance would become an issue in the trial of many persons charged with heinous crimes and the enforcement of law would suffer a complete breakdown. (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, no evidence of a clear and intentional discrimination against petitioner was shown, whether by Prosecution Attorney Torrevillas in recommending the filing of Information against petitioner or by the CTA First Division in denying petitioner's Motion to Quash. The only basis for petitioner's claim of denial of equal protection of the laws was the dismissal of the charges against Velasquez while those against her were not.<br><br>And lastly, the Resolutions of the CTA First Division dated 23 February 2006 and 11 May 2006 directly addressed the arguments raised by petitioner in her Motion to Quash and Motion for Reconsideration, respectively, and explained the reasons for the denial of both Motions.&nbsp; There is nothing to sustain a finding that these Resolutions were rendered capriciously, whimsically, or arbitrarily, as to constitute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>In sum, the CTA <i>en banc</i> did not err in denying petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review.&nbsp; Petitioner cannot file a Petition for Review with the CTA <i>en banc</i> to appeal the Resolution of the CTA First Division denying her Motion to Quash. The Resolution is interlocutory and, thus, unappealable.&nbsp; Even if her Petition for Review is to be treated as a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, it is dismissible for lack of merit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition for Review is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Corona,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>&nbsp; Justice Renato C.
