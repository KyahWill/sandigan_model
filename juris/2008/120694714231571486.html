It also failed to deliver the concrete mix and rebars according to schedule. For this reason, petitioner was not responsible for the project's delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The trial court thus allowed petitioner to set-off respondent's other outstanding liabilities with respondent’s excess payment in the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It concluded that respondent owed petitioner P2,023,876.25.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In addition, because respondent refused to deliver the keys to the condominium units and the management certificate to petitioner, the RTC found that petitioner lost rental income amounting to US$1,665,260.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The dispositive portion of the RTC decision stated:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing [respondent's] [c]omplaint for lack of merit.

Not only did it incur delay in the performance of its obligation but petitioner also failed to finish the project. The CA ruled that respondent was entitled to recover the value of the unfinished portion of the project under the principle of unjust enrichment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision is <b>REVERSED</b> and a new one entered dismissing [petitioner's] counterclaims of P2,023,867.25 representing unpaid balance for [its] services in [the project]; US$1,665,260 as accrued lost earnings, and attorney's fees.

Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the CA erred in giving weight to ITI's report because the project evaluation was commissioned only by respondent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> in disregard of industry practice. Project evaluations are agreed upon by the parties and conducted by a disinterested third party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We grant the petition.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REVIEW OF CONFLICTING <br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">FACTUAL FINDINGS</span><br><br>As a general rule, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari. Factual issues are entertained only in exceptional cases such as where the findings of fact of the CA and the trial court are conflicting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Here, a glaring contradiction exists between the factual findings of the RTC and the CA. The trial court found that respondent contributed to the project's delay because it belatedly communicated the modifications and failed to deliver the necessary materials on time. The CA, however, found that petitioner incurred delay in the performance of its obligation. It relied on ITI's report which stated that petitioner had accomplished only 48.71% of the project as of October 12, 1995.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">JANUARY 31, 1994</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> WAS EXTINGUISHED</span><br><br>A contract is a meeting of the minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This case involved two contracts entered into by the parties with regard to the project.<br><br>The parties first entered into a contract for a piece of work<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> when they executed the supplemental agreement. Petitioner as contractor bound itself to execute the project for respondent, the owner/developer, in consideration of a price certain (P130,000,000). The supplemental agreement was reciprocal in nature because the obligation of respondent to pay the entire contract price depended on the obligation of petitioner to complete the project (and <i>vice versa</i>).<br><br>Thereafter, the parties entered into a second contract. They agreed to extinguish the supplemental agreement as evidenced by the October 12, 1995 letter-agreement which was duly acknowledged by their respective representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>While the October 12, 1995 letter-agreement stated that respondent was to take over merely the supervision of the project, it actually took over the whole project itself. In fact, respondent subsequently hired two contractors in petitioner's stead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Moreover, petitioner's project engineer at site only monitored the progress of architectural works undertaken in its condominium units.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Petitioner never objected to this arrangement; hence, it voluntarily surrendered its participation in the project. Moreover, it judicially admitted in its answer that respondent took over the entire project, not merely its supervision, pursuant to its (respondent’s) long-range plans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Because the parties agreed to extinguish the supplemental agreement, they were no longer required to fully perform their respective obligations. Petitioner was relieved of its obligation to complete the project while respondent was freed of its obligation to pay the entire contract price. However, respondent, by executing the June 30, 1994 deed of absolute sale, was deemed to have paid P112,416,716.88. Nevertheless, because petitioner applied part of what it received to respondent’s outstanding liabilities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> it admitted overpayment.<br><br>Because petitioner acknowledged that it had been overpaid, it was obliged to return the excess to respondent. Embodying the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i>, Article 2154 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Article 2154. If something is received when there is no right to demand it and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises.<br></blockquote>For the extra-contractual obligation of <i>solutio indebiti</i> to arise, the following requisites must be proven:<br><ol><li>the absence of a right to collect the excess sums and<br><br></li><li>the payment was made by mistake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></li></ol>With regard to the first requisite, because the supplemental agreement had been extinguished by the mutual agreement of the parties, petitioner became entitled only to the cost of services it actually rendered (<i>i.e.,</i> that fraction of the project cost in proportion to the percentage of its actual accomplishment in the project). It was not entitled to the excess (or extent of overpayment).<br><br>On the second requisite, Article 2163 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Article 2163. It is presumed that <b>there was a mistake in the payment if something which had never been due</b> or had already been paid <b>was delivered</b>; but, he from whom the return is claimed may prove that the delivery was made out of liberality or for any other just cause. (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this instance, respondent paid part of the contract price under the assumption that petitioner would complete the project within the stipulated period. However, after the supplemental agreement was extinguished, petitioner ceased working on the project. Therefore, the compensation petitioner received in excess of the cost of its actual accomplishment as of October 12, 1995 was never due. The condominium units and parking slots corresponding to the said excess were mistakenly delivered by respondent and were therefore not due to petitioner.<br><br>Stated simply, respondent erroneously delivered excess units to petitioner and the latter, pursuant to Article 2154, was obliged to the return them to respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Article 2160 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Article 2160. He who in good faith accepts an undue payment of a thing certain and determinate shall only be responsible for the impairment or loss of the same or its accessories and accessions insofar as he has thereby been benefited. If he has alienated it, he shall return the price or assign the action to collect the sum.<br></blockquote>One who receives payment by mistake in good faith is, as a general rule, only liable to return the thing delivered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> If he benefited therefrom, he is also liable for the impairment or loss of the thing delivered and its accessories and accessions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> If he sold the thing delivered, he should either deliver the proceeds of the sale or assign the action to collect to the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The situation is, however, complicated by the following facts:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)      the basis of the valuation (P112,416,716.99) of the condominium units and parking slots covered by the June 30, 1994 deed of sale is unknown;<br><br>b)     the percentage of petitioner's actual accomplishment in the project has not been determined and<br><br>c)     the records of this case do not show the actual number of condominium units and parking slots sold by petitioners.<br></div><br>Because this Court is not a trier of facts, the determination of these matters should be remanded to the RTC for reception of further evidence.<br><br>The RTC must first determine the percentage of the project petitioner actually completed and its proportionate cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This will be the amount due to petitioner. Thereafter, based on the stipulated valuation in the June 30, 1994 deed of sale, the RTC shall determine how many condominium units and parking slots correspond to the amount due to petitioner. It will only be the management certificate and the keys to these units that petitioner will be entitled to. The remaining units, having been mistakenly delivered by respondent, will therefore be the subject of <i>solutio indebiti</i>.<br><br>What exactly must petitioner give back to respondent? Under Article 2160 in relation to Article 2154, it should return to respondent the condominium units and parking slots in excess of the value of its actual accomplishment (<i>i.e.,</i> the amount due to it) as of October 12, 1995. If these properties include units and/or slots already sold to third persons, petitioner shall deliver the proceeds of the sale thereof or assign the actions for collection to respondent as required by Article 2160.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">DELAY IN THE COMPLETION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> OF THE PROJECT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><i>Mora</i> or delay is the failure to perform the obligation in due time because of <i>dolo</i> (malice) or <i>culpa</i> (negligence).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> A debtor is deemed to have violated his obligation to the creditor from the time the latter makes a demand. Once the creditor makes a demand, the debtor incurs <i>mora</i> or delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The construction contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> provided a procedure for protesting delay:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Article XIV<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DELAYS AND ABANDONMENT</span><br></div><br>15.1. <b>If at any time during the effectivity of this contract, [PETITIONER] shall incur unreasonable delay or slippages of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the scheduled work program, [RESPONDENT] should notify [PETITIONER] in writing to accelerate the work and reduce, if not erase, slippage.</b> If after the lapse of sixty (60) days from receipt of such notice, [PETITIONER] fails to rectify the delay or slippage, [RESPONDENT] shall have the right to terminate this contract except in cases where the same was caused by force majeure. “FORCE MAJEURE” as contemplated herein, and in determination of delay includes, but is not limited to, typhoon, flood, earthquake, coup d'etat, rebellion, sedition, transport strike, stoppage of work, mass public action that prevents workers from reporting for work, and such other causes beyond [PETITIONER'S] control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                xxx</div></blockquote>Respondent never sent petitioner a written demand asking it to accelerate work on the project and reduce, if not eliminate, slippage. If delay had truly been the reason why respondent took over the project, it would have sent a written demand as required by the construction contract. Moreover, according to the October 12, 1995 letter-agreement, respondent took over the project for the sole reason that such move was part of its (respondent's) long-term plan.<br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, relied on ITI's September 7, 1995 report. The construction contract named GEMM, not ITI, as construction manager.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Because petitioner did not consent to the change of the designated construction manager, ITI's September 7, 1995 report could not bind it.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we hold that petitioner did not incur delay in the performance of its obligation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">RECOVERY OF ADDITIONAL COSTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> RESULTING FROM CHANGES</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>The supplemental agreement was a contract for a stipulated price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In such contracts, the recovery of additional costs (incurred due to changes in plans or specifications) is governed by Article 1724 of the Civil Code.<br><blockquote>Article 1724. The contractor who undertakes to build a structure or any other work for a stipulated price, in conformity with plans and specifications agreed upon with the landowner, can neither withdraw from the contract nor demand an increase in the price on account of higher cost of labor or materials, save when there has been a change in plans and specifications, provided:<br><ol><li>such change has been authorized by the proprietor in writing; and<br><br></li><li>the additional price to be paid to the contractor has been determined in writing by both parties.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In <i>Powton Conglomerate, Inc. v. Agcolicol,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> we reiterated that a claim for the cost of additional work arising from changes in the scope of work can only be allowed upon the:<br><blockquote><ol><li>written authority from the developer/owner ordering/allowing the changes in work; and<br><br></li><li>written agreement of parties with regard to the increase in cost (or price) due to the change in work or design modification. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Furthermore:<br><blockquote><b>Compliance with the two requisites of Article 1724, a specific provision governing additional works, is a condition precedent of the recovery.</b> The absence of one or the other bars the recovery of additional costs. Neither the authority for the changes made nor the additional price to be paid therefor may be proved by any other evidence for purposes of recovery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner submitted neither one. In addition, petitioner’s project coordinator Estellita Garcia testified that respondent never approved any change order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Thus, under Article 1724 and pursuant to our ruling in <i>Powton Conglomerate, Inc.,</i> petitioner cannot recover the cost it incurred in effecting the design modifications. A contractor who fails to secure the owner or developer's written authority to changes in the work or written assent to the additional cost to be incurred cannot invoke the principle of unjust enrichment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">RECOVERY OF<br> COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</span><br><br>Indemnification for damages comprehends not only the loss suffered (actual damages or <span style="font-style: italic;">damnum emergens</span>) but also the claimant's lost profits (compensatory damages or <i>lucrum cessans</i>).
