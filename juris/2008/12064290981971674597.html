It was registered in the name of a certain Raul Palencia Salvatierra of Sampaloc, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As proof, Deriquito presented a certification signed by Roque, the chief records officer of the same office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The Court on several occasions ruled that either the testimony of a representative of, or a certification from, the Philippine National Police (PNP) Firearms and Explosive Office attesting that a person is not a licensee of any firearm would suffice to prove beyond reasonable doubt the second element of possession of illegal firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The prosecution more than complied when it presented both.<br><br><i><b>The certification is outside the scope<br>of the hearsay rule.</b></i><br><br>The general rule is that a witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Otherwise, the testimony is objectionable for being hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>On this score, the certification from the Firearms and Explosives Division is an exception to the hearsay rule by virtue of Rule 130, Section 44 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec.  44.  <i>Entries in official records.</i>  – Entries in official records made in the performance of his official duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specifically enjoined by law, are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.<br></blockquote>It may be true that the contents of said certification are only <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts stated there.  However, the failure of petitioner to present controverting evidence makes the presumption unrebutted.  Thus, the presumption stands.<br><br>Petitioner, however, raises several points which he says entitles him to no less than an acquittal.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The assessment of credibility of </span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">witnesses lies with the trial court.</span><br><br><b>First</b>, petitioner says that the seizure of the subject firearm was invalid.

However, as aptly put by Justice Ynares-Santiago in People v.  Rivera:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x <u>the manner of assigning values to declarations of witnesses on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge who had the unmatched opportunity to observe the witnesses and assess their credibility by the various indicia available but not reflected on record.</u>  The demeanor of the person on the stand can draw the line between fact and fancy or evince if the witness is telling the truth or lying through his teeth.  <u>We have consistently ruled that when the question arises as to which of the conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense is worthy of belief, the assessment of the trial courts are generally viewed as correct and entitled to great weight.  Furthermore, in an appeal, where the culpability or innocence of the accused depends on the issue of credibility of witnesses and the veracity of their testimonies, findings of the trial court are given the highest degree of respect if not finality</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The trial court found the prosecution version worthy of credence and belief.  We find no compelling reason not to accept its observation on this score.<br><br>Worth noting is the fact that petitioner is a ranking police officer who not only claims to be highly decorated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> but have effected a number of successful arrests<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> as well.  Common sense would dictate that he must necessarily be authorized to carry a gun.  We thus agree with the Office of the Solicitor General that framing up petitioner would have been a very risky proposition.  Had the arresting officers really intended to cause the damnation of petitioner by framing him up, they could have easily “planted” a more incriminating evidence rather than a gun.  That would have made their nefarious scheme easier, assuming that there indeed was one.<br><br><i><b>The pieces of evidence show that<br>petitioner is not legally authorized to<br>possess the subject firearm and its <br>five (5) ammunition.</b></i><br><br><b>Second</b>, petitioner insists that he is legally authorized to possess the subject firearm and its ammunition on the basis of the Memorandum Receipt issued to him by the PNP Narcotics Command.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Although petitioner is correct in his submission that public officers like policemen are accorded presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> it is only a presumption; it may be overthrown by evidence to the contrary.  The prosecution was able to rebut the presumption when it proved that the issuance to petitioner of the Memorandum Receipt was anything but regular.<br><br>SPO3 Timbol, Jr.  testified that he issued the Memorandum Receipt to petitioner based on the verbal instruction of his immediate superior, Col.  Moreno.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> However, a reading of Timbol’s testimony on cross-examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> would reveal that there was an unusual facility by which said receipt was issued to petitioner.  Its issuance utterly lacked the usual necessary bureaucratic constraints.  Clearly, it was issued to petitioner under questionable circumstances.<br><br><i><b>Failure to offer an unlicensed <br>firearm as evidence is not fatal <br>provided there is competent<br>testimony as to its existence.</b></i><br><br><b>Third</b>, petitioner claims that the subject firearm and ammunition should have been excluded as evidence because they were not formally offered by the prosecution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> in violation of Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>We note that petitioner contradicted himself when he argued for the validity of the Memorandum Receipt and, at the same time, for the exclusion in evidence of the subject firearm and its ammunition.  Petitioner’s act may result to an absurd situation where the Memorandum Receipt is declared valid, while the subject firearm and its ammunition which are supposedly covered by the Memorandum Receipt are excluded as evidence.  That would have made the Memorandum Receipt useless.<br><br>In any case, petitioner’s contention has no leg to stand on.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner’s claim, the subject firearm<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> and its five (5) live ammunition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> were offered in evidence by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that they were not offered, petitioner’s stance must still fail.  The existence of an unlicensed firearm may be established by testimony, even without its presentation at trial.  In <i>People v.  Orehuela,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the non-presentation of the pistol did not prevent the conviction of the accused.<br><br>The doctrine was affirmed in the recent case of <i>People v.  Malinao.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>As previously stated, the existence of the subject firearm and its five (5) live ammunition were established through the testimony of SPO2 Disuanco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Yuson also identified said firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Petitioner even admitted its existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>We hasten to add that there may also be conviction where an unlicensed firearm is presented during trial but through inadvertence, negligence, or fortuitous event (for example, if it is lost), it is not offered in evidence, as long as there is competent testimony as to its existence.<br><br><i><b>Penal and civil liabilities</b></i><br><br>Petitioner was charged with the crime of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under the first paragraph of Section 1 of P.D.  No.  1866, as amended.  It provides that “[t]he penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess any firearm, part of firearm, ammunition or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition.”<br><br>P.D.  No.  1866, as amended, was the governing law at the time petitioner committed the offense on July 10, 1996.  However, R.A.  No.  8294 amended P.D.  No.  1866 on July 6, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> during the pendency of the case with the trial court.  The present law now states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.  <i>Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition. </i> – The penalty of <u><i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000)</u> shall be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess any low-powered firearm, such as rimfire handgun, <u>.380 or .32 and other firearm of similar firepower,</u> part of firearm, ammunition, or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition: <i>Provided</i>, That no other crime was committed.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As a general rule, penal laws should not have retroactive application, lest they acquire the character of an <i>ex post facto</i> law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> An exception to this rule, however, is when the law is advantageous to the accused.  According to Mr.  Chief Justice Araullo, this is “not as a right” of the offender, “but founded on the very principles on which the right of the State to punish and the commination of the penalty are based, and regards it not as an exception based on political considerations, but as a rule founded on principles of strict justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Although an additional fine of P15,000.00 is imposed by R.A.  No.  8294, the same is still advantageous to the accused, considering that the imprisonment is <u>lowered</u> to <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> from <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> under P.D.  No.  1866.<br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>maximum which ranges from four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years, is the prescribed penalty and will form the maximum term of the indeterminate sentence.  The minimum term shall be one degree lower, which is <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> in its medium period (two <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[2]</span> years, four <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[4]</span> months and one <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[1]</span> day to four <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[4]</span> years and two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> months).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Hence, the penalty imposed by the CA is correct.  The penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correcciona</i>l medium, as minimum term, to six (6) years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> maximum, as maximum term, is in consonance with the Court’s ruling in <i>Gonzales v.

Accordingly, hearsay evidence is objected to due to the following reasons:<br><blockquote><i>Oath</i>.  Among the earliest of the criticisms of hearsay, and one often repeated in judicial opinions down to the present, is the objection that <u>the out-of-court declarant who made the hearsay statement commonly speaks or writes without the solemnity of the oath administered to witnesses in a court of law</u>.  The oath may be important in two aspects.  As a ceremonial and religious symbol it may induce in the witness a feeling of special obligation to speak the truth, and also it may impress upon the witness the danger of criminal punishment for perjury, to which the judicial oath or an equivalent solemn affirmation would be a prerequisite condition.  x x x<br><br><i>Personal presence at trial.</i>  Another objection early asserted and repeated of late is the <u>want of opportunity, in respect to the out-of-court declarant, for observation of his demeanor, with the light that this may shed on his credibility, that would be afforded if he were a witness on the stand.</u><br>The solemnity of the occasion and possibility of public disgrace can scarcely fail to impress the witness, and falsehood no doubt becomes more difficult if the person against whom directed is present.<br><br>Moreover, personal presence eliminates the danger that in the oral reporting of an out-of-court statement that the witness reporting the statement may do so inaccurately.  It seems probable that the reporting of words spoken is subject to special dangers of inaccuracy beyond the fallibility common to all reproduction from memory of matters of observation, and this seems a substantial danger in the admission of hearsay.  x x x<br><br><i>Cross-examination</i>.  It would be generally agreed today that noncompliance with the third condition is the main justification for the exclusion of hearsay.  This is the <u>lack of any opportunity for the adversary to cross examine the absent declarant whose out-of-court statement is reported by the witness</u>.  x x x In perhaps his most famous remark, Wigmore described cross-examination as “beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” (Underscoring supplied) (Id.  at 727-728.)<br></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp.  8, 136.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> 433 Phil.  343 (2002), citing <i>People v.
