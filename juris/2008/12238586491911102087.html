				<BR><BR><div align="justify">AT stake in these consolidated cases is the right of the present occupants of Boracay Island to secure titles over their occupied lands.<br><br>There are two consolidated petitions. The first is G.R. No. 167707, a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming that<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Kalibo, Aklan, which granted the petition for declaratory relief filed by respondents-claimants Mayor Jose Yap, <i>et al.</i> and ordered the survey of Boracay for titling purposes.  The second is G.R. No. 173775, a petition for prohibition, mandamus, and nullification of Proclamation No. 1064<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> issued by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo classifying Boracay into reserved forest and agricultural land.<br><br><center><b>The Antecedents</b><br></center><br><center><b>G.R. No. 167707</b><br></center><br>Boracay Island in the Municipality of Malay, Aklan, with its powdery white sand beaches and warm crystalline waters, is reputedly a premier Philippine tourist destination.  The island is also home to 12,003 inhabitants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> who live in the bone-shaped island's three <i>barangays</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 1976, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources  (DENR) approved  the  National Reservation  Survey of Boracay Island,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which identified several lots as being occupied or claimed by named persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On November 10, <b>1978</b>, then President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. <b>1801</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> declaring Boracay Island, among other islands, caves and peninsulas in the Philippines, as <b>tourist zones and marine reserves</b> under the administration of the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA).  President Marcos later approved the issuance of <b>PTA</b><b> Circular 3-82</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated September 3, 1982, to implement Proclamation No. 1801.<br><br>Claiming that Proclamation No. 1801 and PTA Circular No 3-82 precluded them from filing an application for judicial confirmation of imperfect title or survey of land for titling purposes, respondents-claimants <br> Mayor  Jose  S.  Yap, Jr.,  Libertad Talapian, Mila Y. Sumndad, and Aniceto Yap filed a petition for declaratory relief with the RTC in Kalibo, Aklan.<br><br>In their petition, respondents-claimants alleged that Proclamation No. 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 raised doubts on their right to secure titles over their occupied lands.  They declared that they themselves, or through their predecessors-in-interest, had been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation in Boracay since June 12, 1945, or earlier since time immemorial.  They declared their lands for tax purposes and paid realty taxes on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Respondents-claimants posited that Proclamation No. 1801 and its implementing Circular did not place Boracay beyond the commerce of man.  Since the Island was classified as a tourist zone, it was susceptible of private ownership.  Under Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Act, they had the right to have the lots registered in their names through judicial confirmation of imperfect titles.<br><br>The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), opposed the petition for declaratory relief.  The OSG countered that Boracay Island was an <b>unclassified land</b> of the public domain.  It formed part of the mass of lands classified as "public forest," which was not available for disposition pursuant to Section 3(a) of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 705 or the Revised Forestry Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as amended.<br><br>The OSG maintained that respondents-claimants' reliance on PD No. 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 was misplaced.  Their right to judicial confirmation of title was governed by CA No. 141 and PD No. 705.  Since Boracay Island had not been classified as alienable and disposable, whatever possession they had cannot ripen into ownership.<br><br>During pre-trial, respondents-claimants and the OSG stipulated on the following facts:  (1) respondents-claimants were presently in possession of parcels of land in Boracay Island; (2) these parcels of land were planted with coconut trees and other natural growing trees; (3) the coconut trees had heights of more or less twenty (20) meters and were planted more or less fifty (50) years ago; and  (4) respondents-claimants declared the land they were occupying for tax purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The parties also agreed that the principal issue for resolution was purely legal: whether Proclamation No. 1801 posed any legal hindrance or impediment to the titling of the lands in Boracay. They decided to forego with the trial and to submit the case for resolution upon submission of their respective memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The RTC took judicial notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that certain parcels of land in Boracay Island, more particularly Lots 1 and 30, Plan PSU-5344, were covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 19502 (RO 2222) in the name of the Heirs of Ciriaco S. Tirol.  These lots were involved in Civil Case Nos. 5222 and 5262 filed before the RTC  of  Kalibo, Aklan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The  titles were  issued  on August 7, 1933.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><b>RTC and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On July 14, 1999, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of respondents-claimants, with a <i>fallo </i>reading:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court declares that Proclamation No. 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 pose no legal obstacle to the petitioners and those similarly situated to acquire title to their lands in Boracay, in accordance with the applicable laws and in the manner prescribed therein; and to have their lands surveyed and approved by respondent Regional Technical Director of Lands as the approved survey does not in itself constitute a title to the land.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC upheld respondents-claimants' right to have their occupied lands titled in their name.  It ruled that neither Proclamation No. 1801 nor PTA Circular No. 3-82 mentioned that lands in Boracay were inalienable or could not be the subject of disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  The Circular itself recognized private ownership of lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  The trial court cited Sections 87<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and 53<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the Public Land Act as basis for acknowledging private ownership of lands in Boracay and that only those forested areas in public lands were declared as part of the forest reserve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The OSG moved for reconsideration but its motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  The Republic then appealed to the CA.<br><br>On December 9, 2004, the appellate court affirmed <i>in toto </i>the RTC decision, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us DENYING the appeal filed in this case and AFFIRMING the decision of the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA held that respondents-claimants could not be prejudiced by a declaration that the lands they occupied since time immemorial were part of a forest reserve.<br><br>Again, the OSG sought reconsideration but it was similarly denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Hence, the present petition under Rule 45.<br><br><center><b>G.R. No. 173775</b><br></center><br>On May 22, 2006, during the pendency of G.R. No. 167707, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 1064<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> classifying Boracay Island into four hundred (400) hectares of reserved forest land (protection purposes) and six hundred twenty-eight and 96/100 (628.96) hectares of agricultural land (alienable and disposable).  The Proclamation likewise provided for a fifteen-meter buffer zone on each side of the centerline of roads and trails, reserved for right-of-way and which shall form part of the area reserved for forest land protection purposes.<br><br>On August 10, 2006, petitioners-claimants Dr. Orlando Sacay,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Wilfredo Gelito,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and other landowners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in Boracay filed with this Court an original petition for prohibition, mandamus, and nullification of Proclamation No. 1064.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  They allege  that the Proclamation infringed on their "prior vested rights" over portions of Boracay.  They have been in continued possession of their respective lots in Boracay since time immemorial.  They have also invested billions of pesos in developing their lands and building internationally renowned first class resorts on their lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioners-claimants contended that there is no need for a proclamation reclassifying Boracay into agricultural land.  Being classified as neither mineral nor timber land, the island is <b>deemed</b> agricultural pursuant to the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926,  known as the first Public Land Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  Thus, their possession in the concept of owner for the required period entitled them to judicial confirmation of imperfect title.<br><br>Opposing the petition, the OSG argued that petitioners-claimants do not have a vested right over their occupied portions in the island.  Boracay is an unclassified public forest land pursuant to Section 3(a) of PD No. 705.  Being public forest, the claimed portions of the island are inalienable and cannot be the subject of judicial confirmation of imperfect title.  It is only the executive department, not the courts, which has authority to reclassify lands of the public domain into alienable and disposable lands.  There is a need for a positive government act in order to release the lots for disposition.<br><br>On November 21, 2006, this Court ordered the consolidation of the two petitions as they principally involve the same issues on the land classification of Boracay Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br><br><b>G.R. No. 167707</b><br></center><br>The OSG raises the lone issue of whether Proclamation No. 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 pose any legal obstacle for respondents, and all those similarly situated, to acquire title to their occupied lands in Boracay Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><center><br><b>G.R.

No. 167707 and petitioners-claimants in G.R. No. 173775) have a right to secure titles over their occupied portions in Boracay.  The twin petitions pertain to their right, if any, to judicial confirmation of imperfect title under CA No. 141, as amended. They do not involve their right to secure title under other pertinent laws.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br><br><b><i>Regalian Doctrine and power of the executive<br>to reclassify lands of the public domain</i></b><br></center><br>Private claimants rely on three (3) laws and executive acts in their bid for judicial confirmation of imperfect title, namely: (a) Philippine Bill of 1902<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> in relation to Act No. 926, later amended and/or superseded by Act No. 2874 and CA No. 141;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  (b) Proclamation No. 1801<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> issued by then President Marcos; and (c) Proclamation No. 1064<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> issued by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.  We shall proceed to determine their rights to apply for judicial confirmation of imperfect title under these laws and executive acts.<br><br>But first, a peek at the Regalian principle and the power of the executive to reclassify lands of the public domain.<br><br>The 1935 Constitution classified lands of the public domain into agricultural, forest or timber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Meanwhile, the 1973 Constitution provided the following divisions: agricultural, industrial or commercial, residential, resettlement, mineral, timber or forest and grazing lands, and such other classes as may be provided by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> giving the government great leeway for classification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Then the 1987 Constitution reverted to the 1935 Constitution classification with one addition: national parks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  Of these, <b>only</b> agricultural lands may be alienated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Prior to Proclamation No. 1064 of May 22, 2006, Boracay Island had <b>never</b> been expressly and administratively classified under any of these grand divisions.  Boracay was an unclassified land of the public domain.<br><br>The Regalian Doctrine dictates that all lands of the public domain belong to the State, that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land and charged with the conservation of such patrimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  The doctrine has been consistently adopted under the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Constitutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>All lands not otherwise appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  Thus, all lands that have not been acquired from the government, either by purchase or by grant, belong to the State as part of the inalienable public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  Necessarily, it is up to the State to determine if lands of the public domain will be disposed  of for private ownership. The government, as the agent of the state, is possessed of the plenary power as the persona in law to determine who shall be the favored recipients of public lands, as well as under what terms they may be granted such privilege, not excluding the placing of obstacles in the way of their exercise of what otherwise would be ordinary acts of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Our present land law traces its roots to the Regalian Doctrine.  Upon the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, ownership of all lands, territories and possessions in the Philippines passed to the Spanish Crown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  The Regalian doctrine was first introduced in the Philippines through the <i>Laws of the Indies and the Royal Cedulas</i>, which laid the foundation that "all lands that were not acquired from the Government, either by purchase or by grant, belong to the public domain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The <i>Laws of the Indies </i>was followed by the <i>Ley Hipotecaria </i>or the <i>Mortgage Law of 1893</i>.  The Spanish Mortgage Law provided for the systematic registration of titles and deeds as well as possessory claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The Royal Decree of 1894 or  the Maura Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> partly amended the Spanish Mortgage Law and the <i>Laws of the Indies</i>.  It established possessory information as the method of legalizing possession of vacant Crown land, under certain conditions which were set forth in said decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  Under Section 393 of the Maura Law, an <i>informacion posesoria </i>or possessory information title,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> when duly inscribed in the Registry of Property, is converted into a title of ownership only after the lapse of twenty (20) years of uninterrupted possession which must be actual, public, and adverse,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> from the date of its inscription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> However, possessory information title had to be perfected one year after the promulgation of the Maura Law, or until April 17, 1895.  Otherwise, the lands would revert to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In sum, private ownership of land under the Spanish regime could only be founded  on royal concessions which took various forms, namely:   (1) <i>titulo real </i>or royal grant; (2) <i>concesion especial </i>or special grant;          (3) <i>composicion con el estado </i>or adjustment title; (4) <i>titulo de compra </i>or title by purchase; and (5) <i>informacion posesoria </i>or possessory information title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The <b>first</b> law governing the disposition of public lands in the Philippines under American rule was embodied in the Philippine Bill of <b>1902</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  By this law, lands of the public domain in the Philippine Islands were classified into three (3) grand divisions, to wit: agricultural, mineral, and timber or forest lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  The act provided for, among others, the disposal of mineral lands by means of absolute grant (freehold system) and by lease (leasehold system).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  It also provided the definition by exclusion of "agricultural public lands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  Interpreting the meaning of "agricultural lands" under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the Court declared in <i>Mapa v. Insular Government</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x  In other words, that the phrase "<b>agricultural land</b>" as used in Act No. 926 means <b>those public lands acquired from </b><b>Spain</b><b> which are not timber or mineral lands</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>On February 1, <b>1903</b>, the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. <b>496</b>, otherwise known as the Land Registration Act.

This is known as the Torrens system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Concurrently, on October 7, <b>1903</b>, the Philippine Commission passed Act No. <b>926</b>, which was the first Public Land Act.  The Act introduced the homestead system and made provisions for judicial and administrative confirmation of imperfect titles and for the sale or lease of public lands.  It permitted corporations regardless of the nationality of persons owning the controlling stock to lease or purchase lands of the public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  Under the Act, open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands for the next ten (10) years preceding July 26, 1904 was sufficient for judicial confirmation of imperfect title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>On November 29, <b>19</b><b>19</b>, Act No. 926 was <b>superseded</b> by Act No. <b>2874</b>, otherwise known as the second Public Land Act.

It should be stressed that the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926 merely provided the manner through which land registration courts would classify lands of the public domain.  Whether the land would be classified as timber, mineral, or agricultural depended on proof presented in each case.<br><br><i>Ankron</i> and <i>De Aldecoa</i> were decided at a time when the President of the Philippines had no power to classify lands of the public domain into mineral, timber, and agricultural.

Director of Lands </i>and <i>Ankron v. Government </i>is misplaced. These cases were decided under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the first Public Land Act No. 926 enacted by the Philippine Commission on October 7, 1926, under which there was no legal provision vesting in the Chief Executive or President of the Philippines the power to classify lands of the public domain into mineral, timber and agricultural so that the courts then were free to make corresponding classifications in justiciable cases, or were vested with implicit power to do so, depending upon the preponderance of the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote>To aid the courts in resolving land registration cases under Act No. 926, it was then necessary to devise a presumption on land classification.  Thus evolved the dictum in <i>Ankron</i> that "the courts have a right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that in each case the lands are agricultural lands until the contrary is shown."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>But We cannot unduly expand the presumption in <i>Ankron</i> and <i>De Aldecoa</i> to an argument that all lands of the public domain had been automatically reclassified as disposable and alienable agricultural lands.  By no stretch of imagination did the presumption convert all lands of the public domain into agricultural lands.<br><br>If We accept the position of private claimants, the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926 would have automatically made all lands in the Philippines, except those already classified as timber or mineral land, alienable and disposable lands.  That would take  these lands out of State ownership and worse, would be utterly inconsistent with and totally repugnant to the long-entrenched Regalian doctrine.<br><br>The presumption in <i>Ankron</i> and <i>De Aldecoa</i> attaches only to land registration cases brought under the provisions of Act No. 926, or more specifically those cases dealing with judicial and administrative confirmation of imperfect titles.  The presumption applies to an applicant for judicial or administrative conformation of imperfect title under Act No. 926.  It certainly cannot apply to landowners, such as private claimants or their predecessors-in-interest, who failed to avail themselves of the benefits of Act No. 926.  As to them, their land remained unclassified and, by virtue of the Regalian doctrine, continued to be owned by the State.<br><br>In any case, the assumption in <i>Ankron</i> and <i>De Aldecoa</i> was not absolute.  Land classification was, in the end, dependent on proof.  If there was proof that the land was better suited for non-agricultural uses, the courts could  adjudge it as a mineral or timber land despite the presumption.  In <i>Ankron</i>, this Court stated:<br><blockquote>In the case of <i>Jocson vs. Director of Forestry</i> (supra), the Attorney-General admitted in effect that whether the particular land in question belongs to one class or another is a question of fact.  The mere fact that a tract of land has trees upon it or has mineral within it is not of itself sufficient to declare that one is forestry land and the other, mineral land.  There must be some proof of the extent and present or future value of the forestry and of the minerals.  While, as we have just said,  many definitions have been given for "agriculture," "forestry," and "mineral" lands, and that in each case it is a question of fact, we think it is safe to say that in order to be forestry or mineral land the proof must show that it is more valuable for the forestry or the mineral which it contains than it is for agricultural purposes. (Sec. 7, Act No. 1148.) It is not sufficient to show that there exists some trees upon the land or that it bears some mineral. Land may be classified as forestry or mineral today, and, by reason of the exhaustion of the timber or mineral, be classified as agricultural land tomorrow.  And vice-versa, by reason of the rapid growth of timber or the discovery of valuable minerals, lands classified as agricultural today may be differently classified tomorrow.  <b>Each case must be decided upon the proof in that particular case</b>, <b>having regard for its present or future value for one or the other purposes</b>.  We believe, however, considering the fact that it is a matter of public knowledge that a majority of the lands in the Philippine Islands are agricultural lands that the courts have a right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that in each case the lands are agricultural lands until the contrary is shown.  <b>Whatever the land involved in a particular land registration case is forestry or mineral land must, therefore, be a matter of proof.  Its superior value for one purpose or the other is a question of fact to be settled by the proof in each particular case</b>. The fact that the land is a manglar [mangrove swamp] is not sufficient for the courts to decide whether it is agricultural, forestry, or mineral land.  It may perchance belong to one or the other of said classes of land.  The Government, in the first instance, under the provisions of Act No. 1148, may, by reservation, decide for itself what portions of public land shall be considered forestry land, unless private interests have intervened before such reservation is made. In the latter case, whether the land is agricultural, forestry, or mineral, is a question of proof. Until private interests have intervened, the Government, by virtue of the terms of said Act (No. 1148), may decide for itself what portions of the "public domain" shall be set aside and reserved as forestry or mineral land.

It prescribed rules and regulations for the homesteading, selling and leasing of portions of the public domain of the Philippine Islands, and prescribed the terms and conditions to enable persons to perfect their titles to public lands in the Islands. It also provided for the "issuance of patents to certain native settlers upon public lands," for the establishment of town sites and sale of lots therein, for the completion of imperfect titles, and for the cancellation or confirmation of Spanish concessions and grants in the Islands." <i>In short, the Public Land Act operated on the assumption that title to public lands in the Philippine Islands remained in the government; and that the government's title to public land sprung from the Treaty of Paris and other subsequent treaties between Spain and the United States</i>. The term "public land" referred to all lands of the public domain whose title still remained in the government and are thrown open to private appropriation and settlement, and excluded the patrimonial property of the government and the friar lands."<br></blockquote>Thus, <b>it is plain error for petitioners to argue that under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and </b><b>Public Land</b><b> Act No. 926, mere possession by private individuals of lands creates the legal presumption that the lands are alienable and disposable</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote><b><i>Except for lands already covered by existing titles, Boracay was an unclassified land of the public domain prior to Proclamation No. 1064.

Section 3(a) of PD No. 705 defines a public forest as "a mass of lands of the public domain which <i>has not been the subject of the present system of classificatio</i>n for the determination of which lands are needed for forest purpose and which are not."  Applying PD No. 705, all unclassified lands, including those in Boracay Island, are <i>ipso facto</i> considered public forests.  PD No. 705, however, respects titles already existing prior to its effectivity.<br><br>The Court notes that the classification of Boracay as a forest land under PD No. 705 may seem to be out of touch with the present realities in the island.  Boracay, no doubt, has been partly stripped of its forest cover to pave the way for commercial developments.  As a premier tourist destination for local and foreign tourists, Boracay appears more of a commercial island resort, rather than a forest land.<br><br>Nevertheless, that the occupants of Boracay have built multi-million peso beach resorts on the island;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111] </sup>that the island has already been stripped of its forest cover; or that the implementation of Proclamation No. 1064 will destroy the island's tourism industry, do <b>not</b> negate its character as public forest.<br><br>Forests, in the context of both the Public Land Act and the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112] </sup>classifying lands of the public domain into "<i>agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks</i>," do not necessarily refer to large tracts of wooded land or expanses covered by dense growths of trees and underbrushes.[113]  The discussion in <i>Heirs of Amunategui v. Director of Forestry</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> is particularly instructive:<br><blockquote>A forested area classified as forest land of the public domain does not lose such classification simply because loggers or settlers may have stripped it of its forest cover.  Parcels of land classified as forest land may actually be covered with grass or planted to crops by <i>kaingin</i> cultivators or other farmers.  "Forest lands" do not have to be on mountains or in out of the way places.  Swampy areas covered by mangrove trees, nipa palms, and other trees growing in brackish or sea water may also be classified as forest land.  <b>The classification is descriptive of its legal nature or status and does not have to be descriptive of what the land actually looks like</b>.  Unless and until the land classified as "forest" is released in an official proclamation to that effect so that it may form part of the disposable agricultural lands of the public domain, the rules on confirmation of imperfect title do not apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>There is a big difference between "forest" as defined in a dictionary and "forest or timber land" as a classification of lands of the public domain as appearing in our statutes.  One is descriptive of what appears on the land while the other is a legal status, a classification for legal purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>  At any rate, the Court is tasked to determine the <b>legal</b> status of Boracay Island, and not look into its physical layout.  Hence, even if its forest cover has been replaced by beach resorts, restaurants and other commercial establishments, it has not been automatically converted from public forest to alienable agricultural land.<br><br><b><i>Private claimants cannot rely on Proclamation No. 1801 as basis for judicial confirmation of imperfect title.  The proclamation did not convert Boracay into an agricultural land</i></b>.  However, private claimants argue that Proclamation No. 1801 issued by then President Marcos in 1978 entitles them to judicial confirmation of imperfect title.  The Proclamation classified Boracay, among other islands, as a tourist zone.  Private claimants assert that, as a tourist spot, the island is susceptible of private ownership.<br><br>Proclamation No. 1801 or PTA Circular No. 3-82 did not convert the whole of Boracay into an agricultural land.  There is nothing in the law or the Circular which made Boracay Island an agricultural land.  The reference in Circular No. 3-82 to "private lands"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and "areas declared as alienable and disposable"[118] does not by itself classify the entire island as agricultural.  Notably, Circular No. 3-82 makes reference not only to private lands and areas but also to public forested lands.  Rule VIII, Section 3 provides:<br><blockquote>No trees in forested private lands may be cut without prior authority from the PTA. All forested areas in <b>public lands are declared forest reserves</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Clearly, the reference in the Circular to both private <b>and </b>public lands merely recognizes that the island can be classified by the Executive department pursuant to its powers under CA No. 141.  In fact, Section 5 of the Circular recognizes the then Bureau of Forest Development's authority to declare areas in the island as alienable and disposable when it provides:<br><blockquote>Subsistence farming, in areas declared as alienable and disposable by the Bureau of Forest Development.<br></blockquote>Therefore, Proclamation No. 1801 cannot be deemed the positive act needed to classify Boracay Island as alienable and disposable land.  If President Marcos intended to classify the island as alienable and disposable or forest, or both, he would have identified the specific limits of each, as President Arroyo did in Proclamation No. 1064.  This was not done in Proclamation No. 1801.<br><br>The Whereas clauses of Proclamation No. 1801 also explain the rationale behind the declaration of Boracay Island, together with other islands, caves and peninsulas in the Philippines, as a tourist zone and marine reserve to be administered by the PTA - to ensure the concentrated efforts of the public and private sectors in the development of the areas' tourism potential with due regard for ecological balance in the marine environment.  Simply put, the proclamation is aimed at administering the islands for <b>tourism and ecological purposes</b>.  It does not address the areas' alienability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>More importantly, Proclamation No. 1801 covers not only Boracay Island, but sixty-four (64) other islands, coves, and peninsulas in the Philippines, such as Fortune and Verde Islands in Batangas, Port Galera in Oriental Mindoro, Panglao and Balicasag Islands in Bohol, Coron Island, Puerto Princesa and surrounding areas in Palawan, Camiguin Island in Cagayan de Oro, and Misamis Oriental, to name a few.  If the designation of Boracay Island as tourist zone makes it alienable and disposable by virtue of Proclamation No. 1801, all the other areas mentioned would likewise be declared wide open for private disposition.  That could not have been, and is clearly beyond, the intent of the proclamation.<br><br><b><i>It was Proclamation No. 1064 of 2006 which positively declared part of Boracay as alienable and opened the same to private ownership</i></b>.

Private claimants further assert that Proclamation No. 1064 violates the provision of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) or RA No. 6657 barring conversion of public forests into agricultural lands.  They claim that since Boracay is a public forest under PD No. 705, President Arroyo can no longer convert it into an agricultural land without running afoul of Section 4(a) of RA No. 6657, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Scope</i>. - The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 shall cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced, all public and private agricultural lands as provided in Proclamation No. 131 and Executive Order No. 229, including other lands of the public domain suitable for agriculture.<br><br>More specifically, the following lands are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:<br><blockquote>(a) All alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No <b style="text-decoration: underline;">reclassification</b> of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain.</blockquote></blockquote>That Boracay Island was classified as a public forest under PD No. 705 did not bar the Executive from later converting it into agricultural land.  Boracay Island still remained an unclassified land of the public domain despite PD No. 705.<br><br>In <i>Heirs of the Late Spouses Pedro S. Palanca and Soterranea Rafols v.

In the absence of the classification as mineral or timber land, the land remains unclassified land until released and rendered open to disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Moreover, the prohibition under the CARL applies only to a "reclassification" of land.  If the land had never been previously classified, as in the case of Boracay, there can be no prohibited reclassification under the agrarian law.

Lack of title does not necessarily mean lack of right to possess.<br><br>For one thing, those with lawful possession may claim good faith as builders of improvements.

Ecological conservation is as important as economic progress.<br><br>To be sure, forest lands are fundamental to our nation's survival.  Their promotion and protection are not just fancy rhetoric for politicians and activists. These are needs  that become more urgent as destruction of our environment gets prevalent and difficult to control.  As aptly observed by Justice Conrado Sanchez in 1968 in <i>Director of Forestry v. Munoz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><blockquote>The view this Court takes of the cases at bar is but in adherence to public policy that should be followed with respect to forest lands.  Many have written much, and many more have spoken, and quite often, about the pressing need for forest preservation, conservation, protection, development and reforestation.  Not without justification.  For, forests constitute a vital segment of any country's natural resources.  It is of common knowledge by now that absence of the necessary green cover on our lands produces a number of adverse or ill effects of serious proportions.  Without the trees, watersheds dry up; rivers and lakes which they supply are emptied of their contents. The fish disappear. Denuded areas become dust bowls. As waterfalls cease to function, so will hydroelectric plants. With the rains, the fertile topsoil is washed away; geological erosion results. With erosion come the dreaded floods that wreak havoc and destruction to property - crops, livestock, houses, and highways - not to mention precious human lives.  Indeed, the foregoing observations should be written down in a lumberman's decalogue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is rendered as follows:<ol><li>The petition for <i>certiorari</i> in G.R.
