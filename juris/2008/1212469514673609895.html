				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 4 to 15, 2004, a judicial audit was conducted by the judicial audit team of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 14, Davao City, then presided over by Judge William M. Layague. The audit unearthed numerous undecided/unresolved cases, prompting the filing of an Administrative Case, <b>A.M. No. 05-1-37- RTC</b>, against respondent Judge William M. Layague.<b> </b><br><br>Previous to this administrative case, several administrative complaints were already filed against respondent Judge William M. Layague, two (2) of which were: (a) <b>A.M. OCA IPI No.  04-2055-RTJ</b>, entitled <i>Paul L. Cansino v. Judge William M. Layague, RTC, Branch 14, Davao City</i>, charging the latter with inefficiency and delay in the disposition of cases in connection with the two (2) separate criminal informations, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 45,973-2000 and 45,974-2000, for Malversation and Illegal Exaction, respectively; and (b) <b>A.M. No. 05-2177-RTJ</b>, entitled <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Judge William M. Layague, RTC, Branch 14, Davao City</i>, also charging herein respondent judge with inefficiency and grave misconduct relative to Civil Case No. 29,386-02, for specific performance, damages, etc. with urgent prayer for the issuance of a restraining order and writ of prohibition.  These three (3) cases were later on consolidated.  However, in our Resolution dated June 20, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court ordered the said two (2) administrative complaints closed and terminated considering that the incidents therein were already resolved by respondent Judge.<br><br>After the audit team had submitted its report, the OCA issued a Memorandum Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> addressed to the then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., informing the Court that since the last audit in 1996 of RTC, Branch 14 of Davao City, respondent Judge Layague had accumulated a total of <b>83</b> cases (inclusive of one inherited case) submitted for decision already beyond the reglementary period to decide.  These did not include the <b>230</b> cases submitted for resolution which were already beyond the reglementary period to resolve, <b>93 </b>cases with no further action, <b>19 </b>cases with no further settings and  <b>9</b> cases with no action taken yet since the filing  thereof.<br><br>The Report revealed that respondent judge incurred several absences from 1996 to 2004 as a result of his poor health, as shown by the latter's medical certificates, which adversely affected his work efficiency.  Quoted hereunder is the account of the audit team regarding respondent judge's various illnesses:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>Also, Judge Layague is suffering from various illnesses which admittedly has slowed down his work.<br><br>Information as well as the records show that, since the early 70's, Judge Layague has already been saddled with various illnesses which he attributes to his slow disposal and resolution of cases.  In 1974, he had his gall bladder surgically removed.  In 1976, he developed duodenal ulcer for which he underwent treatment for three months. In January 1995, he was diagnosed with emphysema and since then he had been suffering from numbness in the lower extremities and acute erosive and atrophic gastritis.  In 1998, he was hospitalized for vertigo (Menier's Syndrome). He also suffers from Goiter (Thyroid Nodule); including Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, Hypercholesterolemia, acute gastritis with Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease, Systemic Viral Illness and Musculoskeletal Pain.  In addition, and just lately, it appears from the Certification, dated  4 August 2004 of one Dr. June Anadith Eborde-Buenaventura, a dentist, that Judge Layague is afflicted with `periodontal problem' which necessitated the extraction of all of his teeth from 7-19 July 2004.  In addition to what was not stated above, he (Judge Layague) also informed the Judicial Audit Team that he also had TB.<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the OCA recommended the appointment of an assisting judge to hear, try and decide the cases in said sala at least twice a week until respondent judge has decided/resolved all cases submitted for decision/resolution which have not been decided/resolved or until further orders from this Court.<br><br>Acting on the said Memorandum Report and the Recommendation of the Court Administrator, this Court issued an <i>en banc</i> Resolution dated January 25, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> stating, thus:<br><blockquote>(a) DIRECT Hon. William M. Layague, Presiding Judge, RTC, Br. 14, Davao City<br><ol><li>to <b>EXPLAIN</b> in writing, within the period mentioned in par. (A), subpar. 3, in connection with par.

This is besides the SFR Cases which he was directed to resolve as well as newly discovered additional cases submitted for decision, among others, as a result of the follow-up conducted.

These cases are as follows: <b>Criminal Case No. 55,263;</b> <b>Civil Case Nos.</b> <b>21,701 </b>[decided already]<b>; 35,995; 27,733; 30,523, 30,633, SCA 21,274. </b><br><br><b>xxx xxx  xxx</b><br><br>These cases were not included in the Report of the Team which last conducted an audit of the court, hence, not included in the subject Resolution, dated 25 January 2005 of the Court.<br><br><b>(2) </b><b>CASES AUDITED DURING THE LAST AUDIT WHICH WERE NOT SFD/SFR DURING THAT TIME, BUT HAVE MOVED, AND AFTER THE AUDIT ALREADY SFD/SFR: </b><br><br>These cases are the following:<b> Criminal Case Nos. 53,476,  53,477,  53,478, 53,479,  53,480,  53,481, 53, 482,  53,483,  53,484, 53,485,  53,486,  53,487 </b>and<b> 54,397; </b>and <b>Civil Case Nos. 22,405; 27,385. </b><br><br>xxx  xxx xxx<br><br><b>(3) </b><b>CASES INADVERENTLY OMITTED IN THE REPORT: </b><br><br>These cases are as follows:  to wit: <b>Civil Case No. 26,480; 29,610; 30,230 and 29,330. </b><br><br>xxx  xxx xxx<br><br><b>(4) </b><b>CASES NOT ACCURATELY RECORDED DURING THE LAST AUDIT: </b><br><br>These cases are the following, to wit: <b>Civil Case Nos. 29,499, 30,118; and 30,094. </b><br><br>xxx xxx   xxx<br><br><b>(5) </b><b>MISMANAGEMENT OF THE COURT:</b><br><br>In 2004, the Audit Team has no knowledge, nor were they forewarned of how disorganized the court (RTC, Br. 14, Davao City) was, such that the same needs more time and attention than the other courts (with retiring judges) which was first  audited that time. The Team, has to maximize the use of the short time left for them to audit the court. One of the many measures adopted was to concentrate more on the `movement of cases,' especially those with 2003 settings and below, not so much those cases with 2004 settings, except SFD/SFR Cases, inasmuch as the audit was conducted in 2004, and cases with 2004 settings were to be considered still to have moved on time.<br><br>When the court was audited, tell-tale signs or indicia that the same has been mismanaged were already evident.

They were found anywhere, i.e. on desk tops or on the floor, etc. (2) The Audit Team which audited the court in 2004 were not shown all the records of active cases. That is why there were still unaudited cases not included in the Report of the Team; (3) The pleadings, etc. inside the <i>expediente</i>s were not hand-stitched but were just kept together by fasteners with some loose pleadings, orders, etc. not yet held by fasteners; (4) The arrangements of the pleadings, orders, etc. in some, if not most of the <i>expedientes</i>, are not in chronological order, the reason why the team, who were troubled with time, failed to record accurately the correct `last action taken;'  In some, the latest orders were not yet attached to the <i>expedientes,</i> not even paper-clipped on front of the folder of the same (<i>expedientes)</i>, the reason why the `last action taken' were not up to date; (5) The Audit Team cannot reconcile the cases they audited <i>vis-à-vis</i> the records of the court because the court's last Semestral Docket Inventory was a year behind and neither were the Docket Books of help inasmuch as the entries were not updated; (6) Unaccounted Cases: There were cases, subject of the Resolution, dated 25 January 2005 of the Court in A.M. No. 05-1-37, which were not shown to the Audit Team, to wit: sixteen (16) SFD cases; and twenty-seven (27) SFR cases.  (7)<b> </b>No<b> </b>updated Monthly Reports, Docket Inventory and Docket Books.

Note may be taken that when the court was last audited in 2004, its last Monthly Report was for July 2004.  The Docket Books were not properly maintained and updated. The above problems were duly noted and relayed, accordingly, to the Judge, as well as the employees concerned, who were orally admonished to correct the problem.

Further, He is attaching with the said Motion a certification/referral from a Urologist. Further, when the Audit Team was still in RTC, Br. 14 to audit the court, Atty.

M. NO. 05-1-37-RTC.<br></blockquote>Hence, in our Resolution dated March 6, 2007, the Memorandum Report of the OCA was re-docketed as a regular administrative matter against respondent judge for gross inefficiency; that is, for undue delay in deciding and resolving an exceptionally huge number of cases.<br><br>The Court shares the position taken by the OCA.<br><br>The Court has always impressed upon all members of the judiciary the need to decide cases promptly and expeditiously under the time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>   The Constitution itself, under Section 15, Article VIII, mandates that lower courts have three (3) months from the date of submission within which to decide the cases or matters pending before them.    Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct directs judges to "dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods." Finally, Canons 6 and 7 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics exhort judges to be prompt and punctual in the disposition and resolution of cases and matters pending before their court, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>PROMPTNESS<br><br>He should be prompt in disposing of all matters submitted to him, remembering that justice delayed is often justice denied.<br><br></li><li>PUNCTUALITY<br><br>He should be punctual in the performance of his judicial duties, recognizing that the time of litigants, witnesses, and attorneys is of value and that if the judge is unpunctual in his habits, he sets a bad example to the bar and tends to create dissatisfaction with the administration of justice.<br></li></ol></blockquote>To ensure that the mandates on the prompt disposition of judicial business are complied with, this Court issued Administrative Circular No. 1 dated January 26, 1988 requiring all magistrates to act promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts. This was emphasized in Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999 which requires judges to scrupulously observe the periods prescribed by Section 15, Article VIII of the Constitution in the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted to their courts.<br><br>However, these rules are not rigid.   An extension of the period may be granted by this Court upon request by the judge concerned on account of heavy case load, age, poor health or any other reasonable excuse.<br><br>Here, however, respondent judge clearly transgressed the applicable rules relating to the proper and speedy disposition and resolution of cases within the reglementary period provided by law.  The records show that as of audit date (October 4 to 15, 2004), the following facts were established: (1) 83 cases were not decided within the reglementary period; (2) pending incidents in 230 other cases remained unresolved even beyond the prescribed period to resolve; and (3) no appropriate action was made on 221 others (193 cases with no further action, 19 cases with no further settings and 9 cases with no action taken yet since the filing thereof), despite the lapse of considerable time.   Worse, after his retirement, it was found out that he had left behind 53 cases (not included in those cases stated in the court's resolution dated January 25, 2006 and September 20, 2006),  all of which were beyond the reglementary period to decide/resolve.   We have stated in <i>Cadauan v. Judge Alivia</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><blockquote>Decision-making, among other duties, is the primordial duty of a member of the bench. The speedy disposition of cases in our courts is a primary aim of the judiciary so the ends of justice may not be compromised and the judiciary will be true to its commitment of providing all persons the right to a speedy, impartial and public trial and to a speedy disposition of cases.<br></blockquote>While it may be true that the delays incurred by respondent judge can be attributed in part to his failing health, nonetheless, his illness should not be an excuse for his failure to render the corresponding decisions or resolutions within the prescribed period.  It was incumbent upon him to inform this Court of his inability to seasonably decide the cases and he could have sought an extension of the reglementary period within which to decide his cases if he thought that he could not comply with his judicial duty.   Poor health may excuse a judge's failure to decide cases within the reglementary period but not his failure to request an extension of time within which to decide cases on time.   We note that respondent judge made no such request long before an audit was conducted in his sala.    The fact that he was burdened with failing health, which adversely affected his work efficiency, serves only to mitigate the penalty, not to exonerate him.<br><br>Under Section 9(1), Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, undue delay in rendering a decision is classified as a less serious charge. Under Section 11(B) of the same Rule, the penalty for such charge is suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months, or a fine of more than P10,000 but not exceeding P20,000. In <i>Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the RTC, Branches 29 and 59, Toledo City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court observed the factors considered in the determination of the proper penalty for failure to decide a case on time:<br><blockquote>We have always considered the failure of a judge to decide a case within ninety (90) days as gross inefficiency and imposed either fine or suspension from service without pay for such. The fines imposed vary in each case, depending chiefly on the number of cases not decided within the reglementary period and other factors, to wit: the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances- the damage suffered by the parties as a result of the delay, the health and age of the judge, etc. The fines imposed vary in each case, depending chiefly on the number of cases or matters undecided or unresolved, respectively, within the reglementary period and other factors, to wit: the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances -- the damage suffered by the parties as a result of the delay, the health and age of the judge, etc<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Madronio</i>, we held:<br><blockquote>In a number of cases, the fines were set at ten thousand pesos (P10,000), for the judge failed to decide one (1) case within the reglementary period, without offering an explanation for such delay; for one (1) motion left unresolved within the prescriptive period; and for eight (8) cases left unresolved beyond the extended period of time granted to the judge, taking into consideration that the judge was understaffed, burdened with heavy caseload, and hospitalized for more than a month. xxx  In other cases, the fine was set at eleven thousand pesos (P11,000) for the judge failed to resolve a motion for reconsideration and other pending incidents relative thereto, alleging lack of manpower in his sala as an excuse; decided a case for forcible entry only after one year (1) and more than seven (7) months from the time it was submitted for resolution, considering that respondent judge was grieving due to the untimely demise of his daughter; xxx  In another case, the judge was fined twelve thousand pesos (P12,000) for his failure to decide one (1) criminal case on time, without explaining the reason for the delay. Still in other cases, the maximum fine of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) was imposed on the judges for delay in rendering decisions in nine (9) criminal cases and failing altogether to render decisions in eighteen (18) cases, taking note that the judge also promulgated his decisions in seventeen (17) cases even after he already retired; failure to decide forty-eight (48) cases on time and failing to resolve pending incidents in forty-nine (49) cases despite the lapse of considerable length of time; xxx  There were other cases in which the Court did not strictly apply the Rules as when it only imposed a fine of one thousand pesos (P1,000) for a delay of nine (9) months in resolving complainant's Amended Formal Offer of Exhibits, after finding that there was no malice in the delay and that the delay was caused by the complainant himself. In two cases, we imposed a fine of five thousand pesos (P5,000) on a judge who was suffering from cancer, for failing to decide five (5) cases within the reglementary period and failing to decide pending incidents in nine (9) cases; xxx  In other cases, the fines were variably set at more than the maximum amount when the undue delay was coupled with other offenses. In one case, the judge was fined twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000) for undue delay in rendering a ruling and for making a grossly and patently erroneous decision. In another case, the judge was fined forty thousand pesos (P40,000) for deciding a case only after an undue delay of one (1) year and six (6) months and for simple misconduct and gross ignorance of the law, considering also that said undue delay was his second offense. Finally, the fine of forty thousand pesos (P40,000) was also imposed in a case for the judge's failure to resolve one (1) motion, considering that he was already previously penalized in two cases for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct and for Gross Ignorance of Procedural Law and Unreasonable Delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>We note that this is not the first time that an administrative case of the same nature has been filed against respondent judge.   In 1996, in <i>Re: Report of the Judicial Audit and Physical Inventory of Cases Conducted in the Regional Trial Court of Davao City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court imposed a fine in the amount of  P25,000.00 on respondent judge for his failure to decide/resolve, within the reglementary period, 147 cases submitted for decision/resolution.  Again, in <i>De Vera v. Layague</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> respondent was fined  in the amount of P10,000.00 for undue delay in deciding cases pending before his sala.     Still, one (1) case is pending investigation with the OCA.    Under the circumstances, we agree with the OCA that respondent judge should be fined in the amount of eighty thousand pesos (P80,000.00).<br><br>Also, we would like to point out that in our <i>en banc</i> Resolution dated January 30, 2007, amending our earlier Resolution dated January 25, 2005, we designated Judge Loida S. Posadas-Kahulugan, Presiding Judge, RTC, Branch 21, Bansalan, Davao del Sur, and Judge Marivic T. Daray, Presiding Judge, RTC, Branch 14, Davao City, as Acting Presiding Judge and Assisting Judge, respectively of RTC, Branch 14, Davao City. We also directed Judge Daray to take appropriate actions on the remaining unacted cases mentioned in par. (a) subpar. 1(c) of the Court's <i>en banc</i> Resolution dated January 25, 2005.
