				<H3>HEIRS OF FORTUNATA MUYALDE, NAMELY, ARTURO, TRINIDAD, FELICIDAD AND DOROTEA, ALL SURNAMED MUYALDE, PETITIONERS, VS. BONIFACIO REYES, JR., RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The sisters Fortunata R. Muyalde (Fortunata), Cresencia R. Reyes (Cresencia) and Felicidad Revilla (Felicidad) inherited a commercial lot from their brother Aquilino Revilla. Felicidad died without any heir.<br><br>It appears that in an agreement entitled "Compromise Agreement" executed on June 10, 1996, Cresencia, mother of herein respondent Bonifacio Reyes, Jr., agreed to give to her sister Fortuna's six children Gertrudes Muyalde Marzan - herein petitioners Trinidad Muyalde Solis, Felicidad Muyalde, and Arturo Muyalde and their other siblings - one-third of a lot co-owned by Crescencia, Fortunata, and Felicidad, containing 2,233 square meters located in Urdaneta City which was registered under TCT No. 19209 in the name of Cresencia and her husband Bonifacio Reyes, Sr.<br><br>It further appears that on August 4, 2003, the herein petitioners-heirs of Fortuna filed a complaint for Partition before the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta, docketed as Civil Case No. U-7846 against herein respondent Bonifacio Reyes, Jr. The complaint was dismissed for lack of cause of action.<br><br>Subsequently or on October 30, 2003, petitioners filed a complaint also against respondent, for "Ownership, Reformation of instrument, Partition and Delivery of Share," docketed as Civil Case No. U-7952 before the Urdaneta RTC. To the complaint, respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of <i>res judicata </i>and failure to state a cause of action.<br><br>By Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of May 14, 2004, Branch 48 of the Urdaneta City RTC brushed aside respondent's allegation of <i>res judicata </i>as Civil Case No. U-7846 was not decided on the merits. The trial court dismissed the complaint, however, on three grounds: 1) "petitioners' actions . . . had not been sufficiently laid"; 2) "partition may be premature unless . . . the parties had already agreed [on] the extent of their participation in the land," and 3) petitioners' lack of personality to sue.<br><br>Thus the RTC held:<br><blockquote>The allegations of the complaint clearly show that plaintiff's bone of contention is their alleged mistake in the Compromise Agreement as their true intention was not expressed therein. Plaintiffs, in fact, insist on the reformation of the said agreement in order to reflect their correct share in the subject realty. Obviously, they are not questioning defendant's ownership nor have they raised any ground to resist defendant's claim of ownership. Hence, <u>plaintiff's actions for ownership, partition and delivery of share had not been sufficiently laid.</u> Moreover, at this point, <u>partition may be premature unless, and until, the parties had already agreed to the extent of their participation in the land in question</u> (<i>sic</i>).<br><br>Finally, as to plaintiff's action for reformation, it is inconceivable how at this point reformation could be achieved considering that <u>Cresencia Reyes, one of the parties to the [Compromise A]greement, died already and the defendant, <b>Cresencia's heir, was never a party to the said agreement while two of [Fortunata's] heirs were not, likewise, made parties thereto</b></u><b>. </b>Verily, the said heirs lacked personality to sue herein defendant, both not being parties to the case. Thus, lack of personality to sue can be used as a ground for a motion to dismiss based on the fact that the complaint, on the face thereof, evidently states no cause of action. x x x Moreover, we can never discover the true intention of Cresencia Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Petitioners later filed on June 3, 2004 a Motion to Admit Amended Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The following day or on June 4, 2004, petitioners having received a copy of the RTC's May 14, 2004 Order, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court's May 14, 2004 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The RTC denied the Motion for Reconsideration by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of August 30, 2004.<br><br>Petitioners thereupon filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> before the RTC.

The reason for this is because when plaintiff Arturo Muyalde went to pay the same he had only P1,000 cash on hand as he was not aware of the increased fees which took effect on 16 <b>August 2004</b><b> </b>but which could be implemented only by the clerk of court in Urdaneta City in the last week of August 2004. He tried though to raise the money and ultimately was able to pay the full amount of the docket and other fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>By Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of January 20, 2005, the RTC gave due course to petitioners' appeal and ordered the elevation of the records of the case to the Court of Appeals. Passing on the belated payment by petitioners of the appellate docket and other fees, the RTC held that petitioners' momentary lack of funds, in addition to the confusion with the new rules and the fact that the fees were eventually paid in full, justified a relaxation of the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the said order which was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Respondent thus filed a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> before the Court of Appeals assailing the January 20, 2005 Order of the RTC denying his Motion to Dismiss Appeal and the supplemental motions thereto.

CV No. 85043, strictly applied the rule on the payment of appellate docket fees and dismissed petitioners' appeal. Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> was denied by Resolution of June 28, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of June 9, 2006, the Special Third Division of the Court of Appeals dismissed respondent's petition for certiorari in CA-G.R.

Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><i> </i>this Court, in the exercise of its "sole prerogative to amend, repeal, or even establish new rules for a more simplified and inexpensive process, and the speedy disposition of cases",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> established the following rules:<br><blockquote>To standardize the appeal periods provided in the Rules and to afford litigants fair opportunity to appeal their cases, the Court deems it practical to allow a <u>fresh period of 15 days within which to file the notice of appeal in the Regional Trial Court, <b>counted from receipt of the order dismissing </b>a motion</u> for a new trial or <u><b>motion for reconsideration</b>.</u><br><br>Henceforth, this "fresh period rule" shall also apply to Rule 40 governing appeals from the Municipal Trial Courts to the Regional Trial Courts; Rule 42 on petitions for review from the Regional Trial Courts to the Court of Appeals; Rule 43 on appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals and Rule 45 governing appeals by <i>certiorari</i> to the Supreme Court. The new rule aims to regiment or make the appeal period uniform, to be counted from receipt of the order denying the motion for new trial, motion for reconsideration (whether full or partial) or any final order or resolution.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To recapitulate, a party litigant may either file his notice of appeal within 15 days from receipt of the Regional Trial Court's decision or file it within 15 days from receipt of the order (the "final order") denying his motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration. Obviously, the new 15-day period may be availed of <i>only</i> if either motion is filed; otherwise, the decision becomes final and executory after the lapse of the original appeal period provided in Rule 41, Section 3.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><i>Neypes</i><i> v. Court of Appeals</i> was decided on September 14, 2005, during the pendency of the case at bar before the Court of Appeals. It is settled that procedural laws and rules are considered as applicable to actions pending and unresolved at the time of their passage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Petitioners having received copy of the trial court's order denying their motion for reconsideration on September 10, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> they had until September 25, 2004 to perfect their appeal. Since they paid the docket and other fees on September 20, 2004, they perfected their appeal within the reglementary period.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the appellate docket fees were not paid within the reglementary period, this Court, in <i>La Salette College v. Pilotin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> held that the mandatory requirement of payment of appellate docket fees is qualified by the following: 1) failure to pay those fees within the reglementary period allows only discretionary, not automatic dismissal; and 2) such power should be used by the court in conjunction with its exercise of sound discretion in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play, as well as with a great deal of circumspection in consideration of all attendant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> For the policy of the courts is to encourage full adjudication of the merits of an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Given the circumstances which the RTC noted in giving due course to petitioners' appeal, some of which were echoed by the Special Third Division of the Court of Appeals in its Decision of June 9, 2006 dismissing respondent's petition for certiorari, the present case calls for a liberal application of the rule requiring the payment of appellate docket fee.<br><br>On to the merits of petitioners' appeal.<br><br>In dismissing petitioners' complaint, the RTC held that, <i>inter alia</i>, petitioners' allegations do not make out a clear case of ownership, partition, and/or delivery of share. The complaint of petitioners alleged, however, that they are heirs of Fortunata who, together with her siblings Felicidad and respondent's mother Cresencia, co-owned the land in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> That explains why petitioners do not question respondent's ownership, what they question being his and their respective shares in the co-owned lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As for the RTC's finding that reformation of the "Compromise Agreement" would not lie as respondent's mother Crescencia had died, the same is erroneous.
