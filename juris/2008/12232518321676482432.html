				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an administrative complaint against respondent Librada Puno, Cash Clerk III of the Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court  (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, for dishonesty and grave misconduct.<br><br>The case stemmed from the formal complaint submitted by Executive Judge Rodrigo S. Caspillo of the RTC of Cabanatuan City. Judge Caspillo averred that Atty. Numeriano Galang, Clerk of Court of the Office of the Clerk of Court- RTC of  Cabanatuan City, had reported apparent discrepancies between the original and the duplicate copies of the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and the Clerk of Court General Fund (COCGF) official receipts issued by respondent relative to payments of sheriff's commissions and notarial commission fees. Thereafter, an audit investigation of the accountabilities of respondent was conducted in which tampering of receipts was discovered, resulting to a partial shortage of P354,572.23. Respondent admitted sole responsibility for the alterations which involved the sum of more or less P385,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Financial Audit Team of the Court Management Office submitted an initial report recommending, among others, that respondent be directed to restitute the partial shortage of P354,572.23 and to explain why she should not be criminally charged with falsification of public documents and malversation of public funds;  that Atty. Numeriano Galang be directed to produce all the records and documents to determine once and for all the financial accountability of respondent; and for the Team to be directed to conduct a comprehensive detailed audit. The Court adopted the Team's recommendations in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 10 September 2003.<br><br>In the intervening time, the resolution of the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cabanatuan City recommending the filing of informations for Malversation of Public Funds thru Falsification of Official and Public Documents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> against respondent was referred for appropriate action to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) per the action dated 9 January 2004 of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Then, in a Letter dated 9 July 2004, Atty. Galang detailed the steps he had taken to trace the shortage and therewith submitted the photocopies of pertinent receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In her Comment/Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated 5 January 2005, respondent asserted that since she was able to immediately restitute to the JDF and the General Fund the amounts demanded, she could not be held liable for misappropriation of court funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Court in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 10 January 2005 adopted the recommendations submitted by the Financial Audit Team of the Court Management Office in its Memorandum dated 19 October 2004, as follows:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">1.</td> <td colspan="2">That Ms. LIBRADA S.

Galang (submitted in compliance with the Resolution dated 10 January 2005) stating, among others, that he had already deposited to the respective accounts the unwithdrawn confiscated bonds amounting to P256,780.00.<br><br>On 30 May 2007, respondent filed her Manifestation with Compliance praying, among others, that she be allowed to restitute the amount of P600,051.81 due to the Sheriff Judiciary Development Fund (SJDF) in thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments starting 30 May 2007 or until 30 April 2008 and the amount of P1,000.00 due to the Sheriff General Fund (SGF, now Special Allowance for the Judiciary) in one payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 25 June 2007, the Court denied respondent's Manifestation with Compliance and reiterated its directive that she submit her Comment pursuant to the Resolution dated 28 February 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In her Comment/Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 10 August 2007, respondent admitted her mistakes and assumed full responsibility for the restitution of the amount of P600,051.81.  She offered no excuses for her acts and hoped that with her admission of guilt, the Court would extend its compassion and clemency to her. She sought an additional time of thirty (30) days to finally restitute the amount she had misappropriated. Respondent claimed that she was constrained to commit the misappropriation in order to finance the medical bills of her ailing sister who had been suffering from and eventually died of lung cancer.<br><br>On 8 January 2008, Atty. Galang filed with the Office of the Clerk of Court-2<sup>nd</sup> Division a letter addressed to the Chief Justice requesting that the former be cleared of money accountability to enable him to receive the salaries and benefits due him as Presiding Judge.<br><br>In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated 22 May 2008, the OCA found respondent guilty of Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct and recommended that the penalty of dismissal with forfeiture of all benefits be meted out to her, with the application of any amount due her to the payment of the shortage. The OCA likewise recommended that: (1) respondent be directed to restitute the amounts of P600,051.81 (net of amount restituted) pertaining to the SJDF and P1,000.00 pertaining to the SGF per the Court's Resolution dated 10 January 2005; (2) the Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, be directed to compute all the benefits to which respondent is entitled and apply the same to the computed shortage; (3) the Legal Office, OCA, be directed to file the appropriate criminal charges against respondent; and 4) the request of Presiding Judge Numeriano Y. Galang of the Municipal Trial Court of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija that he be cleared of money accountability be denied pending the submission of his explanation for the shortage and the required proof of remittance/s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the OCA that respondent should be dismissed from the service.<br><br>There is no question with respect to the guilt of respondent as she herself admitted that she had misappropriated the amount of P600,051.81. To explain her misconduct, respondent reasoned that she was constrained to siphon off the amount to help her ailing sister.<br><br>The Court finds this profferred excuse unsatisfactory. Public servants are mandated to uphold public interest over personal needs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Certainly, no less can be expected from those involved in the administration of justice. Everyone, from the highest official to the lowest  rank employee  must  live up to the strictest norms of probity and integrity in the public service. Safekeeping of public and trust funds is essential to an orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Personal problems cannot justify the misuse by any court employee of judiciary funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Such are government funds, and public servants have absolutely no right to use them for their own purposes.<br><br>There is no doubt that respondent violated the trust reposed in her as a collecting officer of the judiciary. The fact that respondent is willing to pay her shortages does not free her from the consequences of her wrongdoing. The act of misappropriation of judiciary funds constitutes dishonesty and grave misconduct, which are grave offenses punishable by dismissal under Section 52, Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Her acts may, moreover, subject her to criminal liability. Verily, her grave misdemeanor justifies her severance from the service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, excluding accrued leave credits pursuant to current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>It is best to stress that dishonesty is a malevolent conduct that has no place in the judiciary. The Court has repeatedly warned that dishonesty, particularly that which amounts to malversation of public funds, will not be countenanced; or else, courts of justice may come to be regarded as mere havens of thievery and corruption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, respondent Librada S. Puno, Cash Clerk III of the Office of the Clerk of Court-Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City is found GUILTY of DISHONESTY and GRAVE MISCONDUCT. She is DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, excluding accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in the Government or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations. She is further ORDERED to restitute the amounts of P600,051.81 (net of amount restituted) pertaining to the Sheriff Judiciary Development Fund (SJDF) and P1,000.00 pertaining to the Sheriff General Fund (SGF) (now the Special Allowance for the Judiciary), per Resolution of the Court dated 10 January 2005.<br><br>The Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, is DIRECTED to compute all the benefits to which respondent Puno is entitled to be included in the restitution of the computed shortages.<br><br>The OCA is also ORDERED to coordinate with the prosecution arm of the government to ensure the expeditious prosecution of respondent Puno for her criminal liability.<br><br>Finally, the request of Presiding Judge Numeriano Y. Galang of the Municipal Trial Court of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija that he be cleared of money accountability is DENIED pending the submission of his explanation for the shortage and the required proof of remittance/s.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i> Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Reyes, Leonardo-De Castro, </i> and <i>Brion, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J</span>., no part.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p.  8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 36-37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 235.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 280-281.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 443-448.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 445.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 437-439.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 437-438.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 460.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 466.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 476-478.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 481-482.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 516-521.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 538-542.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 542.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees provides thus: Public officials and employees shall always uphold the public interest over and above personal interest.
