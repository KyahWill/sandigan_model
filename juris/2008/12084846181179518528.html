				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The core issue in this petition for review under Rule 45 is what constitutes a sufficient cause of action for a complaint for easement of right-of-way.&nbsp; Petitioners assail the August 13, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 85558, dismissing their petition for defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping, and the November 23, 2004 CA Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> rejecting their plea for reconsideration.&nbsp; In effect, the dismissal of petitioners’ complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-2001-60 before the Bacoor, Cavite Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19 was upheld by the CA.<br><br>Petitioner St. Michael School of Cavite, Inc. (St. Michael) is a duly registered non-stock corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> owned by petitioners-spouses Crisanto S. Claveria and Gloria M. Claveria. &nbsp;It is represented by petitioner Gloria M. Claveria. Respondents Masaito Development Corporation (Masaito) and Rexlon Realty Group, Inc. (Rexlon) are domestic corporations that own, operate, and manage Citihomes Molino IV, Bacoor, Cavite (Citihomes).&nbsp; St. Michael is located outside the northern perimeter fence of Citihomes. Its passageway occupies a portion of the 61-square meter lot described as Lot 4, Block 7, Phase 1 of Citihomes. The gate to the school is located at the subdivision’s northern perimeter fence and is the only entrance and exit for the entire school population.<br><br>On July 28, 1998, Rexlon informed petitioners that the value of the Citihomes lots when fully developed was PhP 3,872 per square meter as appraised by the Home Insurance and Guarantee Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> &nbsp;In a letter dated January 29, 2001, Masaito advised petitioners to purchase Lots 1-9, Block 7, Phase 1, fronting the school at PhP 3,579,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> &nbsp;On April 6, 2001, Masaito sent another offer to sell Lot 4, Block 7 of the subdivision with the right-of-way through the private roads/drainage facilities of Citihomes at the price of PhP 2 Million. &nbsp;Petitioners refused both proposals, reasoning that the school did not need the entire area mentioned in the first proposal. St. Michael also said that the second offer was grossly overpriced.<br><br>Petitioners, with four other homeowners, filed a complaint against respondents before the Bacoor, Cavite RTC, Branch 19 entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Michael School of Cavite, Inc., Spouses Crisanto S.

Claveria is expressly authorized by her co-petitioners to represent them in filing the petition for certiorari with the CA, evidenced by her Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> a Special Power of Attorney, and Secretary’s Certificate.&nbsp; They claim that there was no need for them to submit an Amended Verification as the three aforementioned documents satisfied the requirement.<br><br>In its November 23, 2004 Resolution, the CA stated:<br><blockquote>Considering that petitioners did not cure the first deficiency mentioned in Our August 13, 2004 Resolution dismissing the petition by submitting an amended verification and stating therein that the allegations in the petition <span style="font-weight: bold;">are true and correct not only of their personal knowledge but also based on authentic records</span>, the Court is constrained to deny their Motion for Reconsideration of said Resolution (emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>The CA erred.<br><br>Petitioners correctly point out that paragraph 3 of Sec. 4, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court uses the conjunction “or” not “and”:<br><blockquote>A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his personal knowledge <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">or</span> based on authentic records x x x .A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification based on “information and belief,” or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading.</blockquote>Moreover, petitioners, in their September 6, 2004 Urgent Motion for Reconsideration, attached the following:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; Affidavit executed by petitioner Gloria M. Claveria, stating:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; That I am one of the petitioners in <span style="font-weight: bold;">C.A.- G.R. SP [No.] 85558 for Certiorari with Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order</span> pending before the Special Tenth Division of the Court of Appeals;<br><br>2.&nbsp; That I hereby certify that I am duly authorized by my husband Crisanto S.

Claveria, Corporate Secretary of St. Michael, attesting that Mrs. Gloria M. Claveria is authorized to represent St. Michael as approved in a special meeting of the board of directors dated September 1, 2004.<br><br>We have held that the requirement regarding verification of a pleading is intended to assure that the pleading’s allegations are accurate, filed in good faith, and not the product of the imagination or a matter of speculation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While courts and litigants alike are directed to abide strictly by the procedural rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we have relaxed these rules on the basis of justifiable circumstances and substantial compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Although petitioners did not file their amended pleading to include the special power of attorney or board resolution authorizing Gloria M. Claveria to represent her co-petitioners, they, however, attached to their Urgent Motion for Reconsideration the special power of attorney; authorization signed by Crisanto S. Claveria for Gloria M. Claveria to make, sign, and execute all documents pertaining to the case; and the Board Resolution authorizing Gloria M. Claveria to represent the corporation. &nbsp;The submission of authorization, special power of attorney and certification issued by the corporate secretary is considered substantial compliance of the requirements under Rule 7, Sec. 4 of the Revised Rules of Court. We thus hold that petitioners were able to substantially comply with the requirements under the Rules of Court.<br><br>On the second issue. &nbsp;In its July 29, 2002 Order, the RTC resolved respondents’ Motion to Dismiss by holding that plaintiffs Pancho Navo, Vivencio Asuncion, Isaurito Hernandez, and Elias Namit, as parents of some of the students in petitioners’ school, have no cause of action to file the complaint for right-of-way. &nbsp;It ruled that the claimant in such an action must be the owner of a dominant estate and as such, the parents were not real parties-in-interest.<br><br>In its September 25, 2003 Order, the RTC resolved respondents’ Motion for Reconsideration by ruling that St. Michael is not a registered owner of any property that is the subject matter of the easement case, hence not a real party-in-interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;It thus dismissed the case because petitioners failed to state a cause of action against respondents.<br><br>Petitioners claim that the lower court’s orders are baseless. They argue that concrete evidence is necessary for a reliable judgment on the merits.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, contend that the initiatory pleading does not aver the first two basic requisites for the establishment of a legal easement of right-of-way: (1) that the dominant property is surrounded by estates of others and (2) there is no adequate outlet to a public highway.&nbsp; The rest of the co-plaintiffs, they point out, did not even allege if they are co-owners or possessors of any real right over the estate of the petitioners-spouses which is a requisite for the right to demand the establishment of a legal easement of right-of-way over a servient estate.<br><br>We held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dabuco v. Court of Appeals</span> that what is determinative in a dismissal for failure to state a cause of action is the sufficiency, not the veracity, of the material allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> These allegations, hypothetically speaking, must aver ultimate facts that constitute plaintiff’s cause of action which may entitle plaintiff to an advantageous decision as a matter of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>An examination of petitioners’ Complaint is necessary to determine if the lower court’s orders were in accordance with the law. Petitioners’ “allegations in support of plaintiffs’ demand for an easement of right-of-way” read:<br><blockquote>10. That the students, their parents, school teachers and school staff&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">who reside within Citihomes</span> (nearly 50% of the school population) including the four (4) plaintiffs namely Pancho R. Navo, Vivencio B. Asuncion, Isaurito S. Hernandez and Elias Namit who are parents of certain school children of St. Michael School of Cavite have incontrovertibly the full right of passage as well as the free right to use the roads, lanes and pathways of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> &nbsp;including those leading to and from the school;<br><br>11. That, for the last five (5) years, apart from the major access road shown in the Subdivision Plan, Annex “A,” the land area actually used by the school population to and from the school, inclusive of the passageway and the school gate is only a <span style="font-weight: bold;">portion</span> of a SIXTY-ONE (61) SQUARE METERS LOT described as Lot 4, Block 7 of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> owned and/or operated and managed by defendants;<br><br>12. That the school has only one (1) gate which serves as both entry and exit points for the entire school population which defendants threaten to fence off and to close;<br><br>13. That, other than the right of way fronting the school and shown in the Subdivision plan, Annex “A,” there are no other developed nor practical entry and exit points at the rear and at the two sides of the school site readily and immediately accessible for use by the school population as right of way and/or entrance to and exit from the school especially by those who reside within <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> including the four (4) plaintiffs/parents abovementioned which constitute almost 50% of the total school population;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>15. That through an appraisal report/letter dated <span style="font-weight: bold;">October 16, 1997</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">July 28, 1998</span> respectively, [plaintiffs] were advised by defendant Rexlon Realty Group, Inc. that the appraisal value of lots at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> when fully developed is P3,872.00 per square meter x x x;<br><br>16. That through a <span style="font-weight: bold;">letter dated June 16, 1998</span>, defendant Rexlon Realty Group, Inc. approved the use of the 61 square meters property described as Lot 4, Block 7 of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> as a right of way for plaintiff St. Michael School of Cavite x x x;<br><br>17. That, however, under a letter dated <span style="font-weight: bold;">January 29, 2001</span>, [plaintiffs] were advised by defendant Masaito Development Corporation that instead of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">sixty-one (61) square meter</span> property, Lot 4, Block 7, plaintiffs should instead purchase Lot 1-9, Block 7, phase I, of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> with a total lot area of one thousand and seventy-four (1,074) square meters at a total contract price of P3,759,000.00 which lots are all fronting the school x x x;<br><br>18. That, despite Annexes “D” and “D-1” of the complaint, on <span style="font-weight: bold;">April 6, 2001</span>, [plaintiffs] again received a new proposal from defendant Masaito Development Corporation proposing that plaintiff should pay the sum of P2,000.000.00 for the puchase of the sixty-one (61) square meters property, Lot 4, Block 7, Phase I, of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span>, plus the right to pass through the private roads/drainage facilities of said school x x x;<br><br>19. That plaintiffs do not need the entire 1,074 lot area covered by Lot 1-9, Block 7, Phase I, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> which exceeds the requirements for the school’s right of way; while plaintiffs find unacceptable defendant Masaito Development Corporation’s proposal for plaintiffs to pay the sum of P2,000,000.00 for the sixty-one (61) square meter property, Lot 4, Block 7 of Phase I, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> which amount is clearly unconscionable, excessive, unreasonable and unjust;<br><br>20. That plaintiffs and the school population only require a <span style="font-weight: bold;">portion</span> of the sixty-one (61) square meters property Lot 4, Block 7 of Phase I, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> for <span style="font-weight: bold;">their permanent right of way</span> and accept the price of P3,872.00 per square meter as reasonable as quoted in the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation’s appraisal report/letter, x x x;<br><br>21. That in support of plaintiffs’ application for the [above-described] right of way plaintiffs further state:<br><br>21-A. That the St. Michael School of Cavite is surrounded by immovable properties belonging to other persons including <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> owned and/or operated and managed by herein defendants such that plaintiffs and the school population have at present no immediate and adequate outlet to a public highway other than the major Access Road and the sixty-one (61) square meters lot of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> described in the Subdivision Plan, x x x;<br><br>21-B. That plaintiffs are willing and able to pay the proper indemnity to defendants pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code;<br><br>21-C That the isolation of plaintiffs’ property is not due to plaintiffs’ own acts but was caused by the expansion of the land area owned by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Citihomes</span> and the rapid increase in the number of homeowners which now has reached more than a thousand residents[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>Three elements must be present for a complaint to state a cause of action: (1) the legal right of the plaintiff, (2) the correlative obligation of the defendant, and (3) the act or omission of the defendant violating said legal right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; For a complaint to state a cause of action in an easement case, more specifically, Art. 649 of the Civil Code has laid down the following requirements: (1) the dominant estate is surrounded by other immovables and has no adequate outlet to a public highway; (2) there is payment of proper indemnity; and (3) the isolation is not due to the acts of the proprietor of the dominant estate.<br><br>We rule that the Complaint satisfies these three elements and thus sufficiently alleges a cause of action. The Complaint, <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, asserts that petitioners have a right to an easement of right-of-way that cuts across respondents’ property; <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, it refers to respondents’ correlative obligation not to fence off and close the single gate which is used as the only entry and exit points of the school population; and <span style="font-style: italic;">third</span>, it refers to respondents’ expansion and excessive terms and conditions, constituting the acts violating petitioners’ right. &nbsp;We thus hold that the Complaint’s material allegations are enough to entitle petitioners to a favorable judgment if these are assumed to be true.<br><br>The four corners of the initiatory pleading do not reveal any averment that the properties in question are bounded by public roads and there is an adequate access to a public highway. On the contrary, par. 13 of the Complaint alleges that “other than the right of way fronting the school and shown in the Subdivision Plan, Annex ‘A,’<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> there are no other developed nor practical entry and exit points at the rear and at the two (2) sides of the school site readily and immediately accessible for use by the school population x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Pars. 11 and 21-A of the Complaint as aforequoted confusingly refer both to a major “access road” and the sixty-one (61) square meter lot (Lot 4, Block 7 of Citihomes) as an immediate and adequate outlet to the public highway. The paragraphs are not equivocal about petitioner school’s lack of an adequate outlet to a public highway and give the impression that such road is an adequate outlet to a public highway.<br><br>A complete examination of the Complaint, however, unmistakably shows petitioners’ sufficient cause of action. To be more precise, Annexes “A,” “A-1,” and “A-2” plainly demonstrate that the requisites for a legal easement of right-of-way under Art. 649 of the Code have been met.<br><br>Annex “A” of the Complaint which is the location plan of Citihomes clearly shows that the school’s only access to the public highway is Lot 4, Block 7 that abuts the major “access road” of Citihomes which in turn is connected to the public highway. &nbsp;The photographs (Annexes “A-1”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and Annex “A-2”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the Complaint) showing the school building and adjoining areas easily reveal that it is bounded by other immovable properties, which explains why it only has one entry and exit point. Without the right-of-way on Lot 4, Block 7 of Citihomes, the school has no adequate access to a public highway. Annex “A,” as well as Annexes “A-1” and “A-2” of the Complaint, supports petitioners’ averments as these show that the school has a lone entry and exit point which is the right-of-way in front of the school.&nbsp; The reference to a major access road, therefore, must be understood in the context of all the allegations of fact contained in the Complaint. Petitioners’ cause of action is not solely found in the paragraphs referred to. The annexes cited likewise form part of the material allegations of the Complaint.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pars. 11 and 21-A of the Complaint and Annexes “A,” “A-1,” and “A-2” read together, the averments of the Complaint amply show a sufficient cause of action as prescribed by Art. 649 of the Code.</span><br><br>However, in the September 25, 2003 Order dismissing the case, the RTC made the following findings:<br><blockquote>Finding the Motion for Partial Reconsideration filed by the defendants to be well taken, it appearing that indeed the properties (the alleged dominant estates) of plaintiffs Sps. Crisanto S. Claveria and Gloria M. Claveria are bounded by public roads, hence, they have adequate outlet to a public highway.&nbsp; Likewise, insofar as plaintiff St. Michael School of Cavite, Inc., it is not a real party in interest considering that it is not the registered owner of any property subject matter of the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>It is settled that a motion to dismiss hypothetically admits the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Such being the case, the RTC erred when it apparently considered matters not embodied in the Complaint. The Complaint, contrary to the lower court’s Order, does not aver that the properties of petitioners-spouses are bounded by public roads. The location plan and photographs of the subject lot and the school building appended to the Complaint, without doubt, demonstrate that the lot and school building are enclosed, not by public roads, but by other lots in the subdivision.<br><br>The Court has previously held that it is not for the trial court to inquire into the truth or falsity of a complaint’s allegations before a hearing on its merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In ordering the dismissal, it is apparent that the trial court relied on matters not encompassed by the Complaint. This is proscribed by the rules and jurisprudence. The dismissal of the Complaint has thus no leg to stand on.<br><br>In the same matter, the trial court erred when it ruled that the school, not being the registered owner of the subject lot, is not a real party-in-interest.<br><br>It will suffice under Art. 649 of the Civil Code that “any person who by virtue of a real right may cultivate or use any immovable which is surrounded by other immovables pertaining to other persons and without adequate outlet to a public highway, is entitled to demand a right of way.”&nbsp; Clearly, the school is a real party-in-interest since it has established a right to use the passageway for the benefit of its students.&nbsp; More importantly, the records reveal that petitioners-spouses are the owners of the lot where the school is located and they are the incorporators, trustees, and officers of St. Michael.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; They are also authorized to represent the corporation in the complaint and subsequent actions.&nbsp; Thus, petitioners are real parties-in-interest and we rule that the dismissal of the complaint is patently erroneous and bereft of any legal basis.&nbsp; Petitioners must be allowed to pursue their case before the trial court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. &nbsp;The assailed August 13, 2004 and November 23, 2004 CA Resolutions in CA-G.R.
