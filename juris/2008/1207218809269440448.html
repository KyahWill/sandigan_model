Mandin, Provincial Auditor’s Office, Bohol,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> conducted a cash examination on the account of petitioner, who was then the acting municipal treasurer of Tubigon, Bohol.<br><br>Petitioner was absent on the first scheduled audit at his office on December 28, 1988. A radio message was sent to Loon, the town where he resided, to apprise him of the on-going audit. The following day, the audit team counted the cash contained in the safe of petitioner in his presence. In the course of the audit, the amount of P21,331.79 was found in the safe of petitioner.<br><br>The audit team embodied their findings in the Report of Cash Examination,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which also contained an inventory of cash items. Based on the said audit, petitioner was supposed to have on hand the total amount of P94,116.36, instead of the P21,331.79, incurring a shortage of P72,784.57.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The report also contained the Cash Production Notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated January 4, 1989, where petitioner was informed and required to produce the amount of P72,784.57, and the cash count sheet signed and acknowledged by petitioner indicating the correctness of the amount of P21,331.79 found in his safe and counted in his presence. A separate demand letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated January 4, 1989 requiring the production of the missing funds was sent and received by petitioner on <u>January 5, 1989</u>.<br><br>When asked by the auditing team as to the location of the missing funds, petitioner verbally explained that part of the money was used to pay for the loan of his late brother, another portion was spent for the food of his family, and the rest for his medicine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>As a result of the audit, Arlene R. Mandin prepared a memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated January 13, 1989 addressed to the Provincial Auditor of Bohol recommending the filing of the appropriate criminal case against petitioner.<br><br>On January 16, 1989, petitioner remitted to the Office of the Provincial Treasurer of Bohol the amounts of P10,000.00 and P15,000.00, respectively. On February 14, 1989, petitioner again remitted to the Provincial Treasurer an additional amount of P35,000.00, followed by remittances made on February 16, 1989 in the amounts of P2,000.00 and P2,784.00.<br><br>An administrative case was filed against petitioner on February 13, 1989.

Petitioner had then fully restituted his shortage in the amount of P72,784.57.

Perez, a public officer being then Acting Municipal Treasury of the said Municipality, by reason of the duties of his official position was accountable for the public funds collected and received by him, with grave abuse of confidence did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate, misapply, embezzle and take away from the said funds the total amount of SEVENTY-TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR PESOS and 57/100 (P72,784.57), which said fund was appropriated and converted by the said accused to his own personal use and benefit to the damage and prejudice of the government in the aforementioned amount.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On March 1, 1990, petitioner, duly assisted by counsel <i>de parte</i>, entered a plea of “not guilty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Pre-trial was initially set on June 4-5, 1990 but petitioner’s counsel moved for postponement. The Sandiganbayan, however, proceeded to hear the case on June 5, 1990, as previously scheduled, due to the presence of prosecution witness Arlene R. Mandin, who came all the way from Bohol.<br><br>On said date, the Sandiganbayan dispensed with pre-trial and allowed the prosecution to present its witness. Arlene R. Mandin testified as narrated above.<br><br>The defense presented evidence through petitioner Zenon R. Perez himself. He denied the contents of his first Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to the administrative case filed against him by the audit team. He claimed it was prepared without the assistance of counsel and that at the time of its preparation and submission, he was not in peak mental and physical condition, having been stricken with diabetes mellitus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>He then revoked his Answer dated February 22, 1989 and filed his second Answer dated March 2, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the latter, he vehemently denied that he incurred a cash shortage P72,784.57.<br><br>According to petitioner, the alleged shortage was in the possession and custody of his accountable personnel at the time of the audit examination. Several amounts totalling P64,784.00 were remitted to him on separate dates by his accountable officer, starting January 16, 1989 to February 16, 1989. The same were turned over by him to the Office of the Provincial Treasurer, leaving an unremitted sum of P8,000.00 as of February 16, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He remitted the P8,000.00 on April 17, 1989 to the Provincial Treasurer of Bohol, fully restoring the cash shortage.<br><br>Petitioner further testified that on July 30, 1989, he submitted his Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> before the Office of the Ombudsman, Cebu City and maintained that the alleged cash shortage was only due to oversight. Petitioner argued that the government did not suffer any damage or prejudice since the alleged cash shortage was actually deposited with the Office of the Provincial Treasurer as evidenced by official receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner completed his testimony on September 20, 1990. He rested his case on October 20, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Sandiganbayan Disposition</b><br></div><br>On September 24, 2003, the Sandiganbayan rendered a judgment of conviction with a <i>fallo</i> reading:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused ZENON R. PEREZ, <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds as defined in and penalized by Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code and, there being one mitigating circumstance without any aggravating circumstance to offset the same, is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> as the minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS and EIGHT (8) MONTHS of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as the maximum and to suffer perpetual special disqualification. The accused Zenon R.

On August 6, 2004, petitioner’s motion was denied with finality.<br><br>On September 23, 2004, petitioner resorted to the instant appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> raising the following issues, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE HON. SANDIGANBAYAN BY UNDULY AND UNREASONABLY DELAYING THE DECISION OF THE CASE FOR OVER THIRTEEN (13) YEARS <u>VIOLATED THE PETITIONER’S RIGHT TO SPEEDY DISPOSITION OF HIS CASE AND DUE PROCESS</u>.<br><br></li><li><u>THE LAW</u> RELIED UPON IN CONVICTING THE PETITIONER <u>AND THE SENTENCE IMPOSED IS CRUEL</u> AND THEREFORE VIOLATES SECTION 19 OF ARTICLE III (BILL OF RIGHTS) OF THE CONSTITUTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>Before addressing petitioner’s twin assignment of errors, We first tackle the propriety of petitioner’s conviction for malversation of public funds.<br><br><i><b>I. Petitioner was correctly convicted<br> of malversation.</b></i><br><br>Malversation is defined and penalized under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code. The acts punished as malversation are: (1) <i>appropriating</i> public funds or property, (2) <i>taking</i> or <i>misappropriating</i> the same, (3) <i>consenting</i>, or through <i>abandonment</i> or <i>negligence, permitting</i> any other person to take such public funds or property, and (4) being <i>otherwise</i> guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>There are four elements that must concur in order that one may be found guilty of the crime. They are:<br><blockquote>(a) That the offender be a public officer;<br><br>(b) That he had the <i>custody</i> or <i>control</i> of funds or property by <i>reason of the duties of his office</i>;<br><br>(c) That those funds or property involved were public funds or property <i>for which he is accountable</i>; and<br><br>(d) That he has appropriated, took or misappropriated or consented or, through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Evidently, the first three elements are present in the case at bar. At the time of the commission of the crime charged, petitioner was a public officer, being then the acting municipal treasurer of Tubigon, Bohol. By reason of his public office, he was accountable for the public funds under his custody or control.<br><br>The question then is whether or not petitioner has appropriated, took or misappropriated, or consented or through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take such funds.<br><br>We rule in the affirmative.<br><br>In malversation, all that is necessary to prove is that the defendant received in his possession public funds; that he could not account for them and did not have them in his possession; and that he could not give a reasonable excuse for its disappearance. <u>An accountable public officer may be convicted of malversation even if</u> there is no direct evidence of misappropriation and <u>the only evidence is shortage in his accounts which he has not been able to explain satisfactorily</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Verily, an accountable public officer may be found guilty of malversation even if there is no direct evidence of malversation because the law establishes a presumption that mere failure of an accountable officer to produce public funds which have come into his hands on demand by an officer duly authorized to examine his accounts is <i>prima facie</i> case of conversion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Because of the <i>prima facie</i> presumption in Article 217, the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused to adequately explain the location of the funds or property under his custody or control in order to rebut the presumption that he has appropriated or misappropriated for himself the missing funds. Failing to do so, the accused may be convicted under the said provision.<br><br>However, the presumption is merely <i>prima facie</i> and a rebuttable one. The accountable officer may overcome the presumption by proof to the contrary. If he adduces evidence showing that, in fact, he has not put said funds or property to personal use, then that presumption is at end and the <i>prima facie</i> case is destroyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner was not able to present any credible evidence to rebut the presumption that he malversed the missing funds in his custody or control. What is extant in the records is that the prosecution, through witness Arlene R. Mandin, was able to prove that petitioner malversed the funds under his custody and control. As testified by Mandin:<br><br><tdwidth="85%">Was Mr. Zenon Perez actually and physically present during the time of your cash examination?<br><br></tdwidth="85%"> <table width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Atty.

He there stated:<br><blockquote>1. That the circumstances surrounding the cash shortage in the total amount of P72,784.57 during the examination of the respondent’s cash accounts by the Commission on Audit on December 28-29, 1988 and January 4-5, 1989 are as follows, to wit:<br><blockquote>(a) That <b>respondent paid the amount of about P30,000.00 to the Philippine National Bank, Tagbilaran Branch as interests of the commercial loan of his late brother Carino R. Perez</b> using respondent’s house and lot as collateral thereof. If the interests would not be paid, the loan would be foreclosed to respondent’s great prejudice and disadvantage considering that he and his family are residing in said house used as collateral;<br><br>(b) That <b>respondent spent the amount of P10,000.00 in connection with the treatment of his toxic goiter</b>;<br><br>(c) That the <b>rest of the amount amounting to about P32,000.00 was spent by him for his family’s foods, clothings</b> (sic), <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> <b>education of his children</b> because his monthly salary is not enough for the needs of his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>By the explicit admission of petitioner, coupled with the testimony of Arlene R. Mandin, the fourth element of the crime of malversation was duly established. His conviction thus stands in <i>terra firma</i>.<br><br>True it is that petitioner filed another Answer on March 2, 1989 with the Office of the Provincial Treasurer of Bohol, substantially changing the contents of his earlier answer of February 22, 1989. His second Answer averred:<br><blockquote>3. That the truth of the matter is that the alleged total cash shortage of P72,784.57 were still in the possession and custody of his accountable personnel at the time of the examination held by the auditor of the Commission on Audit;<br><br>4. That out of the alleged cash shortage of P72,784.57, almost all of said amount were already remitted to him by his accountable personnel after January 5, 1989, and only the remaining amount of P8,000.00 remains to be remitted to him by his accountable personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>The sudden turnaround of petitioner fails to convince Us. To Our mind, petitioner only changed his story to exonerate himself, after realizing that his first Answer put him in a hole, so to speak.<br><br>It is contended that petitioner’s first Answer of February 22, 1989 should not have been given probative weight because it was executed without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>There is no law, jurisprudence or rule which mandates that an employee should be assisted by counsel in an administrative case. On the contrary, jurisprudence is in unison in saying that <u>assistance of counsel is not indispensable in administrative proceedings</u>.<br><br><b><i>Walang batas, hurisprudensiya, o tuntunin na nagsasabi na ang isang kawani ay dapat may tulong ng abogado sa isang kasong administratibo. Sa katunayan, ang hurisprudensiya ay iisa ang sinasabi na ang pagtulong ng isang abogado ay hindi kailangang-kailangan sa kasong administratibo.</i></b><br><br>The right to counsel, which cannot be waived unless the waiver is in writing and in the presence of counsel, is a right afforded a suspect or accused during custodial investigation. It is not an absolute right and may be invoked or rejected in a criminal proceeding and, with more reason, in an administrative inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ang karapatang magkaroon ng abogado, na hindi maaaring talikdan malibang ang waiver ay nakasulat at sa harap ng abogado, ay karapatang ibinibigay sa <u>suspek</u> o <u>nasasakdal</u> sa isang custodial investigation. Ito ay hindi lubos na karapatan at maaring hingin o tanggihan sa isang prosesong kriminal, at lalo na sa isang administratibong pagsisiyasat.</i></b><br><br>While investigations conducted by an administrative body may at times be akin to a criminal proceeding, the fact remains that under existing laws, a party in an administrative inquiry <i>may or may not be assisted by counsel</i>, irrespective of the nature of the charges and of respondent’s capacity to represent himself, and no duty rests on such body to furnish the person being investigated with counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Thus, the right to counsel is not imperative in administrative investigations because such inquiries are conducted merely to determine whether there are facts that merit disciplinary measures against erring public officers and employees, with the purpose of maintaining the dignity of government service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><b><i>Kung gayon, ang karapatang magkaroon ng abogado ay hindi sapilitan sa isang administratibong imbestigasyon sapagkat ito ay ginagawa lamang upang malaman kung may sapat na batayan na patawan ng disiplina ang nagkasalang opisyal o empleyado, para mapanatili ang dignidad ng paglilingkod sa pamahalaan.</i></b><br><br>There is nothing in the Constitution that says that a party in a non-litigation proceeding is entitled to be represented by counsel and that, without such representation, he shall not be bound by such proceedings. The assistance of lawyers, while desirable, is not indispensable. The legal profession was not engrafted in the due process clause such that without the participation of its members, the safeguard is deemed ignored or violated. The ordinary citizen is not that helpless that he cannot validly act at all except only with a lawyer at his side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>More than that, petitioner’s first Answer may be taken against him, as he executed it in the course of the administrative proceedings below. This is pursuant to Rule 130, Section 26 of the Rules of Court which provides that the “act, declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact may be given against him.” In <i>People v. Lising</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held:<br><blockquote>Extrajudicial statements are as a rule, admissible as against their respective declarants, pursuant to the rule that the act, declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact may be given against him. This is based upon the presumption that no man would declare anything against himself, unless such declarations were true. A man’s act, conduct and declarations wherever made, provided they be voluntary, are admissible against him, for the reason that it is fair to presume that they correspond with the truth and it is his fault if they are not.<br></blockquote>There is also no merit in the contention that petitioner’s sickness affected the preparation of his first Answer. He presented no convincing evidence that his disease at the time he formulated that answer diminished his capacity to formulate a true, clear and coherent response to any query. In fact, its contents merely reiterated his verbal explanation to the auditing team on January 5, 1989 on how he disposed of the missing funds.<br><br><b><i>II. There is no violation of the rights<br> to a speedy disposition of the case<br> and to due process of law.</i></b><br><br>We now discuss the right to a speedy trial and disposition, the balancing test, due process, and cruel and unusual punishment.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that his right to due process of law and to speedy disposition of his case was violated because the decision of the Sandiganbayan was handed down after the lapse of more than twelve years. The years that he had to wait for the outcome of his case were allegedly spent in limbo, pain and agony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Due process of law as applied to judicial proceedings has been interpreted to mean “a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds on inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Petitioner cannot complain that his right to due process has been violated. He was given all the chances in the world to present his case, and the Sandiganbayan rendered its decision only after considering all the pieces of evidence presented before it.<br><br>Petitioner’s claim of violation of his right to a speedy disposition of his case must also fail.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> guarantees the right of an accused to speedy <u>trial</u>. Both the 1973 Constitution in Section 16 of Article IV and the 1987 Constitution in Section 16 of Article III, Bill of Rights, are also explicit in granting to the accused the right to speedy <u>disposition</u> of his case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In <i>Barker v. Wingo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the United States Supreme Court was confronted for the first time with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> “rigid approaches” on speedy trial as “ways of eliminating some of the uncertainty which courts experience protecting the right.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The first approach is the “<b>fixed-time period</b>” which holds the view that “the Constitution requires a criminal defendant to be offered a trial within a specified time period.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The second approach is the “<b>demand-waiver rule</b>” which provides that “a defendant waives any consideration of his right to speedy trial for any period prior to which he has not demanded trial. Under this rigid approach, a prior demand is a necessary condition to the consideration of the speedy trial right.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The fixed-time period was rejected because there is “no constitutional basis for holding that the speedy trial can be quantified into a specific number of days or months.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The demand-waiver rule was likewise rejected because aside from the fact that it is “inconsistent with this Court’s pronouncements on waiver of constitutional rights,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> “it is insensitive to a right which we have deemed fundamental.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The Court went on to adopt a middle ground: the “<b>balancing test</b>,” in which “the conduct of both the prosecution and defendant are weighed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Mr. Justice Powell, <i>ponente</i>, explained the concept, thus:<br><blockquote><b>A balancing test necessarily compels courts to approach speedy trial cases on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</b> We can do little more than identify some of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right. <b>Though some might express them in different ways, we identify four such factors: Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.</b><br><br>The length of the delay is to some extent a triggering mechanism. Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance. <b>Nevertheless, because of the imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.</b> To take but one example, the delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is considerably less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.<br><br><b>Closely related to length of delay is the reason the government assigns to justify the delay.</b> Here, too, different weights should be assigned to different reasons. A deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government. A more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded courts should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant. Finally, a valid reason, such as a missing witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay. <b>We have already discussed the third factor, the defendant’s responsibility to assert his right.</b> Whether and how a defendant asserts his right is closely related to the other factors we have mentioned. <b>The strength of his efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the reason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always readily identifiable, that he experiences.</b> The more serious the deprivation, the more likely a defendant is to complain. The defendant’s assertion of his speedy trial right, then, is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right. <b>We emphasize that failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.</b><br><br><b>A fourth factor is prejudice to the defendant. Prejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.</b> This Court has identified <b>three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.</b> Of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past. Loss of memory, however, is not always reflected in the record because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Philippine jurisprudence has, on several occasions, adopted <u>the balancing test</u>.<br><br>In 1991, in <i>Gonzales v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court ruled:<br><blockquote>It must be here emphasized that the right to a speedy disposition of a case, like the right to speedy trial, is deemed violated only when the proceeding is attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or when unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured, or when without cause or justifiable motive a long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his case tried. <u>Equally applicable is the balancing test</u> used to determine whether a defendant has been denied his right to a speedy trial, or a speedy disposition of a case for that matter, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed, and such factors as length of the delay, reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion or non-assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay, are considered. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Subsequently, in <i>Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> this Court again enumerated the factors that should be considered and balanced, namely: (1) length of delay; (2) reasons for the delay; (3) assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused; and (4) prejudice caused by the delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Once more, in <i>Mendoza-Ong v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> this Court reiterated that the right to speedy disposition of cases, like the right to speedy trial, is violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In the determination of whether said right has been violated, particular regard must be taken of the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The conduct of both the prosecution and defendant, the length of the delay, the reasons for such delay, the assertion or failure to assert such right by accused, and the prejudice caused by the delay are the factors to consider and balance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the determination of whether the delays are of said nature is relative and cannot be based on a mere mathematical reckoning of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Measured by the foregoing yardstick, We rule that petitioner was not deprived of his right to a speedy disposition of his case.<br><br>More important than the absence of serious prejudice, petitioner himself did not want a speedy disposition of his case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Petitioner was duly represented by counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de parte</span> in all stages of the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan.

The matter could have taken a different dimension if during all those twelve years, petitioner had shown signs of asserting his right to a speedy disposition of his case or at least made some overt acts, like filing a motion for early resolution, to show that he was not waiving that right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Currit tempus contra decides et sui juris contempores</span>: Time runs against the slothful and those who neglect their rights. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ang panahon ay hindi panig sa mga tamad at pabaya sa kanilang karapatan.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Vigilantis sed non dormientibus jura in re subveniunt.</span> The law aids the vigilant and not those who slumber in their rights. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ang batas ay tumutulong sa mga mapagbantay at hindi sa mga humihimbing sa kanilang karapatan.</span><br><br>Pending his conviction by the Sandiganbayan, petitioner may have truly lived in suspicion and anxiety for over twelve years. However, any prejudice that may have been caused to him in all those years was only minimal. The supposed gravity of agony experienced by petitioner is more imagined than real.<br><br>This case is analogous to <span style="font-style: italic;">Guerrero v. Court of Appeals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> There, the Court ruled that there was no violation of petitioner’s right to speedy trial and disposition of his case inasmuch as he failed seasonably to assert his rights:<br><blockquote>In the present case, there is no question that petitioner raised the violation against his own right to speedy disposition only when the respondent trial judge reset the case for rehearing. It is fair to assume that he would have just continued to sleep on his right – a situation amounting to laches – had the respondent judge not taken the initiative of determining the non-completion of the records and of ordering the remedy precisely so he could dispose of the case. The matter could have taken a different dimension if during all those ten years between 1979 when accused filed his memorandum and 1989 when the case was re-raffled, the accused showed signs of asserting his right which was granted him in 1987 when the new Constitution took effect, or at least made some overt act (like a motion for early disposition or a motion to compel the stenographer to transcribe stenographic notes) that he was not waiving it. As it is, his silence would have to be interpreted as a waiver of such right.<br><br>While this Court recognizes the right to speedy disposition quite distinctly from the right to a speedy trial, and although this Court has always zealously espoused protection from oppressive and vexatious delays not attributable to the party involved, at the same time, we hold that a party’s individual rights should not work against and preclude the people’s equally important right to public justice. In the instant case, three people died as a result of the crash of the airplane that the accused was flying. It appears to us that the delay in the disposition of the case prejudiced not just the accused but the people as well. Since the accused has completely failed to assert his right seasonably and inasmuch as the respondent judge was not in a position to dispose of the case on the merits due to the absence of factual basis, we hold it proper and equitable to give the parties fair opportunity to obtain (and the court to dispense) substantial justice in the premises.<br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">III.

That is borne by the records.<br><br>It bears stressing that the full restitution of the amount malversed will not in any way exonerate an accused, as payment is not one of the elements of extinction of criminal liability. Under the law, the refund of the sum misappropriated, even before the commencement of the criminal prosecution, does not exempt the guilty person from liability for the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> At most, then, payment of the amount malversed will only serve as a mitigating circumstance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> akin to voluntary surrender, as provided for in paragraph 7 of Article 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> in relation to paragraph 10<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of the same Article of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>But the Court also holds that aside from voluntary surrender, petitioner is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of no intention to commit so grave a wrong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> again in relation to paragraph 10 of Article 13.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The records bear out that petitioner misappropriated the missing funds under his custody and control because he was impelled by the genuine love for his brother and his family.

Evidently, there was no intention to commit so grave a wrong.<br><br>Of course, the end does not justify the means. To condone what petitioner has done because of the nobility of his purpose or financial emergencies will become a potent excuse for malefactors and open the floodgates for more corruption in the government, even from “small fry” like him.<br><br>The bottom line is a guilty person deserves the penalty given the attendant circumstances and commensurate with the gravity of the offense committed. Thus, a reduction in the imposable penalty by one degree is in order. Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code is explicit:<br><blockquote>Art. 64.
