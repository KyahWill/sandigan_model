The findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are ordinarily not subject to review by this Court as they are deemed conclusive; but not when the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts are conflicting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>There is one serious flaw that the trial court committed: its failure to require the court-appointed surveyors - considering that there are quite a number of irregularities in the certificates of title of the parties - to conduct an extensive investigation of the titles of the parties.<br><blockquote>The case of overlapping of titles necessitates the assistance of experts in the field of geodetic engineering. The very reason why commissioners were appointed by the trial court, upon agreement of the parties, was precisely to make an evaluation and analysis of the titles in conflict with each other. Given their background, expertise and experience, these commissioners are in a better position to determine which of the titles is valid. Thus, the trial court may rely on their findings and conclusions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>It was the duty of the trial court, considering the magnitude and extent of the issues presented and the questions that arose from a careful examination of the parties' respective certificates of title, to have required the appointed surveyors of the DENR to investigate and trace the parties' respective titles, conduct a comprehensive survey, study and analysis of the boundaries, distances and bearings thereof, and submit an exhaustive report thereon.  Given their expertise and experience, they would have been able to satisfactorily perform the required task.  Yet the court did not.  As a matter of fact, the services of the government surveyors were not even secured by court initiative; the trial court even threatened to do away with the testimonies of the state surveyors when their presence in court could not be guaranteed. It was through the auspices of the respondents that they were brought to court.  To make matters worse, the parties did not even pay the required fees for the survey; the court did not compel them.<br><br>In overlapping of titles disputes, it has always been the practice for the court to appoint a surveyor from the government land agencies - the Land Registration Authority or the DENR - to act as commissioner.  Given that the trial court here did not, we are now left to make do with the two-page report of the state surveyors and decide the case with what evidence is made available to us by the parties' respective expert witnesses as well, which - for the most part - must be received with caution as their testimonies are understandably self-serving.<br><blockquote>The crux of the matter, however, lies in ascertaining whether there really is overlapping of boundaries of the properties of the movants for intervention and that of the private respondent. As We scrutinize carefully the claim of each party based on survey readings and plottings appearing on the plans submitted as annexes, We find that the same have not passed the rigid test of accuracy and authenticity as should be determined by precision instruments duly verified by accredited surveyors. <i>Indeed, each claim may appear to be as good and self-serving as the other</i>. And since the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts, the veracity and correctness of the alleged overlapping is better left to those scientifically qualified, trained and experienced and whose integrity is beyond question and dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The present petition calls only for the settlement of the overlapping issue, barring direct and collateral attacks on each of the parties' respective certificates of title, which require different proceedings for the ventilation thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The trial court, in dismissing the case, held primarily that respondents failed to overcome the burden of establishing their claim of overlapping.  It stated that the respondents' titles - whose tie points are based on mere PLS monuments (which are not fixed, and are therefore not in accordance with Sec. 36 of the Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>) cannot prevail as against the petitioner's, which has a fixed tie or reference point.  Simply put, a PLS monument is not one of the reference points enumerated in Section 36 of the Manual, and cannot be used to defeat petitioner's title. Secondly, the trial court held that Nerit, given his training and expertise as surveyor, should have detected the overlap - if there was one - in his 1960 survey of TCT 18250, and not suddenly discover it only in 1990.  Thirdly, the presence of the old <i>adobe</i> wall as early as the 1960s and the absence of any protest or objection from Nerit or the Madrigals (then owner of the SUSANA title) militate against the present claim of overlap and encroachment.<br><br>The appellate court, however, found that there is an encroachment, and the cause thereof may be traced to a change in the technical description of the petitioner's title (which was derived from TCT 578) when it was subdivided on November 10, 1920.  The appellate court held that the respective northeastern boundaries of the ERIDANUS, CHITON and CAMBRIDGE titles should be "<b>S.21'deg.56'55"E</b>" but the CAMBRIDGE title indicates "<b>N.25 deg. 07'W</b>". Yet TCT 578 carries the same bearing as the ERIDANUS and CHITON properties, "S.21'deg.56'55"E".  This change in the technical description, according to the appellate court, caused the encroachment by the petitioner's property on the respondents' land.  The appellate court ratiocinated that it was precisely for this reason that in 1960, Nerit found no encroachment during his subdivision survey of the SUSANA lot: because TCT 578 still carried the bearing "S.21'deg.56'55"E".  When he conducted his 1990 survey, which among others included the petitioner's title (with the new and different bearing "N.25 deg. 07'W") as basis, he naturally found an overlap.<br><br>What the trial and appellate courts overlooked, however, was that out of the four expert witnesses presented, three of them (the government surveyor <b>De Lara</b>, respondents' witness <b>Lim</b>, and petitioner's witness <b>Sison</b>) categorically admitted that a change in the tie or reference point results in an overlap; or, more accurately, that a change in the tie or reference point has a corresponding <b>effect</b> on the survey.<br><br>What has been made clear by the law and practice is that PLS monuments have given way to Bureau of Lands Location Monument (BLLM) No. 1, which shall "always be used as the tie point."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  In so doing (disregarding PLS monuments for the BLLM), such process somehow affects the integrity of the survey.<br><br>Thus, <b>De Lara</b> testified that if he plotted the respondents' properties on the basis of the common boundary (lines 1 to 2) between the adjacent AYALA and SUSANA properties as stated in the technical description of the SUSANA title, there would be no overlapping of boundaries between petitioner's and respondents' titles;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> on the other hand, if the survey were conducted based on the respondents' respective titles which do not have a tie line or tie point, there would be an overlap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  De Lara claims, moreover, that the alleged encroachment is really a "technical overlapping."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  <b>Lim</b>, on the other hand, testified - on re-direct examination - that when the reference point or tie point is changed, the azimuth lines and azimuth tie lines of the (respondents') property are likewise changed, but not the location thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> <b>Sison</b>, witness for the petitioner, testified on cross-examination that when a tie point is changed, an overlapping is caused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a <b>reliable</b>, if not accurate, verification survey; barring one, no overlapping or encroachment may be proved successfully, for obvious reasons.  In the wake of the majority expert opinion that by changing the tie or reference point from a PLS to a BLLM 1 monument, a corresponding effect on the survey occurs - which can include a change in boundaries and, at worst, an overlap - the Court is not prepared to declare that an accurate survey of the respondents' properties has been made as to be a <i>proper</i> basis of the present claim of encroachment or overlap.<br><br>Likewise, we cannot see how a change in the bearings of the CAMBRIDGE property from "S.21'deg.56'55"E" in TCT 578 to "N.25 deg. 07'W" in the CAMBRIDGE title can cause an overlap of respondents' properties.  This has not been sufficiently shown by respondents' evidence to be the cause of the overlap. Respondents' key witness Nerit does <i>not</i> believe that the CAMBRIDGE title was a derivative of TCT 578, because there is nothing in the title thereof which indicates that it was derived from the latter; he was ambivalent, if not ambiguous, and definitely far from categorical, in this respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>  State surveyor De Lara's testimony and Report - inconclusive and incomplete as it is - does not help or indicate any. Likewise, a thorough examination of TCT 578 shows that it has no similar boundary and bearings with the CAMBRIDGE title. Finally, the CAMBRIDGE title explicitly declares that it is derived from TCT No. 363717/T-1823, and not TCT 578.<br><br>Thus, for failure of the respondents to prove that the CAMBRIDGE title is a derivative of TCT 578, the <i>conclusion</i> that a change in the technical description of the former - as compared to that of the latter - is the reason for the overlap, simply does not follow.  The appellate court is in clear error.<br><br>Finally, we agree with the trial court's observation that the continuous presence of the old <i>adobe</i> wall diminishes the case for the respondents.  It was only in 1989 that the wall became an ungainly sight for respondents.  Previous owners of what now constitutes the respondents' respective lots did not complain of its presence. The wall appears to have been built in the 1960s, and yet the Madrigals (SUSANA title owners) did not complain about it; if they did, Nerit would have known and testified to the same since he was responsible for the subdivision of the lot.  Only respondents complain about it now. In one overlapping of boundaries case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Court held that a land owner may not now claim that his property has been encroached upon when his predecessor did not register any objections at the time the monuments were being placed on the claimed encroached area; nor did the latter make any move to question the placement of said monuments at the time.<br><br>Courts exist to dispense justice through the determination of the truth to conflicting claims.  A party comes to court equipped with the tools that will convince the court that his position is more viable than the other's.  He may not hesitate to employ any method, means or artifice of persuasion that will sway the sympathies of the court in his favor.  As we have said before, indeed, <i>each claim may appear to be as good and self-serving as the other</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In the quest for truth, a court often encounters concerns that necessitate not only the application of the various principles of law, but likewise precepts of the exact sciences, various disciplines of study or fields of human endeavour about which the judge may not be knowledgeable or skilled, and which concerns he is not prepared to resolve, unless with the aid and intervention of or through the medium of learned and experienced disinterested experts.<br><br>An example lies precisely in the area of land boundary disputes.

Taking this to mind, we cannot grant the respondents' prayer without violating the very principles of the Torrens system. They have failed to lay the proper foundation for their claim of overlap.  This is precisely the reason why the trial court should have officially appointed a commissioner or panel of commissioners and not leave the initiative to secure one to the parties: so that a <i>thorough</i> investigation, study and analysis of the parties' titles could be made in order to provide, in a comprehensive report, the necessary information that will guide it in resolving the case completely, and not merely leave the determination of the case to a consideration of the parties' more often than not self-serving evidence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
