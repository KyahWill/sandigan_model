It bears emphasizing at this juncture that under Section 5 of Rule 18, it is the failure of the <u>plaintiff</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to appear during pre-trial when so required which is a cause for dismissal of the action; and that the <u>plaintiff-herein petitioner was already present in court,</u> together with a care-giver, at the time the case was called.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals, by the challenged August 29, 2006 Decision, narrated the factual milieu of the case, thus:<br><blockquote>As culled from the records, it appears that during the scheduled Pre-Trial Conference of this case on October 1, 1998 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning, the parties and counsel for the defendants were present.  Counsel for the plaintiff was not around.  As alleged in the Appellant's Brief, <u>plaintiff's counsel arrived at the premises of the trial court at 8:55 o'clock</u> in the morning of the said day but was <b><u>not allowed to enter the court room</u>, </b>"When he succeeded in gaining entry into the court room, <u>the public <b>respondent judge shouted at him and ordered him to step out"</b></u> only to learn later that "upon verification at the Office of the Branch Clerk of Court that the case was dismissed because when he called the herein counsel for the plaintiff-appellant was not yet in court, and additionally the pre-trial brief for the plaintiff was not yet on file.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>After observing as follows, however,<br><blockquote>. . . [T]he Pre-trial brief serves as a guide during the pre-trial conference so as to simplify, abbreviate and expedite the trial.  If not, indeed, to dispense with it.  It is an essential device to the speedy disposition of disputes, and parties cannot brush it aside as a mere technicality.  Thus, if a party is allowed to serve the brief at any time after the scheduled pre-trial or, on the date of the pre-trial, the purposes of the procedure is defeated as the parties will not be given sufficient time to study the proposals of the adverse party and to decide whether or not to accept the same,<br></blockquote>and citing the following injunction of this Court in <i>Saguid v. CA</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><blockquote>"Pre-trial rules are not to be belittled or dismissed because their non-observance may result in prejudice to a party's substantive rights.  Like all rules they <u>should be <b>followed except </b><b>only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thought[less]ness in not complying with the procedure</b>,"</u> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>the appellate court sustained the trial court's earlier-quoted conclusion that petitioner "did not come forward with the most persuasive reasons. . ."<br><br>In his present petition, petitioner pleads that justice would be best served if the Complaint would be reinstated, he invoking Article 24 of the Civil Code which states:<br><blockquote>In all contractual, property or other relations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when one of the parties is at a disadvantage</span> on account of his moral dependence, ignorance, indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the courts must be vigilant for his protection</span>.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The dismissal of a complaint for failure to file pre-trial brief is discretionary on the part of the trial court.<br><blockquote>Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court (Rules) mandates that parties shall file with the court and serve on the adverse party their pre-trial briefs at least three days before the scheduled pre-trial.  The Rules also provide that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure to file the pre-trial brief shall have the same effect as failure to appear at the pre-trial</span>.  Therefore, plaintiff's failure to file the pre-trial brief shall be cause for dismissal of the action.<br><br>The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the trial court had "no discretion" on the matter of a party's failure to file a pre-trial brief.  If the trial court has discretion to dismiss the case because of plaintiff's failure to appear at pre-trial, then the trial court also has discretion to dismiss the case because of plaintiff's failure to file the pre-trial brief. Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether an order of dismissal should be maintained under the circumstances of a particular case or whether it should be set aside depends on the sound discretion of the trial court.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div></blockquote>While petitioner's counsel's explanation behind his failure to file pre-trial brief may not be convincing, given, among other considerations, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the  plaintiff-herein petitioner's presence when the case was called for pre-trial, the nature of the case, the subject involved</span> - real properties located in Las Piñas City, and the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eventual appearance in the court of petitioner's </span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">counsel</span> </b>whose claim that he was, on arrival  initially barred from entering it and was even shouted upon by the trial judge has not been disputed, the dismissal of the case by the trial court had been too precipitate and was not commensurate with the level of non-compliance by petitioner's counsel with the order of the court.  The following ruling of this Court is instructive:<br><blockquote>. . . The precipitate haste of the lower court in declaring the respondent bank non-suited was uncalled for and deserved a second look.  Considering the fact that the <b>counsel for the plaintiff/respondent bank <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did arrive for the pre-trial conference, though a bit late</span> </b>and that counsel for the defendant was himself also late, the <b style="text-decoration: underline;">trial court should have called the case again</b>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An admonition to both counsel to be more prompt in appearing before the Court as scheduled</span> would have sufficed, instead of having dismissed the complaint outright.<br><br>Unless a party's conduct is so negligent, irresponsible, contumacious, or dilatory as to provide substantial grounds for dismissal for non-appearance, the courts should consider lesser sanctions which would still amount into achieving the desired end.<br><br>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inconsiderate dismissals, even if without prejudice, do not constitute a panacea nor a solution to the congestion of court dockets; while they lend a deceptive aura of efficiency to records of individual judges, they merely postpone the ultimate reckoning between the parties.  </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">In the absence of clear lack of merit or intention to delay, justice is better served by a brief continuance, trial on the merits, and final disposition of the cases before the court.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">" </span><br><br>And there is authority that an order dismissing a plaintiff's complaint without prejudice for failure of his counsel to appear at a pre-trial conference must be reversed as too severe a sanction to visit on a litigant where the record is devoid of evidence reflecting the litigant's willful or flagrant disregard for the Court's authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The phrase "in the interest of substantial justice" is not, of course, a magic wand that would automatically compel the suspension of procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  But exigencies and situations might occasionally demand flexibility in their application.  Considering the circumstances attendant to the present case which are reflected above, substantial justice can be best served if both parties are given the full opportunity to ventilate their respective claims in a full-blown trial.<br><br>The Court notes petitioner's Manifestation dated May 22, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> before the appellate court that the case had been pending before the Court of Appeals for almost five years since August 2000; that there was a case of forgery and falsification of public documents, docketed as I.S. No. 05-2126, pending before the Office of the City Prosecutor, in which the therein respondents Spouses Alvendia filed an Urgent Motion for Suspension of Proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on the ground of prejudicial question; and that to the Manifestation was attached Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Questioned Document Report No. 128-05<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which concluded that the submitted specimen signature of petitioner and his purported signature in the documents involved in the case "were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> written by one and the same person." The records do not show whether respondent Spouses Alvendia's Motion to Suspend Proceedings in the said criminal complaint was granted. What is clear is that the case at bar had been unduly prolonged, hence, the urgency of proceeding with the case with utmost dispatch.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the assailed August 29, 2006 Decision and February 16, 2007 ­­­­­­ Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
