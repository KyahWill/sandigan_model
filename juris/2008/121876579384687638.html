She also claimed that during the night of the shooting incident, Romualde brought with him the amount of P50,000.00 in his wallet, but the same was no longer recovered.

The latter were fearful of reprisals from unknown individuals. No evidence was likewise adduced on their behalf. Also, the other employees who worked as guest relations officers in the RML Canteen and who likewise witnessed the incident were said to have absconded already.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>For the defense, appellant Robert Buduhan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> testified that on the evening of 24 July 1998, he was at their boarding house in Poblacion, Maddela, Quirino, together with Rudy Buduhan, Boyet Ginyang, and Boy Guinhicna. The group drank one bottle of San Miguel Gin, and then went to sleep. Unknown to him and Guinhicna, Rudy and Ginyang still went out to continue their drinking sessions. While he was sleeping, Ginyang arrived and woke him up. Ginyang told him that they had to go to the beerhouse where he (Ginyang) and Rudy had been to because something might have happened to Rudy, as there was a fight there. Robert, Ginyang and Guinhicna then proceeded to look for Rudy. On their way there, at the junction of the National Highway, they encountered some policemen who asked them where they were headed. When Robert said that they were looking for Rudy, the policemen told them to board the police vehicle and the group was given a ride. As it turned out, Robert's group was taken to the Municipal Jail of Maddela where they were detained. The policemen went out to look for Rudy and they likewise put him in jail. The following day, the policemen confiscated the shirts worn by the group. They were also taken to Santiago City where paraffin tests were conducted. On the evening of 26 July 1998, the policemen went to the jail with three ladies who were asked to identify Robert's group. The ladies, however, did not recognize Robert and his companions.<br><br>Boyet Ginyang<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> testified that on 24 July 1998, at 10:00 p.m., he and Rudy went to a beerhouse in Maddela, Quirino. After ordering some drinks and chatting, they suddenly heard gunshots from the outside. Looking towards the direction of the sound, he saw somebody fall to the ground and at that point, he and Rudy ran to get away from the place. While running towards their boarding house, Rudy was stopped by an unknown armed person in a white T-shirt. When Ginyang reached the boarding house, he roused appellant Robert and Guinhicna from their sleep and asked them to go with him and search for Rudy. Upon reaching the junction at the National Highway, they were halted by a man who asked where they were heading. After hearing their story, the man said they should wait for a vehicle that would help them look for Rudy. When the vehicle arrived, he and the others were brought to the municipal jail. Thereafter, Rudy was likewise picked up by the police and detained with the group. On the morning of 25 July 1998, three ladies were brought to the municipal jail to identify his group, but the former did not recognize them. On the morning of 26 July 1998, Ginyang and his three companions were brought to Santiago City where they were made to undergo paraffin testing. Afterwards, the group was brought back to the municipal jail in Maddela, Quirino. Ginyang also testified that the policemen took the shirts they wore on the night of 24 July 1998, but he could not remember when they did.<br><br>Police Inspector Maria Leonora Chua-Camarao<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> testified that she was the one who conducted the examination proper of the paraffin casts taken from Robert Buduhan, Rudy Buduhan, Boyet Ginyang and Boy Guinhicna. She likewise brought before the trial court the original Letter Request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> of the Maddela Police Station for the conduct of paraffin casting; the Letter of Request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> addressed to the Officer-in-Charge the PNP Crime Laboratory in Region 2 for the conduct of paraffin examination; and the paraffin casts of subjects Rudy, Ginyang, Guinhicna and Robert.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Police Inspector Chua-Camarao explained that the purpose of conducting a paraffin test was to determine the presence of gunpowder residue in the hands of a person through extraction using paraffin wax. The process involves two stages: first, the paraffin casting, in which the hands of the subject are covered with paraffin wax to extract gunpowder residue; and second, the paraffin examination per se, which refers to the actual chemical examination to determine whether or not gunpowder residue has indeed been extracted. For the second stage, the method used is the diphenyl amine test, wherein the diphenyl amine agent is poured on the paraffin casts of the subject's hands. In this test, a positive result occurs when blue specks are produced in the paraffin casts, which then indicates the presence of gunpowder residue. When no such reaction takes place, the result is negative.<br><br>The findings and conclusion on the paraffin test that Police Inspector Chua-Camarao conducted were contained in Physical Science Report No. C-25-98<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> which yielded a negative result for all the four accused. Nonetheless, the forensic chemist pointed out that the paraffin test is merely a corroborative evidence, neither proving nor disproving that a person did indeed fire a gun. The positive or negative results of the test can be influenced by certain factors, such as the wearing of gloves by the subject, perspiration of the hands, wind direction, wind velocity, humidity, climate conditions, the length of the barrel of the firearm or the open or closed trigger guard of the firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Appellant Rudy Buduhan testified that at past 10:00 p.m. of 24 July 1998, he and Ginyang went to a beerhouse. Shortly after ordering their drinks, they heard gunshots, and a person seated near the door fell. They then ran towards the road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> While running, an armed man wearing a white T-shirt held him, while Ginyang was able to get away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> After a while, the police arrived and they took him to the Maddela police station where he was jailed along with Robert, Ginyang and Guinhicna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The rest of his testimony merely corroborated the testimonies of Robert and Ginyang.<br><br>Reynaldo Gumiho (Reynaldo)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> testified that on the evening of 24 July 1998, he was in Poblacion, Maddela, Quirino, for a business transaction involving the sale of a 6x6 truck with a certain <i>alias</i> Boy. At about 8:00 p.m., Reynaldo and Boy proceeded to a beerhouse in Maddela. After settling with their drinks, Reynaldo heard a group of five men near their table who were conversing and he recognized from the accent of their voices that they were from Lagawe (Ifugao). One of the men then told him that they should leave after finishing their drinks because the former were looking for someone who killed their relative. Reynaldo disclosed that he recognized one of the persons whom he usually saw in Lagawe, and that the group was composed of relatively tall people who were mostly wearing jackets. Not long after, Reynaldo and Boy left the beerhouse so as not to get involved in any trouble. Two days after he left Maddela, Reynaldo learned of the shooting incident in the beerhouse.<br><br>In a Decision dated 24 July 2003, the trial court found appellants guilty of the charges, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court renders judgment as follows:<br><br>1) Finding accused Robert and Rudy, both surnamed Buduhan, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide (Par. 1 Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code) with respect to the deceased Larry Erese and sentences each of them to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua;<br><br>2) As to the victim Romualde Almeron, the court also finds them GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Homicide (Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code) and sentences each of them to the indeterminate penalty of 12 years of Prision Mayor as minimum to 20 years of Reclusion Temporal as maximum;<br><br>However, they shall be entitled to a deduction of their preventive imprisonment from the term of their sentences in accordance with Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A.

CR-HC No. 01940.<br><br>On 29 December 2006, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the July 24, 2003 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Maddela, Quirino, Branch 38, in Civil Case No. 39-18, is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> only in that, in addition to the award already given by the trial court, in consonance with current jurisprudence, the heirs of ERESE are also entitled to moral damages of P50,000 and in addition to the award already given by the trial court, the heirs of ALMERON are also entitled to moral damages of P50,000.00.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 13(c), Rule 124 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure as amended by A.M.

They fault the trial court's over-reliance on the testimony of the prosecution's main witness and its failure to consider the glaring inconsistencies in Cherry Rose's previous accounts of the shooting incident.<br><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>Appellants insist that Cherry Rose is not a credible witness in view of the conflicting answers she gave in her sworn statement before the police,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> in the preliminary investigation of the case and in her testimony in open court. They contend that the trial court failed to scrutinize the entirety of the statements made by Cherry Rose <i>vis-à-vis</i> the shooting incident.<br><br>Appellants called attention to the fact that during the preliminary investigation of the case, Cherry Rose stated that a man wearing a white Giordano T-shirt shot Larry after Larry handed his wristwatch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Thereafter, when Cherry Rose was asked whom she saw wearing a white Giordano T-shirt, she pointed to Boy Guinhicna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> With respect to appellant Robert Buduhan, Cherry Rose identified him as the one who shot Orlando Pascua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In the testimony of Cherry Rose in open court, however, she identified appellant Robert as the man who was wearing a white Giordano T-shirt and who shot Larry Erese.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Also, in Cherry Rose's sworn statement before the police, she narrated that the group of the appellants, consisting of five persons, was already inside the RML Canteen before the shooting incident occured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> However, in her direct examination, Cherry Rose stated that appellant Robert had only three other companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Finally, in the preliminary investigation, appellants pointed out that Cherry Rose unhesitatingly admitted that Larry Erese was her intimate boyfriend and that was why she embraced him after the latter was shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In her cross-examination, however, Cherry Rose stated that Larry was only a customer and not her boyfriend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> When questioned about her prior statement about this fact given during the preliminary investigation, Cherry Rose changed her answer and said that Larry was indeed her boyfriend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Taking all these circumstances into account, appellants argue that, judging from the conflicting statements of Cherry Rose, the identification of the accused is highly doubtful.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>As between statements made during the preliminary investigation of the case and the testimony of a witness in open court, the latter deserves more credence. Preliminary investigations are commonly fairly summary or truncated in nature, being designed simply for the determination, not of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, but of probable cause prior to the filing of an information in court. It is the statements of a witness in open court which deserve careful consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In any event, Section 13, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, on the matter of inconsistent statements by a witness, is revealing:<br><blockquote>Section 13. <i>How witness impeached by evidence of inconsistent statements</i>. <i>-- </i>Before a witness can be impeached by evidence that he has made at other times statements inconsistent with his present testimony, the statements must be related to him, with the circumstances of the times and places and the persons present, and he must be asked whether he made such statements, and if so, allowed to explain them. If the statements be in writing they must be shown to the witness before any question is put to him concerning them.<br></blockquote>The rule that requires a sufficient foundation to be first laid before introducing evidence of inconsistent statements of a witness is founded upon common sense and is essential to protect the character of a witness. His memory is refreshed by the necessary inquiries, which enable him to explain the statements referred to and to show that they were made by mistake, or that there was no discrepancy between them and his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the statements made by Cherry Rose during the preliminary investigation with respect to the identities of the accused were not related to her during the trial. Indeed, it is only during the appeal of this case that appellants pointed out the supposed inconsistencies in Cherry Rose's identification of the appellants in order to destroy her credibility as a witness. No opportunity was ever afforded her to provide an explanation. Without such explanation, whether plausible or not, we are left with no basis to evaluate and assess her credibility, on the rationale that it is only when no reasonable explanation is given by a witness in reconciling her conflicting declarations that she should be deemed impeached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>In this regard, what the defense brought to Cherry Rose's attention during the trial were her contradictory statements about her romantic relationship with Larry Erese. As a result of this confrontation, Cherry Rose changed her answer. We rule, however, that this inconsistency relates only to an insignificant aspect of the case and does not involve a material fact in dispute.<br><br>Inasmuch as the above-stated mandatory procedural requirements were not complied with, the credibility of Cherry Rose as a witness stands unimpeached. As found by the trial court, the testimony of Cherry Rose was straightforward throughout. The appellants were not able to adduce any reason or motive for her to bear false witness against them. As a matter of fact, Cherry Rose testified during cross-examination that she did not personally know appellant Robert, and that she had first seen him only during the night when the shooting incident took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>As the trial judge who penned the assailed decision did not hear the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the rule granting finality to the factual findings oftrial courts does not find applicability to the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>After a careful review of the entire records of this case, the Court finds no reason to disagree with the factual findings of the trial court that all the elements of the crime of Robbery with Homicide were present and proved in this case.<br><br>Robbery with Homicide is penalized under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 294. <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons-Penalties</i>. - Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><br>1. The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<br></blockquote>To warrant conviction for the crime of robbery with homicide, one that is primarily classified as a crime against property and not against persons, the prosecution has to firmly establish the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property with the use of violence or intimidation against the person; (2) the property thus taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or <i>animus lucrandi</i>; and (4) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, the crime of homicide, which is therein used in a generic sense, is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>In Robbery with Homicide, so long as the intention of the felon is to rob, the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery. It is immaterial that death would supervene by mere accident, or that the victim of homicide is other than the victim of robbery, or that two or more persons are killed. Once a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, the felony committed is the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The original design must have been robbery; and the homicide, even if it precedes or is subsequent to the robbery, must have a direct relation to, or must be perpetrated with a view to consummate, the robbery. The taking of the property should not be merely an afterthought, which arose subsequently to the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>With respect to the elements of the crime, the following excerpts from the direct testimony of Cherry Rose clearly illustrates the same, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>PROVINCIAL PROSECUTOR FERDINAND D.

At this point, there already occurred the taking of personal property that belonged to another person, which was committed with violence or intimidation against persons.<br><br>Likewise, the intent to gain may already be presumed in this case. <i>Animus lucrandi</i> or intent to gain is an internal act, which can be established through the overt acts of the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> The unlawful act of the taking of Larry's watch at gunpoint after the declaration of a hold-up already speaks well enough for itself. No other intent may be gleaned from the acts of the appellant's group at that moment other than to divest Larry of his personal property.<br><br>The appellants acted in conspiracy in perpetrating the crimes charged. As found by the trial court, conspiracy was proved by the concurrence of the following facts: that the four men were together when they entered the RML canteen; that they occupied the same table; that they were all armed during that time; that while the robbery was in progress, neither Rudy nor the one in blue T-shirt with black jacket prevented the robbery or the killing of the victims; that all four fired their firearms when the robbery was going on and that they fled all together and were seen running by the police before they were intercepted just a few meters from the scene of the crime.<br><br>There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. The same degree of proof necessary to prove the crime is required to support a finding of criminal conspiracy. Direct proof, however, is not essential to show conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Proof of concerted action before, during and after the crime, which demonstrates their unity of design and objective is sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>As the fatal shooting of both Larry Erese and Romualde Almeron happened on the occasion of the robbery and was subsequent thereto, both of the appellants must be held liable for the crime of Robbery with Homicide on two counts.<br><br>The defense of appellants of alibi is at best weak when faced with the positive identification of the appellants by the prosecution's principal witness. It is elemental that for alibi to prosper, the requirements of time and place must be strictly met. This means that the accused must not only prove his presence at another place at the time of the commission of the offense but he must also demonstrate that it would be physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> In the present case, there was absolutely no claim of any fact that would show that it was well nigh impossible for appellants to be present at the <i>locus criminis</i>. In fact, they all testified that they were going towards the vicinity of the area of the shooting incident when the police apprehended them.<br><br>The testimonies of Robert Buduhan and Boyet Ginyang were also markedly inconsistent on the material date as to when the witnesses in the shooting incident identified them. Robert Buduhan testified that the three lady witnesses came to identify them at the municipal jail on the evening of 26 July 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> However, in the direct examination of Boyet Ginyang, he testified that said witnesses arrived on the morning of 25 July 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> This fact only tends to lend suspicion to their already weak alibi.<br><br>Appellants likewise cannot rely on the negative findings of Police Inspector Chua-Camarao on the paraffin tests conducted in order to exculpate themselves. The said witness herself promptly stated that paraffin test results are merely corroborative of the major evidence offered by any party, and they are not conclusive with respect to the issue of whether or not the subjects did indeed fire a gun. As previously mentioned, the positive and negative results of the paraffin test can also be influenced by certain factors affecting the conditions surrounding the use of the firearm, namely: the wearing of gloves by the subject, perspiration of the hands, wind direction, wind velocity, humidity, climate conditions, the length of the barrel of the firearm or the open or closed trigger guard of the firearm.<br><br>Lastly, the persistent claim of appellants of the illegality of their warrantless arrest, due to the lack of personal knowledge on the part of the arresting officers, deserves scant consideration. As aptly stated in <i>People v. Salazar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> granting <i>arguendo</i> that appellants were illegally arrested, such arrest did not invest these eyewitness accounts with constitutional infirmity as "fruits of the poisonous tree." Considering that their conviction could be secured on the strength of the testimonial evidence given in open court, which are not inadmissible in evidence, the court finds no reason to further belabor the matter.<br><br>A determination of the appropriate imposable penalties is now in order.<br><br>The prescribed penalty for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. In accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, when the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, and there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br>The RTC and the Court of Appeals thus correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>As regards the charge for the death of Orlando Pascua and the injuries sustained by Fernando Pera and Gilbert Cortez, the trial court aptly held that the prosecution failed to substantiate the same. No witnesses were presented to testify as to the circumstances leading to the said incidents, and neither were they proved to be caused by the criminal actions of the appellants.<br><br>The two courts below committed a mistake, however, in convicting the appellants separately of the crime of Homicide for the death of Romualde Almeron. It bears stressing that in the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide, so long as the intention of the felon is to rob, the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery. It is immaterial that death would supervene by mere accident, or that the victim of homicide is other than the victim of robbery, or that two or more persons are killed. Once a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, the felony committed is the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>As to the award of damages, we hold that the heirs of Larry Erese and Romualde Almeron are each entitled to the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>. This award for civil indemnity is mandatory and is granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals' grant of moral damages in this case even in the absence of proof for the entitlement to the same. As borne out by human nature and experience, a violent death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the victim's family. It is inherently human to suffer sorrow, torment, pain and anger when a loved one becomes the victim of a violent or brutal killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> The heirs of Erese and Almeron are thus entitled to moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each.<br><br>On the award of actual damages, we hold that the heirs of Larry Erese are entitled to the award of temperate damages for P25,000.00, in lieu of the lower amount of P18,000 that was substantiated by a receipt. In <i>People v. Villanueva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> we have laid down the rule that when actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, the award of temperate damages for P25,000.00 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount. Conversely, if the amount of actual damages proven exceeds P25,000.00, then temperate damages may no longer be awarded. Actual damages based on the receipts presented during trial should instead be granted.<br><br>However, with respect to the award of the amount of P38,000.00 to the heirs of Romualde Almeron, the same is incorrect since the receipt presented therefor covers only the amount of P26,000.00. The award of actual damages should be reduced accordingly. The grant of temperate damages to the heirs of Almeron is thus deleted.<br><br>The award of exemplary damages is likewise deleted, as the presence of any aggravating circumstance was neither alleged nor proved in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision dated 29 December 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

If only to ensure utmost circumspection before the penalty of death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment is imposed, the Court now deems it wise and compelling to provide in these cases a review by the Court of Appeals before the case is elevated to the Supreme Court. Where life and liberty are at stake, all possible avenues to determine his guilt or innocence must be accorded an accused, and no care in the evaluation of the facts can ever be overdone. A prior determination by the Court of Appeals on, particularly, the factual issues, would minimize the possibility of an error of judgment. <b>If the Court of Appeals should affirm the penalty of death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment, it could then render judgment imposing the corresponding penalty as the circumstances so warrant, refrain from entering judgment and elevate the entire records of the case to the Supreme Court for its final disposition</b>.
