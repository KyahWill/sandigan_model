The trial court found her credible and gave full faith and credit to her testimony as sufficient to sustain the conviction of the accused-appellant of rape in all three counts, thus:<br><br>x x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has reviewed the records of this case, including the respective pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, and finds no reason to overturn the verdict of guilt handed down by the RTC and affirmed by the CA.<br><br>To determine the innocence or guilt of an accused in a&nbsp; rape case, the courts are guided by three well-entrenched&nbsp; principles: (1) an accusation of&nbsp; rape can be made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of&nbsp; rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these guiding&nbsp; principles,&nbsp; credibility becomes the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>AAA categorically testified that her father sexually abused her on the dates stated in the Informations.<br><br>As regards the rape that occurred on August 22, 1997, AAA testified:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Why were you awakened?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Maglente</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote> When the offended party is a young and immature girl testifying against a parent, courts are inclined to lend credence to her version of what transpired. Youth and immaturity are given full weight and credit. Incestuous rape is not an ordinary crime that can be easily invented because of its heavy psychological toll.&nbsp; It is unlikely that a young woman of tender years would be willing to concoct a story which would subject her to a lifetime of gossip and scandal among neighbors and friends and even condemn her father to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Like the RTC and the CA, the Court has no reason to doubt AAA's credibility.&nbsp; Her testimony was candid and straightforward.<br><br>Appellant interposed the defense of denial, which is inherently a weak defense.&nbsp; Mere denial of involvement in a crime cannot take precedence over the positive testimony of the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The fact that it took a long time for AAA to report her father's transgressions does not mitigate her credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, appellant threatened to kill AAA and her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, telling people that one has been raped by her own father is not easy to do, and a girl of AAA's age cannot be expected to know how to go about reporting crimes to the proper authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the Court has constantly ruled that:<br><blockquote> x x x [D]elay in making a criminal accusation [does not] impair the credibility of a witness if such delay is satisfactorily explained. In <i>People v. Coloma</i>, x x x the Court adverted to the father's moral and physical control over the young complainant in explaining the delay of eight years before the complaint against her father was made. In this case, [complainant] must have been overwhelmed by fear and confusion, and shocked that her own father had defiled her. x x x She also testified that she was afraid to tell her mother because the latter might be angered x x x. Indeed, a survey conducted by the University of the Philippines Center for Women's Studies showed that victims of rape committed by their fathers took much longer in reporting the incidents to the authorities than did other victims. Many factors account for this difference: the fact that the father lives with the victim and constantly exerts moral authority over her, the threat he might make against her, the victim's fear of her mother and other relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court also cannot subscribe to appellant's argument that AAA was merely instigated by her mother BBB to file the complaints against him due to BBB's anger with him when he left his family and went to Manila. Suffice it to say that such argument is not uncommon in rape cases.&nbsp; The Court has repeatedly held that it is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an instrument of malice, especially if it will subject them to embarrassment and even stigma.&nbsp; No mother in her right mind would expose her daughter to the disgrace and trauma resulting from a prosecution for rape if she was not genuinely motivated by a desire to incarcerate the person responsible for her daughter's defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant miserably failed to show that her "anger" was such that BBB would senselessly use her daughter as an instrument of revenge against him and subject her to the trauma of being internally examined by a doctor and exposed to the rigors of police and court proceedings, not to mention the ignominy attached to a rape victim by insensitive neighbors and townmates.<br><br>Appellant harps on the alleged statements of the examining physician that there were no external injuries on AAA's body or that the laceration on her hymen could be caused by many factors.&nbsp; Case law has it that in view of the intrinsic nature of rape, the only evidence that can be offered to prove the guilt of the offender is the testimony of the offended party.&nbsp; Even absent a medical certificate, her testimony, standing alone, can be made the basis of conviction if such testimony is credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the absence of external injuries does not negate rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, even the absence of spermatozoa is not an essential element of rape.&nbsp; This is because in rape, the important consideration is not the emission of semen but the penetration of the female genitalia by the male organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>All told, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the heinous crimes alleged in this case.<br><br>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides that the death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any aggravating/qualifying circumstances enumerated thereunder, one of which is when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.&nbsp; The three separate Informations filed in this case all contained the allegations of AAA's minority and her relationship with appellant, which were proved by competent evidence during the trial. Hence, the imposition of the death penalty was proper.<br><br>However, with the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9346, effective June 24, 2006, prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty to be imposed on appellant in this case is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, without eligibility for parole, as provided in Section 2, paragraph (a) thereof.&nbsp; The Court has ruled that R.A. No. 9346 has retroactive effect, to wit:<br><blockquote> The aforequoted provision of R.A. No. 9346 is applicable in this case pursuant to the principle in criminal law, <i>favorabilia sunt amplianda adiosa restrigenda</i>. Penal laws which are favorable to accused are given retroactive effect.&nbsp; This principle is embodied under Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code, which provides as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>However, appellant is not eligible for parole because Section 3 of R.A. No. 9346 provides that "persons convicted of offenses punished with reclusion perpetua, or whose sentences will be reduced to reclusion perpetua by reason of the law, shall not be eligible for parole."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>On the award of damages for each count of rape, the CA modified the award made by the RTC.&nbsp; The Court modifies it further.&nbsp; The CA's award of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00 is proper inasmuch as the death penalty was originally imposed on appellant.&nbsp; The award of exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 is likewise proper.&nbsp; As regards moral damages, however, the CA affirmed the RTC's award of P50,000.00.&nbsp; This should be increased to P75,000.00 in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals Decision dated March 31, 2006 is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with<b> </b><b>MODIFICATION</b> in that appellant is ordered to pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as&nbsp; exemplary&nbsp; damages, for each count of rape or a total of P525,000.00.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Carpio Morales, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Reyes, Leonardo-De Castro</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ.</span>, On official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In line with the Court's ruling in <i>People v.
