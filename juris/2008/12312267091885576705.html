				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In mid-1994, Linda Uy Lim (petitioner) and her husband Saturnino Lim (Saturnino), also known as "Amay Lim," executed a Special Power of Attorney (SPA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in favor of respondents Philip Ong (Ong) and Helen Tong (Helen), president and treasurer, respectively, of their co-respondent Propmech Corporation (the corporation) where Saturnino worked as sales manager. The SPA authorized Ong and Helen:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> <u>To MORTGAGE or ENCUMBER</u> the properties described hereinbelow in favor of any individual, person or entity <u>for the purpose of obtaining or securing a loan, indebtedness or monetary obligation:</u><br><br>"<u>Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-50103</u>"<br><br>A parcel of land x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>of which we are the registered owners as evidenced by TCT No. T-50103 of the Registry of Deeds of General Santos City; and<br><br></li><li> <u>To TRANSMIT, APPLY, and REMIT the entire proceeds</u> of the mortgage to PHILIP L. ONG and/or HELEN O. TONG, their heirs, successors or assigns, <u>for the purpose of fully satisfying the outstanding obligations of the principals herein;</u> and<br><br></li><li> To MAKE, EXECUTE, SIGN and DELIVER any and all pertinent documents and/or instruments relative to the foregoing authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</li></ol></blockquote>The property subject of the SPA covered by TCT No. T-50103 was registered on September 21, 1992 in the name of petitioner "Linda U. Lim . . . married to Saturnino Lim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> About <u>two years from the execution of the SPA or on May 8, 1996,</u> the property was made the subject of a Real Estate Mortgage executed by Lim's attorney-in-fact Helen in favor of the corporation to secure a "P1,000,000 obligation" which the Lim spouses purportedly obtained from it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The Deed of Real Estate Mortgage contained, among other things, the following provision:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><ol start="2"><li> It is the essence of this contract that if the MORTGAGORS shall well and truly pay or cause to be paid their obligation of ONE MILLION PESOS (P1,000,000.00) on or before June 30, 1996, then this Mortgage shall become null and void and of no effect; otherwise, the same shall remain in full force and effect and shall be enforceable in the manner provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In late 1996, petitioner received a Notification of Foreclosure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the mortgage. She subsequently received a Sheriff's Notice of Public Auction Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> scheduled on January 8, 1997, drawing her to file on January 3, 1997 before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> against attorneys-in-fact Helen and Ong, along with the corporation and Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff Atty. Elmer Lastimosa, for annulment of mortgage, injunction and damages with application for temporary restraining order. <br><br>Petitioner claimed that her husband Saturnino, from whom she had in the meantime been separated and had not heard from, obtained her signature on the SPA through fraud by representing to her that the purpose was to secure a loan with which to build a house; that she had never been indebted to, and had not received any amount from the corporation, hence, the Real Estate Mortgage is null and void; and that the property subject of the mortgage which she claims to be her paraphernal property "was actually being sequestered to answer and pay for certain shortages and other liabilities incurred by her husband in the course of [his] employment with the defendant corporation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The sheriff cancelled/deferred the sale of the property scheduled on January 8, 1996 until further advice from the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In their Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> respondents Helen, Ong, and the corporation alleged that petitioner co-signed the SPA empowering the first two respondents to mortgage the property for "the purpose of fully satisfying the[ir] outstanding obligation"; and that petitioner received the amount of P405,000 [<i>sic</i>] in 1994 and November 1995 from respondents representing "a portion of the loan . . . for the purpose of building a house." <br><br>On February 17, 1997, Branch 22 of the General Santos City RTC ordered the Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff, his agents, and deputies to cease and desist from proceeding with the public auction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the property.<br><br>Evidence for respondents shows as follows: <br><br>In 1994, on the request of petitioner and her husband, the corporation granted them a loan of P400,000, evidenced by checks and deposit slips.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The corporation later discovered that Saturnino misappropriated corporate funds bringing his total obligation, including the P400,000 loan, to P1,000,000. When confronted about the misappropriated amount, Saturnino and petitioner begged the corporation not to file any case against Saturnino, they promising to pay the obligation within a reasonable period. Ong and Helen agreed. The spouses welched on their promise, however, hence, Helen, as attorney-in-fact, executed the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and subsequently indorsed it to the sheriff for foreclosure proceedings.<br><br>By Decision of October 30, 2001, the trial court declared that the Real Estate Mortgage was legally executed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and accordingly dismissed petitioner's complaint. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the trial court's decision. Her Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> petitioner filed the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> alleging that the Court of Appeals erred in <br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>. . . <u>UPHOLDING THE VALIDITY OF THE SPURIOUS SPECIAL POWER OF ATTORNEY AND THE CONSEQUENT REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE</u> IN A MANNER CONTRARY TO LAW AND THE SETTLED PRONOUNCEMENTS OF THIS HONORABLE TRIBUNAL.<br><br><center>II</center><br>X X X <u>IN UPHOLDING THE COURT A QUO'S FINDINGS THAT THE PARAPHERNAL PROPERTY OF THE PETTITIONER-APPELLANT IS LIABLE TO THE ALLEGED PERSONAL DEBT OF HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND</u> ABSENT ANY PROOF THAT THE SAME REDOUNDED TO THE FAMILY'S BENEFIT.<br><br><center>III</center><br>X X X IN DENYING THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Fraud is never presumed, and intentional acts to deceive and deprive another of his right or in some manner injure him must be specifically alleged and proved by the plaintiff by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <br><br>By petitioner's admission, she read the SPA before signing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She is a college graduate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> who had worked as a Regional Operations Clerk of Metrobank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It is inconceivable that she did not understand the contents of what she was signing. In fact, her allegation in her complaint that she agreed to sign the SPA believing that the "intention and purpose behind the same was to secure a loan <u>with which to build the house</u> that [she] had long dreamed of to be erected [on] the lot in question"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> confirms that she agreed to authorize the attorneys-in-fact to perform the acts therein enumerated including encumbering the property by way of mortgage. <br><br>That petitioner and her husband indeed obtained and received the proceeds of a P400,000 loan, respondents were able to prove via testimonial and documentary evidence:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><p align="justify">[ATTY.
