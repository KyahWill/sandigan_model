SP No. 02615.  Said Resolution denied petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to enjoin the Office of the Ombudsman from implementing its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 29 March 2007 placing the petitioners herein under preventive suspension for a period of six months, pending investigation.<br><br>The undisputed facts of the case are set forth hereunder:<br><br>On 9 to 15 January 2007, the Philippines successfully played host to the 12<sup>th</sup> Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit, which was held in the province of Cebu.<br><br>The preparations therefor were undertaken only in the year 2006 or less than a year before the designated date of the Summit.<br><br>Several cause-oriented groups<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> wrote a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated 9 January 2007 to Honorable Virginia Palanca-Santiago, the Director of the Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office (PACPO) of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Visayas, urging the latter to investigate some allegedly anomalous transactions involving the preparations for the ASEAN Summit.  In particular, the letter pointed out to the overpriced procurement of decorative lamp posts and streetlights, which were installed along the ceremonial routes in the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, and Lapu-Lapu.  Said letter was docketed as CPL-V-07-0033.<br><br>Subsequently, Crisologo Saavedra, the Project Manager of the joint venture company Pelican/Cebesos that previously offered to sell and install decorative street lights in Cebu City, likewise submitted supplemental evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to PACPO Director Palanca-Santiago to prove that the decorative lamp posts and streetlights actually installed were indeed severely overpriced.<br><br>After the conduct of an investigation, a Final Evaluation Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was submitted to PACPO Director Palanca-Santiago on 23 March 2007.  The Report stated that the project for the procurement and installation of decorative lamp posts and street lighting facilities along the ceremonial routes of the 12<sup>th</sup> ASEAN Summit in the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, and Lapu-Lapu pertained to the national government through the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).  In the implementation of the said project, the local chief executives of the aforementioned cities were made to select the designs of the lamp posts to be installed in their areas of jurisdiction, subject to the approval of the DPWH.  The City Engineer's Office of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu prepared their own Program of Works and Estimates (POWE) for the project, with the approval of their respective City Mayors; while the DPWH Regional Office No. VII prepared that of Cebu City.  The POWE submitted by the cities contained the detailed list of the equipment, personnel, and total expenditure requirements for the part of the project within their respective jurisdiction.<br><br>Still, according to the PACPO Report, comparing in detail the costs of the lamp posts and street lighting facilities as specified in the POWE prepared by the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the costs for the same as indicated in the importation documents and price quotations from the suppliers, it could be determined that the former prices were as much as ten (10) times more than the latter.<br><br>Thus, the PACPO investigating team concluded that there was indeed <i>prima facie</i> evidence of overpricing, resulting from the collusion between the contractors, Gampik Construction and Development Corp. (Gampik) and Fabmik Construction and Equipment Co., Inc. (Fabmik), who supplied and installed the street lighting facilities and decorative lamp posts; the City Government of Lapu-Lapu, as represented by herein petitioners City Mayor Arturo O. Radaza and City Engineers Julito H. Cuizon, Fernando T. Taga-An, Jr., and Rogelio D. Veloso; the City Government of Mandaue, as represented by its City Mayor and City Engineers; and the Department of Public Works and Highways Region VII Officials.<br><br>Consequently, the Report recommended the filing of a criminal case for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, paragraph 3(e)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> against all the individuals involved, as well as an administrative case for Dishonesty/Misconduct against the erring public officials.<br><br>Accordingly, an administrative complaint for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct was filed against the public officials involved, including petitioners, before the Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas), docketed as <b>Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 29 March 2007, Ombudsman Ma. Merceditas N. Gutierrez issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C, to the following effect:<br><blockquote>Respondent DPWH-Region VII, Mandaue City and Lapu-Lapu City officials are the signatories to the Program of Work covering their respective areas of jurisdiction.  On the other hand, respondent DPWH-VII [Bids and Awards Committee] Chairman and Members were the officials responsible for the conduct of the supposed bidding. Thus, taking into consideration how respondents are so closely involved, complainants now allege that respondents, in conspiracy among each other and with the private contractors, can be said to be the very people who orchestrated the subject overpricing of lighting facilities.<br><br>The Final Evaluation Report of the PACPO-Visayas, setting forth in detail the circumstances behind the alleged overpricing of lampposts, and its numerous attachments which are mostly public documents, constitutes strong evidence of guilt.  Moreover, in view of the flagrant nature of the acts complained of, the administrative charge definitely involves Grave Misconduct, which on another perspective might possibly advance further to include destruction or tampering of important official documents.  For prudence' (sic) sake, measures, (sic) should be taken so as to ensure a fair and reliable progress of this investigation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as warranted by aforesaid insight on the circumstances of the case, above-named respondents [including petitioners herein] are hereby placed under <b>PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION for a period of six (6) months,</b> pending investigation.</blockquote>Without seeking reconsideration of the above order, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals on 2 April 2007 a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> under Rule 65 with [a] Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 02615.<br><br>Petitioners contended that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the order for their preventive suspension since there was no strong evidence of guilt to warrant the issuance of the said order.  According to the petitioners, the procurement and installation of decorative lamp posts and street lighting facilities in the City of Lapu-Lapu were entirely the project of the national government.  They argue that the POWE of Lapu-Lapu City, upon which their participation was based, was prepared by DPWH-Region VII and they merely signed the same given that the project was already pressed for time.  Petitioners likewise claimed entitlement to a TRO and/or a Preliminary Injunction as they asserted that the issuance of the order of preventive suspension was a clear violation of their rights <i>in esse</i> and its impending enforcement would inflict grave injustice and irreparable injury on their part.<br><br>On the same day, 2 April 2007, the Court of Appeals issued the assailed Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in which it resolved as follows:<br><blockquote>Addressing petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a TRO, this Court finds no cogent and compelling reason to issue the same.</blockquote>Aggrieved, petitioners filed on 3 April 2007 a Very Urgent Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> thereon, arguing, <i>inter alia</i>, that the order for their preventive suspension violated the provisions of Section 261(x) of the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> prohibiting the suspension of elective officials during the election period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> without the approval of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC); and deprived the petitioners of their salaries for the duration of the preventive suspension.  Petitioners reiterated therein their prayer for the issuance of a TRO against the implementation of the order for their preventive suspension.<br><br>On 4 April 2007, the Court of Appeals resolved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to direct the respondent Office of the Ombudsman to comment on the afore-mentioned motion within ten (10) days from notice.<br><br>In the meantime, on 3 April 2007, the office of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), Region VII duly implemented the order for the preventive suspension of petitioner Radaza.  This fact was confirmed by Rene K. Burdeos, Regional Director of the DILG in Region VII, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> addressed to Ombudsman Ma. Merceditas N. Gutierrez, which reads:<br><blockquote>Dear Hon. Gutierrez:<br><br>Please be advised that <b>we have implemented the preventive suspension for six (6) months on Mayor Arturo O. Radaza of Lapu-lapu (sic) City on April 03, 2007</b>, and on Mayor Thadeo Z. Ouano of Mandaue City on April 04, 2007.<br><br>The implementation of your Order dated March 29, 2007, was carried out through the issuance of separate Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to the respondent mayors by [Secretary of Interior and Local Government] Ronaldo V.

Merceditas N. Gutierrez, Deputy Ombudsman Virginia Palanca-Santiago, the DILG, Acting Mayor of Lapu-Lapu City Norma R. Patalingjug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and private complainant Crisologo Saavedra<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to comment on the Petition at bar.<br><br>On 27 April 2007, petitioners filed an Urgent Motion to Resolve Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order with Manifestations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> stating therein that the order of preventive suspension upon petitioner Radaza had already caused damage to his bid for re-election as Mayor of Lapu-Lapu City.  Petitioners further manifested that they had just obtained a copy of the Final Evaluation Report by PACPO and averred that their involvement in the alleged anomalous transactions was not clearly set forth therein.<br><br>Petitioners eventually filed on 4 June 2007 a Motion to Withdraw Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for Being Moot and Academic,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> praying that their petition be considered withdrawn with respect to petitioner Radaza in view of his re-election as Mayor of Lapu-Lapu City, thereby rendering moot the issue of the validity of his preventive suspension.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 13 June 2007, the Court granted the above-mentioned Motion to Withdraw Petition insofar as petitioner Radaza was concerned and noted without action petitioners' Urgent Motion to Resolve Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order with Manifestations.<br><br>On 29 June 2007, the Ombudsman duly filed its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> arguing that petitioners failed to exhaust available ordinary remedies before filing their petition before this Court and the Ombudsman did not act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order of preventive suspension against the petitioners.<br><br>On 12 December 2007, the Court ordered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> petitioners to file their Reply to the Comment of the Ombudsman.<br><br>During the pendency of the present Petition before this Court, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> on 24 January 2008, dismissing petitioners' Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 02615.  The appellate court noted that petitioner Radaza was successfully re-elected during the 14 May 2007 elections and the six-month period of preventive suspension imposed upon the petitioners had already lapsed, the same having been served on April 2007 and which ended on October 2007.  Hence, the Court of Appeals found it already unnecessary to further discuss the issues raised by the petitioners as their Petition had become moot.<br><br>In the meantime, on 31 January 2008, the Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas) rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C, ordering the dismissal from service of petitioners Cuizon, Taga-an, Jr., and Veloso.  The dispositive portion partly reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, x x x.<br><br>Likewise there being substantial evidence showing that respondents x x x, JULITO H. CUIZON, FERNANDO T.

They cited therein the fact that the Court had previously granted petitioner Radaza's Motion to Withdraw Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and petitioners Cuizon, Tagaan, Jr., and Veloso have already completed the service of the period of their suspension.<br><br>Upon being ordered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to comment on the petitioners' Manifestation and Motion, the Ombudsman interposed no objection to the same.<br><br>The Court finds that the Petition at bar has indeed become moot and academic.  By virtue of the supervening events that transpired after the filing of the instant Petition on 11 April 2007, the same has ceased to present a justiceable controversy, such that a declaration thereon would no longer be of practical use or value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Notably, the order of the Ombudsman, which placed the petitioners under preventive suspension for a period of six (6) months, was issued on 29 March 2007 and petitioners received copies of the said order on 30 March 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  DILG Secretary Puno issued Memoranda directing the implementation of the order of suspension against petitioners.  The suspension was effected upon service of DILG Secretary Puno's Memoranda upon petitioners, particularly, petitioner Radaza on 3 April 2007; and petitioners Cuizon, Taga-an, Jr., and Veloso on 4 April 2007.<br><br>It is worthy to note that petitioners did not bother to move for the reconsideration of the Order dated 29 March 2007 of the Office of the Ombudsman in Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C, imposing upon them preventive suspension for six (6) months.  Section 8, Rule III of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative cases allows the filing of a motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation within ten (10) days from receipt by the party of the challenged decision or order, based on any of the following grounds:<br><blockquote>a) New evidence had been discovered which materially affects the order, directive or decision;<br><br>b) Grave errors of facts or laws or serious irregularities have been committed prejudicial to the interest of the movant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners, instead, directly assailed the 29 March 2007 Order of the Office of the Ombudsman in a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 02615.<br><br>However, petitioners were unsuccessful in securing a TRO or a preliminary injunction from either the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 02615 or this Court in the Petition at bar, which would have enjoined the implementation of the order of suspension against them.  Thus, the period of preventive suspension was never interrupted.<br><br>The six-month period of the preventive suspension against petitioners Cuizon, Taga-an, Jr., and Veloso, which commenced on 4 April 2007, had already lapsed on 1 October 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  Said petitioners even acknowledged this fact in their <b>Manifestation with Motion</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> filed before this Court on 18 February 2008, <b>wherein they manifested that they have accordingly resumed their posts and admitted that the instant Petition had indeed become moot and academic</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As regards petitioner Radaza, the Court had previously resolved on 13 June 2007 to allow him to withdraw from the instant Petition, considering his successful re-election as Mayor of Lapu-Lapu City.<br><br>Finally, the Court notes that the Office of the Ombudsman has since rendered a Decision dated 31 January 2008 in Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C, wherein petitioners Cuizon, Taga-an, Jr., and Veloso, among other public officials, were found guilty of Grave Misconduct and were, thus, sentenced to the penalty of dismissal from service.  Resultantly, the order of preventive suspension against petitioners has become inconsequential by then.  Under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the preventive suspension shall continue <b>until the case is terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six months, without pay</b>, except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, in which case, the period of such delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided.  In the case at bar, both resolutory conditions for the preventive suspension have taken place: <i>first,</i> the six-month period without pay had already expired on 1 October 2007; and <i>second</i>, the Office of the Ombudsman had terminated Administrative Case No. OMB-V-A-07-0122-C by the promulgation of its Decision therein on 31 January 2008.<br><br>All told, a determination by this Court of the issues of the validity of the issuance of the order of preventive suspension against petitioners and the propriety of a TRO and/or a preliminary injunction to arrest the injurious effects of the same would merely be an exercise in futility as there is no more preventive suspension to speak of.  And although the Court has previously ruled that the "moot and academic" doctrine will not automatically dissuade it from resolving a case where (a) there is a grave violation of the Constitution; (b) the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; (c) when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar and the public; and (d) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> none of the said circumstances are obtaining in the instant case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court hereby accordingly DISMISSES the Petition at bar for mootness.
