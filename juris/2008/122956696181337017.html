On even date, the trial court received petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time [30 days up to June 11, 2006] to File Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated May 5, 2006.<br><br>The following day, May 16, 2006 or eight days prior to the slated hearing of respondents' Motion to Declare [Petitioner] in Default, the trial court issued an Order denying said motion and granting petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer.  To the trial court's Order respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>In the meantime, petitioner filed its Answer to the Complaint on May 25, 2006.<br><br>The trial court, by Order of August 9, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> denied respondents' Motion for Reconsideration of its May 16, 2006 Order denying their Motion to Declare petitioner in default and granting the latter's Motion for Extension.<br><br>Respondents subsequently assailed the trial court's Orders of May 16, 2006 and August 9, 2006 via certiorari to the Court of Appeals which, by the challenged Decision of February 26, 2007, annulled the trial court's orders, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.  The Orders dated May 16, 2006 and August 9, 2006 issued by the Hon. Omar T. Viola are hereby <b>ANNULLED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, <u>private respondent is declared <b>IN DEFAULT</b> and the Answer filed by private respondent is ordered <b>EXPUNGED</b></u> from the records of the case.  <u>The case is <b>REMANDED</b></u> to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, Angeles City, <u>for further proceedings</u>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  (Emphasis in the original, underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by Resolution of May 16, 2007, it filed the present Petition for Review (with Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction) which ascribes error to the Court of Appeals in:<br><blockquote>. . . DECLARING PNB IN DEFAULT AND ORDERING THAT THE ANSWER FILED IN THE RTC BE EXPUNGED FROM THE RECORDS OF THE CASE [AND]<br><br>. . . ANNULLING AND SETTING ASIDE THE ORDERS DATED MAY 16, 2006 AND AUGUST 9, 2006 OF THE RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The petition fails.<br><br>Petitioner's Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer was laden with glaring lapses.<br><br>Petitioner had, following the reglementary 15-day period after service of summons (unless a different period is fixed by the court),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> until <b>May 5, 2006</b> within which to file an Answer or appropriate pleading.  It filed the Motion for Extension, however, via a private courier on May 14, 2006, which was received by the trial court on May 15, 2006 or ten days late.<br><br>It is a basic rule of remedial law that a motion for extension of time to file a pleading must be filed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the expiration of the period sought to be extended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  The court's discretion to grant a motion for extension is conditioned upon such motion's timeliness, the passing of which renders the court <u>powerless</u> to entertain or grant it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Since the motion for extension was filed after the lapse of the prescribed period, there was no more period to extend.<br><br>Petitioner was not candid enough to aver in the Motion for Extension that the period had lapsed, as it still toyed with the idea that it could get away with it.  The allegations therein were crafted as if the said motion was timely filed. Notably, the May 16, 2006 Order expressed no inkling that the motion was filed out of time.  The trial court either was deceived by or it casually disregarded the apparent falsity foisted by petitioner.  Lest this Court be similarly deceived, it is imperative to carefully examine the facts.<br><br>By petitioner's allegation in its Motion for Extension, it received the summons on April 24, 2006.  This is belied by the Process Server's Return, which indicates that petitioner received the summons on April 20, 2006.  Petitioner's counsel was to later clarify that it was only on April 24, 2006 that she received copies of the summons and complaint which were faxed from petitioner's main office.<br><br>In requesting for a 30-day extension or until <u>June 11, 2006</u> to file answer, petitioner apparently reckoned the date from which the extension would start on May 12, 2006, which was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the last day of the 15-day period sought to be extended, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it being May 5, 2006</span>.  By computation, petitioner actually sought more than 30 days, contrary to the period of extension it purportedly requested. The counting of the period was erroneous, even if one uses the material dates alleged by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Petitioner clearly disregarded elementary rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on the matter.<br><br>The flaws in petitioner's moves/representations reinforce respondents' claim that the Motion for Extension was "cunningly" dated May 5, 2006 (the last day to file a responsive pleading) to make it appear that it was timely filed, although it was transmitted only on May 14, 2006. Petitioner's allegation that the Motion it filed was the one actually prepared and signed on May 5, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contradicts</span> its earlier claim in its Opposition to the Motion to Declare [It] in Default that "[s]hort of time in coming up with [herein petitioner's] Answer on April 28, 2006," its counsel caused to be prepared a Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer which was, however, misplaced, and upon discovery thereof "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">another</span> motion for extension was immediately caused to be prepared and filed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>More.  Petitioner served and filed the Motion for Extension through a private courier, LBC, a mode not recognized by the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Explanation for availing such mode was not stated in the Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  The mode was, nonetheless, clearly unjustifiable, considering that (a) petitioner's handling counsel was based in nearby San Fernando; (b) postal registry service is, for lack of explanation to the contrary, available in Pampanga;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (c) urgency is out of the equation because the official date of filing done via private messengerial service is the date of actual receipt of the court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and had the motion been personally filed the following day (May 15, 2006), it would have reached the court earlier.  It thus shows that the mode was utilized to obscure any indication that the motion was filed out of time.<br><br>In denying respondents' Motion for Reconsideration of its grant of petitioner's Motion for Extension, the trial court ruled that it was inclined to reconsider or lift an order of default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  By such ruling, the trial court preempted the dictates of orderly procedure by unduly anticipating and signifying a slant toward the remedies and arguments yet to be availed of and raised by petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner can not harp on <i>Indiana Aerospace University v. Comm. on Higher Educ.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which it cites.  In that case, the Answer had already been filed- albeit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after the 15-day period</span>, but before the defendants were declared in default. In the present case, had the hearing on the Motion to Declare Petitioner in Default pushed through on May 24, 2006, the trial court would have readily noticed that no Answer had yet been filed on said date, the Answer having been filed, as earlier stated, only on May 25, 2006.<br><br>Neither can petitioner harp on <i>Sps. Ampeloquio, Sr. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> for the Court therein held that it is within the discretion of the trial court to permit the filing of an answer even beyond the reglementary period, <i>provided that</i> there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">justification for the belated action</span> and there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no showing that the defendant intended to delay the case</span>.  Thus, in that case, the therein defendant-respondent deferred the submission of a prepared Answer as it awaited the trial court's resolution on its motion to dismiss, which resolution had, it turned out, been priorly issued, a copy of which was, however, mistakenly addressed to another counsel.<br><br>In the present case, no satisfactory reason was adduced to justify the tardiness of the Answer and no compelling reason was given to justify its admission.  The intention to delay was rather obvious.<br><br>It is not amiss to mention at this juncture that the Court's attention has been drawn to the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner's counsel</span> even notarized the Verification of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondents' Complaint</span> as well as the Corporate Secretary's Certificate as early as April 10, 2006. By such act, which is irregular, to say the least, petitioner's counsel was even made aware in advance of the impending filing of the case against her client-herein petitioner.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner's handling counsel belongs to its Legal Department which monitors its pending cases and oversees a network of lawyers.<br><br>On petitioner's counsel's belated and trite allegation of heavy volume of work which called for the filing of the Motion for Extension, nowhere is it therein claimed that there was heavy volume of work in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other equally important cases</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  With the implication that petitioner had been all the while preparing an Answer, it defies comprehension how petitioner still attributes the delay to "inadvertence," "honest oversight" and "simple remission" in its having allegedly misplaced the Motion for Extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court thus finds petitioner's negligence inexcusable, as the circumstances behind and the reasons for the delay are detestable.<br><br>Rules of procedure, especially those prescribing the time within which certain acts must be done, have often been held as absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of business.  The bare invocation of "the interest of substantial justice" is not a magic wand that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>Under Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, liberal construction of the rules is the controlling principle to effect substantial justice. Thus, litigations should, as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This does not mean, however, that procedural rules are to be ignored or disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. Procedural law has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely, to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism, or whimsicality in the settlement of disputes.</span> Hence, it is a mistake to suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to each other, or as often suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules should never be permitted if it would result in prejudice to the substantive rights of the litigants.<br><br>Litigation is not a game of technicalities, but every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure so that issues may be properly presented and justly resolved. Hence, rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only when for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to explain his failure to abide by the rules.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Given the foregoing circumstances, Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr., in his Dissenting Opinion, still finds "exceptional circumstances" that warrant this Court to suspend its rules and accord liberality to petitioner, citing Section 11, Rule 11 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><blockquote>Upon motion and <b>on such terms as may be just</b>, the court may extend the time to plead provided in these Rules.<br><br><u>The court may also, <b>upon like terms</b>, allow an answer or other pleading to be filed after the time fixed by these Rules.</u> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>From the foregoing discussion, it is unimaginable how "such terms as may be just" may be applied in petitioner's favor.  Under the stated premises, to grant the petition along the lines of liberality is to countenance the context of fibs and flaws.<br><br>Obviously grasping straws in its final pitch to win the court's leniency, petitioner employed a ploy to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conceal</span> not just the lapse of time but also the serious lapses of non-compliance with basic rules.  The scheme insults the intelligence of the Court.  While the Court frowns upon default judgments, it does not condone gross transgressions of the rules and perceptible vestiges of bad faith.<br><br>Good faith is central to the concept of "excusable neglect" justifying failure to answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  An attempt to cover up the procedural lapses and obscure the technical imperfections negates good faith on the part of the party imploring the accommodating arm of the court.<br><br>In his Dissenting Opinion, Justice Velasco proffers that the complaint centers on the interpretation of a contract which can only be determined if the parties are heard in the course of trial.<br><br>There is no arguing that all complaints of whatever nature can only be determined if the parties are heard.  There is, however, a standing rule set in place for a declaration of default, in cases where there is no justification for the belated action, and there is showing that the defendant intended to delay the case. In this case, the party lackadaisically squandered its opportunity to file a responsive pleading and, worse, made deceptive moves in an obvious attempt to redeem itself.<br><br>The Court is duty-bound to observe its rules and procedures and uphold the noble purpose behind their issuance.  Rules are laid down for the benefit of all and should not be made dependent upon a suitor's sweet time and own bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In preliminarily assessing the merits of the case, the Court is merely tasked to consider whether the reception of defendant's evidence would serve a practical purpose, considering that respondents had, during the pendency of the case, concluded the <i style="text-decoration: underline;">ex-parte</i> presentation of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, after carefully reviewing petitioner's Answer and Pre-Trial Brief, the Court finds that to re-open the presentation of evidence just to ventilate the defense of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mere denial</span> - that there exists no <i>dacion en pago -</i>and to present the written agreement, the existence of which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">already</span> admitted by respondents, would serve no practical purpose.<br><br>If petitioner is confident that the complaint lacks merit, then it need not worry because once the defendant is declared in default, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the plaintiff is not automatically entitled to the relief prayed for.</span>  Favorable relief can be granted only after it has been ascertained that it is warranted by the evidence offered and the facts proven by the presenting party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  In any event, petitioner, even if declared in default, is not deprived of his right to appeal the decision of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>To emphasize, the case does not involve any outright deprivation of life, liberty or property.  Contrary to what is being depicted, intimated or romanticized, petitioner does not stand to lose P36,483,699.45 regardless of the characterization of the commercial transaction entered into by the parties.  The amount is secured by mortgages over prime real properties, which is precisely the subject of the alleged <i>dacion en pago</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Brion, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Tinga, J.</span>, joined Justice Velasco's dissent.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J.</span>, pls. see dissenting opinion.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 10-16, penned by Justice Juan Q.

The Court under Sec. 11, Rule 11 has the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discretion to allow an answer filed <u>after</u> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time fixed by the Rules.</b><br><br>The ruling in the main case turns on a technicality. It holds that petitioner, Philippine National Bank (PNB), failed to file an Answer within the reglementary period. The facts, as found by the majority, are as follows:<br><br>Respondents Deang Marketing Corporation and Berlita Deang filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Angeles City a complaint for reformation of contract and specific performance, claiming that a <i>dacion en pago</i> arrangement with PNB altered their outstanding loan obligations into a seven-year term loan in the amount of PhP 36,483,699.45.<br><br>The Process Server's Return shows that PNB was served with summons on April 20, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> through PNB's Chief Legal Counsel in Pasay City. The PNB Branch concerned, PNB San Fernando City, Pampanga, claimed that it received the summons from its head office only on April 24, 2006.<br><br>Counting from April 20, 2006, PNB had 15 days, or until May 5, 2006, within which to file an Answer. PNB, however, filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File an Answer only on May 15, 2006. This was granted by the RTC, thereby giving PNB until June 11, 2006 to file an Answer. PNB filed its Answer on May 25, 2006. Even if the original 15-day period to file an Answer is reckoned from April 20, 2006 and the said period was extended up to June 4, 2006, the filing of the answer on May 25, 2006 can be considered as within the extended period of 30 days in the higher interests of justice.<br><br>On May 15, 2006, respondents filed a Motion to Declare PNB in Default. On the same date, the RTC received PNB's Motion for Extension of Time to File an Answer. The next day, or on May 16, 2006, the RTC issued an Order denying the Motion to Declare PNB in Default and granting a 30-day extension of time to file an Answer in favor of PNB. The Order of the RTC granting an extension to file an Answer in favor of PNB is in accord with Section 11, Rule 11:<br><blockquote><i>Extension of time to plead</i>.—Upon motion and on such terms as may be just, the court may extend the time to plead provided in these Rules.<br><br><b>The court may also, upon like terms, allow an answer or other pleading to be filed after the time fixed by these Rules.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Plainly the matter of admitting an answer filed beyond the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days is DISCRETIONARY on the trial court. Discretion is the power exercised by courts to determine questions arising in the trial of a case to which no rule of law is applicable but which, from their nature and circumstances of the case, are controlled by personal judgment and not by fixed rules of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Discretion which a judge may exercise means sound discretion exercised, not arbitrarily or willfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by the judge's reason and conscience to just result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In its Order of August 9, 2006, the RTC stood by its Order of May 16, 2006 and reasoned that "it would be best if this case will go to trial on the merits rather than ruling in favor of plaintiffs in declaring PNB in default. The Court still believes that its Order serves not the parties, but the ends of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The RTC itself saw the need for the subject of the complaint to be exhaustively weighed and discussed, which is related to the second reason for my dissent. Under the circumstances, it is not difficult to say that the trial court actef properly and fairly in allowing the tardy filing of PNB's answer especially considering that a decision has not yet been rendered in the case. To allow the answer and to afford PNB the opportunity to adduce evidence is but in keeping with the norms of fair play. It will grant said party a sporting chance to convince the court of its proposition. There is nothing arbitrary nor whimsical in the challenged order.<br><br><b>2. The complaint centers on the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpretation of a contract, which can<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only be determined if the parties are <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard in the course of trial.<br><br></b>Respondents seek in the RTC the reformation of the loan contract extended by PNB, alleging that there has been a <i>dacion en pago</i> agreement involving the amount of PhP 36,483,699.45. PNB refutes this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> ft claims that after the Consolidation and Restructuring Agreement was signed between the parties, respondents offered in a letter the possibility of turning the agreement into a <i>dacion en pago</i>, but no such new agreement was entered into.<br><br>Even respondents admit that its claim of <i>dacion en pago</i> was not expressed in its written agreement with PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, the substantive issue is, what was the true agreement of the parties?<br><br>Case law provides that among the requisites of a valid dation in payment, there must be an agreement between the creditor and debtor that the obligation is immediately extinguished by reason of the performance of a prestation different from that due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As aforementioned, the main issue is whether or not there is such an agreement to a <i>dacion en pago</i>. This can only be resolved by hearing the parties and allowing them to present evidence in a full-blown trial, for the law provides that "in order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>It would be unfair and unjust to declare PNB in default and preclude it from presenting evidence on the import of the contract when it is respondents themselves who are the parties ascribing a different meaning to the written contract. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This rule, also known as the Parol Evidence Rule, is the general rule. Stated otherwise, a written contract embodies the intention of the parties. To go beyond the four corners of the document is an exception to the general rule, such that a party may present evidence to modify, explain, or add to the terms of written agreement if the party puts in issue in the pleading the existence of other terms agreed to after the execution of the written agreement. To determine whether or not the terms of the agreement between the parties have been changed necessitates that before the court steps in, it must consider the intent of the parties and the surrounding reasons and circumstances bearing on the total import of their true intention.<br><br><b>3. The Rules of Court should be given a <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liberal construction in this case for two <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compelling reasons, namely: (a) the gross <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negligence of PNB's counsel led to PNB's <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grave prejudice; and (b) PNB's cause <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears to be meritorious.</b><br><br><b>Gross Negligence of PNB's Counsel<br><br></b>There is a range of reasons which may provide justification for a court to resist a strict adherence to procedure, such as: (1) matters of life, liberty, honor, or property; (2) counsel's negligence without any participatory negligence on the part of the client; (3) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (4) the merits of the case; (5) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (6) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and (7) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The Rules is to be liberally construed in order to promote its objective of securing a just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the subject complaint, especially in this case where it can be conceded that petitioner's counsel, Atty. Elenita Quinsay, is guilty of gross negligence in handling PNB's case.<br><br>After the summons was received by PNB San Fernando City from its main office on April 20, 2006, Atty. Quinsay failed to act on it immediately. The confusion on which reglementary period to reckon the extension from was caused by her claim of receiving the summons on April 24 from the PNB main branch. She should have known that April 20 was the official date of receipt of her client of the summons.&nbsp;&nbsp; She should then have acted accordingly. These acts of negligence have led to the prejudice of PNB.<br><br>As a general rule, the negligence of counsel binds the client, except in the following instances: (1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law; (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property; or (3) where the interests of justice so require. In such cases, courts must step in and accord relief to a party-litigant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The gross negligence of petitioner's counsel amounted to an abandonment or total disregard of its case.<br><br>The Court noted that respondents had, during the pendency of this case, concluded the <i>ex-parte</i> presentation of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Since there is no decision rendered yet in the first instance, there is no prejudice that would result on the part of respondents should PNB be allowed to adduce evidence on its behalf.<br><br><b>PNB's Defense Necessitates Presentation of Evidence<br><br></b>PNB's defense justifies a liberal application of the Rules for respondents seek in the RTC the reformation of the loan contract extended by PNB, alleging that there has been a <i>dacion en pago</i> agreement involving the amount of PhP 36,483,699.45. PNB vehemently denies any such reformation and asserts the primacy of its written Consolidation and Restructuring Agreement with the respondents. Respondents are claiming the exception to the parol evidence rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, the substantive issue revolves on the true agreement of the parties. This cannot be resolved without hearing both of the parties to the contract. Based on the pleadings, PNB strongly asserts that the Consolidation and Restructuring Agreement is the true agreement between the parties. It is supported by the best evidence of the agreement, the written contract itself, while respondents' claim is anchored on evidence beyond the four corners of the written contract. For us to deprive PNB of the opportunity to refute the respondents' claim is not only unfair but also unjust.<br><br>The Rules of Court was conceived and promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice, but not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion. That is precisely why courts, in rendering justice, have always been, as they in fact ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that on the balance, technicalities take a backseat to substantive rights, and not the other way around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Circumspect leniency will give the appellant the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of the appellant's complaint rather than to lose life, liberty, honor, or property on technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to aid the courts in the speedy, just, and inexpensive determination of the cases before them. Liberal construction of the rules and the pleadings is the controlling principle to effect substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In light of the foregoing reasons, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, Vol. 1, pp. 49-53.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v.
