However, Congress did not act on bills converting 24 other municipalities into cities.<br><br>During the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Congress enacted into law Republic Act  No. 9009 (RA 9009),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which took effect on 30 June 2001. RA 9009 amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code by increasing the annual income requirement for conversion of a municipality into a city from P20 million to P100 million. The rationale for the amendment was to restrain, in the words of Senator Aquilino Pimentel, "the mad rush" of municipalities to convert into cities solely to secure a larger share in the Internal Revenue Allotment despite the fact that they are incapable of fiscal independence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><i>After</i></b> the effectivity of RA 9009, the House of Representatives of the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> adopted Joint Resolution No. 29,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which sought to exempt from the P100 million income requirement in RA 9009 the 24 municipalities whose cityhood bills were not approved in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.

However, the Senate again failed to approve the Joint Resolution. Following the advice of Senator Aquilino Pimentel, 16 municipalities filed, through their respective sponsors, individual cityhood bills.  The 16 cityhood bills contained a common provision exempting all  the 16 municipalities from the P100 million income requirement in RA 9009.<br><br>On 22 December 2006, the House of Representatives approved the cityhood bills.  The Senate also approved the cityhood bills in February 2007, except that of Naga, Cebu which was passed on 7 June 2007.

Petitioner League of Cities of the Philippines has legal standing because Section 499 of the Local Government Code tasks the League with the "primary purpose of ventilating, articulating and crystallizing issues affecting city government administration and securing, through proper and legal means, solutions thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>   Petitioners-in-intervention,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which are existing cities, have legal standing because their Internal Revenue Allotment will be reduced if the Cityhood Laws are declared constitutional.  Mayor Jerry P. Treñas has legal standing because as Mayor of Iloilo City and as a taxpayer he has sufficient interest to prevent the unlawful expenditure of public funds, like the release of more Internal Revenue Allotment to political units than what the law allows.<br><br><b><i>Applying RA 9009 is a Prospective Application of the Law </i></b><br><br><b>RA 9009 became effective on 30 June 2001 during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress</b>. This law specifically amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code, which now provides:<br><blockquote>Section 450. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. -- (a) A municipality or a cluster of barangays may be converted into a component city if it has a locally generated <b>average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of at least One hundred million pesos (P100,000,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive years based on 2000 constant prices</b>, and if it has either of the following requisites:<br><blockquote>(i) a contiguous territory of at least one hundred (100) square kilometers, as certified by the Land Management Bureau; or<br><br>(ii) a population of not less than one hundred fifty thousand (150,000) inhabitants, as certified by the National Statistics Office.<br></blockquote>The creation thereof shall not reduce the land area, population and income of the original unit or units at the time of said creation to less than the minimum requirements prescribed herein.<br><br>(b)       The territorial jurisdiction of a newly-created city shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. The requirement on land area shall not apply where the city proposed to be created is composed of one (1) or more islands. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands.<br><br>(c)       The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, transfers, and non-recurring income.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, RA 9009 increased the income requirement for conversion of a municipality into a city from P20 million to P100 million.   Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, does not provide any exemption from the increased income requirement.<br><br>Prior to the enactment of RA 9009, a total of 57 municipalities had cityhood bills pending in Congress.  Thirty-three cityhood bills became law before the enactment of RA 9009.  <b>Congress did not act on 24 cityhood bills during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress</b>.<br><br>During the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress, the House of Representatives adopted Joint Resolution No. 29, exempting from the income requirement of P100 million  in RA 9009 the 24 municipalities whose cityhood bills were not acted upon during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.  This Resolution reached the Senate.  <b>However, the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress adjourned without the Senate approving Joint Resolution No. 29</b>. <br><br><b>During the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress, </b>16 of the 24 municipalities mentioned in the unapproved Joint Resolution No. 29 filed between November and December of 2006, through their respective sponsors in Congress, individual cityhood bills containing a common provision, as follows:<br><blockquote>Exemption from Republic Act No. 9009. -- The City of x x x shall be exempted from the income requirement prescribed under Republic Act No. 9009.<br></blockquote><b>This common provision <i>exempted</i> each of the 16 municipalities from the income requirement of P100 million prescribed in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009</b>.  These cityhood bills lapsed into law on various dates from March to July 2007 after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo failed to sign them.<br><br>Indisputably, Congress passed the Cityhood Laws long <b><i>after</i></b> the effectivity of RA 9009. <b> RA 9009 became effective on 30 June 2001 or during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.  The 13<sup>th</sup> Congress passed in December 2006 the cityhood bills which became law only in 2007.  </b>Thus, respondent municipalities cannot invoke the principle of non-retroactivity of laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  This basic rule has no application because RA 9009, an earlier law to the Cityhood Laws, is not being applied retroactively but prospectively.<br><br><b><i>Congress Must Prescribe in the Local Government Code All Criteria </i></b><br><br>Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>No province, city, municipality, or barangay shall be created, divided, merged, abolished or its boundary substantially altered, <b>except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code</b> and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Constitution is clear. The creation of local government units must follow the <b>criteria established in the Local Government Code </b>and not in any other law. There is only one Local Government Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  The Constitution requires Congress to stipulate in the Local Government Code all the criteria necessary for the creation of a city, including the conversion of a municipality into a city.  Congress cannot write such criteria in any other law, like the Cityhood Laws.<br><br>The criteria prescribed in the Local Government Code govern exclusively the creation of a city.   No other law, not even the charter of the city, can govern such creation. The clear intent of the Constitution is to insure that the creation of cities and other political units must follow <b>the same uniform, non-discriminatory criteria found solely in the Local Government Code</b>.  Any derogation or deviation from the criteria prescribed in the Local Government Code violates Section 10, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br>RA 9009 amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code to increase the income requirement from P20 million to P100 million for the creation of a city. <b>This took effect on  30 June 2001 . Hence, from that moment the Local Government Code required that any municipality desiring to become a city must satisfy the P100 million income requirement</b>.  Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, does not contain any exemption from this income requirement.<br><br>In enacting RA 9009, Congress did not grant any exemption to respondent municipalities, even though their cityhood bills were pending in Congress when Congress passed RA 9009.  The Cityhood Laws, all enacted <b><i>after </i></b>the effectivity of RA 9009, explicitly exempt respondent municipalities from the increased income requirement in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009. <b>Such exemption clearly violates Section 10, Article X of the Constitution and is thus patently unconstitutional.   To be valid, such exemption must be written in the Local Government Code and not in any other law, including the Cityhood Laws. </b><br><br><b><i>Cityhood Laws Violate Section 6, Article X of the Constitution</i></b><br><br>Uniform and non-discriminatory criteria as prescribed in the Local Government Code are essential to implement a fair and equitable distribution of national taxes to all local government units.  Section 6, Article X of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>Local government units shall have a <b>just share</b>, as determined by law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released to them.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>If the criteria in creating local government units are not uniform and discriminatory, there can be no fair and just distribution of the national taxes to local government units.<br><br>A city with an annual income of only P20 million, all other criteria being equal, should not receive the same share in national taxes as a city with an annual income of P100 million or more. The criteria of land area, population and income, as prescribed in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, must be strictly followed because such criteria, prescribed by law, are material in determining the "just share" of local government units in national taxes.   Since the Cityhood Laws do not follow the income criterion in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, they prevent the fair and just distribution of the Internal Revenue Allotment in violation of Section 6, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br><b><i>Section 450 of the Local Government Code is Clear, </i></b><br><b><i>Plain and Unambiguous</i></b><br><br>There can be no resort to extrinsic aids -- like deliberations of Congress -- if the language of the law is plain, clear and unambiguous.  Courts determine the intent of the law from the literal language of the law, within the law's four corners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  If the language of the law is plain, clear and unambiguous, courts simply apply the law according to its express terms.  If a literal application of the law results in absurdity, impossibility or injustice, then courts may resort to extrinsic aids of statutory construction like the legislative history of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Congress, in enacting RA 9009 to amend Section 450 of the Local Government Code, did not provide any exemption from the increased income requirement, not even to respondent municipalities whose cityhood bills were then pending when Congress passed RA 9009.  Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, contains no exemption whatsoever.  Since the law is clear, plain and unambiguous that any municipality desiring to convert into a city must meet the increased income requirement, there is no reason to go beyond the letter of the law in applying Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009.<br><br><b><i>The 11<sup>th</sup> Congress' Intent was not Written into the Local Government Code </i></b><br><br>True, members of Congress discussed exempting respondent municipalities from RA 9009, as shown by the various deliberations on the matter during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress. However, Congress did not write this intended exemption into law. Congress could have easily included such exemption in RA 9009 but Congress did not. This is fatal to the cause of respondent municipalities because such exemption must appear in RA 9009 as an amendment to Section 450 of the Local Government Code. The Constitution requires that the criteria for the conversion of a municipality into a city, including any exemption from such criteria, must all be written in the Local Government Code. Congress cannot prescribe such criteria or exemption from such criteria in any other law.  <b>In short, Congress cannot create a city through a law that does not comply with the criteria or exemption found in the Local Government Code</b>.<br><br>Section 10 of Article X is similar to Section 16, Article XII of the Constitution prohibiting Congress from creating private corporations except by a general law.  Section 16 of Article XII provides:<br><blockquote><b>The Congress shall not, except by general law, provide for the formation, organization, or regulation of private corporations</b>. Government-owned or controlled corporations may be created or established by special charters in the interest of the common good and subject to the test of economic viability.   (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, Congress must prescribe all the criteria for the "formation, organization, or regulation" of private corporations in a <b>general law applicable to all without discrimination</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Congress cannot create a private corporation through a special law or charter.<br><br><b><i>Deliberations of the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress on Unapproved Bills Inapplicable</i></b><br><br>Congress is not a continuing body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  The <b>unapproved </b>cityhood bills filed during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress became mere scraps of paper upon the adjournment of the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.  All the hearings and deliberations conducted during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress on unapproved bills also became worthless upon the adjournment of the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.  <b>These hearings and deliberations cannot be used to interpret bills enacted into law in the 13<sup>th</sup> or subsequent Congresses</b>.<br><br>The members and officers of each Congress are different. All unapproved bills filed in one Congress become <i>functus officio</i> upon adjournment of that Congress and must be re-filed anew in order to be taken up in the next Congress. When their respective authors re-filed the cityhood bills in 2006 during the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress, the bills had to start from square one again, going  through the legislative mill just like bills taken up for the first time, from the filing to the approval.   Section 123, Rule XLIV of the Rules of the Senate, on Unfinished Business, provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 123.  x x x<br><br><b> All pending matters and proceedings shall terminate upon the expiration of one (1) Congress</b>, but may be taken by the succeeding Congress <b>as if presented for the first time</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Similarly, Section 78 of the Rules of the House of Representatives, on Unfinished Business, states:<br><blockquote>Section 78. Calendar of Business. The Calendar of Business shall consist of the following:<br><blockquote>a. Unfinished Business. This is business being considered by the House at the time of its last adjournment. Its consideration shall be resumed until it is disposed of. The Unfinished Business at the end of a session shall be resumed at the commencement of the next session as if no adjournment has taken place. <b>At the end of the term of a Congress, all Unfinished Business are deemed terminated</b>.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Thus, the deliberations during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress on the unapproved cityhood bills, as well as the deliberations during the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> Congresses on the unapproved resolution exempting from RA 9009 certain municipalities, have no legal significance. They do not qualify as extrinsic aids in construing laws passed by subsequent Congresses.<br><br><b><i>Applicability of Equal Protection Clause</i></b><br><br>If Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, contained an exemption to the P100 million annual income requirement, the criteria for such exemption could be scrutinized for possible violation of the equal protection clause. Thus, the criteria for the exemption, if found in the Local Government Code, could be assailed on the ground of absence of a valid classification.  However, Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, does not contain any exemption.   The exemption is contained in the Cityhood Laws, which are unconstitutional because such exemption must be prescribed in the Local Government Code as mandated in Section 10, Article X of the Constitution.<br><br>Even if the exemption provision in the Cityhood Laws were written in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by RA 9009, such exemption would still be unconstitutional for violation of the equal protection clause.  The exemption provision merely states, "<b>Exemption from Republic Act No. 9009  â”€ The City of x x x shall be exempted from the income requirement prescribed under Republic Act No. 9009.</b>"   This one sentence exemption provision contains no classification standards or guidelines differentiating the exempted municipalities from those that are not exempted.<br><br>Even if we take into account the deliberations in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress that municipalities with pending cityhood bills should be exempt from the P100 million income requirement, there is still no valid classification to satisfy the equal protection clause.  <b>The exemption will be based</b> <b>solely on the fact that the 16 municipalities had cityhood bills pending in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress when RA 9009 was enacted</b>.  This is not a valid classification between those entitled and those not entitled to exemption from the P100 million income requirement.<br><br>To be valid, the classification in the present case must be based on substantial distinctions, rationally related to a legitimate government objective which is the purpose of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> not limited to existing conditions only, and applicable to all similarly situated.   Thus, this Court has ruled:<br><blockquote>The equal protection clause of the 1987 Constitution permits a valid classification under the following conditions:<br><ol><li>The classification must rest on substantial distinctions;<br></li><li>The classification must be germane to the purpose of the law;<br></li><li>The classification must not be limited to existing conditions only; and<br></li><li>The classification must apply equally to all members of the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>There is no substantial distinction between municipalities with pending cityhood bills in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress and municipalities that did not have pending bills.   The mere pendency of a cityhood bill in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress is not a material difference to distinguish one municipality from another for the purpose of the income requirement.  The pendency of a cityhood bill in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress does not affect or determine the level of income of a municipality.  Municipalities with pending cityhood bills in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress might even have lower annual income than municipalities that did not have pending cityhood bills.  In short, the classification criterion − mere pendency of a cityhood bill in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress − is not rationally related to the purpose of the law which is to prevent fiscally non-viable municipalities from converting into cities.<br><br>Municipalities that did not have pending cityhood bills were not informed that a pending cityhood bill in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress would be a condition for exemption from the increased P100 million income requirement.  Had they been informed, many municipalities would have caused the filing of their own cityhood bills.    These municipalities, even if they have bigger annual income than the 16 respondent municipalities, cannot now convert into cities if their income is less than P100 million.<br><br>The fact of pendency of a cityhood bill in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress limits the exemption to a specific condition existing at the time of passage of RA 9009.   That specific condition will never happen again.  This violates the requirement that a valid classification must not be limited to existing conditions only.   This requirement is illustrated in <i>Mayflower Farms, Inc. v. Ten Eyck</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> where the challenged law allowed milk dealers engaged in business prior to a fixed date to sell at a price lower than that allowed to newcomers in the same business.  In <i>Mayflower</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court held:<br><blockquote>We are referred to a host of decisions to the effect that a regulatory law may be prospective in operation and may except from its sweep those presently engaged in the calling or activity to which it is directed. Examples are statutes licensing physicians and dentists, which apply only to those entering the profession subsequent to the passage of the act and exempt those then in practice, or zoning laws which exempt existing buildings, or laws forbidding slaughterhouses within certain areas, but excepting existing establishments. <b>The challenged provision is unlike such laws, since, on its face, it is not a regulation of a business or an activity in the interest of, or for the protection of, the public, but an attempt to give an economic advantage to those engaged in a given business at an arbitrary date as against all those who enter the industry after that date</b>. The appellees do not intimate that the classification bears any relation to the public health or welfare generally; that the provision will discourage monopoly; or that it was aimed at any abuse, cognizable by law, in the milk business. In the absence of any such showing, we have no right to conjure up possible situations which might justify the discrimination. The classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and denies the appellant the equal protection of the law. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the same vein, the exemption provision in the Cityhood Laws gives the 16 municipalities a unique advantage based on an arbitrary date − the filing of their cityhood bills before the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress - as against all other municipalities that want to convert into cities after the effectivity of RA 9009.<br><br>Furthermore, limiting the exemption only to the 16 municipalities violates the requirement that the classification must apply to all similarly situated. Municipalities with the same income as the 16 respondent municipalities cannot convert into cities, while the 16 respondent municipalities can.

To recall, the cityhood laws have a common provision that the COMELEC is supposed to conduct plebiscites in different parts of the country for the ratification of the cityhood laws.  Thus, filing different petitions for prohibition in the various Regional Trial Courts where the plebiscites were to be conducted was not a speedy and adequate remedy.<br><br>I cannot subscribe to the <i>fait accompli</i> defense of respondent municipalities, which they claim should be a ground for outright dismissal of the petitions and petitions-in-intervention.  They are not mooted by the fact that plebiscites were already conducted, respondent municipalities acknowledged as cities, and their officials correspondingly appointed.  The petitions and petitions-in-intervention raise constitutional issues which necessitate the intervention of the Court.  No amount of intervening events can legitimize the conversions of respondent municipalities into component cities if, indeed, the requirements of the Constitution and the Local Government Code have not been met.  As the Court earlier held:<br><blockquote>x x x the fact that such plebiscite had been held and a new province proclaimed and its officials appointed, the case before Us cannot truly be viewed as already moot and academic.  Continuation of the existence of this newly proclaimed province which petitioners strongly profess to have been illegally born, deserves to be inquired by this Tribunal so that, if indeed, illegality attaches to its creation, the commission of that error should not provide the very excuse for perpetuation of such wrong. For this Court to yield to the respondents' urging that, as there have been <i>fait accompli</i>, then this Court should passively accept and accede to the prevailing situation is an unacceptable suggestion.  Dismissal of the instant petition, as respondents  so propose is a proposition fraught with mischief. Respondents' submission will create a dangerous precedent.  Should this Court decline now to perform its duty of interpreting and indicating what the law is and should be, this might tempt again those who strut about in the corridors of power to recklessly and without ulterior motives, create, merge, divide and/or alter the boundaries of political subdivisions either brazenly or stealthily, confident that this Court will abstain from entertaining future challenges to their acts if they manage to bring about a <i>fait accompli</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></blockquote>It is true that the usual function of the writ of prohibition is to prevent the execution of an act which is about to be done.

No. 9009, finds relevance.<br><br>The purpose of the enactment of R.A. No. 9009 can be seen in the sponsorship speech of Senator Pimentel on Senate Bill No. 2157.   Noteworthy is his statement that  the basis for the proposed increase from P20,000,000.00 to P100,000,000.00 in the income requirement for municipalities and cluster of <i>barangays</i> wanting to be converted into cities is the "mad rush of municipalities wanting to be converted into cities," and in order that the country "will not be a nation of all cities and no municipalities," <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Pimentel</b>. Mr. President, I would have wanted this bill to be included in the whole set of proposed amendments that we have introduced to precisely amend the Local Government Code.  However, it is a fact that there is a <b>mad rush of municipalities wanting to be converted into cities</b>.  Whereas in 1991, when the Local Government was approved, there were only 60 cities, today the number has increased to 85 cities, with 41 more municipalities applying  for  conversion to  the same status.  <b>At the rate we are going, I am apprehensive that before long this nation will be a nation of all cities and no municipalities</b>.<br><br>It is for that reason, Mr. President, that we are proposing among other things, that the financial requirement, which, under the Local Government Code, is fixed at P20 million, be raised to P100 million to enable a municipality to have the right to be converted into a city, and the P100 million should be sourced from locally generated funds.<br><br>What has been happening, Mr. President, is, the municipalities aspiring to become cities say that they qualify in terms of financial requirements by incorporating the Internal Revenue share of the taxes of the nation added on to their regularly generated revenue. Under that requirement, it looks clear to me that practically all municipalities in this country would qualify to become cities.<br><br>It is precisely for that reason, therefore, that we are seeking the approval of this Chamber to amend, particularly Section 450 of Republic Act No. 7160, the requisite for the average annual income of a municipality to be converted into a city or cluster of barangays which seek to be converted into a city, raising that revenue requirement from P20 million to P100 million for the last two consecutive years based on 2000 constant prices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>What follows is revealing.  At the time that R.A. No. 9009 was being deliberated upon, Congress was also well aware that several municipalities wanting to become cities and which qualified under the income threshold of P20,000,000.00 under the old Local Government Code had pending cityhood bills.  These included  respondent  municipalities.  Thus, equally noteworthy is the interpellation by Senate President Franklin Drilon of Senator Pimentel in which the latter stated that municipalities that had pending cityhood bills "<b>would not be affected</b>" by the income threshold of P100,000,000.00 being proposed by Senate Bill No. 2157, thus:<br><blockquote>THE PRESIDENT.  The Chair would like to ask for some clarificatory point.<br><br>SENATOR PIMENTEL.  Yes, Mr. President.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  This is just on the point of the <u>pending bills in the Senate which propose the conversion of a number of municipalities into cities and which qualify under the present standard.</u><br><br>We would like to know the view of the sponsor: <u> Assuming that this bill becomes a law, will the Chamber apply the standard as proposed in this bill to those bills which are pending for consideration</u>?<br><br>SENATOR  PIMENTEL, Mr. President, <u>it might not be fair to make this bill, on the assumption that it is approved, retroact to the bills that are pending in the Senate for conversion from municipalities to cities.</u><br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  Will there be an appropriate language crafted to reflect that view? Or does it not become a policy of the Chamber, assuming that this bill becomes a law tomorrow, that it will apply to those bills which are already approved by the House under the old version of the Local Government Code and are now pending in the Senate?  The Chair does not know if we can craft a language which will limit the application to those which are not yet in the Senate.  Or is that a policy that the Chamber will adopt?<br><br>SENATOR PIMENTEL. Mr. President, personally, <u>I do not think it is necessary to put that provision because what we are saying here will form part of the interpretation of this bill.  Besides, if there is no retroactivity clause, I do not think that the bill would have any retroactive effect.</u><br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  <u>So the understanding is that those bills which are already pending in the Chamber will not be affected.</u><br><br>SENATOR PIMENTEL.  <u>These will not be affected, Mr. President.</u><br><br>THE PRESIDENT.

No. 9009.  It is very clear that <b>Congress intended that the then pending cityhood bills would not be covered  by the income requirement of P100,000,000.00 imposed by R.A. No. 9009</b>.  It was made clear by the Legislature that <b>R.A. No. 9009 would not have any retroactive effect</b>.<br><br>Thus, the interpellations by Senator Drilon of Senator Pimentel are consistent with the rule that laws should be applied prospectively in the spirit of justice and fair play.  Be that as it may, the Civil Code is explicit that laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim, <i>lex prospicit, non respicit.</i>  The law looks forward, never backward. <b><i> Ang batas ay tumitingin sa hinaharap, hindi sa nakaraan</i></b>.  The reason behind the rule is not difficult to perceive.  The retroactive application of the law usually divests rights that have already become vested or impairs the obligations of contracts, thus, is unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>It then becomes clear that the basis for the inclusion of the exemption clause of the cityhood laws is the clear-cut <b>intent</b> of the Legislature of not giving retroactive effect to R.A. No. 9009.  In fact, not only do the legislative records bear the legislative intent of exempting the cityhood laws from the income requirement of P100,000,000.00 imposed by R.A. No. 9009.  Congress has now made its intent <b>express</b> in the cityhood laws.<br><br>Legislative intent or spirit is the controlling factor, the leading star and guiding light in the application and interpretation of a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>  If a statute needs construction, the influence most dominant in that process is the intent or spirit of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> The spirit, rather than the letter, of a statute, determines its construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup>  Thus, a statute must be read according to its spirit or intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup>  For what is within the spirit is within the statute although it is not within its letter, and that which is within the letter but not within the spirit is not within the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>  Stated otherwise, a thing which is within the intent of the lawmaker is as much within the statute as if within the letter; and a thing which is within the letter of the statute is not within the statute unless within the intent of the lawmakers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup>  Legislative intent is part and parcel of the law.

Sponsorship speech of Senator Alfredo Lim on House Joint Resolution No. 1</b><br><br>But first, let the convincing sponsorship speech of then Senator Alfredo Lim on House Joint Resolution No. 1 shed light on the ensuing discussion:<br><blockquote>I thank the Senate President and my colleagues in this Chamber for their kind indulgence in allowing this Representation to take the floor on behalf of the people of 12 municipalities in their collective aspiration for sustained growth and progress.  Over a million people spread in eight regions have long been awaiting the realization of their dreams for cityhood.<br><br>Between July 1998 to June 2001,  during the Eleventh Congress, fifty-seven (57) municipalities applied for city status, confident that each <br> has met the requisites for conversion under Section 450 of the Local Government Code, particularly the income threshold of P20 million.  Of the 57 that filed, thirty-two (32) were enacted into law; one was rejected in a plebiscite; while the rest - twenty-four (24) in all - failed to pass through Congress.  Shortly before the long recess of Congress in February 2001, to give way to the May elections of that year, Senate Bill No. 2157, which eventually became Republic Act No. 9009, was passed into law, effectively raising the income requirement for creation of cities to a whooping P100 million, exclusive of IRA.  <u>Much as the proponents of the 24 cityhood bills then pending struggled to beat the effectivity of the law on June 30, 2001, events that then unfolded were swift and overwhelming that Congress just did not have the time to act on the measures.</u><br><br>Some of these intervening events were the <u>Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation</u> into the <i>jueteng</i> scandal, the <u>impeachment of President Estrada</u> by the House of Representatives, the aborted impeachment proceedings in the Senate, the leadership <u>reorganization</u> in both Houses of Congress, the <u>"EDSA Dos"</u> and <u>"EDSA Tres"</u> uprisings, the <u>campaign period</u> and the <u>May 2001 elections</u>.<br><br>The imposition of a much higher income requirement for the creation of a city virtually delivered a lethal blow to the aspirations of the 24 municipalities to attain economic growth and progress.  To them, it was unfair; like any sport - changing the rules in the middle of the game.<br><br>Undaunted, they came back during the Twelfth Congress (from June 2001  to June 2004) appealing for fairness and justice.  They filed House Joint Resolution No. 29 seeking exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  They were successful in the House all the way through the Senate.  Here, they found a staunch ally in the person of my dear friend and colleague Sen. Bobby Barbers as chair of the Committee on Local Government.  Several public hearings, caucuses, dialogues and informal discussions notwithstanding, the committee report was only good up to plenary debates.  <u>For the second time, time ran out from them</u>.<br><br>For many of the municipalities whose Cityhood Bills are now under consideration, this year, at the closing days of the Thirteenth Congress, marks their ninth year appealing for fairness and justice.  House Joint Resolution No. 1 which was sent by the House to the Senate for concurrence embodies their unfailing hope that their lawmakers would give them their rightful due.<br><br>I, for one, share their view that fairness dictates that they should be given a legal remedy by which they could be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status using the criteria set forth under the Local Government Code  prior to its amendment by RA 9009.  Hence, when House Joint Resolution.  No. 1 reached the Senate and was referred to the Committee on Local Government in March 2005, I immediately set the public hearing the following month.  On July 25, 2006, I filed Committee Report No. 84 after over a year of determining the sentiments of our colleagues and  considering the positions taken by the concerned sectors both for and against the resolution.  On September 6, I delivered the sponsorship speech and was interpellated by Senators Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. and Sergio Osmeña III on September 12.  Although I had made myself available for interpellation from anyone almost every session day since then, it was only last October 12 that the Senate agreed to proceed with the committee and individual amendments.  On the same day, the Senate approved the measure on Second Reading, without prejudice to a motion for reconsideration by any member who was not on the floor that day.<br><br>After a month-long break, on November 7, the approval was reconsidered to give way to further questions from Senators Pimentel and Biazon.  By November 14, the measure had reverted to the period of individual amendments.  This was when the then acting majority leader, Senator Compañera Pia Cayetano, informed the Body that Senator Pimentel and the proponents of House Joint Resolution No. 1 have agreed to the proposal of the Minority Leader for the House to first approve the individual Cityhood Bills of the qualified municipalities,  along with the provision exempting each of them from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  Prior to that, on the initiative of the Senate President, and in his presence, this Representation and Senator Pimentel had come up with an agreement with the proponents to pre-qualify the municipalities.  This led to the certification issued by the proponents short-listing fourteen (14) municipalities deemed to be qualified for city-status.<br><br>Acting on the suggestion of Senator Pimentel, the proponents lost no time in working for the approval by the House of Representatives of their individual Cityhood Bills, each containing a provision of exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  On the last session day of last year, December 21, the House transmitted to the Senate the Cityhood Bills of twelve out of the 14 pre-qualified municipalities. Your Committee immediately conducted the public hearing last January 10, and the committee reports were filed on January 25.<br><br>The whole process I enumerated spanning <u>three Congresses</u> brings us to where we are today. I sincerely hope that time would not run out for them the third time around.<br><br>In essence, the Cityhood Bills now under consideration will have the same effect as that of House Joint Resolution No. 1 because each of the 12 bills seeks exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  The proponents are invoking the <u>exemption on the basis of justice and fairness.</u><br><br><u>Each of the 12 municipalities has all the requisites for conversion into a component city based on the old requirements set forth under Section 450 of the Local Government Code, prior to its amendment by RA 9009, namely:</u><br><blockquote><ol><li>An average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of at least P20 million for the last two consecutive years based on 1991 constant prices, and if it has either of the following requisites:<br><blockquote>1.1 A contiguous territory of at least 100 square kilometers, as certified by the Lands Management Bureau; or<br><br>1.2  A population of not less than 150,000 inhabitants, as certified by the National Statistics Office.<br></blockquote></li></ol></blockquote>Allow me now to place on record the qualification of each of the 12 municipalities based on these requirements.  The average regular income for the years 2000 and 2001 (prior to the effectivity of RA 9009) based on 1991 constant prices was duly certified by the Bureau of Local Government Finance, the land area by the Lands Management Bureau, and the population (based on the 2000 Census) by the National Statistics Office:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="36%"><div align="justify">Municipalities</div></td> <td width="29%"><div align="justify">(House Bill-Committee Report)</div></td> <td width="12%"><div align="justify">Income</div></td> <td width="11%"><div align="justify">Land Area </div></td> <td width="12%"><div align="justify">Population</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">1.

All of them satisfy the mandatory requirement on income and one of the two optional requirements of territory.<br><br>It must also be noted that except for Tandag and Lamitan, which are both second-class municipalities in terms of income,  all the rest are categorized by the Department of Finance as first-class municipalities with gross income of at least P70 million as per Commission on Audit Report for 2005.  Moreover, <u>Tandag and Lamitan</u>, together with <u>Borongan</u>, <u>Catbalogan</u>, and <u>Tabuk</u>, are all <u>provincial capitals</u>.<br><br>The more recent income figures of the 12 municipalities, which would have increased further by this time, indicate their readiness to take on the responsibilities of cityhood.<br><br>Moreover, the <u>municipalities under consideration are leading localities in their respective provinces</u>.  Borongan, Catbalogan, Tandag, Batac and Tabuk are ranked number one in terms of income among all the municipalities in their respective provinces; Baybay and Bayugan are number two;  Bogo and Lamitan are number three; Carcar, number four; and Tayabas, number seven. Not only are they pacesetters in their respective provinces, they are also among the frontrunners in their regions - Baybay, Bayugan and Tabuk are number two income earners in Regions VIII, XII, and CAR, respectively; Catbalogan and Batac are number three in Regions VIII and I, respectively; Bogo, number five in Region VII;  Borongan and Carcar are both number six in Regions VIII and VII, respectively.  This simply shows that these municipalities are viable.<br><br>It is for these reasons that I once again appeal to my distinguished colleagues for their kind consideration and approval of the Cityhood Bills of the 12 municipalities whose application for city status was overtaken by events beyond their control.

The classification rests on substantial distinctions</b>. What distinguishes respondent municipalities from other municipalities is that the latter had  pending  cityhood  bills  before the  passage  of  R.A. No. 9009.  In the words of Senator Lim, the peculiar conditions of respondent municipalities, which led to their  exemption  from  the increased  P100,000,000.00 income requirement of R.A. No. 9009, is that the imposition of a much higher income requirement on those that were qualified to become cities before the enactment of R.A. No. 9009 was "unfair; like any sport - changing the rules in the middle of the game."  Thus, "fairness dictates that they should be given a legal remedy by which they should be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status using the criteria set forth under the Local Government Code prior to its amendment by R.A. No. 9009."  Truly, the peculiar conditions of respondent municipalities, which are actual and real, furnish sufficient grounds for legislative classification.<br><br>It is not the province of the Court to delve into the wisdom of legislative enactments.

They may be addressed only by the legislative and executive departments, to which the function belongs in our scheme of government.  That function is exclusive, to which courts have no business of prying into.

This is the prerogative of the Legislature.

The classification is germane to the purpose of the law</b>.  The exemption of  respondent municipalities  from the  P100,000,000.00  income requirement of R.A. No. 9009 was unquestionably designed to insure that fairness and justice were accorded to respondent municipalities, as their cityhood bills were not enacted by Congress in view of intervening events and for reasons beyond their control.  The equal protection clause does not merely prohibit Congress from passing discriminatory laws.  The equal protection clause also commands Congress to pass laws which would positively promote equality or reduce existing inequalities.  This was what Congress actually did in enacting the cityhood laws.  These laws positively promote equality and reduce the existing inequality between respondent municipalities and the "other thirty-two (32) municipalities" whose cityhood bills were  enacted during the 11th Congress.<br><br><b>D. The classification is not limited to existing conditions only</b>.  The non-retroactive effect of R.A. No. 9009 is not limited in application to <br> conditions existing at the time of its enactment.  It is intended to apply for all time as long as the conditions set there exist.  It is applicable as long as the concerned  municipalities have filed  their respective cityhood  bills before the effectivity of R.A. No. 9009, <u>and</u> qualify for conversion into city under the original version of Section 450 of the Local Government Code.<br><br>The common exemption clause in the cityhood laws is an application of the non-retroactive effect of R.A. No. 9009.  <b>It is not a declaration of certain rights but a mere declaration of prior qualification and/or compliance with the non-retroactive effect of R.A. No. 9009</b>.<br><br>Curiously, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention do not question the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9009.  In fact, they use R.A. No. 9009 to argue for the alleged unconstitutionality of  the cityhood laws.  This is absurd, considering that <b>the cityhood  laws only expressed  the intent of  R.A. No. 9009 to exempt respondent municipalities from the income requirement of P100,000,000.00</b>.<br><br>Petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention, however, invite the attention of the Court to <i>Mayflower Farms, Inc. v. Ten Eyck.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup>  In that case,  the  Milk Control Act of 1933 authorized a board to fix minimum prices for sales of fluid milk by dealers to stores in cities where there are more than one million inhabitants with a differential of 1% quart in favor of dealers "not having a well-advertised trade name."  The Act was good for one year.  An amended act, effective April 1, 1934, placing milk control under the jurisdiction of a division of the Department of Agriculture and Markets, contained a similar provision on the differential.  The pertinent section, as it stood at the time of the appellant's application for a license, is as follows:<br><blockquote>It shall not be unlawful for any milk dealer who since April tenth, nineteen hundred thirty-three has been engaged continuously in the business of purchasing and handling milk not having a well advertised <br> trade name in a city of more than one million inhabitants to sell fluid milk in bottles to stores in such city at a price not more than one cent per quart below the price of such milk sold to stores under a well advertised trade name, and such lower price shall also apply on sales from stores to consumers; provided that in no event shall the price of such milk not having a well advertised trade name, be more than one cent per quart below the minimum price fixed (by the board) for such sales to stores in such a city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup></blockquote>Appellant Mayflower did not have a well-advertised trade name.  However, its application for license was denied because although it had not been continuously in the business of dealing in milk since April 10, 1933, it had sold and was selling to stores milk at a price a cent below the established minimum price.  The issue then centered on "whether the provision denying the benefit of the differential to all who embark in the business after April 10, 1933, works a discrimination which has no foundation in the circumstances of those engaging in the milk business in New York City, and is therefore so unreasonable as to deny appellant the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]<br></sup><br>In support of the argument that the questioned act did not violate the equal protection clause, appellees referred to the Court "a host of decisions to the effect that a regulatory law may be prospective in operation and may except from its sweep those presently engaged in the calling or activity to which it is directed.  Examples are statutes licensing physicians and dentists, which apply only to those entering the profession subsequent to the passage of the act and exempt those then in practice, or zoning laws which exempt existing buildings, or laws forbidding slaughter houses within certain areas, but excepting existing establishments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>The cases cited by appellees, however, were held to be inapplicable to the questioned Act.  This was so because the questioned Act, "on its face, x x x is not a regulation of a business or an activity in the interest of, or for the protection of, the public, but an attempt to give an economic advantage to those engaged in a given business at an arbitrary date as against all those who enter the industry after that date."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>In finally ruling that the questioned Act violated the equal protection clause, the United States Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Owen Roberts, held that "appellees do not intimate that the classification bears any relation to the public health or welfare generally; that the provision will discourage monopoly; or that it was aimed at any abuse, cognizable by law, in the milk business."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup>  Thus, "[i]n the absence of any such showing, we have no right to conjure up possible situations which might justify the discrimination.  The classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and denies the appellant the equal protection of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>Petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention claim that like the Milk Control Act of 1933, the cityhood laws should also be declared unconstitutional because "there is no compelling or countervailing State policy, constitutional provision or even statutory or public policy that underlies the exemption clause in the cityhood laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>The argument is untenable.  The Milk Control Act of 1933 was declared unconstitutional because the time was based on an arbitrary date.  It did not have any relation to the public welfare generally.  There was no causal connection between time and the purpose of the law.<br><br>What we have here is different.  There is a causal connection between time, i.e., the Eleventh Congress when the cityhood bills of respondent municipalities were filed, and the purpose of the law, which is justice and fairness.<br><br>Respondent municipalities and the other thirty-two (32) municipalities, which had already been elevated to city status, were all found to be qualified under the old Section 450 of the Local Government Code and  had  pending cityhood  bills during  the Eleventh  Congress.  As such, both respondent municipalities and the other thirty-two (32) municipalities are under like circumstances and conditions.  There is thus no cogent reason why an exemption from the P100,000,000.00 cannot be given to respondent municipalities. Otherwise, unfairness and injustice will be committed against them.<br><br>The equal protection of the law clause proscribes undue favor and individual favor and individual or class privilege as well as hostile discrimination or the possession of inequality.  The equal protection clause is not intended to prohibit legislation, which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate.  Neither does equal protection demand absolute equality among residents. It merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>An analogy may be found in the Constitution.  Citizenship may be granted to those born before January 17, 1973, of Filipino mothers, who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.  Citizenship, however, is denied to those who, although born before January 17, 1973, of Filipino mothers, did not elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> In like manner, Congress has the power to carry out the intent of R.A. No. 9009 by making a law which exempts municipalities from the P100,000,000.00 income requirement imposed by R.A. No. 9009 if their cityhood laws were pending when R.A. No. 9009 was passed, and were compliant with the income threshold requirement of P20,000,000.00 imposed by then Section 450 of the Local Government Code.<br><br>Even if the classification of the cityhood laws is limited to existing conditions only, this does not automatically mean that they are unconstitutional.  The <u>general rule</u> is that a classification must not be based on existing conditions only.  It must also be made for future acquisitions of the class as other subjects acquire the characteristics which form the basis of the classification.  The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exception</span> is when the statute is curative or remedial, and thus temporary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br>Here, the cityhood laws are curative or remedial statutes.  They seek to prevent the great injustice which would be committed to respondent municipalities.  Again, the cityhood laws are not contrary to the spirit and intent of R.A. No. 9009 because Congress intended said law to be prospective, not retroactive, in application.  Indeed, to deny respondent municipalities the same rights and privileges accorded to the other thirty-two (32) municipalities when they are under the same circumstances, is tantamount to denying respondent municipalities the protective mantle of the equal protection clause.  In effect, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention are creating an absurd situation in which an alleged violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution is remedied by another violation of the equal protection clause.  That the Court cannot sustain.<br><br><b>E. The classification applies equally to all members of the same class</b>.  The cityhood laws, in carrying out the clear intent of R.A. No. 9009, apply to municipalities that had pending cityhood bills before the passage of R.A. No. 9009 and were compliant with then Section 450 of the Local Government Code that prescribed an income requirement of P20,000,000.00.<br><br>In sum, a statutory discrimination will not be set aside on the ground of denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup>  Class legislation which discriminates against some and favors others is prohibited.  But a classification on a reasonable basis, which is not made arbitrarily or capriciously, is permissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup>  Thus, in <i>Lopez v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup>  the Court rejected the claim that there was denial of the equal protection provision of the Constitution, unless Presidential Decree No. 824, which created Metropolitan Manila, was to be construed in such a way that, along with the rest of other cities and municipalities, there would be an election for Sangguniang Bayan.  The Court reasoned, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x There is no need to set anew the compelling reasons that called for the creation of Metropolitan Manila. It is quite obvious that under the conditions then existing - still present and, with the continued growth of population, attended with more complexity - what was done was a response to a great public need.  The government was called upon to act. Presidential Decree No. 824 was the result.  It is not a condition for the validity of the Sangguniang Bayans provided for in the four cities and thirteen municipalities that the membership be identical with those of other cities or municipalities. There is ample justification for such a distinction.  It does not by any means come under the category of what Professor Gunther calls suspect classification.  There is thus no warrant for the view that the equal protection guarantee was violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup></blockquote>As a last ditch effort, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention allege that respondents are not yet ready to become cities.  This contention, however, is belied by the sponsorship speech by Senator Lim of Senate Bill  No. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> and that by the respective Congressmen<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> who introduced what  eventually became the cityhood laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup>  <i>Contra factum non valet argumentum</i>.  There is no argument against facts.  <b><i>Walang pakikipagtalo laban sa totoo</i></b>.<br><br>It should not also be forgotten that petitioning cities and petitioners-in-intervention became cities under the old income requirement of either P10,000,000.00 by virtue of B.P. Blg. 337 or P20,000,000.00 by virtue of then Section 450 of the Local Government Code.  And yet nobody doubted their capacity to become cities.<br><br><b>Summing Up</b><br><br>The majority holds that the cityhood laws are unconstitutional on seven grounds, namely: (1) applying R.A. No. 9009 to the present case is a prospective, not a retroactive application, because R.A. No. 9009 took effect in 2001 while the cityhood bills became laws more than five (5) years later; (2) the Constitution requires that Congress shall prescribe all the criteria for the creation of a city in the Local Government Code and not in any other law; (3) the cityhood laws violate Section 6, Article X of the Constitution because they prevent a fair and just distribution of the national taxes to local government units; (4) the intent of members of Congress to exempt certain municipalities from the coverage of R.A. No. 9009 remained an intent and was never written into law; (5) the criteria prescribed in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, as amended by R.A. No. 9009, for converting a municipality into a city are clear, plain, and unambiguous, needing no resort to any statutory construction; (6) the deliberations of the 11th or 12th Congress on unapproved bills or resolutions are not extrinsic aids in interpreting a law passed in the 13th Congress because it is not a continuing body; and (7) even if the exemption in the cityhood laws were written in Section 450 of the Local Government Code, the exemption would still be unconstitutional for violation of the equal protection clause because the exemption is based solely on the fact that the 16 municipalities had cityhood bills pending in the 11th Congress when R.A. No. 9009 was enacted.<br><br>Anent the first ground, it must be pointed out that the cityhood bills were pending <b>before</b> the passage of R.A. No. 9009. Congress was well aware of such fact.  Thus, Congress intended the hiked income requirement in R.A. No. 9009 not to apply to the cityhood bills which became the subject cityhood laws. This is the context of the reference to the prospective application of the said R.A.  Congress intended the cityhood laws in question to be exempted from the income requirement of P100,000,000.00 imposed by R.A. No. 9009.<br><br>The second point is specious.  It overlooks that R.A. No. 9009 <b>is now</b> Section 450 of the Local Government Code.  The cityhood laws also merely carry out the intent of R.A. No. 9009 to exempt respondent municipalities from the income requirement of P100,000,000.00.<br><br>The third needs clarification.  Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution speaks for itself.  While it is true that local government units shall have a "<b>just share</b>" in the national taxes, it is qualified by the phrase "<b>as determined by law</b>."<br><br>As to the fourth point,<b> Congress meant not to incorporate its intent </b>in what eventually became R.A. No. 9009.  To recall, Senate President Franklin Drilon asked if there would be an appropriate language to be crafted which would reflect the intent of Congress.  Senator Aquilino Pimentel gave a categorical answer: "<b>I do not think it is necessary to put that provision because what we are saying here will form part of the interpretation of this bill</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup><br><br>Neither is the fifth item persuasive.  The dissent admits that <b>courts may resort to extrinsic aids of statutory construction like the legislative history of the law  if the literal application of the law results in absurdity, impossibility, or injustice</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup><br><br>The sixth reason misses the point.  It is immaterial if Congress is not a continuing body.  The hearings and deliberations conducted during the 11th or 12th Congress may still be used as extrinsic aids or reference because <b>the same cityhood bills which were filed before the passage of R.A. No. 9009 were being considered during the 13th Congress</b>.<br><br>It does not matter if the officers of each Congress or the authors of the bills are different.  In the end, <b>the rationale for exempting the cityhood bills from the P100,000,000.00 income requirement imposed by R.A. No. 9009 remains the same</b>: (1) the cityhood bills were pending before the passage of R.A. No. 9009, and (2) respondent municipalities were compliant with the P20,000,000.00 income requirement imposed by the old Section 450 of the Local Government Code, which was eventually amended by R.A. No. 9009.<br><br>What should not be overlooked  is  that the  cityhood  laws  enjoy the presumption of constitutionality.  Petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention bear the heavy burden of overcoming such presumption.  However, the majority does exactly the opposite.  <b>It shifts the <i>onus probandi</i> to respondent municipalities to prove that their cityhood laws are constitutional.  That is violative of the basic rule of evidence</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br>On the last ground, the majority misreads the dissent.  The exemption on the 16<sup> </sup>municipalities is not only based on the fact that they had pending cityhood bills when R.A. No. 9009 was enacted.  Aside from complying with the territory and population requirements of the Local Government Code, these municipalities also met the P20,000,000.00 income threshold of the old Section 450 of the Local Government Code.<br><br><center><b>A Parting Word</b></center><br>The decade-long quest of respondent municipalities for cityhood merits an approval, not rejection.<br><br>Section 10, Article X of the 1987 Constitution requires, aside from a plebiscite, that the criteria established in the  Local Government Code  should  be  followed in  the creation of  a city. R.A. No. 9009, which became Section 450 of  the Local Government Code, prescribes an income threshold of P100,000,000.00. But the <b>intent</b> of R.A. No. 9009 is clear.  Congress intended to exempt municipalities (1) that had pending cityhood bills before the passage of R.A. No. 9009; <b>and</b> (2) that were compliant with the income threshold of P20,000,000.00 under the old Section 450 of the Local Government Code. Respondent municipalities are covered by the twin criteria.<br><br>Thus, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention cannot hardly claim the cityhood laws are unconstitutional on the ground they violate the criteria established in the Local Government Code.  Neither may they claim that the <br> cityhood laws violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  Congress is given the widest latitude in making classifications and in laying down the criteria.  Separation of powers prevents the Court from prying into the wisdom or judgment of Congress.  Even  if the  Court  did, there is no unreasonable classification here, much less grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Admittedly, R.A. No. 9009 is geared towards making it very difficult for municipalities and cluster of <i>barangays</i> to convert into cities.  The dissent is not contrary to that goal.  The intent of Congress - to avert the mad rush of municipalities wanting to be converted into cities and to prevent this nation from becoming a nation of all cities and no municipalities - is preserved.  A cluster of <i>barangays</i> or municipalities that had (1) no pending cityhood bills before the passage of R.A. No. 9009; <b>and</b> (2) that were not compliant with the income threshold of P20,000,000.00 imposed by the old Section 450 of the Local Government Code, cannot find refuge in the cityhood laws in their bid to become component cities.  They now have to comply with the P100,000,000.00 income requirement imposed by R.A. No. 9009.  In the alternative, they should seek the amendment of R.A. No. 9009 if they wish to lower the income requirement.<br><br><center><b>Disposition</b></center><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petitions and petitions-in-intervention and to declare the cityhood laws <b>CONSTITUTIONAL</b>.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  The Sixteen (16) Cityhood Laws are the following:<br><ol><li>Republic Act No. 9389, otherwise known as "An Act converting the Municipality of Baybay in the Province of Leyte into a component city to be known as City of Baybay."

It is one hundred sixty-five (165) kilometers away from Davao City, a one and a half-hour drive from Tagum City.  Visitors can travel from Davao City through the Madaum diversion road, which is shorter than taking the Davao-Tagum highway.  Travels by air and sea are possible, with the existence of an airport and seaport. Mati boasts of being the coconut capital of Mindanao if not the whole country.  A large portion of its fertile land is planted to coconuts, and a significant number of its population is largely dependent on it.  Other agricultural crops such as mango, banana, corn, coffee and cacao are also being cultivated, as well as the famous Menzi <i>pomelo</i> and Valencia oranges.  Mati has a long stretch of shoreline and one can find beaches of pure, powder-like white sand.  A number of resorts have been developed and are now open to serve both local and international tourists. Some of these resorts are situated along the coast of Pujada Bay and the Pacific Ocean.  Along the western coast of the bay lies Mt. Hamiguitan, the home of the pygmy forest, where bonsai plants and trees grow,some of which are believed to be a hundred years old or more.  On its peak is a lake, called "Tinagong Dagat," or hidden sea, so covered by dense vegetation a climber has to hike trails for hours to be able to reach it.  The mountain is also host to rare species of flora and fauna, thus becoming a wildlife sanctuary for these life forms. <http: mati.wetpaint.com="" ?t="anon"> accessed on September 19, 2008.<br><br>Mati is abundant with nickel, chromite, and copper.

The first settlers referred to this place as Narra, derived from the hudge trees, which later simply became Naga.  Considered as one of the oldest settlements in the Province of Cebu, Naga became a municipality on June 12, 1829.  The municipality has gone through a series of classifications as its economic development has undergone changes and growth. The tranquil farming and fishing villages of the natives were agitated as the Spaniards came and discovered coal in the uplands.  Coal was the first export of the municipality, as the Spaniards mined and sent it to Spain.  The mining industry triggered the industrial development of Naga.  As the years progressed, manufacturing and other industries followed, making Naga one of the industrialized municipalities in the Province of Cebu.<br><br></http:></http:><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="45%"><div align="justify"><span>Class of Municipality <br></span></div></td> <td width="55%"><div align="justify"><span>1<sup>st</sup> class</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>Province</span></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><span> Cebu</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>Distance from Cebu City .</span></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><span>22 kms</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>Number of Barangays </span></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><span>28</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>No. of Registered Voters </span></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><span>44,643 as of May 14, 2007</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>Total No. of Precincts </span></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><span>237 (as of May 14, 2007)</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span>Ann.
