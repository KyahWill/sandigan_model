				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the Decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed that of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch 24 nullifying the marriage of respondent, Lynnette Cabantug-Baguio (Lynnette), to Martini Dico Baguio (Martini), the Republic through the Office of the Solicitor General filed the present petition for review.<br><br>Lynnette and Martini contracted marriage on August 12, 1997.

Martini, however, stayed there only on weekends, and during weekdays he stayed with his parents in Looc, Lapu-lapu City. While Lynnette suggested that the two of them stay in the house of Martini's parents, Martini disagreed, claiming that there were many already living with his parents.<br><br>Lynnette noticed that every time she conversed with Martini, he always mentioned his mother and his family, and she soon realized that he was a "mama's boy." And she noticed too that when she would call up Martini at his parent's house and his mother was the one who answered the call, she would deny that he was around.<br><br>In 1998, after Martini again returned following an almost 10-month contract overseas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> he stayed with Lynnette.&nbsp; When in 1999 Martini again disembarked, he stayed with his parents.<br><br>On the insistence of his mother, Martini's monetary allotment was shared equally between her and Lynnette.<br><br>Lynnette had since January 1999 not heard from Martini.&nbsp; And since April 1999, Lynnette stopped receiving her share of the allotment, drawing her to inquire from Martini's employer who informed her that he had already disembarked on even month.&nbsp;&nbsp; She soon found out that Martini was in Alabang, Muntinlupa.<br><br>When Lynnette and Martini finally met in Cebu City, he told her that they are not compatible and should just part ways.<br><br>The last time the couple talked was on October 14, 1999 when Martini was at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) about to depart for abroad.&nbsp; Since then, Martini never communicated with Lynnette.&nbsp; On investigation, Lynnette learned that Martini declared in his employment records that he was "single" and named his mother as principal allottee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Hence, Lynnette's filing of the complaint for declaration of nullification of marriage.<br><br>Aside from her deposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Lynnette presented her Certificate of Marriage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Martini's undated Seafarer Information Sheet,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; the letter of clinical psychologist Dr. Andres S.

During the trial, Dr. Gerong also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failed to explain in detail why the defendant's alleged psychological incapacity is grave and to discuss what kind of disorder defendant is suffering from</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original; italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On the doctor's findings in his Report, the Solicitor General argued:<br><blockquote>The said findings <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">reveal nothing in defendant's </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">past </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">life and acts</span> </i>that shows a behavior pattern that would prove his alleged psychological incapacity.&nbsp; Dr. Gerong's finding that defendant's parents are too controlling because they were made co-allottees of the remittances sent by their son does not prove the alleged psychological incapacity of defendant.&nbsp; The report likewise <i style="text-decoration: underline;">failed to explain </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the gravity of the alleged psychological incapacity of defendant and state whether or not it incapacitates defendant from carrying out the normal and ordinary duties of marriage and family</span>.&nbsp; There is likewise no explanation by Dr. Gerong <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why he found defendant's incapacity to be incurable</span>.&nbsp; This Honorable Court has held that such illness must be shown to be grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligation of the marriage.&nbsp; Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent or incurable and grave [<b>Republic vs. Court of Appeals and Molina</b>, <i>supra</i>].&nbsp; These Dr. Gerong failed to do.<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even when the rules have been relaxed and the personal examination of the defendant by a psychiatrist or psychologist is no longer mandatory</span> </b>for the declaration of nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the totality of evidence presented during trial by private respondent must </span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">still </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">prove </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged psychological incapacity</span> </b>(<b>Marcos v.

Care must be observed so that these various circumstances are not to be applied indiscriminately as if the law were indifferent on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>And Article 36 should not be confused with a divorce law that cuts the marital bond at the time the causes therefor manifest themselves, nor with legal separation in which the grounds need not be rooted in psychological incapacity but on physical violence, moral pressure, moral corruption, civil interdiction, drug addiction, habitual alcoholism, sexual infidelity, abandonment, and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>"<i>Psychological incapacity</i>" has been elucidated on as follows:<br><blockquote>The term "<i>psychological incapacity</i>" to be a ground for the nullity of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code, refers to a serious psychological illness afflicting a party even before the celebration of the marriage.&nbsp; It is a malady so grave and so permanent as to deprive one of awareness of the duties and responsibilities of the matrimonial bond one is about to assume.&nbsp; As all people may have certain quirks and idiosyncrasies, or isolated characteristics associated with certain personality disorders, there is hardly a doubt that the intendment of the law has been to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confine the meaning of "</span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">psychological incapacity</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">" to the most serious cases of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage</b>. x x x [T]he root cause must be identified as a psychological illness, and its incapacitating nature must be fully explained x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp;

From Lynnette's deposition, however, it is gathered that Martini's failure to establish a common life with her stems from his refusal, not incapacity, to do so.
