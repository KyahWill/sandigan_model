Prado</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>Inconsistencies and discrepancies on minor details of the testimony of a witness serve instead to strengthen his credibility as they are badges of truth rather than indicia of falsehood. The most candid witnesses oftentimes make mistakes and fall into confused and inconsistent statements but such honest lapses do not necessarily affect their credibility.Far from eroding the effectiveness of the testimonies of the two witnesses, such trivial differences in fact constitute signs of veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>We agree with the CA that the alleged inconsistency "only challenges the exact time when Cayetano gave his statement to the police."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The fact that Cayetano had conflicting accounts as to when he gave his statement to the police, does not in any way alter his testimony that appellant is one of the malefactors.He witnessed the crimes and had positively identified appellant.<br><br>Contrary to his claim, Cayetano specifically identified appellant as one of the assailants in his sworn affidavit before the police authorities.He even declared that he could also identify the other two suspects in case he sees them again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Cayetano confirmed this on the witness stand, thus:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">A:</td><td width="90%">I turned my back and I saw my two (2) companions fell down with blood, Sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>Were those shots successive?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>Yes, Sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>When you turned your back you saw the two (2) victims slumped on the ground?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><p>Yes, Sir.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>What else did you see aside from the two victims slumped on the ground?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>I saw the three (3) persons who shot them, Sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><b>Those three (3) persons who shot the victims, can you recognize them?</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><b>I only recognized one [but] I do not know the other two (2), Sir.</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><b>You cannot recognize the two (2) persons who shot the victim[s]?</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><b>Yes, Sir.</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><b>You said that you recognized the (<i>sic</i>) one, who is that person whom you recognized?</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><b>Warren</b><b> dela Cruz, Sir.</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><b>Will you please rise and point at him.</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><b>(Witness pointed to a person inside the courtroom who when asked answered to the name </b><b>Warren</b><b> dela Cruz.)</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>You said that you heard shots, did you also recognize the weapon used?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>Yes, Sir, one (1) .45 and one (1) .38 caliber.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>And who was holding the .45 caliber firearm?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td>One of the companions of the accused Warren dela Cruz, Sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td><b>How about the .38 caliber revolver?</b></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify"><b>Warren</b><b> dela Cuz, Sir.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><b> </b>(Emphasis supplied)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Cayetano also testified that he had known appellant for a long time as a tricycle driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, he could not have been mistaken with his identity.Nor is there any evidence that Cayetano was impelled by improper motives in pointing a finger at appellant as one of the culprits.The absence of evidence of improper motive tends to indicate that his testimony is worthy of full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Self-serving denial cannot overthrow the positive identification that appellant was one of the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In <i>Ferrer v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court reiterated the longstanding doctrine that denial -<br><blockquote>x x x is intrinsically a weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.To be sure, it is negative, self-serving evidence that cannot be given evidentiary weight greater than that of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the negative averments of the accused, the former indisputably deserve more credence and evidentiary weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>TheCourtreaffirmedthisdoctrine in<i>Velasco v.

More importantly, as a mother, Julieta cannot totally be considered as a disinterested witness.Her maternal instincts may impel her to protect her son at all cost, even to the point of prevarication.<br><br><b>Treachery qualified the killings to murder; treachery absorbs abuseofsuperior strength</b>.Appellantarguesthat treacherywasnot present in the commission of the crime.He claims that the prosecution failed to present any positive proof that he has resolved to commit the crime.There was no proof that the death of the victims was the result of mediation, calculation or reflection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><b><i></i></b><br><br>We hold otherwise.There is treachery when the offender commits the crime employing means, methods or forms of execution thereof which tend directly and specifically to ensure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the victim might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The elements of treachery are: (1) the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (2) the means of execution were deliberate or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Here, Danilo and Felix were shot from behind while they were innocently walking on their way to the cockpit arena in Dampalit, Malabon.They were unaware of the impending death that awaited them.In fact, they were unarmed.They were shot unceremoniously. The absence of warning deniedthemthe opportunity to defend themselves or retaliate.Treachery was clearly present.<br><br>Records also show that the malefactors were all armed while Danilo and Felix were not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> There was abuse of superior strength.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>However, as the RTC and CA correctly held, abuse of superior strength is absorbed in treachery.Pursuanttothis Court'srulingin <i>People v. Ellado</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> abuse of superior strength can no longer be separately considered as an aggravating circumstance.<b><i></i></b><br><br><b>There is no violation of appellant's right to information</b>.<b><i> </i> </b>Appellant also argues that he was denied due process of law.He claims that even if he is found guilty, the qualifying circumstance of treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength alleged in the two Informations should not be appreciated against him becausetheywerenot specifiedin ordinary and concise language sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what those qualifying circumstances were.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><b><i></i></b><br><br>Sections 8 and 9 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure provide:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8.<i>Designation of the offense</i>. - The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.<br><br>Sec. 9. <i>Cause of the accusation</i>. - The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know whatoffense isbeingcharged as wellas its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment.</blockquote>This Court interpreted the above sections in <i>People v. Aquino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as requiring simply that the Information enumerate the attendant circumstances mentioned in the law to qualify the offense.It is sufficient that these circumstances are specified in the Information to apprise the accused of the charge.Said the Court:<br><blockquote>The use of the words "aggravating/qualifying circumstances" will not add any essential element to the crime.Neither will the use of such words further apprise the accused of the nature of the charge.<u>The specific allegation of the attendant circumstance in the Information, coupled with the designation of the offense and a statement of the acts constituting the offense as required in Sections 8 and 9 of Rule 110, is sufficient to warn the accused</u> x x x.<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>Thus, even the attendant circumstance itself, which is the essential element that raises the crime to a higher category, need not be stated in the language of the law.With more reason, the words "aggravating/qualifying circumstances" as used in the law need not appear in the Information, especially since these words are merely descriptive of the attendant circumstances and do not constitute an essential element of the crime.These words are also not necessary in informing the accused that he is charged of a qualified crime.<u>What properly informs the accused of the nature of the crime charged is the specific allegation of the circumstances mentioned in the law that raise the crime to a higher category.</u><br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>WethereforereiteratethatSections 8 and 9 of Rule 110 merely require that the Information allege, specify or enumerate the attendant circumstances mentioned in the law to qualify the offense.

This includes the death penalty in proper cases.<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>To guide the bench and the bar, this Resolution clarifies and resolves the issue of how to allege or specify qualifying or aggravating circumstances in the Information.
