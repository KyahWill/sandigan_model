				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><i>Via </i>a contract denominated as "CREDIT LINE AND REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE AGREEMENT FOR PROPERTY LINE"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (<i>Credit Line Agreement</i>) executed on March 31, 1997, Leo-Mers Commercial, Inc., as the Client, and  its officers spouses Leopoldo and Mercedita Viola (petitioners) obtained a loan through a credit line facility in the maximum amount of P4,700,000.00 from the Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCI Bank), which was later merged with Equitable Bank and became known as Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. (respondent).<br><br>The <i>Credit Line Agreement </i>stipulated that the loan would bear interest at the "prevailing PCIBank lending rate" per annum on the principal obligation and a "penalty fee of three percent (3%) per month on the outstanding amount."<br><br>To secure the payment of the loan, petitioners executed also on March 31, 1997 a "Real Estate Mortgage"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in favor of PCIBank over their two parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title No. N-113861 (consisting of 300 square meters, more or less ) and N-129036 (consisting of 446 square meters, more or less) of the Registry of Deeds of Marikina.<br><br>Petitioners availed of the full amount of the loan. Subsequently,   they made partial payments which totaled P3,669,210.67. By respondent's claim, petitioner had since November 24, 2000 made no further payments and despite demand, they failed to pay their outstanding obligation which, as of September 30, 2002, totaled P14,024,623.22, broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="left">Principal obligation </div></td> <td width="75%"> <div align="justify">P4,783,254.69</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td> <td><div align="left">Past due interest from<br> 11/24/00 to 09/30/02<br> at 15% interest </div></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="justify">P1,345,290.38</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="left">Penalty at 3% per month<br> from 03/31/98 to 02/23/02</div></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="justify">P7,896,078.15</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="middle"><div align="justify">_____________________<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">P14,024,623.22<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Respondent thus extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage before the Office of the Clerk of Court &amp; Ex-Officio Provincial Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Marikina City. The mortgaged properties were sold on April 10, 2003 for P4,284,000.00 at public auction to respondent, after  which a Certificate of Sale dated April 21, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was issued.<br><br>More than five months later or on October 8, 2003, petitioners filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for annulment of foreclosure sale, accounting and damages before the Marikina RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 2003-905-MK and raffled to Branch 192.  Petitioners alleged, <i>inter alia</i>, that they had made substantial payments of P3,669,210.67 receipts of which were issued without respondent specifying "whether the payment was for interest, penalty or the principal obligation;" that based on respondent's statement of account, not a single centavo of their payments was applied to the principal obligation; that every time respondent sent them a statement of account and demand letters, they requested for a proper accounting for the purpose of determining their actual obligation, but all their requests were unjustifiably ignored on account of which they were forced to discontinue payment; that "the foreclosure proceedings and auction sale were not only irregularly and prematurely held but were <u>null and void because the mortgage debt is only P2,224,073.31 on the principal obligation and P1,455,137.36 on the interest, or a total of only P3,679,210.67 as of April 15, 2003</u>, but the mortgaged properties were sold to satisfy an inflated and erroneous principal obligation of <i>P4,783,254.69, plus 3% penalty fee per month or 33% per year and 15% interest per year, which amounted to P14,024,623.22 as of September 30, 2002</i>;" that "the parties <u><i>never agreed and stipulated</i> in the <i>real estate mortgage contract</i>" that the <i>15% interest per annum on the principal loan and the 3% penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount</i> would be covered or secured by the mortgage</u>; that assuming respondent could impose such interest and penalty fee, the same are "exorbitant, unreasonable, iniquitous and unconscionable, hence, must be reduced;" and that respondent is only allowed to impose the legal rate of interest of <i>12%</i> per annum on the principal loan absent any stipulation thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In its Answer, respondent denied petitioners' assertions, contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that the absence of stipulation in the mortgage contract securing the payment of 15% interest per annum on the principal loan, as well as the 3% penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount, is immaterial since the mortgage contract is "a mere accessory contract which must take its bearings from the principal <i>Credit Line Agreement</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>During the pre-trial conference, the parties defined as <u><i>sole issue </i>in the case whether the mortgage contract <b>also secured </b>the payment of 15% interest per annum on the principal loan of P4,700,000.00 and the 3% penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount</u>, which interest and penalty fee are stipulated only in the <i>Credit Line Agreement</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of September 14, 2005, the trial court sustained respondent's affirmative position on the issue but found the questioned interest and penalty fee "excessive and exorbitant." Thus, it equitably <u>reduced</u> the interest on the principal loan from 15% to <u>12%</u> per annum and the penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount from 3% to <u>1.5%</u> per month.<br><br>Accordingly, the court nullified the foreclosure proceedings and the Certificate of Sale subsequently issued, "without prejudice" to the holding anew of foreclosure proceedings based on the "re-computed amount" of the indebtedness, "if the circumstances so warrant."<br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1) The interest on the principal loan in the amount of Four Million Seven Hundred Thousand (P4,700,000.00) Pesos should be <u>recomputed at 12% per annum;</u><br><br>2) The 3% per month penalty on delinquent account as stipulated by the parties in the Credit Line Contract dated March 31, 1997 is hereby <u>REDUCED to 1.5% per month</u>;<br><br>3) The <u>foreclosure sale</u> conducted on April 10, 2003 by the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of Marikina, to satisfy the plaintiff's mortgage indebtedness, <u>and the Certificate of Sale</u> issued as a consequence of the said proceedings, <u>are declared NULL and VOID, without prejudice to the conduct of another foreclosure proceedings on the basis of the re-computed amount of the plaintiff's indebtedness, if the circumstances so warrant.</u><br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> contending that the penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount should have been taken out of the coverage of the mortgage contract as it was not stipulated therein.  By Order dated December 6, 2005, the trial court denied the motion.<br><br>On appeal by petitioners, the Court of Appeals, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of February 21, 2007, <u>dismissed</u> the same for lack of merit, holding that "the Real Estate Mortgage <b>covers not only</b> the principal amount [of P4,700,000.00] but also the `interest and <b>bank charges</b>,' which [phrase bank charges] refers to the <b>penalty charges </b>stipulated in the Credit Line Agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><b> </b><br><br>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of May 16, 2007, they filed the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, alleging that -<br><blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DECIDING THE CASE NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT BY RULING THAT THERE IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO AMBIGUITY</span> IN CONSTRUING TOGETHER THE CREDIT LINE AND MORTGAGE CONTRACTS WHICH PROVIDED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONFLICTING PROVISIONS</span> AS TO INTEREST AND PENALTY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The only issue is whether the mortgage contract <u>also secured the penalty fee</u> per month on the outstanding amount as stipulated in the <i>Credit Line Agreement</i>.<br><br>The Court holds not.<br><br>A mortgage must "<u>sufficiently describe</u> the debt sought to be secured, which description must not be such as to mislead or deceive, and an obligation is not secured by a mortgage unless it comes fairly within the terms of the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the parties executed two separate documents on March 31, 1997 - the <i><u>Credit Line Agreement</u></i> granting the Client a loan through a credit facility in the maximum amount of P4,700,000.00, and the <u>Real Estate Mortgage contract</u> securing the payment thereof.  Undisputedly, both contracts were prepared by respondent and written in fine print, single space.<br><br>The <i>Credit Line Agreement </i>contains the following stipulations on interest and delinquency charges:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CREDIT  FACILITY</span><br></div><br>9.

The phrase "bank charges" is normally understood to refer to compensation for <u>services</u>. A "penalty fee" is likened to a compensation for <u>damages</u> in case of breach of the obligation.  Being <i><u>penal</u> </i>in nature, such fee must be <u>specific</u> and <u>fixed</u> by the contracting parties, unlike in the present case which slaps a <u>3% penalty fee per month of the <b>outstanding </b>amount of the obligation.</u><br><br>Moreover, the "penalty fee" does not belong to the species of obligation enumerated in the mortgage contract, namely: "loans, credit and other banking facilities obtained x x x from the Mortgagee, . . . including the interest and bank charges, . . . the costs of collecting the same and of taking possession of and keeping the mortgaged properties, and all other expenses to which the Mortgagee may be put in connection with or as an incident to this mortgage . . ."<br><br>In <i>Philippine Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which raised a similar issue, this Court held:<br><blockquote>The sole issue in this case is whether, in the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage, the penalties stipulated in two promissory notes secured by the mortgage may be charged against the mortgagors as part of the sums secured, although the mortgage contract does not mention the said penalties.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We immediately discern that <u>the mortgage contract does not at all mention the penalties stipulated in the promissory notes</u>. However, the petitioner insists that the penalties are covered by the following provision of the mortgage contract:<br><blockquote>This mortgage is given as security for the payment to the MORTGAGEE on demand or at maturity, as the case may be, of all promissory notes, letters of credit, trust receipts, bills of exchange, drafts, overdrafts and all other obligations of every kind already incurred or which hereafter may be incurred....<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>The Court is unconvinced</u>, for the cases relied upon by the petitioner are inapplicable. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>The mortgage contract is also one of adhesion as it was prepared solely by the petitioner and the only participation of the other party was the affixing of his signature or "adhesion" thereto. <u>Being a contract of adhesion, the mortgage is to be strictly construed against the petitioner, the party which prepared the agreement.</u><br><br><u>A reading, not only of the earlier quoted provision, but of the entire mortgage contract yields no mention of penalty charges. Construing this silence strictly against the petitioner, it can fairly be concluded that the petitioner did not intend to include the penalties on the promissory notes in the secured amount</u>. This explains the finding by the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that "penalties and charges are not due for want of stipulation in the mortgage contract."<br><br><u>Indeed, <b>a mortgage must sufficiently describe the debt sought to be secured</b>, which description must not be such as to mislead or deceive, and <b>an obligation is not secured by a mortgage unless it comes fairly within the terms of the mortgage</b></u>. In this case, the mortgage contract provides that it secures notes and other evidences of indebtedness. Under the rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i>, where a description of things of a particular class or kind is "accompanied by words of a generic character, the generic words will usually be limited to things of a kindred nature with those particularly enumerated . . . " <b><u>A penalty charge does not belong to the species of obligations enumerated in the mortgage, hence, the said contract cannot be understood to secure the penalty</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondent's contention that the absence in the mortgage contract of a stipulation securing the payment of the 3% penalty fee per month on the outstanding amount is of no consequence, the deed of mortgage being merely an "accessory contract" that "must take its bearings from the principal <i>Credit Line Agreement</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> fails.  Such absence is significant as it <br>creates an ambiguity between the two contracts, which ambiguity must be resolved in favor of petitioners and against respondent who drafted the contracts. Again, as stressed by the Court in <i>Philippine Bank of Communications</i>: <br><blockquote>There is also sufficient authority to declare that any ambiguity in a contract whose terms are susceptible of different interpretations must be read against the party who drafted it.<br><br><u>A mortgage and a note secured by it are deemed parts of one transaction and are construed together, thus, <b>an ambiguity is created when the notes provide for the payment of a penalty but the mortgage contract does not</b>. Construing the ambiguity against the petitioner, it follows that <b>no penalty was intended to be covered by the mortgage</b>.</u> The mortgage contract consisted of three pages with no less than seventeen conditions in fine print; it included provisions for interest and attorney's fees similar to those in the promissory notes; and it even provided for the payment of taxes and insurance charges. <u>Plainly, the petitioner can be as specific as it wants to be, yet it simply did not specify nor even allude to, that the penalty in the promissory notes would be secured by the mortgage. This can then only be interpreted to mean that the petitioner had no design of including the penalty in the amount secured.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Court of Appeals Decision of February 21, 2007 and Resolution of May 16, 2007 in CA-G.R.
