The employee questions the propriety of his dismissal after he was caught stealing 1.335 kilos of squid heads worth P50.00. He invokes his almost thirty-one (31) years of untarnished service and the several awards he received from the company to temper the penalty of dismissal meted on him.<br><center><br><b>The Facts<br><br></b></center>Petitioner Julito Sagales was employed by respondent Rustan's Commercial Corporation from October 1970 until July 26, 2001, when he was terminated. At the time of his dismissal, he was occupying the position of Chief Cook at the Yum Yum Tree Coffee Shop located at Rustan's Supermarket in Ayala Avenue, Makati City. He was paid a basic monthly salary of P9,880.00. He was also receiving service charge of not less than P3,000.00 a month and other benefits under the law and the existing collective bargaining agreement between respondent and his labor union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In the course of his employment, petitioner was a consistent recipient of numerous citations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for his performance. After receiving his latest award on March 27, 2001, petitioner conveyed to respondent his intention of retiring on October 31, 2001, after reaching thirty-one (31) years in service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Petitioner, however, was not allowed to retire with his honor intact.<br><br>On June 18, 2001, Security Guard Waldo Magtangob, upon instructions from Senior Guard Bonifacio Aranas, apprehended petitioner in the act of taking out from Rustan's Supermarket a plastic bag. Upon examination, it was discovered that the plastic bag contained 1.335 kilos of squid heads worth P50.00. Petitioner was not able to show any receipt when confronted. Thus, he was brought to the Security Office of respondent corporation for proper endorsement to the Makati Headquarters of the Philippine National Police. Subsequently, petitioner was brought to the Makati Police Criminal Investigation Division where he was detained. Petitioner was later ordered released pending further investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Respondent alleged that prior to his detention, petitioner called up Agaton Samson, Rustan's Branch Manager, and apologized for the incident. Petitioner even begged Samson that he would just pay for the squid heads. Samson replied that it is not within his power to forgive him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On June 19, 2001, petitioner underwent inquest proceedings for qualified theft before Assistant Prosecutor Amado Y. Pineda. Although petitioner admitted that he was in possession of the plastic bag containing the squid heads, he denied stealing them because he actually paid for them. As proof, petitioner presented a receipt. The only fault he committed was his failure to immediately show the purchase receipt when he was accosted because he misplaced it when he changed his clothes. He also alleged that the squid heads were already "scraps" as these were not intended for cooking. Neither were the squid heads served to customers. He bought the squid heads so that they could be eaten instead of being thrown away. If he intended to steal from respondent, he could have stolen other valuable items instead of scrap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Assistant Prosecutor Pineda believed the version of petitioner and recommended the dismissal of the case for "lack of evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The recommendation was approved upon review by City Prosecutor Feliciano Aspi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding the dismissal of the complaint, respondent, on June 25, 2001, required petitioner to explain in writing within forty-eight (48) hours why he should not be terminated in view of the June 18, 2001 incident. Respondent also placed petitioner under preventive suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On June 29, 2001, petitioner was informed that a formal investigation would be conducted by the Legal Department on July 6, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Petitioner and his counsel attended the administrative investigation where he reiterated his defense before the inquest prosecutor. Also in attendance were Aranas and Magtangob, who testified on the circumstances surrounding the apprehension of petitioner; Samson, the branch manager to whom petitioner allegedly apologized for the incident; and Zenaida Castro, cashier, who testified that the squid heads were not paid.<br><br>Respondent did not find merit in the explanation of petitioner. Thus, petitioner was dismissed from service on July 26, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> At that time, petitioner had been under preventive suspension for one (1) month.<br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against respondent. He also prayed for unpaid salaries/wages, overtime pay, as well as moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and service charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]<br><br></sup><center><b>Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On July 24, 2002, Labor Arbiter Felipe P.

The challenged resolutions of April 10, 2003 and July 31, 2003 of public respondent NLRC are <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

According to the CA, "the award of separation pay cannot be sustained under the social justice theory" because the instant case "involves theft of the employer's property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Left with no other recourse, petitioner availed of the present remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]<br><br></sup><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Petitioner in his Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> imputes to the CA the following errors, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li><u>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION</u> AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION <u>WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT THE POSITION OF THE PETITIONER BEING AN ASSISTANT COOK AS A SUPERVISORY POSITION</u> FOR BEING CONTRADICTORY TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.<br><br></li><li><u>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION</u> AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION <u>WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT THE DOCTRINE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE APPLIES AGAINST THE PETITIONER TO JUSTIFY HIS DISMISSAL FROM EMPLOYMENT</u> FOR BEING CONTRADICTORY TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>For a full resolution of the issues in the instant case, the following questions should be answered: (1) Is the position of petitioner supervisory in nature which is covered by the trust and confidence rule? (2) Is the evidence on record sufficient to conclude that petitioner committed the crime charged? and (3) Assuming that the answer is in the affirmative, is the penalty of dismissal proper?<br><center><br><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b>I. The position of petitioner is supervisory in nature which is covered by the trust and confidence rule</b>.<br><br>The nature of the job of an employee becomes relevant in <b>termination of employment by the employer</b> because the rules<b> </b>on<b> </b>termination<b> </b>of managerial and supervisory employees are different from those on the rank-and-file. Managerial employees are tasked to perform key and sensitive functions, and thus are bound by more exacting work ethics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As a consequence, managerial employees are covered by the trust and confidence rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The same holds true for supervisory employees occupying positions of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>There is no doubt that the position of petitioner as chief cook is supervisory in nature. A chief cook directs and participates in the preparation and serving of meals; determines timing and sequence of operations required to meet serving times; and inspects galley and equipment for cleanliness and proper storage and preparation of food.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Naturally, a chief cook falls under the definition of a supervisor, i.e., one who, in the interest of the employer, effectively recommends managerial actions which would require the use of independent judgment and is not merely routinary or clerical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>It has not escaped Our attention that petitioner changed his stance as far as his actual position is concerned. In his position paper, he alleged that at the time of his dismissal, he was "Chief Cook."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, in his memorandum, he now claimed that he was an "Asst. Cook."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The ploy is clearly aimed at giving the impression that petitioner is merely a rank-and-file employee. The change in nomenclature does not, however, help petitioner, as he would still be covered by the trust and confidence rule. In <i>Concorde Hotel v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court categorically ruled:<br><blockquote><b>Petitioner is correct insofar as it considered the nature of private respondent's position as assistant cook a position of trust and confidence</b>.<b> </b>As assistant cook, private respondent is charged with the care of food preparation in the hotel's coffee shop. He is also responsible for the custody of food supplies and must see to it that there is sufficient stock in the hotel kitchen. He should not permit food or other materials to be taken out from the kitchen without the necessary order slip or authorization as these are properties of the hotel. Thus, the nature of private respondent's position as assistant cook places upon him the duty of care and custody of Concorde's property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Of course, the ruling assumes greater significance if petitioner is the <u>chief cook</u>. A chief cook naturally performs greater functions and has more responsibilities than an assistant cook. <i>In eo quod plus sit simper inest et minimus</i>. The greater always includes the less. <b><i>Ang malawak ay laging sumasakop sa maliit</i></b>.<br><br><b>II. The evidence on record is sufficient to conclude that petitioner committed the crime charged</b>.<b></b><br><br>Security of tenure is a paramount right of every employee that is held sacred by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The reason for this is that labor is deemed to be "property"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> within the meaning of constitutional guarantees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Indeed, as it is the policy of the State to guarantee the right of every worker to security of tenure as an act of social justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> such right should not be denied on mere speculation of any similar or unclear nebulous basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Indeed, the right of every employee to security of tenure is all the more secured by the Labor Code by providing that "the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized" by law. Otherwise, an employee who is illegally dismissed "shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Necessarily then, the employer bears the burden of proof to show the basis of the termination of the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, respondent has discharged its <i>onus</i> of proving that petitioner committed the crime charged. We quote with approval the observation of the CA in this regard:<br><blockquote>On this matter, petitioner presents as evidence the verified statement of security guard Aranas. Aranas positively saw the private in the act of bringing out the purloined squid heads. Similarly, the statement of security guard Magtangob attested to the commission by private respondent of the offense charged. Further, the verified statement of Samson, store manager of petitioner corporation who is in charge of all personnel, including employees of the Yum Yum Tree Coffee Shop of which private respondent was a former assistant cook, attested to the fact of private respondent seeking apology for the commission of the act. Likewise, the statement of Zenaida Castro (Castro), cashier of petitioner corporation's supermarket, Makati Branch, Ayala Center, Makati City, confirmed that indeed the 1.335 kilos of squid heads amounting to fifty pesos (P50.00)per kilo, had not been paid for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>The contention of petitioner that respondent merely imputed the crime against him because he was set to retire is difficult, if not impossible, to believe. Worth noting is the fact that petitioner failed to impute any ill will or motive on the part of the witnesses against him. As aptly observed by the Labor Arbiter:<br><blockquote>It seems unbelievable to believe that the apprehending officers up to the Manager, Mr. Samson, were all telling a lie as what complainant wants to portray when he alleged in his pleadings that he mentioned to the apprehending officers [that] he has a receipt for [the squid heads] and that he never apologized. This is understandable on his part because complainant wants no loophole in his version. And an easy way out is to fabricate his allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>We stress that the quantum of proof required for the application of the loss of trust and confidence rule is <b>not</b> proof beyond reasonable doubt. <b>It is sufficient that there must only be some basis for the loss of trust and confidence or that there is reasonable ground to believe, if not to entertain the moral conviction, that the employee concerned is responsible for the misconduct and that his participation in the misconduct rendered him absolutely unworthy of trust and confidence</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>It is also of no moment that the criminal complaint for qualified theft against petitioner was dismissed. It is well settled that <b>the conviction of an employee in a criminal case is not indispensable to the exercise of the employer's disciplinary authority</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><b>III</b><b>. The penalty of dismissal is too harsh under the circumstances</b>.<b></b><br><br>The free will of management to conduct its own business affairs to achieve its purpose cannot be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The only condition is that the exercise of management prerogatives should not be done in bad faith<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> or with abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Truly, while the employer has the inherent right to discipline, including that of dismissing its employees, this prerogative is subject to the regulation by the State in the exercise of its police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In this regard, it is a hornbook doctrine that <b>infractions committed by an employee should merit only the corresponding penalty demanded by the circumstance. The penalty must be commensurate with the act, conduct or omission imputed to the employee and must be imposed in connection with the disciplinary authority of the employer</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>For example, in <i>Farrol v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the employee, who was a district manager of a bank, incurred a shortage of P50,985.37. He was dismissed although the funds were used to pay the retirement benefits of five employees of the bank. The employee was also able to return the amount, leaving a balance of only P6,995.37 of the shortage. The bank argued that under its rules, the penalty for the infraction of the employee is dismissal. The Court disagreed and held that the penalty of dismissal is too harsh. The Court took note that it is the first infraction of the employee and that he has rendered twenty-four (24) long years of service to the bank. In the words of <b>Mme. Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago</b>, "<b>the dismissal imposed on petitioner is unduly harsh and grossly disproportionate to the infraction which led to the termination of his services. A lighter penalty would have been more just, if not humane</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>So too did the Court pronounce in <i>Felix v.

Santos</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner deserves compassion more than condemnation. At the end of the day, it is undisputed that: (1) petitioner has worked for respondent for almost thirty-one (31) years; (2) his tireless and faithful service is attested by the numerous awards<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> he has received from respondent; (3) the incident on June 18, 2001 was his first offense in his long years of service; (4) the value of the squid heads worth P50.00 is negligible; (5) respondent practically did not lose anything as the squid heads were considered scrap goods and usually thrown away in the wastebasket; (6) the ignominy and shame undergone by petitioner in being imprisoned, however momentary, is punishment in itself; and (7) petitioner was preventively suspended for one month, which is already a commensurate punishment for the infraction committed. Truly, petitioner has more than paid his due.<br><br>In any case, it would be useless to order the reinstatement of petitioner, considering that he would have been retired by now. Thus, in lieu of reinstatement, it is but proper to award petitioner separation pay computed at one-month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one whole year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In the computation of separation pay, the period where backwages are awarded must be included.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br><b>Word of caution</b>.<br><br>We do not condone dishonesty. After all, honesty is the best policy. However, punishment should be commensurate with the offense committed. The supreme penalty of dismissal is the death penalty to the working man. Thus, care should be exercised by employers in imposing dismissal to erring employees. The penalty of dismissal should be availed of as a last resort.<br><br>Indeed, the immortal words of Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Enrique Fernando ring true then as they do now: "where a penalty less punitive would suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not be visited with a consequence so severe. It is not only because of the law's concern for the workingman. There is, in addition, his family to consider.
