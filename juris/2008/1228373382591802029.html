Dumlao, A. Florentino R. Dumlao, Jr., Stella Dumlao-Atienza, and Nestor R. Dumlao, heirs of the deceased Florentino G.

Finding the valuation to be correct, petitioner bank informed respondents of the said valuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Payments were then deposited in the name of the landowners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Meanwhile, processing of the properties covered by the other four (4) titles, namely, TCT Nos. 41505, 41506, 41507 and 41508, remains pending with the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On July 9, 1995, respondents filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 28,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for determination of just compensation for their properties.  It was claimed, <i>inter alia</i>, that they were not paid their just compensation for the properties despite issuance of certificates of land transfer to farmer-beneficiaries by the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They prayed for the appointment of three (3) competent and disinterested commissioners who would determine and report to the court the just compensation of their landholdings based on their current fair market value, without prejudice to their retention rights.  They also asked for payment of actual and moral damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In its Answer, the DAR, represented by the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office  (MARO)  and  Provincial Agrarian Reform Office  (PARO), posited that the complaint lacked a cause of action and that the RTC did not have jurisdiction.  Under Section 50 of RA No. 6657, it is the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) which is vested with primary and original jurisdiction over land valuation, while the RTC as a Special Agrarian Court may review the DARAB's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, which was impleaded as defendant in the valuation case before the trial court, likewise filed its Answer, raising a similar line of defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  Petitioner added that while payment for the properties covered by TCT Nos. T-1180 and T-41504 were already deposited in trust for respondents, the claimfolders for the remaining four properties is still with the DAR.  Thus, the filing of the complaint against petitioner was premature.<br><br>After the termination of pre-trial conference, respondent Atty. A. Florentino Dumlao, Jr. submitted his affidavit on which he was cross-examined.  Following the submission of their testimonial and documentary evidence, respondents rested their case.<br><br>Upon motion of respondents, the RTC, on April 15, 1998, appointed Atty. John D. Balasya, Clerk of Court, as commissioner.  He was mandated to "receive, examine, and ascertain valuation of the properties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Believing that the valuation of the properties is not commensurate to their true value and, hence, not a "just" compensation, Atty. Balasya stated in his Commissioner's Report dated July 21, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>The evidences submitted by the parties as well as those gathered by  the undersigned show that only  two (2)  parcels of land were valued under Presidential Decree No. 27. The parcels of land are located in Nagbitin, Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya and per Exhibit "O," the unirrigated riceland in Nagbitin are considered first class agricultural lands. Under Tax Ordinance No. 96-45 adopting and authorizing the 1996 Schedule of Fair Market Values for the Different Classes of Real Property in Nueva Vizcaya (Exhibit "G" and Exhibit "G-1") the market value of first class unirrigated Riceland in the Municipality of Villaverde is P109,000.00 Per Department Order No. 56-97 dated May 27, 1997 issued by the Department of Finance, Re: Implementation of the Revised Zonal Values of Real Properties in all Municipalities under the jurisdiction of Revenue District Office No. 14 (Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya), Revenue Region No. 3, Tuguegarao, Cagayan for Internal Revenue Tax purposes, the zonal value of land in other <i>Barangays</i> in Villaverde is P60.00/square meter.<br><br>In summary, the undersigned believes that the valuation of respondents Land Bank of the Philippines and the Department of Agrarian Reform is not commensurate to the definition of just compensation x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b>RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>On October 14, 1998, the RTC issued a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the <i>fallo </i>of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby orders the remand of the case with respect to TCT Nos. 1180 and T-41504 to the proper DAR agency for further proceedings  and  orders  the dismissal of the case with respect to TCT Nos. T-41508, T-41507, T-41506, and T-41505 for having been prematurely filed, there being no preliminary valuation made yet on the said parcels of land. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents moved for reconsideration.  Consequently, on December 21, 1998, the trial court modified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> its decision in the following manner:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, in the higher interest of justice, the Court MODIFIES its October 14, 1998 decision by ordering plaintiffs to adduce additional evidence to support their contentions under PD 27/EO 228 within 30 days from receipt of this Order furnishing a copy thereof to the defendants who are given 15 days from receipt to comment thereon.  Thereafter, the matter shall be deemed submitted for resolution.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Instead of adducing additional evidence,  respondents  filed  a motion for reconsideration of the trial court's December 21, 1998 order.  Positing that the additional evidence required by the court pertains to the formula under PD No. 27, respondents insisted on P109,000.00 per hectare, the market value of the properties, as just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Accordingly, the trial court, on March 18, 1999, issued another order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby sets the just compensation in the amount of P6,912.50 per hectare for lot covered by TCT No. T-1180 and the amount provided for in the Land Valuation Summary and Farmers Undertaking for lot covered by TCT No. T-41504 to be paid to the plaintiffs with interest from the time of the taking until fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>CA Disposition</b><br></div><br>Dissatisfied with the March 18, 1999 RTC Order, respondents appealed to the CA.

The plaintiffs-appellants' right of retention is recognized.  Plaintiffs-appellants Josefina, A. Florentino, Jr. and Stella, all surnamed Dumlao are each entitled to retain five (5) hectares pursuant to the provisions of R.A. 6657.<br><br>The excess in area after application of the right of retention is valued at One Hundred Nine Thousand (P109,000.00) Pesos per hectare with interest at the prevailing rate from the time of taking until fully paid.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA declared that the definite time of the actual taking of the subject properties is not certain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  Further, there is no doubt that the transfer of the subject landholdings is governed by PD No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  However, after the passage of RA No. 6657, the formula relative to valuation under PD No. 27 no longer applies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  The appellate court held:<br><blockquote>The trial court, therefore, in the determination of just compensation is not confined within the valuation provisions of P.D. 27.  It can depart from it so long as the valuation assigned on the land transferred is within the meaning of the phrase "just compensation" provided for in <i>J.M. Tuazon Co. vs. Land Tenure Administration </i>(31 SCRA 413).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Relying on the Commissioner's Report, the CA assigned the lower value of P109,000.00 per hectare as just compensation for the subject properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Petitioner bank has resorted to the present recourse, imputing to the CA the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>A.<br></center><br>WHEN THE CHALLENGED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DECISION ADHERED TO THE COMMISSIONER'S REPORT AND FIXED THE VALUE</span> OF THE LANDHOLDINGS AT P109,000.00 PER HECTARE WITH INTEREST AT THE PREVAILING RATE FROM THE TIME OF TAKING UNTIL FULLY PAID, WORKING A MODIFICATION OF THE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED BASIC FORMULA FOR DETERMINING THE JUST COMPENSATION OF LANDS ACQUIRED THROUGH OPERATION LAND TRANSFER (OLT), CONTRARY TO THE CLEAR MANDATE OF PD 27/EO 228.<br><br><center>B.<br></center><br>WHEN THE CHALLENGED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DECISION DECLARED THAT OCTOBER 21, 1972 CANNOT BE DEEMED AS THE DATE OF TAKING</span> OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES.<br><br><center>C.<br></center><br>WHEN THE CHALLENGED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">DECISION DECLARED THAT </span>RESPONDENTS' ENTIRE LANDHOLDINGS ARE COVERED BY PD 27 AND THAT RESPONDENTS JOSEFINA, A.

Respondents, on the other hand, insist on the application of RA No. 6657 with respect to the computation.<br><br>Petitioner is mistaken.  The 1987 Constitution, specifically Article XIII on Social Justice and Human Rights, mandates the State's adoption of an agrarian reform program for the benefit of the common people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  The recognition of the need for genuine land reform, however, started earlier.  PD No. 27,  issued on October 21, 1972,  more than a decade before the enactment of the 1987 Constitution, provided for the compulsory acquisition of private lands for distribution among tenant-farmers and specified the maximum retention limits for landowners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The agrarian reform thrust was further energized with the enactment of EO No. 228 on July 17, 1987, when full land ownership was declared in favor of the beneficiaries of PD No. 27.  The executive issuance also provided for the valuation of still unvalued covered lands, as well as the manner of their payment.  On July 22, 1987, Presidential Proclamation No. 131, instituting a comprehensive agrarian reform program, as well as EO No. 229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> providing the mechanics for its implementation, were likewise enacted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>When the Philippine Congress was formally reorganized, RA No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, was immediately enacted.  It was signed by President Corazon Aquino on June 10, 1988.  This law, while considerably changing the earlier <br> presidential issuances, including PD No. 27 and EO No. 228, nevertheless gave them suppletory effect insofar as they are not inconsistent with its provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On one hand, PD No. 27 provides the formula to be used in arriving at the exact total cost of the acquired lands:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><blockquote>For the purpose of determining the cost of the land to be transferred to the tenant-farmer pursuant to this Decree, <b>the value of the land shall be equivalent to two and one half (2-1/2) times the average harvest of three normal crop years immediately preceding the promulgation of this Decree</b>.<br><br>The total cost of the land, including interest at the rate of six (6) per centum per annum, shall be paid by the tenant in fifteen (15) years of fifteen (15) equal annual amortizations.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Implementing the formula under PD No. 27, EO No. 228 states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. Henceforth, the valuation of rice and corn lands covered by P.D. No. 27 shall be based on the average gross production determined by the <i>Barangay</i> Committee on Land Production in accordance with Department Memorandum Circular No. 26, series of 1973 and related issuances and regulation of the Department of Agrarian Reform.  <b>The average gross production per hectare shall be multiplied by two and a half (2.5), the product of which shall be multiplied by Thirty-Five Pesos (P35.00), the government support price for one cavan of 50 kilos of <i>palay</i> on </b><b>October 21, 1972</b>, or Thirty-One Pesos (P31.00), the government support price for one cavan of 50 kilos of corn on October 21, 1972, <b>and the amount arrived at shall be the value of the rice and corn land, as the case may be, for the purpose of determining its cost to the farmer and compensation to the landowner</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, under PD No. 27 and EO No. 228, the formula for computing the Land Value (LV) or Price Per Hectare (PPH) of rice and corn lands is:<br><blockquote>2.5 x AGP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> x GSP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> = LV or PPH<br></blockquote>The parameters of PD No. 27 and EO No. 228 are manifestly different from the guidelines provided by RA No. 6657 for determining just compensation.  Section 17 of RA No. 6657 is explicit:<br><blockquote>Sec. 17.  <i>Determination of Just Compensation</i>.  -  In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of the like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.<br></blockquote>Due to the divergent formulae or guidelines presented by these laws, a number of cases have already been brought to the Court regarding which law applies in computing just compensation for landholdings acquired under PD No. 27.  On this score, the Court has repeatedly held that if just compensation was not settled prior to the passage of RA No. 6657, it should be computed in accordance with said law, although the property was acquired under PD No. 27.<br><br>In the recent <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We rejected the DAR's valuation of just compensation based on the formula provided by PD No. 27 and EO No. 228.  We held then that Section 17 of RA No. 6657 is applicable.  The latter law, being the <b>latest</b> law in agrarian reform, should control.<br><blockquote>When RA 6657 was enacted into law in 1988, the agrarian reform process in the present case was still incomplete as the amount of just compensation to be paid to Domingo had yet to be settled. Just compensation should therefore be determined and the expropriation process concluded under RA 6657.<br><br><b>Guided by this precept, just compensation for purposes of agrarian reform under PD 27 should adhere to Section 17 of RA 6657</b> x x x.<br></blockquote>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Estanislao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court ruled that taking into account the passage of RA No. 6657 in 1988 pending the settlement of just compensation, it is that law which applies to landholdings seized under PD No. 27, with said decree and EO No. 288 having only suppletory effect.  Prior to that declaration, the Court already decreed in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> citing <i>Paris v. Alfeche</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>Under the factual circumstances of this case, the agrarian reform process is still incomplete as the just compensation to be paid private respondents has yet to be settled. Considering the passage of Republic Act No. 6657 (6657) before the completion of the process, the just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under the said law.  Indeed, RA 6657 is the applicable law, with PD 27 and EO 228 having only suppletory effect, conformably with our ruling in <i>Paris  v. Alfeche</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Agrarian reform is a revolutionary kind of expropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The recognized rule in expropriation is that title to the expropriated property shall pass from the owner to the expropriator only upon full payment of the just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Thus, payment of just compensation to the landowner is indispensable.<br><br>In fact, Section 4, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution mandates that the redistribution of agricultural lands shall be subject to the payment of just compensation.  The deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission on this subject reveal that just compensation should not do violence to the Bill of Rights but should also not make an insurmountable obstacle to a successful agrarian reform program.  Hence, the landowner's right to just compensation should be balanced with agrarian reform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In the case under review, the agrarian reform process was not completed.  The just compensation to be paid respondents was not settled prior to the enactment of RA No. 6657, the law subsequent to PD No. 27 and EO No. 228.  In fact, the non-payment of just compensation is precisely the reason why respondents filed a petition for the determination of just compensation before the RTC on July 13, 1995.<br><br>The records do not show when respondents or their father, Florentino Dumlao, was formally notified of the expropriation.  The records, however, bear out that the bank sent Florentino Dumlao a letter stating that it had approved the land transfer claim involving that property covered by TCT No. T-1180 on November 5, 1990.  Moreover, the various Land Valuation Summary and Farmers Undertakings showing the valuation of the land transferred to the farmers-beneficiaries were approved on May 17, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and July 21, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  It is thus crystal clear that even after the passage of RA No. 6657 in 1988, neither petitioner nor the DAR had settled the matter of just compensation with respondents as landowners.<br><br>Besides, RA No. 6657 applies to rice and corn lands covered by PD No. 27.  In <i>Paris v. Alfeche</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court explained:<br><blockquote>Considering the passage of RA 6657 before the completion of the application of the agrarian reform process to the subject lands, the same should now be completed under the said law, with PD 27 and EO 228 having only suppletory effect.  This ruling finds support in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. CA, </i>wherein the Court stated:<br><blockquote>"<b>We cannot see why Sec. 18 of RA 6657 should not apply to rice and corn lands under PD 27</b>.  Section 75 of RA 6657 clearly states that the provisions of PD 27 and EO 228 shall only have a suppletory effect. Section 7 of the Act also provides -<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Priorities. - </i>The DAR, in coordination with the PARC shall plan and program the acquisition and distribution of all agricultural lands through a period of ten (10) years from the effectivity of this Act. Lands shall be acquired and distributed as follows:<br><br>Phase One: <i>Rice and Corn lands under P.D. 27; </i>all idle or abandoned lands; all private lands voluntarily offered by the owners for agrarian reform; x x x and all other lands owned by the government devoted to or suitable for agriculture, which shall be acquired and distributed immediately upon the effectivity of this Act, with the implementation to be completed within a period of not more than four (4) years.<br></blockquote><b>This eloquently demonstrates that RA 6657 includes  PD 27  lands among  the properties  which  the </b><b>DAR</b><b> shall acquire and distribute to the landless.  And to facilitate the acquisition and distribution thereof, Secs. 16, 17, and 18 of the Act should be adhered to</b>.  In <i>Association of Small Landowners of the Philippines v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>, this Court applied the provisions (of) RA 6657 to rice and corn lands when it upheld the constitutionality of the payment of just compensation for PD 27 lands through the different modes stated in Sec. 18."  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Verily, there is nothing to prevent Section 17 of RA No. 6657 from being applied to determine the just compensation for lands acquired under PD No. 27.<br><br>In <i>Natividad</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court ruled that the DAR's failure to determine the just compensation for a considerable length of time made it inequitable to follow the guidelines provided by PD No. 27 and EO No. 228.  Hence, RA No. 6657 should apply.  The same rationale was followed in <i>Meneses v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  There, the Court noted that despite the lapse of more than thirty (30) years since the expropriation of the property in 1972, petitioners had yet to benefit from it, while the farmer-beneficiaries were already harvesting the property's produce.  Thus, RA No. 6657 was applied instead of PD No. 27 in determining just compensation.<br><br>In <i>Meneses</i>, the Court compared the conflicting rulings in <i>Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> cited by petitioner, and <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  This Court affirmed <i>Natividad, </i>stating that it would be more equitable to apply the same due to the circumstances obtaining, i.e. the more than 30-year delay in the payment of just compensation.<br><br>The application of RA No. 6657 due to the inequity faced by landowners continued in <i>Lubrica v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  The landowners were also deprived of their properties in 1972 but had yet to receive their just compensation even after the passage of RA No. 6657.  Since the landholdings were already subdivided and distributed to the farmer-beneficiaries, the Court, speaking through Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago, deemed it unreasonable to compute just compensation using the values at the time of taking in 1972 as dictated by PD No. 27, and not at the time of payment pursuant to RA No. 6657.<br><br>We find no cogent reason not to apply the same ratiocination here.  In the case at bar, emancipation patents, and eventually, transfer certificates of title, were issued to the farmer-beneficiaries<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> at least twenty-eight (28) years ago.  On March 16, 1990, the DAR acknowledged that the property covered by TCT No. T-1180 had already been distributed to farmer-beneficiaries  through  emancipation  patents.

It would certainly be iniquitous to wait for the DAR to process the properties covered by the four other titles before the special agrarian court can finally determine the amount of their just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br><b>Third, </b>while the DAR is vested with primary jurisdiction to determine in a <b>preliminary manner </b>the amount of just compensation, the circumstances of this case militate against the application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.<br><br>The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies is a relative one and is flexible depending on the peculiarity and uniqueness of the factual and circumstantial settings of a case. It is disregarded: (1) when there is a violation of due process; (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question; (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal and amounts to lack or excess of jurisdiction; (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned; (5) when there is irreparable injury; (6) when respondent is a department secretary whose acts, as an alter ego of the President, bears the implied and assumed approval of the latter; (7) <b>when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable</b>; (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim;       (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings;      (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy; (11) <b>when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention, and unreasonable delay would greatly prejudice the complainant</b>; (12) when no administrative review is provided by law;     (13) where the rule of qualified political agency applies; and (14) when the issue of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies has been rendered moot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Here, to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable. What is more, judicial intervention is necessary so as not to unduly prejudice the landowners.  Respondents have long been deprived of their landholdings, yet compensation has been withheld from them.  Accordingly, to make respondents wait for the DAR to process the claimfolders of the remaining four properties would be unreasonable, unjust and manifestly prejudicial to them.<br><br><b>Respondents are entitled to the right of retention over their lands</b>.<br><br>The right of retention is constitutionally guaranteed, subject to qualification by the legislature.  It serves to mitigate the effects of compulsory land acquisition by balancing the rights of the landowner and the tenant and by implementing the doctrine that social justice was not meant to perpetrate an injustice against the landowner.  A retained area, as its name denotes, is land which is not supposed to anymore leave the landowner's dominion, thus sparing the government from the inconvenience of taking land only to return it to the landowner afterwards, which would be a pointless process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The opinion of the MARO<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> that respondents are not entitled to retain areas out of their landholdings because they applied for the same after the grace period set by the government<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> fails to persuade.  A landowner whose land was taken pursuant to PD No. 27 has a right to retain seven hectares of land, provided that the landowner is cultivating the area or will now cultivate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Those who did not avail of their rights of retention under PD No. 27 are entitled to exercise the same under Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> of RA No. 6657.[101]  Landowners may still avail of their retention rights notwithstanding the August 27, 1985 deadline imposed by DAR AO No. 1, Series of 1985.  In <i>Daez v. Court of Appeals</i>,[102] the Court, citing <i>Association of Small Landowners, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>,[103] disregarded said deadline and sustained the landowner's retention rights.  Notably, under RA No. 6657, landowners who do not personally cultivate their lands are no longer required to do so in order to qualify for the retention of an area not exceeding five hectares.  Instead, they are now required to maintain the actual tiller of the area retained, should the latter choose to remain in those lands.[104]  Verily, there is no impediment to the exercise by respondents of their retention rights under RA No. 6657.<br><br>In sum, We rule that:<br><ol><li>The provisions of RA No. 6657 apply in determining the just compensation due to respondents for the taking of their property.
