The motion was denied, as well as respondent’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On December 27, 1999, the Ombudsman for Mindanao found respondent Masing guilty as charged and ordered her suspension for six (6) months without pay.&nbsp;

The Office of the Ombudsman was not allowed by the Court of Appeals to intervene because (1) the motions to intervene were filed after the decisions have already been rendered in CA-G.R.&nbsp; SP Nos.&nbsp; 58735 and 61993, and (2) the Office of the Ombudsman was the quasi-judicial body which rendered the impugned decisions.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court provides that a motion for intervention may be filed <span style="font-style: italic;">before </span>rendition of judgment, viz:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.&nbsp; <i>Time to intervene.</i>– <b>The motion to intervene may be filed at any time before rendition of judgment</b> by the trial court.&nbsp; A copy of the pleading-in-intervention shall be attached to the motion and served on the original parties.&nbsp; (<i>emphasis ours</i>)<br></blockquote>We have ruled however that allowance or disallowance of a motion for intervention rests on the sound discretion of the court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> after consideration of the appropriate circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Rule 19 of the <b>Rules of Court</b> is a rule of procedure whose object is to make the powers of the court fully and completely available for justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Its purpose is not to hinder or delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, interventions have been allowed even beyond the prescribed period in the Rule in the higher interest of justice.&nbsp; Interventions have been granted to afford indispensable parties, who have not been impleaded, the right to be heard even after a decision has been rendered by the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> when the petition for review of the judgment was already submitted for decision before the Supreme Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and even where the assailed order has already become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <b>In Lim v.&nbsp; Pacquing</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the motion for intervention filed by the Republic of the Philippines was allowed by this Court to avoid grave injustice and injury and to settle once and for all the substantive issues raised by the parties.<br><br>In the cases at bar, the rulings of the Court of Appeals adversely affected the all-important jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.&nbsp; The rulings aggrieved the Office of the Ombudsman for they have serious consequences on its effectiveness as the body charged by the Constitution with the prosecution of officials and employees of the government suspected of violating our laws on graft and corruption.<br><br>In <b>Civil Service Commission v.&nbsp; Dacoycoy,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we recognized the standing of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to appeal a decision of the Court of Appeals which reversed its decision finding Dacoycoy guilty of nepotism and ordering his dismissal from the service.&nbsp; Although the CSC was the quasi-judicial body which rendered the decision appealed to the Court of Appeals, it became the party aggrieved or adversely affected by its decision which “seriously prejudices the civil service system.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In <b>Constantino-David v.&nbsp; Pangandaman-Gania,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we likewise ruled that the CSC may seek a review of decisions of the Court of Appeals that are detrimental to its constitutional mandate as the central personnel agency of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>However, rather than remand the cases at bar to the Court of Appeals for a ruling on the merits of the Ombudsman’s motions for reconsideration, we shall resolve the legal issues involved in the interest of speedy justice.<br><br>The authority of the Ombudsman to act on complaints filed against public officers and employees is explicit in Article XI, Section 12 of the <b>1987 Constitution</b>, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall <b>act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations,</b> and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof.&nbsp; (<i>emphasis ours</i>)<br></blockquote>Article XI, Section 13 of the same Constitution delineates the powers, functions and duties of the Ombudsman as follows:<br><blockquote>1) Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.<br><br>(2) Direct, upon complaint or at its own instance, any public official or employee of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, as well as of any government-owned or controlled corporation with original charter, to perform and expedite any act or duty required by law, or to stop, prevent, and correct any abuse or impropriety in the performance of duties.<br><br>(3) Direct the officer concerned to take appropriate action against a public official or employee at fault, and recommend his removal, suspension, demotion, fine, censure, or prosecution, and ensure compliance therewith.<br><br>(4) Direct the officer concerned, in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, to furnish it with copies of documents relating to contracts and transactions entered into by his office involving the disbursement or use of public funds or properties, to the Commission on Audit for appropriate and report any irregularity action.<br><br>(5) Request any government agency for assistance and information necessary in the discharge of its responsibilities, and to examine, if necessary, pertinent records and documents.<br><br>(6) Publicize matters covered by its investigation when circumstances so warrant and with due prudence.<br><br>(7) Determine the causes of inefficiency, red tape, mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the Government and make recommendations for their elimination and the observance of high standards of ethics and efficiency.<br><br>(8) Promulgate its rules and procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law.<br></blockquote>The enumeration of these powers is non-exclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Congress enacted R.A.&nbsp;

No.&nbsp; 6770 is intended to play a more active role in the enforcement of laws on anti-graft and corrupt practices and other offenses committed by public officers and employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The Ombudsman is to be an “activist watchman,” not merely a passive one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He is vested with broad powers to enable him to implement his own actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Respondents, however, insist that the findings of the Ombudsman are mere recommendations, and that he may not directly impose administrative sanctions on public officials and employees, citing <b>Tapiador v.&nbsp; Office of the Ombudsman</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> where the following statement is found, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>x x x x Besides, assuming <i>arguendo</i>, that petitioner was administratively liable, the Ombudsman has no authority to directly dismiss the petitioner from the government service, more particularly from his position in the BID.&nbsp; Under Section 13, subparagraph (3), of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman can only “recommend” the removal of the public official or employee found to be at fault, to the public official concerned.<br></blockquote>The foregoing is now a settled issue.&nbsp; In <b>Ledesma v.&nbsp; Court of Appeals,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we explained <i>Tapiador</i> and ruled categorically that:<br><blockquote>x x x x Under Section 13(3) of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, it is provided:<br><blockquote>Section 13.&nbsp;

that is, that the Ombudsman’s action is only advisory in nature rather than one having any binding effect, citing <i>Tapiador v.&nbsp; Office of the Ombudsman</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; Besides, assuming <i>arguendo</i>, that petitioner were administratively liable, the Ombudsman has no authority to directly dismiss the petitioner from the government service, more particularly from his position in the BID.&nbsp; Under Section 13, subparagraph (3), of Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman can only “recommend” the removal of the public official or employee found to be at fault, to the public official concerned.<br></blockquote>For their part, the Solicitor General and the Office of the Ombudsman argue that the word “<i>recommend</i>” must be taken in conjunction with the phrase <i>“and ensure compliance therewith.”</i> <b>The proper interpretation of the Court’s statement in Tapiador should be that the Ombudsman has the authority to determine the administrative liability of a public official or employee at fault, and direct and compel the head of the office or agency concerned to implement the penalty imposed.&nbsp; In other words, it merely concerns the <i>procedural</i> aspect of the Ombudsman’s functions and not its <i>jurisdiction</i>.</b><br></blockquote>We agree with the ratiocination of public respondents.&nbsp; Several reasons militate against a literal interpretation of the subject Constitutional provision.&nbsp; Firstly, a cursory reading of Tapiador reveals that the main point of the case was the failure of the complainant therein to present substantial evidence to prove the charges of the administrative case.&nbsp; <b>The statement that made reference to the power of the Ombudsman is, at best, merely an <i>obiter dictum</i> and, as it is unsupported by sufficient explanation, is susceptible to varying interpretations x x x x [h]ence, it cannot be cited as a doctrinal declaration of this Court nor is it safe from judicial examination.</b>&nbsp; (<i>emphases ours</i>)<br><br>We reiterated this ruling in <b>Office of the Ombudsman v.&nbsp; Laja</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> where we emphasized that “the Ombudsman’s order to remove, suspend, demote, fine, censure, or prosecute an officer or employee is not merely advisory or recommendatory but is <b>actually mandatory</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Implementation of the order imposing the penalty is, however, to be coursed through the proper officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Recently, in <b>Office of the Ombudsman v.&nbsp;

No.&nbsp; 4670 provides—<br><blockquote>Section 9.&nbsp; <i>Administrative Charges.</i>- Administrative charges against a teacher shall be heard initially by a committee composed of the corresponding School Superintendent of the Division or a duly authorized representative who should at least have the rank of a division supervisor, where the teacher belongs, as chairman, a representative of the local or, in its absence, any existing provincial or national teachers’ organization and a supervisor of the Division, the last two to be designated by the Director of Public Schools.&nbsp; The Committee shall submit its findings, and recommendations to the Director of Public Schools within thirty days from the termination of the hearings; <i>Provided, however</i>, That where the school superintendent is the complainant or an interested party, all the members of the committee shall be appointed by the Secretary of Education.<br></blockquote><br>In <b>Fabella</b>, several public schoolteachers were administratively charged by then DECS Secretary Isidro Cariño for taking part in mass actions in violation of civil service laws and regulations.&nbsp; A committee was constituted to hear the charges.&nbsp; The teachers assailed the procedure adopted by the committee in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.&nbsp; In affirming the regional trial court’s decision which declared illegal the constitution of the committee, we ruled—<br><blockquote>x x x x Section 9 of RA 4670 x x x reflects the legislative intent to impose a standard and a separate set of procedural requirements in connection with administrative proceedings involving public schoolteachers.&nbsp;

The public schoolteachers in <b>Fabella</b> were charged with violations of civil service laws, rules and regulations in administrative proceedings initiated by the DECS Secretary.&nbsp; In contrast, herein respondents Masing and Tayactac were administratively charged in letter-complaints duly filed before the Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao.&nbsp; The charges were for violations of R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6713, otherwise known as the <b>Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees</b>, collecting unauthorized fees, failure to remit authorized fees, failure to account for public funds, oppression, serious misconduct, discourtesy in the conduct of official duties, and physical or mental incapacity or disability due to immoral or vicious habits.&nbsp; In short, the acts and omissions complained of relate to respondents’ conduct as public official and employee, if not to outright graft and corruption.<br><br>The authority of the Office of the Ombudsman to conduct administrative investigations is beyond cavil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><b> As the principal and primary complaints and action center</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> against erring public officers and employees, it is mandated by no less than Section 13(1), Article XI of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In conjunction therewith, Section 19 of R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6770 grants to the Ombudsman the authority to act on all administrative complaints,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 19.&nbsp; <i>Administrative complaints.</i>— The Ombudsman shall act on all complaints relating, but not limited, to acts or omissions which:<br><br>(1) Are contrary to law or regulation;<br>(2) Are unreasonable, unfair, oppressive or discriminatory;<br>(3) Are inconsistent with the general course of an agency’s functions, though in accordance with law;<br>(4)&nbsp; Proceed from a mistake of law or an arbitrary ascertainment of facts;<br>(5) Are in the exercise of discretionary powers but for an improper purpose; or<br>(6) Are otherwise irregular, immoral or devoid of justification.<br></blockquote>Section 23(1) of the same law provides that administrative investigations conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman shall be in accordance with its rules of procedure and consistent with due process.<br><br>It is erroneous, therefore, for respondents to contend that R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4670 confers an exclusive disciplinary authority on the DECS over public school teachers and prescribes an exclusive procedure in administrative investigations involving them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4670 was approved on June 18, 1966.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 1987 Constitution was ratified by the people in a plebiscite in 1987 while R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6770 was enacted on November 17, 1989.&nbsp; It is basic that the 1987 Constitution should not be restricted in its meaning by a law of earlier enactment.&nbsp; The 1987 Constitution and R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6770 were quite explicit in conferring authority on the Ombudsman to act on complaints against <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>public officials and employees, with the exception of officials who may be removed only by impeachment or over members of Congress and the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> If an issue should ever arise, therefore, it should rather be whether the 1987 Constitution and R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6770 have abrogated R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4670.&nbsp; However, repeals by implication are not favored, and courts have the duty to harmonize, so far as it is practicable, apparently conflicting or inconsistent provisions.&nbsp; Therefore, the statement in <b>Fabella</b> that Section 9 of R.A.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4670 “reflects the legislative intent to impose a standard and a separate set of procedural requirements in connection with administrative proceedings involving public schoolteachers” should be construed as referring only to the <span style="font-style: italic;">specific </span>procedure to be followed in administrative investigations conducted by the DECS.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the petitions are <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp;
