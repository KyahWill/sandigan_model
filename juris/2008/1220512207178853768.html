Respondent insists that Jose A. Olaguer was duly authorized by a written power of attorney when the properties were sold to him (Ongjoco).&nbsp; He posits that this fact alone validated the sales of the properties and foreclosed the need for any inquiry beyond the title to the principal.&nbsp; All the law requires, respondent concludes, is that the agent's authority be in writing in order for the agent's transactions to be considered valid.<br><br>Respondent Ongjoco's posture is only partly correct.<br><br>According to the provisions of Article 1874<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the Civil Code on Agency, when the sale of a piece of land or any interest therein is made through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing.&nbsp; Absent this requirement, the sale shall be void.&nbsp; Also, under Article 1878,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> a special power of attorney is necessary in order for an agent to enter into a contract by which the ownership of an immovable property is transmitted or acquired, either gratuitously or for a valuable consideration.<br><br>We note that the resolution of this case, therefore, hinges on the existence of the written power of attorney upon which respondent Ongjoco bases his good faith.<br><br>When Lots Nos. 1 and 2 were sold to respondent Ongjoco through Jose A. Olaguer, the Transfer Certificates of Title of said properties were in Virgilio's name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Unfortunately for respondent, the power of attorney that was purportedly issued by Virgilio in favor of Jose Olaguer with respect to the sale of Lots Nos. 1 and 2 was never presented to the trial court.&nbsp; Neither was respondent able to explain the omission.&nbsp; Other than the self-serving statement of respondent, no evidence was offered at all to prove the alleged written power of attorney. This of course was fatal to his case.<br><br>As it stands, there is no written power of attorney to speak of.&nbsp; The trial court was thus correct in disregarding the claim of its existence. Accordingly, respondent Ongjoco's claim of good faith in the sale of Lots Nos. 1 and 2 has no leg to stand on.<br><br>As regards Lots Nos. 76-D, 76-E, 76-F and 76-G, Ongjoco was able to present a general power of attorney that was executed by Virgilio Olaguer.&nbsp; While the law requires a special power of attorney, the general power of attorney was sufficient in this case, as Jose A. Olaguer was expressly empowered to sell any of Virgilio's properties; and to sign, execute, acknowledge and deliver any agreement therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Even if a document is designated as a general power of attorney, the requirement of a special power of attorney is met if there is a clear mandate from the principal specifically authorizing the performance of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The special power of attorney can be included in the general power when the act or transaction for which the special power is required is specified therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On its face, the written power of attorney contained the signature of Virgilio Olaguer and was duly notarized.&nbsp; As such, the same is considered a public document and it has in its favor the presumption of authenticity and due execution, which can only be contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>No evidence was presented to overcome the presumption in favor of the duly notarized power of attorney.&nbsp; Neither was there a showing of any circumstance involving the said document that would arouse the suspicion of respondent and spur him to inquire beyond its four corners, in the exercise of that reasonable degree of prudence required of a man in a similar situation.&nbsp; We therefore rule that respondent Ongjoco had every right to rely on the power of attorney in entering into the contracts of sale of Lots Nos. 76-D to 76-G with Jose A. Olaguer.<br><br>With respect to the affidavit of Virgilio Olaguer in which he allegedly disavowed any claim or participation in the purchase of any of the properties of the deceased Lino Olaguer, we hold that the same is rather irrelevant.&nbsp; The affidavit was executed only on 1 August 1986 or six years after the last sale of the properties was entered into in 1980.&nbsp; In the determination of whether or not a buyer is in good faith, the point in time to be considered is the moment when the parties actually entered into the contract of sale.<br><br>Furthermore, the fact that Lots Nos. 76-D to 76-G were sold to respondent Ongjoco twice does not warrant the conclusion that he was a buyer in bad faith.&nbsp; While the said incidents might point to other obscured motives and arrangements of the parties, the same do not indicate that respondent knew of any defect in the title of the owner of the property.<br><br>As to the petition filed by Jose A. Olaguer for the issuance of a second owner's copy of the title to Lot No. 76-D, after the property was already sold to respondent Ongjoco, the same does not inevitably indicate that respondent was in bad faith.&nbsp; It is more likely that Jose A. Olaguer was merely compiling the documents necessary for the transfer of the subject property.&nbsp; Indeed, it is to be expected that if the title to the property is lost before the same is transferred to the name of the purchaser, it would be the responsibility of the vendor to cause its reconstitution.<br><br>In sum, we hold that respondent Emiliano M. Ongjoco was in bad faith when he bought Lots Nos. 1 and 2 from Jose A. Olaguer, as the latter was not proven to be duly authorized to sell the said properties.<br><br>However, respondent Ongjoco was an innocent purchaser for value with regard to Lots Nos. 76-D, 76-E, 76-F and 76-G since it was entirely proper for him to rely on the duly notarized written power of attorney executed in favor of Jose A.
