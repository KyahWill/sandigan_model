Flores guilty of malversation of public funds in Crim. Case Nos. 16794 and 16795.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>During the incumbency of President Corazon C. Aquino, Tarlac Province was chosen as one of the four provinces that would serve as a test case on decentralization of local government administration.<br><br>For this purpose, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) released National Aid for Local Government Units (NALGU) funds in the total amount of P100 million to the Province of Tarlac. The NALGU is a fund set aside in the General Appropriations Act to assist local governments in their various projects and services. The distribution of this fund is entirely vested with the Secretary of the DBM.<br><br>Petitioner Ocampo, provincial governor of Tarlac from February 22, 1988 up to June 30, 1992, loaned out P56.6 million of the P100 million to the Lingkod Tarlac Foundation, Inc. (LTFI) for the implementation of various livelihood projects. The loan was made pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) entered into by the Province of Tarlac, represented by petitioner Ocampo, and LTFI, represented by petitioner Flores, on August 8, 1988.<br><br>LTFI is a private non-stock corporation with petitioner Ocampo as its first chairperson and petitioner Andres S. Flores as its executive director. The Sandiganbayan, in its Resolution dated January 6, 2000, admitted the annexes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> submitted by petitioner Ocampo, which annexes proved that petitioner Ocampo resigned as chairperson and trustee of the LTFI prior to August 8, 1988, the date when petitioner Ocampo and LTFI entered into the MOA.<br><br>How the P56.6 million released to LTFI was utilized became the subject matter of 25 criminal cases. In a Resolution in G.R. Nos. 103754-78 dated October 22, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> this Court quashed 19 of the 25 Informations filed against petitioner Ocampo. The Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan dismissed one case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on demurrer to evidence. In its Decision promulgated on March 8, 2002, the Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan dismissed two<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of five criminal cases for malversation of public funds against petitioners. On motion for reconsideration, the Sandiganbayan dismissed one<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> more case in a Resolution promulgated on January 6, 2003. The two remaining cases are the subject matters in the instant consolidated petitions.<br><br>The Informations of the remaining two cases filed on May 28, 1991 state:<br><blockquote><u>Crim. Case No. 16794</u><br><br>That on or about the periods between November 2, 1988 to February 27, 1989, or sometime subsequent thereto, in the Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Mariano Un Ocampo III, then the Governor of the province of Tarlac and at the same time President-Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Lingkod Tarlac Foundation, Inc.

The audit covered the period from July 1, 1988 to December 31, 1989 and was confined to the examination of the loans granted by the Provincial Government of Tarlac for the implementation of its Rural Industrialization Can Happen Program. The result of the audit was embodied in Special Audit Report No. 90-91, offered as Exhibit “B” by the prosecution.<br><br>According to the Sandiganbayan, the money trail with respect to the two cases, as proven by the prosecution, is as follows:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(1)</td> <td width="70%"><div align="justify">Accused Ocampo released P11.5 Million to LTFI, <b>P7,023,836.00</b> of which was intended for the purchase of 400 embroidery machines;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td><div align="justify">The total amount released was deposited by LTFI to the Rural Bank of Tarlac, Inc.;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td><div align="justify">Within two (2) months from the deposit, a total of <b>P5,465,000.00</b> was withdrawn and given to William Uy (LTFI’s broker for the importation of the machines);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(4)</td> <td><div align="justify">This amount (P5,465,000) was thereafter deposited to the personal account of “Willam Uy and/or Andres Flores” under S/A No. 26127;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(5)</td> <td><div align="justify">Another account (PNB S/A No. 490-555744-6) was opened by “LTFI by Andres Flores,” this time with PNB, intended solely for the purchase of the machines;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(6)</td> <td><div align="justify">A check in the amount of <b>P3,395,000.00</b> dated February 27, 1989, was remitted for the payment of the machines;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(7)</td> <td><div align="justify">This amount, together with the <b>P5,465,000.00</b> placed on the personal account of William Uy and/or Andres Flores, made up the cost of he machines or a total of <b>P8,860,000.00</b> as recorded in the books of LTFI;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(8)</td> <td><div align="justify">To the PNB account was added a total of <b>P4,332,261.00</b> deposited on different dates from March 6 to April 17, 1989 which funds came from S/A No. 26127;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(9)</td> <td><div align="justify">Thus, the total amount on deposit with PNB was <b>P7,727,261.00</b> plus interest;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(10)</td> <td><div align="justify">Of this amount, <b>P7,679,530.52</b> was used for the opening of the LC (for the payment of the machines) leaving a balance of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>P47,730,48.00</b> plus interest;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(11)</td> <td><div align="justify">Between the amount listed in the books of the corporation <b>(P8,860,000)</b> and the amount of the LC <b>(P7,679,530)</b>, a discrepancy of <b>P1,180,496.48</b> existed.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(12)</td> <td><div align="justify">Between the total amount deposited in PNB S/A No. 490-555744-6 <b>(P7,727,261.00)</b> and the total amount withdrawn from the account for the payment of the machines <b>(P7,679,530.52)</b>, a balance of <b>P47,730.48</b> remained.

The Sandiganbayan held:<br><blockquote>For such gross and inexcusable negligence, accused is liable for malversation. In so ruling, we are guided by the oft-repeated principle that malversation may be committed through a positive act of misappropriation of public funds or passively though negligence by allowing another to commit such misappropriation (<i>Cabello vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, 197 SCRA 94 [1991]). Although accused was charged with willful malversation, he can validly be convicted of malversation through negligence where the evidence sustains the latter mode of committing the offense (<i>Cabello, supra</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, the Sandiganbayan stated that under Sec. 203(f) of the Local Government Code of 1983,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the provincial governor, as chief executive of the provincial government, has the power to “represent the province in all its business transactions and sign on its behalf all bonds, contracts and obligations and other official documents made in accordance with law or ordinance.”<br><br>Sec. 2 (c) of Rule XI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1983 provides that the local chief executive of a local government unit shall “[r]epresent the respective local units in all their business transactions and sign on its behalf all bonds, contracts and obligations and other official documents made in accordance with law or ordinance.” Sec. 2 of Rule VI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> states that “[t]he power to sue, to acquire and convey real or personal property, and to enter into contracts shall be exercised by the local chief executive upon authority of the <i>Sanggunian</i> concerned.” Thus, the Sandiganbayan declared that since the required authority from the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> was not shown to have been obtained by petitioner Ocampo, the MOA is ineffective as far as the Province of Tarlac is concerned.<br><br>Petitioner Flores, as executive director of LTFI, was charged with malversation of public funds in connivance with a public officer. However, the Sandiganbayan found that there was no conspiracy between the petitioners, and held petitioner Flores guilty of malversation through his independent acts under Art. 222 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> since the purpose of Art. 222 is to extend the provisions of the Penal Code on malversation to private individuals. According to the Sandiganbayan, petitioner Flores bound himself, as a signatory of the MOA representing LTFI, to receive NALGU funds from the province of Tarlac. In such capacity, he had charge of these funds.<br><br>In Crim. Case No. 16794, petitioner Flores was found to have charge of missing NALGU funds deposited in his personal account in the amount of P1,132,739, which formed part of the discrepancy of the actual cost of the embroidery machines and the NALGU funds released for payment of the said machines.<br><br>In defense, petitioner Flores claimed that the broker for the importation of the machines made an initial payment to the supplier of the machines, which initial payment would explain the discrepancy between the reported cost as stated in the books of the corporation and the letter of credit. However, the Sandiganbayan stated that the explanation was hearsay as the broker was not presented in court, and there was no proof of the initial payment.<br><br>In Crim. Case No. 16795, the Sandiganbayan held that petitioner Flores’ failure to explain the purpose of the withdrawal on April 28, 1989 of P58,000 upon his authorization, considering that he was in charge of the PNB savings account, made him liable for malversation of public funds.<br><br>Petitioners presented five documents to show that LTFI’s obligations to the Province of Tarlac, in the amount of P56.6 million, have been extinguished. The documents are as follows:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">1)</td> <td width="70%"> <div align="justify">The Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement (TMOA) dated May 23, 1990 executed by the Province of Tarlac, LTFI and the Barangay Unity for Industrial and Leadership Development (BUILD) Foundation whereby the liability of LTFI in favor of the Province of Tarlac was transferred and assumed by BUILD in the total amount of P40 million.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2)</td> <td><div align="justify">Resolution No. 76 of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan </i>of Tarlac dated April 5, 1990 showing that the authority of petitioner Ocampo in entering into the TMOA was with prior approval of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>3)</td> <td><div align="justify">A Deed of Assignment between Tarlac and LTFI whereby the latter assigned its loan portfolios (including interests and certificates of time deposit), the Juki embroidery machines and other assignable documents to the Province of Tarlac in the total amount of P16,618,403.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>4)</td> <td><div align="justify">Resolution No. 199 of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Tarlac dated October 18, 1990 authorizing petitioner Ocampo to enter into the Deed of Assignment with LTFI</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>5)</td> <td><div align="justify">A certified photocopy of a document dated June 16, 1992 issued by the OIC provincial treasurer of Tarlac whereby the treasurer affirmed the existence of the above documents.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The Sandiganbayan declared that the documents showing the extinguishment of LTFI’s obligations to the Province of Tarlace do not mitigate the liability of petitioners since the crime is consummated as of asportation, akin to the taking of another’s property in theft. It held that the return of the amount malversed is neither an exempting circumstance nor a ground for extinguishing the criminal liability of petitioners.<br><br>On March 8, 2002, the Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan rendered a Decision acquitting petitioners of the crime of malversation of public funds in Crim. Case Nos. 16796 and 16802, but finding them guilty of the crime in Crim. Case Nos. 16787, 16794 and 16795.

Case No. 16787, and acquitted petitioners of the crime charged. In that case, the prosecution alleged that P5 million of the NALGU funds loaned to LTFI were placed in time deposits with the Rural Bank of Tarlac and earned a total interest of P116,932.77, of which amount only P50,000.00 was recorded in the books of LTFI. The unrecorded interest of P66,932.77 was said to have been withdrawn from December 27, 1988 to February 2, 1989 and allegedly malversed by petitioners. The Sandiganbayan held that as this Court has already labeled the subject agreement as one of loan, the said “interest are private funds, hence, not the proper subject for malversation of public funds.” Thus, petitioners were acquitted in Crim. Case No. 16787.<br><br>Petitioners thereafter filed their respective petitions, which were consolidated by the Court in a Resolution dated February 20, 2006.<br><br>The pertinent issues raised by petitioners may be summarized as follows:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">1)</td> <td width="70%"><div align="justify">Whether or not petitioners Ocampo and Flores are guilty of the crime of malversation of public funds under Art. 217 and Art. 220 respectively of the Revised Penal Code; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2)</td> <td><div align="justify">Whether or not the Sandiganbayan erred in holding that the MOA is void and did not bind the Province of Tarlac on the ground that the MOA was entered into by petitioner Ocampo without authority from the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> in violation of the Local Government Code of 1983.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><i><br>First Issue: Whether or not petitioners Ocampo and Flores are guilty of the crime of malversation of public funds under Art. 217 and Art. 220 respectively of the Revised Penal Code?</i><br><br>Crucial to the resolution of the first issue is the nature of the transaction entered into by the Province of Tarlac and LTFI.<br><br>Petitioners claim that in the instant cases, the public funds alleged to have been malversed were <b>loaned</b> by the Province of Tarlac to LTFI per the MOA; hence, LTFI acquired ownership of the funds which thus shed their public character and became private funds.<br><br>Petitioner Ocampo also asserts that the Sandiganbayan impliedly ruled that the funds were private in character and owned by LTFI when it ruled in Crim. Case No. 16787 that since this Court has already labeled the subject agreement as one of loan, the interests from the loan are private funds; hence, not the proper subject for malversation of public funds. Having declared the interests earned by the funds loaned to LTFI as private funds, the Sandiganbayan should have also declared the funds loaned as private.<br><br>Petitioners’ arguments are

Case No. 16794, the fund alleged to have been malversed in the amount of P1,180,496.48 represents the discrepancy of the cost of the Juki embroidery machines as listed in the books of LTFI and the amount actually paid to open the letter of credit for the payment of the machines. In the books of LTFI, the cost of the Juki embroidery machines was listed as P8,860,000, while the amount paid to open the letter of credit for the payment of the machines was P7,679,530.52.

The amount of P58,000 was withdrawn upon the authorization of petitioner Flores. The withdrawal was neither reflected as deposit in the bank accounts of LTFI nor spent by it.<br><br>In both cases, the money trail proven by the prosecution shows that the subject funds or the money used for the purchase of the Juki embroidery machines came from the release of the Province of Tarlac through petitioner Ocampo of NALGU funds in the amount of P11.5 million to LTFI on October 24, 1988. The release of the funds was covered by a loan document in accordance with the MOA which states that the Province of Tarlac “shall release in lump sum the appropriate funds for the approved projects covered by <b>individual loan documents</b> upon signing of the <b>respective loan agreement....”</b><br><br>The Report on the Special Audit of LTFI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> stated:<br><blockquote>. . .

Of the amount released, P7,023,836 was intended for the purchase of 400 sets embroidery machines for the Embroidery Skills Training Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the funds released by the Province of Tarlac, including the money allegedly malversed by petitioners in Crim. Case Nos. 16794 and 16795, were in the nature of a loan to LTFI.<br><br>Art. 1953 of the Civil Code provides that “[a] person who receives a loan of money or any other fungible thing acquires the ownership thereof, and is bound to pay to the creditor an equal amount of the same kind and quality.”<br><br>Hence, petitioner Ocampo correctly argued that the NALGU funds shed their public character when they were lent to LTFI as it acquired ownership of the funds with an obligation to repay the Province of Tarlac the amount borrowed. The relationship between the Province of Tarlac and the LTFI is that of a creditor and debtor. Failure to pay the indebtedness would give rise to a collection suit.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan convicted petitioner Ocampo of malversation of public funds under Art. 217 of the Revised Penal Code for his “gross and inexcusable negligence” in not setting up safeguards in accordance with Sec. 203(t) of the Local Government Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> for the proper handling of the NALGU funds in the hands of LTFI which resulted in the disappearance of P1,132,739 allegedly malversed in Crim. Case No. 16794 and the disappearance of P58,000 in Crim. Case No. 16795.<br><br>In his petition, petitioner Ocampo states that he made sure that proper safeguards were in place within LTFI to ensure the proper handling of NALGU funds by LTFI. On August 5, 1988, before the Province of Tarlac and LTFI entered into the MOA, LTFI’s Articles of Incorporation were amended to add the following:<br><blockquote>TENTH: That no part of the net income of the Foundation shall inure to the benefit of any member of the Foundation and that at least seventy percent (70%) of the funds shall be used for the projects and not more than thirty percent (30%) of said funds shall be used for administrative purposes.<br></blockquote>Petitioner Ocampo argues that since he had resigned from LTFI both as chairperson and as trustee on June 22, 1988, he ceased to become accountable for the handling of the NALGU funds after the same were loaned to LTFI pursuant to the MOA dated August 8, 1988. Consequently, he may not be held criminally liable for disbursements made by LTFI since he had nothing to do with its operations after his resignation.<br><br>Malversation may be committed by appropriating public funds or property; by taking or misappropriating the same; by consenting, or through abandonment or negligence, by permitting any other person to take such public funds or property; or by being otherwise guilty of the misappropriation or malversation of such funds or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The essential elements common to all acts of malversation under Art. 217 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> are:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="70%"><div align="justify">That the offender be a public officer;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td>That he had the custody or control of funds or property by <i>;reason of the duties of his office</i>;;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td>That those funds or property were <i>;public</i>; funds or property for which he was accountable;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(d)</td> <td>That he appropriated, took, misappropriated or consented or, through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>There can be no malversation of public funds by petitioner Ocampo in the instant cases since the loan of P11.5 million transferred ownership and custody of the funds, which included the sum of money allegedly malversed, to LTFI for which Ocampo could no longer be held accountable. Thus, contrary to the allegation of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, petitioner Ocampo cannot be held culpable for malversation committed through negligence in adopting measures to safeguard the money of the Province of Tarlac, since the same were neither in his custody nor was he accountable therefor after the loan to LTFI.<br><br>Thus, petitioner Flores, as the executive director of LTFI, cannot also be held liable for malversation of public funds in a contract of loan which transferred ownership of the funds to LTFI making them private in character. <i>Liwanag v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> held:<br><blockquote>. . . in a contract of loan once the money is received by the debtor, ownership over the same is transferred. Being the owner, the borrower can dispose of it for whatever purpose he may deem proper.<br></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan erred when it stated that the intention of the parties was for the funds to remain public, citing the MOA which allegedly provided, thus:<br><blockquote>The Province shall have the right to have access to all resources and records of either LTF[I] or BUILD and may conduct COA examination or audit on any or all matter affecting the loans or assets covered by this agreement and funds from the Province of Tarlac.<br></blockquote>A review of the MOA did not show the presence of such provision. But the cited provision is contained in the TMOA, which was later entered into by the Province of Tarlac, LTFI and BUILD, whereby LTFI transferred part of its obligation to BUILD.<br><br>What is controlling in the instant cases is that <b>the parties entered into a contract of loan for each release of NALGU funds.</b> The second release on October 24, 1988 included the subject funds in controversy. By virtue of the contract of loan, ownership of the subject funds was transferred to LTFI making them private in character, and therefore not subject of the instant cases of malversation of public funds.<br><br>The Court notes that the obligation of LTFI to repay the NALGU Funds of P56,618,403 obtained by it from the Province of Tarlac pursuant to the MOA was extinguished as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td><td valign="top" width="70%"><div align="justify">BUILD assumed LTFI's principal loan of P40 million;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top">(2)</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">LTFI ceded, transferred and assigned to the Province of Tarlac all the rights and interests of LTFI in certain loans including interests, certificate of time deposit and certain Juki embroidery machines in the total amount of P16,618,403.<br><br></div></td> </tr></tbody></table><span style="font-style: italic;">Second Issue: Whether or not the Sandiganbayan erred in holding that the MOA is void and did not bind the Province of Tarlac on the ground that the MOA was entered into by petitioner Ocampo without authority from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in violation of the Local Government Code of 1983?</span><br><br>In its Resolution dated January 6, 2003, the Sandiganbayan concedes that the transaction between the Province of Tarlac through petitioner Ocampo and the LTFI was one of loan.
