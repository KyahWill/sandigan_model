				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The instant petition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court seeks the annulment of the December 2, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and March 17, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Mining Adjudication Board (DENR-MAB) in MAB Case No. 0124-01 (Mines Administrative Case No. R-M-2000-01) entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Benguet Corporation</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Benguet</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">v. J.G. Realty and Mining Corporation</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">J.G. Realty</span>). The December 2, 2002 Decision upheld the March 19, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the MAB Panel of Arbitrators (POA) which canceled the Royalty Agreement with Option to Purchase (RAWOP) dated June 1, 1987<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> between Benguet and J.G. Realty, and excluded Benguet from the joint Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) application over four mining claims. The March 17, 2004 Resolution denied Benguet’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The Facts<br></div><br>On June 1, 1987, Benguet and J.G. Realty entered into a RAWOP, wherein J.G. Realty was acknowledged as the owner of four mining claims respectively named as Bonito-I, Bonito-II, Bonito-III, and Bonito-IV, with a total area of 288.8656 hectares, situated in Barangay Luklukam, Sitio Bagong Bayan, Municipality of Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte. The parties also executed a Supplemental Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated June 1, 1987. The mining claims were covered by MPSA Application No. APSA-V-0009 jointly filed by J.G. Realty as claimowner and Benguet as operator.<br><br>In the RAWOP, Benguet obligated itself to perfect the rights to the mining claims and/or otherwise acquire the mining rights to the mineral claims. Within 24 months from the execution of the RAWOP, Benguet should also cause the examination of the mining claims for the purpose of determining whether or not they are worth developing with reasonable probability of profitable production. Benguet undertook also to furnish J.G. Realty with a report on the examination, within a reasonable time after the completion of the examination. Moreover, also within the examination period, Benguet shall conduct all necessary exploration in accordance with a prepared exploration program. If it chooses to do so and before the expiration of the examination period, Benguet may undertake to develop the mining claims upon written notice to J.G. Realty. Benguet must then place the mining claims into commercial productive stage within 24 months from the written notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It is also provided in the RAWOP that if the mining claims were placed in commercial production by Benguet, J.G. Realty should be entitled to a royalty of five percent (5%) of net realizable value, and to royalty for any production done by Benguet whether during the examination or development periods.<br><br>Thus, on August 9, 1989, the Executive Vice-President of Benguet, Antonio N. Tachuling, issued a letter informing J.G. Realty of its intention to develop the mining claims. However, on February 9, 1999, J.G. Realty, through its President, Johnny L. Tan, then sent a letter to the President of Benguet informing the latter that it was terminating the RAWOP on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>a. The fact that your company has failed to perform the obligations set forth in the RAWOP, i.e., to undertake development works within 2 years from the execution of the Agreement;<br><br>b. Violation of the Contract by allowing high graders to operate on our claim.<br><br>c. No stipulation was provided with respect to the term limit of the RAWOP.<br><br>d. Non-payment of the royalties thereon as provided in the RAWOP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>In response, Benguet’s Manager for Legal Services, Reynaldo P. Mendoza, wrote J.G. Realty a letter dated March 8, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> therein alleging that Benguet complied with its obligations under the RAWOP by investing PhP 42.4 million to rehabilitate the mines, and that the commercial operation was hampered by the non-issuance of a Mines Temporary Permit by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) which must be considered as <span style="font-style: italic;">force majeure</span>, entitling Benguet to an extension of time to prosecute such permit. Benguet further claimed that the high graders mentioned by J.G. Realty were already operating prior to Benguet’s taking over of the premises, and that J.G. Realty had the obligation of ejecting such small scale miners. Benguet also alleged that the nature of the mining business made it difficult to specify a time limit for the RAWOP. Benguet then argued that the royalties due to J.G. Realty were in fact in its office and ready to be picked up at any time. It appeared that, previously, the practice by J.G. Realty was to pick-up checks from Benguet representing such royalties. However, starting August 1994, J.G. Realty allegedly refused to collect such checks from Benguet. Thus, Benguet posited that there was no valid ground for the termination of the RAWOP. It also reminded J.G. Realty that it should submit the disagreement to arbitration rather than unilaterally terminating the RAWOP.<br><br>On June 7, 2000, J.G. Realty filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity/Cancellation of the RAWOP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the Legaspi City POA, Region V, docketed as DENR Case No. 2000-01 and entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">J.G. Realty v. Benguet</span>.<br><br>On March 19, 2001, the POA issued a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dwelling upon the issues of (1) whether the arbitrators had jurisdiction over the case; and (2) whether Benguet violated the RAWOP justifying the unilateral cancellation of the RAWOP by J.G. Realty. The dispositive portion stated:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the June 01, 1987 [RAWOP] and its Supplemental Agreement is hereby declared cancelled and without effect. BENGUET is hereby excluded from the joint MPSA Application over the mineral claims denominated as “BONITO-I”, “BONITO-II”, “BONITO-III” and “BONITO-IV”.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Therefrom, Benguet filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> with the MAB on April 23, 2001, docketed as Mines Administrative Case No. R-M-2000-01. Thereafter, the MAB issued the assailed December 2, 2002 Decision. Benguet then filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the assailed Decision which was denied in the March 17, 2004 Resolution of the MAB. Hence, Benguet filed the instant petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span></div><blockquote>1. There was serious and palpable error when the Honorable Board failed to rule that the contractual obligation of the parties to arbitrate under the Royalty Agreement is mandatory.<br><br>2. The Honorable Board exceeded its jurisdiction when it sustained the cancellation of the Royalty Agreement for alleged breach of contract despite the absence of evidence.<br><br>3. The Questioned Decision of the Honorable Board in cancelling the RAWOP prejudice[d] the substantial rights of Benguet under the contract to the unjust enrichment of JG Realty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Restated, the issues are: (1) Should the controversy have first been submitted to arbitration before the POA took cognizance of the case?; (2) Was the cancellation of the RAWOP supported by evidence?; and (3) Did the cancellation of the RAWOP amount to unjust enrichment of J.G. Realty at the expense of Benguet?<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The Court’s Ruling<br></div><br>Before we dwell on the substantive issues, we find that the instant petition can be denied outright as Benguet resorted to an improper remedy.<br><br>The last paragraph of Section 79 of Republic Act No. (RA) 7942 or the “Philippine Mining Act of 1995” states, “A petition for review by certiorari and question of law may be filed by the aggrieved party with the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days from receipt of the order or decision of the [MAB].”<br><br>However, this Court has already invalidated such provision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio v. Sulu Resources Development Corp.</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> ruling that a decision of the MAB must first be appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, before recourse to this Court may be had. We held, thus:<br><blockquote>To summarize, there are sufficient legal footings authorizing a review of the MAB Decision under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, Section 30 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, mandates that “[n]o law shall be passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advice and consent.” On the other hand, Section 79 of RA No. 7942 provides that decisions of the MAB may be reviewed by this Court on a “petition for review by certiorari.” This provision is obviously an expansion of the Court’s appellate jurisdiction, an expansion to which this Court has not consented. Indiscriminate enactment of legislation enlarging the appellate jurisdiction of this Court would unnecessarily burden it.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, when the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, transfers to the CA pending cases involving a review of a quasi-judicial body’s decisions, such transfer relates only to procedure; hence, it does not impair the substantive and vested rights of the parties. The aggrieved party’s right to appeal is preserved; what is changed is only the procedure by which the appeal is to be made or decided. The parties still have a remedy and a competent tribunal to grant this remedy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>, the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure included Rule 43 to provide a uniform rule on appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. Under the rule, appeals from their judgments and final orders are now required to be brought to the CA on a verified petition for review. A quasi-judicial agency or body has been defined as an organ of government, other than a court or legislature, which affects the rights of private parties through either adjudication or rule-making. MAB falls under this definition; hence, it is no different from the other quasi-judicial bodies enumerated under Rule 43. Besides, the introductory words in Section 1 of Circular No. 1-91––“among these agencies are”––indicate that the enumeration is not exclusive or conclusive and acknowledge the existence of other quasi-judicial agencies which, though not expressly listed, should be deemed included therein.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth</span>, the Court realizes that under Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 129 as amended by RA No. 7902, factual controversies are usually involved in decisions of quasi-judicial bodies; and the CA, which is likewise tasked to resolve questions of fact, has more elbow room to resolve them. By including questions of fact among the issues that may be raised in an appeal from quasi-judicial agencies to the CA, Section 3 of Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 and Section 3 of Rule 43 explicitly expanded the list of such issues.<br><br>According to Section 3 of Rule 43, “[a]n appeal under this Rule may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.” Hence, appeals from quasi-judicial agencies even only on questions of law may be brought to the CA.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fifth</span>, the judicial policy of observing the hierarchy of courts dictates that direct resort from administrative agencies to this Court will not be entertained, unless the redress desired cannot be obtained from the appropriate lower tribunals, or unless exceptional and compelling circumstances justify availment of a remedy falling within and calling for the exercise of our primary jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>The above principle was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Asaphil Construction and Development Corporation v. Tuason, Jr. </span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Asaphil</span>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio</span> ruling was not applied to Asaphil as the petition in the latter case was filed in 1999 or three years before the promulgation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio</span> in 2002. Here, the petition was filed on April 28, 2004 when the <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio</span> decision was already applicable, thus Benguet should have filed the appeal with the CA.<br><br>Petitioner having failed to properly appeal to the CA under Rule 43, the decision of the MAB has become final and executory. On this ground alone, the instant petition must be denied.<br><br>Even if we entertain the petition although Benguet skirted the appeal to the CA via Rule 43, still, the December 2, 2002 Decision and March 17, 2004 Resolution of the DENR-MAB in MAB Case No. 0124-01 should be maintained.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">First Issue: The case should have first been brought to <br>voluntary arbitration before the POA<br></div><br>Secs. 11.01 and 11.02 of the RAWOP pertinently provide:<br><blockquote>11.01 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arbitration</span><br><br>Any disputes, differences or disagreements between BENGUET and the OWNER with reference to anything whatsoever pertaining to this Agreement that cannot be amicably settled by them shall not be cause of any action of any kind whatsoever in any court or administrative agency but shall, upon notice of one party to the other, be referred to a Board of Arbitrators consisting of three (3) members, one to be selected by BENGUET, another to be selected by the OWNER and the third to be selected by the aforementioned two arbitrators so appointed.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>11.02 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Court Action</span><br><br>No action shall be instituted in court as to any matter in dispute as hereinabove stated, except to enforce the decision of the majority of the Arbitrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Thus, Benguet argues that the POA should have first referred the case to voluntary arbitration before taking cognizance of the case, citing Sec. 2 of RA 876 on persons and matters subject to arbitration.<br><br>On the other hand, in denying such argument, the POA ruled that:<br><blockquote>While the parties may establish such stipulations clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient, the same must not be contrary to law and public policy. At a glance, there is nothing wrong with the terms and conditions of the agreement. But to state that an aggrieved party cannot initiate an action without going to arbitration would be tying one’s hand even if there is a law which allows him to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The MAB, meanwhile, denied Benguet’s contention on the ground of estoppel, stating:<br><blockquote>Besides, by its own act, Benguet is already estopped in questioning the jurisdiction of the Panel of Arbitrators to hear and decide the case. As pointed out in the appealed Decision, Benguet initiated and filed an Adverse Claim docketed as MAC-R-M-2000-02 over the same mining claims without undergoing contractual arbitration. In this particular case (MAC-R-M-2000-02) now subject of the appeal, Benguet is likewise in estoppel from questioning the competence of the Panel of Arbitrators to hear and decide in the summary proceedings J.G. Realty’s petition, when Benguet itself did not merely move for the dismissal of the case but also filed an Answer with counterclaim seeking affirmative reliefs from the Panel of Arbitrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, the MAB ruled that the contractual provision on arbitration merely provides for an additional forum or venue and does not divest the POA of the jurisdiction to hear the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In its July 20, 2004 Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> J.G. Realty reiterated the above rulings of the POA and MAB. It argued that RA 7942 or the “Philippine Mining Act of 1995” is a special law which should prevail over the stipulations of the parties and over a general law, such as RA 876. It also argued that the POA cannot be considered as a “court” under the contemplation of RA 876 and that jurisprudence saying that there must be prior resort to arbitration before filing a case with the courts is inapplicable to the instant case as the POA is itself already engaged in arbitration.<br><br>On this issue, we rule for Benguet.<br><br>Sec. 2 of RA 876 elucidates the scope of arbitration:<br><blockquote>Section 2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Persons and matters subject to arbitration</span>.––<span style="font-weight: bold;">Two or more persons or parties may submit to the arbitration of one or more arbitrators any controversy existing between them at the time of the submission and which may be the subject of an action, or the parties to any contract may in such contract agree to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising between them. Such submission or contract shall be valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law for the revocation of any contract.</span><br><br>Such submission or contract may include question[s] arising out of valuations, appraisals or other controversies which may be collateral, incidental, precedent or subsequent to any issue between the parties. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>In RA 9285 or the “Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004,” the Congress reiterated the efficacy of arbitration as an alternative mode of dispute resolution by stating in Sec. 32 thereof that domestic arbitration shall still be governed by RA 876. Clearly, a contractual stipulation that requires prior resort to voluntary arbitration before the parties can go directly to court is not illegal and is in fact promoted by the State. Thus, petitioner correctly cites several cases whereby arbitration clauses have been upheld by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the contention that RA 7942 prevails over RA 876 presupposes a conflict between the two laws. Such is not the case here. To reiterate, availment of voluntary arbitration before resort is made to the courts or quasi-judicial agencies of the government is a valid contractual stipulation that must be adhered to by the parties. As stated in Secs. 6 and 7 of RA 876:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hearing by court</span>.­­––<span style="font-weight: bold;">A party aggrieved by the failure, neglect or refusal of another to perform under an agreement in writing providing for arbitration may petition the court for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.</span> Five days notice in writing of the hearing of such application shall be served either personally or by registered mail upon the party in default. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement or such failure to comply therewith is not in issue, shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If the making of the agreement or default be in issue the court shall proceed to summarily hear such issue. If the finding be that no agreement in writing providing for arbitration was made, or that there is no default in the proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed. If the finding be that a written provision for arbitration was made and there is a default in proceeding thereunder, an order shall be made summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.</span><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Stay of civil action</span>.––If any suit or proceeding be brought upon an issue arising out of an agreement providing for the arbitration thereof, the court in which such suit or proceeding is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration, shall stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement: Provided, That the applicant, for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>In other words, in the event a case that should properly be the subject of voluntary arbitration is erroneously filed with the courts or quasi-judicial agencies, on motion of the defendant, the court or quasi-judicial agency shall determine whether such contractual provision for arbitration is sufficient and effective. If in affirmative, the court or quasi-judicial agency shall then order the enforcement of said provision. Besides, in <span style="font-style: italic;">BF Corporation v. Court of Appeals</span>, we already ruled:<br><blockquote>In this connection, it bears stressing that the lower court has not lost its jurisdiction over the case. Section 7 of Republic Act No. 876 provides that proceedings therein have only been stayed. After the special proceeding of arbitration has been pursued and completed, then the lower court may confirm the award made by the arbitrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>J.G. Realty’s contention, that prior resort to arbitration is unavailing in the instant case because the POA’s mandate is to arbitrate disputes involving mineral agreements, is misplaced. A distinction must be made between voluntary and compulsory arbitration. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ludo and Luym Corporation v. Saordino</span>, the Court had the occasion to distinguish between the two types of arbitrations:<br><blockquote>Comparatively, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Reformist Union of R.B. Liner, Inc. vs. NLRC</span>, compulsory arbitration has been defined both as “the process of settlement of labor disputes by a <span style="font-weight: bold;">government agency which has the authority to investigate and to make an award</span> which is binding on all the parties, and as a mode of arbitration where the parties are compelled to accept the resolution of their dispute through arbitration by a third party.” While a voluntary arbitrator is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not part of the governmental unit or labor department’s personnel</span>, said arbitrator renders arbitration services provided for under labor laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>There is a clear distinction between compulsory and voluntary arbitration. The arbitration provided by the POA is compulsory, while the nature of the arbitration provision in the RAWOP is voluntary, not involving any government agency. Thus, J.G. Realty’s argument on this matter must fail.<br><br>As to J.G. Realty’s contention that the provisions of RA 876 cannot apply to the instant case which involves an administrative agency, it must be pointed out that Section 11.01 of the RAWOP states that:<br><blockquote>[Any controversy with regard to the contract] shall not be cause of any action of any kind whatsoever in any court or <span style="font-weight: bold;">administrative agency</span> but shall, upon notice of one party to the other, be referred to a Board of Arbitrators consisting of three (3) members, one to be selected by BENGUET, another to be selected by the OWNER and the third to be selected by the aforementioned two arbiters so appointed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>There can be no quibbling that POA is a quasi-judicial body which forms part of the DENR, an administrative agency. Hence, the provision on mandatory resort to arbitration, freely entered into by the parties, must be held binding against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In sum, on the issue of whether POA should have referred the case to voluntary arbitration, we find that, indeed, POA has no jurisdiction over the dispute which is governed by RA 876, the arbitration law.<br><br>However, we find that Benguet is already estopped from questioning the POA’s jurisdiction. As it were, when J.G. Realty filed DENR Case No. 2000-01, Benguet filed its answer and participated in the proceedings before the POA, Region V. Secondly, when the adverse March 19, 2001 POA Decision was rendered, it filed an appeal with the MAB in Mines Administrative Case No. R-M-2000-01 and again participated in the MAB proceedings. When the adverse December 2, 2002 MAB Decision was promulgated, it filed a motion for reconsideration with the MAB. When the adverse March 17, 2004 MAB Resolution was issued, Benguet filed a petition with this Court pursuant to Sec. 79 of RA 7942 impliedly recognizing MAB’s jurisdiction. In this factual milieu, the Court rules that the jurisdiction of POA and that of MAB can no longer be questioned by Benguet at this late hour. What Benguet should have done was to immediately challenge the POA’s jurisdiction by a special civil action for certiorari when POA ruled that it has jurisdiction over the dispute. To redo the proceedings fully participated in by the parties after the lapse of seven years from date of institution of the original action with the POA would be anathema to the speedy and efficient administration of justice.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Second Issue: The cancellation of the RAWOP <br>was supported by evidence<br></div><br>The cancellation of the RAWOP by the POA was based on two grounds: (1) Benguet’s failure to pay J.G. Realty’s royalties for the mining claims; and (2) Benguet’s failure to seriously pursue MPSA Application No. APSA-V-0009 over the mining claims.<br><br>As to the royalties, Benguet claims that the checks representing payments for the royalties of J.G. Realty were available for pick-up in its office and it is the latter which refused to claim them. Benguet then thus concludes that it did not violate the RAWOP for nonpayment of royalties. Further, Benguet reasons that J.G. Realty has the burden of proving that the former did not pay such royalties following the principle that the complainants must prove their affirmative allegations.<br><br>With regard to the failure to pursue the MPSA application, Benguet claims that the lengthy time of approval of the application is due to the failure of the MGB to approve it. In other words, Benguet argues that the approval of the application is solely in the hands of the MGB.<br><br>Benguet’s arguments are bereft of merit.<br><br>Sec. 14.05 of the RAWOP provides:<br><blockquote>14.05 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bank Account</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>OWNER shall maintain a bank account at ___________ or any other bank from time to time selected by OWNER with notice in writing to BENGUET where BENGUET shall deposit to the OWNER’s credit any and all advances and payments which may become due the OWNER under this Agreement as well as the purchase price herein agreed upon in the event that BENGUET shall exercise the option to purchase provided for in the Agreement. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any and all deposits so made by BENGUET shall be a full and complete acquittance and release to</span> [sic] <span style="font-weight: bold;">BENGUET from any further liability to the OWNER of the amounts represented by such deposits.</span> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Evidently, the RAWOP itself provides for the mode of royalty payment by Benguet. The fact that there was the previous practice whereby J.G. Realty picked-up the checks from Benguet is unavailing. The mode of payment is embodied in a contract between the parties. As such, the contract must be considered as the law between the parties and binding on both.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Thus, after J.G. Realty informed Benguet of the bank account where deposits of its royalties may be made, Benguet had the obligation to deposit the checks. J.G. Realty had no obligation to furnish Benguet with a Board Resolution considering that the RAWOP itself provided for such payment scheme.<br><br>Notably, Benguet’s claim that J.G. Realty must prove nonpayment of its royalties is both illogical and unsupported by law and jurisprudence.<br><br>The allegation of nonpayment is not a positive allegation as claimed by Benguet. Rather, such is a negative allegation that does not require proof and in fact transfers the burden of proof to Benguet. Thus, this Court ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Jimenez v. National Labor Relations Commission</span>:<br><blockquote>As a general rule, one who pleads payment has the burden of proving it. Even where the plaintiff must allege non-payment, the general rule is that the burden rests on the defendant to prove payment, rather than on the plaintiff to prove non-payment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The debtor has the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>In the instant case, the obligation of Benguet to pay royalties to J.G. Realty has been admitted and supported by the provisions of the RAWOP. Thus, the burden to prove such obligation rests on Benguet.<br><br>It should also be borne in mind that MPSA Application No. APSA-V-0009 has been pending with the MGB for a considerable length of time. Benguet, in the RAWOP, obligated itself to perfect the rights to the mining claims and/or otherwise acquire the mining rights to the mineral claims but failed to present any evidence showing that it exerted efforts to speed up and have the application approved. In fact, Benguet never even alleged that it continuously followed-up the application with the MGB and that it was in constant communication with the government agency for the expeditious resolution of the application. Such allegations would show that, indeed, Benguet was remiss in prosecuting the MPSA application and clearly failed to comply with its obligation in the RAWOP.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Issue: There is no unjust enrichment in the instant case</span><br></div><br>Based on the foregoing discussion, the cancellation of the RAWOP was based on valid grounds and is, therefore, justified. The necessary implication of the cancellation is the cessation of Benguet’s right to prosecute MPSA Application No. APSA-V-0009 and to further develop such mining claims.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Car Cool Philippines, Inc. v. Ushio Realty and Development Corporation</span>, we defined unjust enrichment, as follows:<br><blockquote>We have held that “[t]here is unjust enrichment when a person <span style="font-weight: bold;">unjustly</span> retains a benefit to the loss of another, or when a person retains money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience.” Article 22 of the Civil Code provides that “[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him.” The principle of unjust enrichment under Article 22 requires two conditions: (1) that a person is benefited without a valid basis or justification, and&nbsp;(2) that such benefit is derived at another’s expense or damage.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no unjust enrichment when the person who will benefit has a valid claim to such benefit.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Clearly, there is no unjust enrichment in the instant case as the cancellation of the RAWOP, which left Benguet without any legal right to participate in further developing the mining claims, was brought about by its violation of the RAWOP. Hence, Benguet has no one to blame but itself for its predicament.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, we <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISS</span> the petition, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRM</span> the December 2, 2002 Decision and March 17, 2004 Resolution of the DENR-MAB in MAB Case No. 0124-01 upholding the cancellation of the June 1, 1987 RAWOP.
