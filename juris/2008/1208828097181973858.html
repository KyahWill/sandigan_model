				<BR><BR>IN this rape case, the Court is confronted with remedial questions on (a) specificity of dates in the Information; (b) quantum of proof; and (c) concurrence of allegation and proof.<br><div align="justify"><br>For Our final review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming with modification appellant's conviction for rape of his two minor daughters.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Facts</b><br></div><br>In line with Our ruling in <i>People v. Cabalquinto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the real names of the rape victims will not be disclosed.&nbsp; We will instead use fictitious initials to represent them throughout the decision.&nbsp; The personal circumstances of the victims or any other information tending to establish or compromise their identities will likewise be withheld.<br><br>Private complainants AAA and BBB are the legitimate daughters of appellant Jerry Nazareno with CCC.&nbsp; AAA was born on April 30, 1983.2-a&nbsp; BBB, the second child of the union, was born on June 24, 1984.2-b&nbsp; At that time, appellant and CCC were yet to wed.&nbsp; It was only in 1987 that the couple formally tied the knot in simple church ceremonies.&nbsp; Three more children sprang from the marriage since then.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 1990, AAA was inside a room in their house located at <i>Barangay</i> Codon, Municipality of San Andres, Province of Catanduanes.&nbsp; All of her siblings were playing in their yard.&nbsp; Unexpectedly, appellant entered the room, and without saying a word, held AAA tightly.&nbsp; He then directed AAA to crouch on the floor and raise her buttocks (<i>baka-bakahan</i>). While in that position, appellant removed the girl's short pants and underwear. He then proceeded to remove his own undergarments.&nbsp; Subsequently, appellant forcibly entered AAA from behind, inserting his penis into the girl's vagina.&nbsp; She was seven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Appellant threatened AAA not to reveal what happened to her to anyone; or else, she and the rest of her family would be killed.&nbsp; Expectedly, AAA suffered in silence.&nbsp; She feared for her life as well as that of her mother and siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>AAA's ordeal with her father became a regular fare.&nbsp; Appellant would rape her whenever they were left alone in the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> CCC was rarely home because she attended to farm work and accepted laundry jobs from neighbors to support the family.&nbsp; Appellant was jobless and stayed at home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On March 25, 1996, appellant again imposed his bestial urges on AAA.&nbsp; AAA distinctly remembered the incident because she graduated from primary school on that day.&nbsp; At around 2:00 p.m., appellant and AAA were left alone in the house.&nbsp; He told AAA to remove her shorts and panty.&nbsp; Appellant then asked her to crouch on the floor and raise her buttocks.&nbsp; Just as he did before, appellant positioned himself behind the girl and then inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; All that time, appellant's hands were clutching the girl's back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Coincidentally, AAA's graduation from elementary school also marked the end of appellant's sexual abuses.<br><br>BBB suffered the same fate as her older sister AAA.&nbsp; Sometime in January 1992, appellant and BBB were left alone in their house.&nbsp; Suddenly, appellant told BBB to kneel on all fours (pig <i>baka-baka</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Appellant then removed BBB's shorts and panties.&nbsp; He then removed his <i>maong </i>pants.&nbsp; Appellant positioned himself at BBB's rear and then inserted his penis into the young girl's vagina.&nbsp; At the time of the rape, BBB was only seven years old and was a Grade II pupil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Appellant continued raping BBB, using the girl for his sexual gratification every other day.&nbsp; From BBB's account, appellant would rape her fifteen times in a month.&nbsp; Every time, appellant would threaten her that he would kill all of them should she tell anyone what was happening between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On October 27, 1998, AAA and BBB found the courage to tell their mother CCC what appellant had been doing to them.&nbsp; AAA accidentally found that BBB was likewise being subjected to sexual abuses by their father.&nbsp; Gathering strength from one another, AAA and BBB tearfully recounted to their mother their individual ordeals.&nbsp; CCC was devastated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On December 6, 1998, appellant again attempted to force himself on BBB.&nbsp; He inserted his finger into BBB's vagina.&nbsp; BBB felt extreme pain from the nails protruding from her father's fingers.&nbsp; That was the last time appellant abused BBB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On February 16, 1999, CCC, with AAA and BBB, secretly went to the Municipal Building of San Andres, Catanduanes to file a complaint against appellant for the rape of AAA and BBB.&nbsp; AAA and BBB were immediately attended to by personnel from the Department of Social Welfare and Development.&nbsp; The two were later examined at the JMA District Hospital by Dr. Erlinda H. Arcilla.<br><br>CCC testified as to the age of the victims AAA and BBB at the time of the commission of the crimes.&nbsp; She affirmed that AAA was born on April 30, 1983 while BBB was born on June 24, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> CCC narrated that she was shocked when she heard her two daughters complain that they were raped by their own father.&nbsp; She knew appellant to be temperamental.&nbsp; He would hit AAA and BBB at the slightest provocation.&nbsp; She failed to act immediately on her daughters' plight for fear of her husband.&nbsp; CCC was convinced that appellant might make good his threats to kill all of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Dr. Arcilla narrated that she examined both AAA and BBB on February 16, 1999.&nbsp; During her examination, she uncovered old healed hymenal lacerations on both AAA and BBB at the 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions.&nbsp; The lacerations suggested that the two girls were no longer in a virgin state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On March 17, 1999, appellant Jerry Nazareno was indicted for violation of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 2638 for the rape of BBB.&nbsp; The information reads:<br><blockquote>That sometime and between January 1992 up to December 06, 1998, in <i>Barangay</i> Codon, Municipality of San Andres, Province of Catanduanes, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force, violence and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and repeatedly made sexual intercourse with his daughter BBB at the age of 7 through 14 years old against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>On May 3, 1999, another Information docketed as Criminal Case No. 2650, for the rape of AAA, was levelled against appellant.&nbsp; The indictment is worded thus:<br><blockquote>That from sometime in January 1990 up to December 1998 in <i>barangay</i> Codon, municipality of San Andres, Catanduanes, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the said accused, being the father of the complainant, did then and there willfully, feloniously and criminally repeatedly had sexual intercourse with her daughter AAA, then five years old up to the time when she was 15-years-old against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The case for the People, which portrayed the foregoing facts, revolved around the combined testimonies of AAA, BBB, CCC, and Dr. Erlinda Arcilla of the JMA District Hospital in San Andres, Catanduanes.<br><br>The defense, anchored on denial, was summed up by the trial court in this wise:<br><blockquote>The defense presented JERRY NAZARENO, the accused himself who testified that he is 34 years old, married, fisherman, a resident of Codon, San Andres, Catanduanes.<br><br>He denied having raped his daughters.&nbsp; He said that he sometimes beat his children because he is strict with them in their studies especially during weekdays.&nbsp; He did not want them to watch television during schooldays. Though he is strict, he could not molest the complainants because they are his daughters.&nbsp; He said that the reason why his daughters filed these cases against him was because his father-in-law wants him to be incarcerated for the reason that from the very start, he was opposed to his marriage to CCC, his daughter.<br><br>He also said that in December 1998, the last molestation of BBB, he was in the motor launch that plies the San Andres and Caramoran route.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>RTC and CA Dispositions</b><br></div><br>On October 25, 2002, the trial court handed down a joint judgment of conviction, imposing upon appellant the capital punishment of death in both cases.&nbsp; The <i>fallo</i> of the RTC decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the prosecution having proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, he is sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of DEATH for raping BBB in Criminal Case No. 2638 and the same penalty for raping AAA in Criminal Case No. 2650 in accordance with Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659.<br><br>The accused is further ordered to indemnify both complainants the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) each, to pay each of them the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and the cost of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Conformably with the pronouncement in <i>People v. Mateo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> providing for an intermediate review by the CA of cases in which the penalty imposed is death, <i>reclusion perpetua </i>or life imprisonment, the Court issued a Resolution dated September 21, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> transferring the case to the appellate court for appropriate action and disposition.<br><br>On February 22, 2005, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC judgment, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Anti Rape Law of 1997, with the aggravating circumstance of relationship and minority, the decision of the court a quo sentencing him to death in both Criminal Cases Nos. 2638 and 2650 is hereby AFFIRMED.&nbsp; The award of civil indemnity is MODIFIED and INCREASED to P75,000.00 each, in both cases.&nbsp; The award of moral damages of P50,000.00 for each case is AFFIRMED.&nbsp; We also award P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in each case.<br><br>Let the records of this case be transmitted to the Supreme Court for appropriate action. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Issues</b><br></div><br>On September 27, 2005, the Court resolved to require the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired, within thirty (30) days from notice.&nbsp; In a manifestation dated December 6, 2005, the Public Attorney's Office, representing appellant Jerry Nazareno, informed the Court that it is adopting its main brief on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General, for the People, similarly opted to dispense with the filing of a supplemental brief in its manifestation dated March 9, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Appellant stands by the same lone error he raised before the appellate court:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED (IN) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT FINDING THAT THE INFORMATION(S) </span>IN CRIMINAL CASE NO[S]. 2638 AND 2650 ARE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSUFFICIENT</span> TO SUPPORT A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION FOR ITS (<i>SIC</i>) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAILURE TO STATE THE PRECISE DATES OF THE COMMISSION</span> OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; (Corrections and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>In the main, appellant argues that the Informations charging him with the rape of AAA and BBB are defective for failure to state with specificity the approximate date of the commission of the offenses.&nbsp; According to him, the twin convictions have no basis in law because the People violated his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him.<br><br>The argument is specious.&nbsp; An information is intended to inform an accused of the accusations against him in order that he could adequately prepare his defense.&nbsp; Verily, an accused cannot be convicted of an offense unless it is clearly charged in the complaint or information.&nbsp; Thus, to ensure that the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him is not violated, the information should state the name of the accused; the designation given to the offense by the statute; a statement of the acts or omissions so complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time and date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Further, it must embody the essential elements of the crime charged by setting forth the facts and circumstances that have a bearing on the culpability and liability of the accused, so that he can properly prepare for and undertake his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>However, it is not necessary for the information to allege the date and time of the commission of the crime with exactitude unless time is an essential ingredient of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In <i>People v. Bugayong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court held that when the time given in the information is not the essence of the offense, the time need not be proven as alleged; and that the complaint will be sustained if the proof shows that the offense was committed at any time within the period of the statute of limitations and before the commencement of the action.<br><br>In <i>People v. Gianan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court ruled that the time of the commission of rape is not an element of the said crime as it is defined in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The gravamen of the crime is the fact of carnal knowledge under any of the circumstances enumerated therein, i.e.: (1) by using force or intimidation; (2) when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and (3) when the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.&nbsp; In accordance with Rule 110, Section 11 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure, as long as it alleges that the offense was committed "at any time as near to the actual date at which the offense was committed," an information is sufficient.<br><br>The doctrine was reiterated with greater firmness in <i>People v. Salalima</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and in <i>People v. Lizada</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the case under review, the information in Criminal Case No. 2638 alleged that the rape of BBB transpired "sometime and between January 1992 up to December 6, 1998 in <i>Barangay</i> Codon, Municipality of San Andres, Province of Catanduanes."&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 2650, the information averred that "from sometime in January 1990 up to December 1998 in <i>Barangay</i> Codon, Municipality of San Andres, Province of Catanduanes," AAA was raped by appellant.&nbsp; To the mind of the Court, the recitals in the informations sufficiently comply with the constitutional requirement that the accused be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<br><br>In <i>People v. Garcia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court upheld a conviction for ten counts of rape based on an Information which alleged that the accused committed multiple rapes "from November 1990 up to July 21, 1994."&nbsp; In <i>People v. Espejon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court found the appellant liable for rape under an information charging that he perpetrated the offense "sometime in the year 1982 and dates subsequent thereto" and "sometime in the year 1995 and subsequent thereto."<br><br>Indeed, this Court has ruled that allegations that rapes were committed "before and until October 15, 1994,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> "sometime in the year 1991 and the days thereafter,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and "on or about and sometime in the year 1988"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> constitute sufficient compliance with Rule 110, Section 11 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br>More than that, the Court notes that the matter of particularity of the dates in the information is being raised for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; The rule is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that objections as to matter of form or substance in the information cannot be made for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Appellant failed to raise the issue of defective informations before the trial court.&nbsp; He could have moved to quash the informations or at least for a bill of particulars.&nbsp; He did not.&nbsp; Clearly, he slumbered on his rights and awakened too late.<br><br>Too, appellant did not object to the presentation of the evidence for the People contending that the offenses were committed "sometime and between January 1992 up to December 6, 1998" for Criminal Case No. 2632 and "sometime in January 1990, up to December 1998" in Criminal Case No. 2650.&nbsp; On the contrary, appellant actively participated in the trial, offering denial and alibi as his defenses.&nbsp; Simply put, he cannot now be heard to complain that he was unable to defend himself in view of the vagueness of the recitals in the informations.<br><br>We now tackle appellant's convictions for the multiple rape of AAA and BBB.<br><br>In an effort to exculpate himself, appellant contends that the charges for rape are mere fabrications and lies.&nbsp; He insists his daughters were instigated by his father-in-law to file the complaints.&nbsp; According to appellant, his father-in-law has an axe to grind against him.&nbsp; His in-law disdained him from the very beginning and wanted him out of CCC's life.<br><br>In reviewing rape cases, the Court is guided by the following jurisprudential guidelines: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) due to the nature of the crime of rape in which only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Tersely put, the credibility of the offended party is crucial in determining the guilt of a person accused of rape.&nbsp; By the very nature of this crime, it is usually only the victim who can testify as to its occurrence.&nbsp; Thus, in rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of the victim, provided that such testimony is credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.&nbsp; Elsewise stated, the lone testimony of the offended party, if credible, suffices to warrant a conviction for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In her testimony before the trial court, AAA narrated:<br><br> <table width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="15%">Q </td> <td width="85%"><div align="justify">Why, when were you particularly raped by your father?<br></div></td> </tr><tr><td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">Since 1990, when I was in Grade I until I was in Grade VI, Sir. </div></td></tr><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">When you were in Grade I, how old were you then?</div></td> </tr> <tr><td>A </td><td><div align="justify">Seven (7) years old, Sir.</div></td> </tr><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr> <td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">Can you remember the first time, you said your father raped you in 1990?</div></td> </tr> <tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">I could no longer remember the date, Sir. </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">But how did your father rape you, do you remember how he raped you in 1990, the first time? </div></td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td><div align="justify"><u>Could you please tell us how he raped you for the first time?</u></div></td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td><div align="justify"><u>I was croaching with raised buttocks, Sir.</u></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">Do you remember where did he tell you to make that position?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">No, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td><div align="justify">Where particularly in your house? </div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">In our room, Sir. </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td><div align="justify">Do you still remember the date, the first time he raped you?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td><div align="justify">No, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">Who were with you in your house during that time? </div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">No one, Sir, because all my other siblings are playing outside the house, and my mother was at work. </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">When you were in that position with your buttocks raised and hands and knees on the floor, what did your father do next?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify"><u>He positioned behind me and s[tar]ted raping me, Sir.</u></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">When you used the term "rape," what do you mean?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify"><u>He inserted his penis into my vagina, Sir.</u> </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td><div align="justify">You mean your father inserted his penis to your vagina?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">Now after that first time, do you remember the second time that he did it to you?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td><div align="justify">I could not remember anymore, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">Do you remember how long the period was between the first and the second time he raped you?</div></td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">I could not longer remember, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">COURT</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">Fiscal,&nbsp;

The trial court has the advantage of observing the witnesses through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply; or the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the sincere or the flippant or sneering tone, the heat, the calmness, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, the carriage and mien.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp;

Denial and alibi, being weak defenses, cannot overcome the positive testimonies of the offended parties and their witnesses.&nbsp; As this Court has reiterated often enough, denial and alibi cannot prevail over positive identification of the accused by the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; The positive, consistent and straightforward testimonies of the victims and the other witnesses for the People sufficiently established appellant's culpability.<br><br>In order to merit credibility, alibi must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability.&nbsp; Verily, for the said defense to prosper, accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis </i>or its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant dismally failed to discharge this <i>onus</i>.<br><br>The trial court and the CA, however, both blundered in convicting appellant of multiple rape of AAA and BBB, from January 1990 to December 1998 and from January 1992 up to December 6, 1998, respectively.<br><br>The RTC and the CA convicted appellant of multiple rapes under two separate informations, Criminal Cases Nos. 2638 and 2650.&nbsp; However, both the trial and appellate courts erroneously sentenced him to a <i>single</i> death penalty for each information.<br><br>We find that appellant is guilty of two qualified rapes, instead of multiple rapes under Criminal Case No. 2650, and only one qualified rape, not multiple, under Criminal Case No. 2638.&nbsp; The legal basis for conviction for as many offenses as are charged and proved is Section 3, Rule 120 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>It is axiomatic that each and every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime.&nbsp;

Matugas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court aptly ruled:<br><blockquote>This Court cannot thus sustain the conviction of accused-appellant for 29 counts of rape because only two incidents were sufficiently proven by the prosecution.&nbsp; While we do not doubt that she was raped on other dates, we cannot ascertain the exact number of times she was actually raped.&nbsp; It must be remembered that each and every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime so that each of the 27 other alleged incidents of rape charged should be proven beyond reasonable doubt. If, as complainant claimed, the number could be more, the possibility that it could be much less than 27 cannot be discounted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote>In <i>People v.

The prosecution is required to establish, by the necessary quantum of proof, the elements of rape for each charge.&nbsp; Baby Jane's testimony on the first rape charge was explicit, detailing the participation of each appellant in the offense and clearly illustrating all the elements of the offense of rape.&nbsp; However her simple assertion that the subsequent rapes occurred in exactly the same manner as in previous incidents is clearly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish to a degree of moral certainty the guilt of the appellants insofar as the eight rape charges are concerned.&nbsp; Her testimony was too general as it failed to focus on material details as to how each of the subsequent acts was committed.&nbsp; Even her testimony on cross-examination did not add anything to support her accusations of subsequent rape.&nbsp; Thus, only the rape alleged to have been committed on September 1992 was proven beyond reasonable doubt and the appellants may be penalized only for this offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote>In the case under review, the evidence bear out that what were proved by the People beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 2650 were the rapes committed by appellant on AAA sometime in 1990 and then again on March 25, 1996.&nbsp; AAA was categorical that she was first raped by appellant sometime in 1990.&nbsp; Her account of the first rape was vivid, candid and straightforward.&nbsp; She further disclosed that appellant repeatedly abused her.&nbsp; However, when asked by the court to clarify her claim that the sexual abuses were repeated, AAA failed to supply the details.&nbsp; But she was able to recount the last incident of rape on March 25, 1996.&nbsp; According to her, that day was of significance to her since she graduated from primary school on that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Applying <i>De la Torre</i>, We hold that AAA's assertion that the subsequent rapes occurred in exactly the same manner as in previous incidents is clearly inadequate and grossly insufficient to establish to a degree of moral certainty the guilt of appellant insofar as the other rape incidents are concerned.&nbsp; Her testimony was too general as it failed to focus on material details as to how each of the subsequent acts was committed.&nbsp; In fine, appellant should have been convicted, in Criminal Case No. 2650, only of the qualified rape of AAA sometime in 1990 and then again on March 25, 1996.<br><br>With respect to private complainant BBB in Criminal Case No. 2638, what is extant from the records is that appellant succeeded in raping her in January 1992.&nbsp; BBB, like AAA, failed to give an account of the alleged rape subsequent to January 1992 when she testified in the court below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As with AAA, We hold that BBB's account of the rapes subsequent to January 1992 but before December 6, 1998 is too general and unconvincing.<br><br>Likewise borne by the records is the insertion of appellant's finger into BBB's vagina on December 6, 1998.&nbsp; BBB testified that appellant raped her for the last time on December 6, 1998.&nbsp; When asked by the court to clarify what she meant, BBB disclosed that appellant inserted his finger into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>What appellant did was rape by sexual assault, punishable under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.)
