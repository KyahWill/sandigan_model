				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Lilian L. Labadan (petitioner) was hired by private respondent Forest Hills Mission Academy (Forest Hills) in July 1989 as an elementary school teacher.  From 1990 up to 2002, petitioner was registrar and secondary school teacher.<br><br>On August 18, 2003, petitioner filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against respondent Forest Hills and its administrator respondent Naomi Cabaluna for illegal dismissal, non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, allowances, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, service incentive leave, illegal deductions, and damages.<br><br>In her Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> petitioner alleged that she was allowed to go on leave from Forest Hills, and albeit she had exceeded her approved leave period, its extension was impliedly approved by the school principal because she received no warning or reprimand and was in fact retained in the payroll up to 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further alleged that since 1990, tithes to the Seventh Day Adventist church have been illegally deducted from her salary; and she was not paid overtime pay for overtime service,  13<sup>th</sup> month pay, five days service incentive leave pay, and holiday pay; and that her SSS contributions have not been remitted.<br><br>Claiming that strained relations between her and Forest Hill have rendered reinstatement not feasible, petitioner prayed for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.<br><br>In its Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Forest Hills claimed as follows:  In July 2001, petitioner was permitted to go on leave for two weeks but did not return for work after the expiration of the period.  Despite petitioner's undertaking to report "soon," she never did even until the end of School Year 2001-2002.  It thus hired a temporary employee to accomplish the needed reports.  When she finally returned for work, classes for the School Year 2002-2003 were already on-going.<br><br>To belie petitioner's claim that she was dismissed, Forest Hills submitted a list of faculty members and staff from School Year 1998-1999 up to School Year 2001 to 2002 which included her name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>With regard to the charge for illegal deduction, Forest Hills claimed that the Seventh Day Adventist Church requires its members to pay tithes equivalent to 10% of their salaries, and petitioner was hired on account of her being a member thereof, and petitioner never questioned the deduction of the tithe from her salary.<br><br>With regard to the charge for non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, and allowances, Forest Hills noted that petitioner proffered no evidence to support the same.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter decided in favor of petitioner, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol><li>Finding respondents Forest Hills Academy and/or Naomi Cabaluna guilty of illegally dismissing the complainant;<br><br></li><li>Directing respondent to pay complainant Lilia P. Labadan the total amount of P152,501.02 representing her monetary award x x x.<br></li></ol>Complainant's other claim[s] are hereby dismissed for lack of merit and/or failure to substantiate.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), finding the Labor Arbiter to have misappreciated the facts of the case, reversed and set aside his decision and dismissed petitioner's complaint by Resolution of June 30, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On petitioner's Petition for Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court of Appeals, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of December 15, 2005, dismissed the petition for deficient amount of appellate docket fee, non-attachment of Affidavit of Service, absence of written explanation why the petition was filed through registered mail instead of through personal service, and non-attachment of copies of the Complaint and the Answer filed before the Labor Arbiter.  Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> she filed the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> faulting the Court of Appeals<br><blockquote><b><i>x x x IN DISMISSING THE PETITION ON THE GROUND OF TECHNICALITIES[;]</i></b><br><br><b><i>x x x IN NOT DECIDING ON THE MERITS WHETHER OR NOT HONORABLE COMMISSIONERS OF THE 5<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION:</i></b><br><ol type="A"><li><b>IN REVERSING THE FINDINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE LABOR ARBITER THAT HEREIN PETITIONER-COMPLAINANT WAS NOT DISMISSED FROM HER WORK AS A TEACHER and AT THE SAME TIME THE REGISTRAR;</b><br><br></li><li><b>IN FINDING THAT BY A PROLONGED ABSENCE OF ONE YEAR MORE OR LESS, PETITIONER WAIVED HER 13<sup>TH</sup> MONTH PAY AND SERVICE INCENTIVE LEAVES AS SHE FAILED TO STATE SUCH CLAIMS IN HER AFFIDAVIT THAT WAS ATTACHED [TO] HER POSITION PAPER, and;</b><br><br></li><li><b>THAT THE DECISION/RESOLUTION RENDERED BY THE HONORABLE COMMISSIONERS OF THE 5<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION WAS TAINTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AS IT WAS INCOMPLETE AND UNLAWFUL[.]<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></b> </b>(Italics and emphasis in the original)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Non-payment of docket fee at the time of the filing of a petition does not automatically call for its dismissal as long as the fee is paid within the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>   While petitioner paid the P30 deficient amount of the docket fee on February 7, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> it was beyond the 60-day period for filing the petition for certiorari.  Nevertheless, the Court, in the interest of substantial justice, brushes aside this and the other technicalities cited by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution of December 15, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and, instead of remanding the case to the appellate court, now hereby decides the case on the merits.<br><br>While in cases of illegal dismissal, the employer bears the burden of proving that the dismissal is for a valid or authorized cause, the employee must first establish by substantial evidence the fact of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The records do not show that petitioner was dismissed from the service. They in fact show that despite petitioner's absence from July 2001 to March 2002 which, by her own admission, exceeded her approved leave,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> she was still considered a member of the Forest Hills faculty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which retained her in its payroll.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues, however, that she was constructively dismissed when Forest Hills merged her class with another "so much that when she reported back to work, she has no more claims to hold and no more work to do."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, however, failed to refute Forest Hills' claim that when she expressed her intention to resume teaching, classes were already ongoing for School Year 2002-2003.  It bears noting that petitioner simultaneously held the positions of secondary school teacher  and  registrar and,  as  the  NLRC  noted, she  could have resumed her work as registrar had she really wanted to continue working with Forest Hills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's affidavit and those of her former colleagues,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which she attached to her Position Paper, merely attested that she was dismissed from her job without valid cause, but gave no particulars on when and how she was dismissed.<br><br>There being no substantial proof that petitioner was dismissed, she is not entitled to separation pay or backwages.<br><br>Respecting petitioner's claim for holiday pay, Forest Hills contends that petitioner failed to prove that she actually worked during specific holidays.  Article 94 of the Labor Code provides, however, that<b style="font-weight: bold;"><br></b><blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Every worker shall be paid his regular daily wage during regular holidays, except in retail and service establishments regularly employing less than ten (10) workers; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The employer may require an employee to work on any holiday but such employee shall be paid a compensation equivalent to twice his regular rate[.]</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The provision that a worker is entitled to twice his regular rate if he is required to work on a holiday implies that the provision entitling a worker to his regular rate on holidays applies even if he does not work.<br><br>The petitioner is likewise entitled to service incentive leave under Article 95 of the Labor Code which provides that<b style="font-weight: bold;"><br></b><blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Every employee who has rendered at least one year of service shall be entitled to a yearly service incentive leave of five days with pay.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">This provision shall not apply to those who are already enjoying the benefit herein provided, those enjoying vacation leave with pay of at least five days and those employed in establishments regularly employing less than ten employees or in establishment exempted from granting this benefit by the Secretary of Labor after considering the viability or financial condition of such establishment.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">x x x x,</div></td> <td><br></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>and to 13<sup>th</sup> month pay under Presidential Decree No. 851.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As for petitioner's claims for overtime pay, it must be denied, for other than the uncorroborated affidavits of her colleagues, there is no concrete proof that she is entitled thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  And so must her claim for allowances, no proof to her entitlement thereto having been presented.<br><br>On the deduction of 10% tithe, Article 113 of the Labor Code instructs:<br><blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">ART. 113.
