The appellate court ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Indeed, it has been held that "it is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but the payment of the prescribed docket fee that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action."&nbsp;

Consequently,&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Pyramid]&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby directed to </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">pay the correct&nbsp; docket fees on the basis of the losses alleged in the body of the complaint, plus the attorney's fees mentioned in the prayer</b><b>, within a reasonable time</b> which should not go beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.

Regional Trial Court of Tagum, </i><i>Davao</i><i> del Norte</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court clarified the effect of the <i>Sun Insurance</i> ruling on the <i>Manchester</i> ruling as follows:<br><blockquote>As will be noted, the requirement in Circular No. 7 [of this Court which was issued based on the <i>Manchester </i>ruling<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>] that complaints, petitions, answers, and similar pleadings should specify the amount of damages being prayed for not only in the body of the pleading but also in the prayer, has not been altered. What has been revised is the rule that subsequent "amendment of the complaint or similar pleading will not thereby vest jurisdiction in the Court, much less the payment of the docket fee based on the amount sought in the amended pleading," <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the trial court now being authorized to </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive period or reglementary period</span>.&nbsp; Moreover, a new rule has been added, governing the awards of claims not specified in the pleading - i.e., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">damages arising </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">after </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the filing of the complaint or similar pleading - as to which the additional filing fee therefore shall constitute a lien on the judgment</span>.<br><br>Now, under the Rules of Court, docket or filing fees are assessed on the basis of the "sum claimed," on the one hand, or the "value of the property in litigation or the value of the estate," on the other. . .<br><br>Where the action is purely for the recovery of money or damages, the docket fees are assessed on the basis of the aggregate amount claimed, exclusive only of interests and costs.&nbsp; In this case, the complaint or similar pleading should, according to Circular No. 7 of this Court, "specify the amount of damages being prayed for not only in the body of the pleading but also in the prayer, and said damages shall be considered in the assessment of filing fees in any case."<br><br>Two situations may arise.&nbsp; One is where the complaint or similar pleading sets out a claim purely for money and damages and there is no statement of the amounts being claimed.&nbsp; In this event the rule is that the pleading will "not be accepted nor admitted, or shall otherwise be expunged from the record."&nbsp; In other words, the complaint or pleading may be dismissed, or the claims as to which amounts are unspecified may be expunged, although as aforestated the Court may, on motion, permit amendment of the complaint and payment of the fees provided the claim has not in the meantime become time-barred.&nbsp; The other is where the pleading does specify the amount of every claim, but the fees paid are insufficient; and here again, the rule now is that the court may allow a reasonable time for the payment of the prescribed fees, or the balance thereof, and upon such payment, the defect is cured and the court may properly take cognizance of the action, unless in the meantime prescription has set in and consequently barred the right of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Indeed, Pyramid captioned its complaint as one for "specific performance and damages" even if it was, as the allegations in its body showed, seeking in the main the collection of its claims-sums of money representing losses the amount of which it, by its own admission, "knew."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; And, indeed, it failed to specify in its prayer in the complaint the amount of its claims/damages.<br><br>When Pyramid amended its complaint, it still did not specify, in its prayer, the amount of claims/damages it was seeking.&nbsp; In fact it has the audacity to inform this Court, in its Comment on the present Petition, that<br><blockquote>x x x In the natural order of things, when a litigant is given the opportunity to spend less for a docket fee after submitting his pleading for assessment by the Office of the Clerk of Court, he would not decline it inasmuch as to request for a higher assessment under the circumstances [for such] is against his interest and would be senseless.&nbsp; Placed under the same situation, petitioner[s] would certainly do likewise.&nbsp; To say otherwise would certainly be dishonest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>which comment drew petitioners to conclude as follows:<br><blockquote>[This] only shows respondent's dishonesty and lack of regard of the rules. Following this line of reasoning, respondent would do everything if only for it to spend less for the filing fee, even to the extent of circumventing and defying the rule on the payment of the filing fee.<br><br>In spite of the fact that the respondent was already caught in the quagmire of its own cobweb of deception, it further justified its unethical act by ratiocinating that "<i>placed under the same situation, petitioner would certainly do likewise, to say otherwise would certainly be dishonest".&nbsp; <b>This attitude of the respondent is very alarming! </b></i>Having been caught red-handed, the honorable thing that respondent should have done is admit its own violation rather than justify an act which it knows is a clear contravention of the rules and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Italics and emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Pyramid's following justification for omitting to specify in the prayer of its complaint the amount of its claims/damages, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>x x x While respondent knew its losses and alleged them in the body of the Complaint, it was <b style="text-decoration: underline;">not aware</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of the </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">extent of petitioners' respective liability</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> under the two insurance policies</span>.&nbsp; The allegation of respondent's losses, albeit, without repeating them in its prayer for relief was not motivated by an intention to mislead, cheat or defraud the Court.&nbsp; It just left the matter of liability arising from two separate and distinct Insurance Policies covering the same insurable risk <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the trial court's determination</span>, hence, respondent came up with an action for "specific performance[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>fails to impress.<br><br>As the salient allegations of Pyramid's complaint show and as priorly stated, they constitute, in the main, an action for collection of its claims it admittedly "knew."<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Pyramid has other claims the amounts of which are yet to be determined by the trial court, the rule established in <i>Manchester</i> which was embodied in this Court's Circular No. 7-88 issued on March 24, 1988, as modified by the <i>Sun Insurance </i>ruling, still applies. Consider this Court's pronouncement bearing on the matter in <i>Ayala Corporation v.
