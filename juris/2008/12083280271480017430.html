				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner National Electrification Administration (NEA) is a government-owned and controlled corporation exercising supervision and control over electric cooperatives pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 269, as amended.<br><br>From 1986 to 1988, the Nueva Ecija III Electric Cooperative, Inc. (NEECO III) experienced serious institutional problems due to its failure to pay its maturing bills from the National Power Corporation (NPC). To bail it out, NEA extended loans to NEECO III, to secure which it mortgaged its entire electric system or entire property to NEA.<br><br>NEECO III failed to pay its amortizations to NEA.<br><br>NEECO III thereupon availed of NEA’s re-lending program to settle its obligations with the NPC. Under the NEA-NEECO III re-lending agreement, NEECO III’s Board of Directors was converted into an advisory council, and NEA was to, as it did, designate, pursuant to Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 1645,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> a project supervisor/acting general manager to take charge of NEECO III’s operations and management. In turn, NEA shelled out P30,000,000 to pay the NPC and to rehabilitate NEECO III. NEECO III, however, still defaulted in the amortization of its loan to NEA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> drawing the latter to, by Resolution No. 42<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> approved on June 25, 1992, foreclose the mortgage on NEECO III’s assets.

The NEA Management Team alleged that Datu forcibly entered NEA’s premises, ransacked its valuables, and carted away its properties and those belonging to other persons without proper inventory, and that he and Saludares set the auction sale of the properties the following day, November 27, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Also on November 26, 1997, the NEA filed before the NLRC a Motion to Quash Alias [Partial] Writ of Execution</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which included in its prayer the quashal of the “Notice of Levy/Sale on execution of personal properties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The records of the case do not show how the NLRC disposed of the said motion.<br><br>Branch 30 of the Cabanatuan RTC granted a temporary restraining order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In their Comment on the NEA Management Team’s complaint, Saludares and Datu argued that the trial court has neither jurisdiction over the nature of the action nor the legal authority to enjoin the NLRC and its labor arbiters from enforcing their judgment or order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> They invoked the concurrent jurisdiction and co-equal rank of trial courts with the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Josephine Manuel et al. later filed before the trial court a Motion for Intervention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and an Urgent Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> essentially echoing the stand of Saludares and Datu.<br><br>By Decision of January 2, 1998, the trial court dismissed the NEA Management Team’s complaint on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Instead of a separate action and in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the plaintiffs could have sought the effective quashal of the Writ of Execution and subsequently the “Notice of Sale”</span> from the Supreme Court in G.R.

(G.R. No. 110509), hence, cannot be bound by NLRC decisions, orders, writs of execution, and other processes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The petition must be dismissed outright on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>It is the NLRC, not the RTC, which has jurisdiction over NEA’s move for the quashal of the Alias Partial Writ of Execution. So <span style="font-style: italic;">Deltaventures Resources, Inc. v. Hon. Cabato</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>Ostensibly the complaint before the trial court was for the recovery of possession and injunction, but in essence it was an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">action challenging the legality or propriety of the levy <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-à-vis</span> the <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> writ of execution</span>, including the acts performed by the Labor Arbiter and the Deputy Sheriff implementing the writ. The complaint was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in effect a motion to quash the writ of execution of a decision rendered on a case properly within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter</span>, to wit: Illegal Dismissal and Unfair Labor Practice. Considering the factual setting, it is then logical to conclude that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the subject matter of the third party claim is but an <span style="font-weight: bold;">incident of the labor case</span>, a matter <span style="font-weight: bold;">beyond the jurisdiction of the regional trial courts</span></span>.<br><br>Precedents abound confirming the rule that said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">courts have no jurisdiction to act on labor cases or various incidents arising therefrom</span>, including the execution of decisions, awards, or orders. Jurisdiction to try and adjudicate such cases pertains exclusively to the proper labor official concerned under the Department of Labor and Employment. To hold otherwise is to sanction split jurisdiction which is obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice.<br><br>Petitioner failed to realize that by filing its third-party claim with the deputy sheriff, it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Commission acting through the Labor Arbiter. It failed to perceive the fact that what it is really controverting is the decision of the Labor Arbiter and not the act of the deputy sheriff in executing said order issued as a consequence of said decision rendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>At all events, as priorly stated, NEA filed before the NLRC a Motion to Quash Alias [Partial] Writ of Execution on the same date that it filed the complaint that gave rise to the present case before the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> assailing the same writ. It thus committed forum-shopping.<br><br>There is forum-shopping when as a result of an adverse decision in one forum, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or in anticipation thereof</span>, a party seeks a favorable opinion in another forum through means other than appeal or <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Forum-shopping exists when two or more actions involve the same transactions, essential facts, and circumstances; and raise identical causes of action, subject matter, and issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Still another test of forum-shopping is when the elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendencia</span> are present or where a final judgment in one case will amount to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in another – whether in the two or more pending cases, there is an identity of (a) parties (or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (b) rights or causes of action, and (c) reliefs sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The remedies NEA sought before the NLRC in the Motion to Quash Alias Partial Writ of Execution are substantially the same as those sought before the RTC. The issues which NEA raised before the NLRC and those sought in the RTC are likewise the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The parties in both cases are the same, given the intervention in the case before the RTC by Josephine Manuel et al.<br><br>NEA’s argument that the NLRC acquired no jurisdiction over it<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> does not persuade. Applying the above-cited <span style="font-style: italic;">Deltaventures Resources, Inc. v. Hon.
