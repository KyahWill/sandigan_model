She saw appellant Rodolfo Sison, together with Corleto Sendaydiego, in a sitting position atop a Pepsi stand outside their fence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  A moment later, she saw her father Bernabe dela Cruz come out of their house clad in an undershirt and underwear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Bernabe walked towards appellant and Sendaydiego to confront them.  Unexpectedly, appellant drew a gun and shot Bernabe thrice, hitting him in the chest and stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  Bernabe cried out in pain and clutched his stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After the shooting, the duo fled the crime scene post-haste.  Bernabe was brought to a hospital.

She likewise saw appellant and Sendaydiego fleeing from the crime scene.

In addition to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>imposed, and the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as actual damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, accused-appellant is likewise ordered to pay the heirs of the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present recourse.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>Appellant imputes to the CA twin errors, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT COMMITTED THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF, THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> NEVERTHELESS ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF THE CRIME OF MURDER INSTEAD OF HOMICIDE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br><b><i>The guilt of appellant was proven beyond reasonable doubt. His bare denial cannot prevail over his positive identification by eyewitnesses.</i></b><br><br>Appellant contends that the prosecution fell short of its duty to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  He claims he was innocently implicated in the killing of Bernabe.  He points to co-accused Sendaydiego as the gunman.  Appellant also questions the RTC finding of facts and appreciation of evidence, particularly the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>It is settled that appellate courts will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, unless there appears in the record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which have been overlooked and, if considered, would affect the result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses is a matter best left to the trial court because of its unique position and opportunity of being able to observe the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying.<br><br>That opportunity is denied to the appellate courts. We find that the RTC calibration of the credibility of the witnesses is not flawed.  The testimonies of Bernadette, Bernie, Bernalyn, and Lydia positively established, beyond reasonable doubt, that it was appellant who shot Bernabe.<br><br>The said witnesses testified in a clear, straightforward, and convincing manner on the material events that led to the shooting of Bernabe, to wit:  (1) the stoning of their house; (2) how they immediately stood up and peeped through the window and saw appellant and Sendaydiego sitting on their fence; (3) how Bernabe came out from their house; (4) how appellant shot Bernabe while the latter was about to approach the place where appellant and Sendaydiego were situated; (5) how they vividly witnessed the shooting of Bernabe by appellant because of the moonlight and the illumination coming from street lamp; (6) how Bernabe held his stomach and jumped after the shooting; and (7) how appellant and Sendaydiego ran away after the shooting.<br><br>Bernadette, on direct examination, testified that she saw appellant shoot his father, thus:<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"> <br></td> <td width="5%">Q: </td> <td width="90%">Will you please tell the Court on that evening of November 25, 1993, if there was anything unusual that happened?</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td>A: </td> <td>Yes, Sir.

It is settled that denials which are unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and self-serving evidence.  It merits no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimony of credible witnesses who testified on affirmatives matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  Denial, like alibi, is an inherently weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive and categorical identification provided by eyewitnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b><i>Appellant was correctly convicted of murder. Although there was no evident premeditation, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was proven.</i></b><br><br>Appellant argues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that assuming it was he who shot Bernabe, the lower court nevertheless erred in convicting him of murder because the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation were not adequately proven.  According to him, if ever he is guilty, he should be convicted only of homicide.<br><br>In order that evident premeditation may be appreciated, the following requisites must concur: (1) the time when accused decided to commit the crime; (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that he has clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between decision and execution to allow accused to reflect upon the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We agree with appellant that there was no evident premeditation.  There is no evidence that appellant and Sendaydiego planned to kill Bernabe.  Even the Solicitor General admits that the lapse of time from the stoning incident until the shooting cannot be considered sufficient for appellant to reflect upon the consequences of his act.  The interval of time was only for several minutes. Evident premeditation should not be appreciated where, as in this case, there is neither evidence of planning or preparation to kill nor of the time when the plot was conceived.<br><br>We, however, find that the qualifying circumstance of treachery attended the killing of the victim.<br><br>Article 14(6) of the Revised Penal Code provides that there is treachery (<i>alevosia</i>) "when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The essence of treachery lies in the attack which comes without warning, and is swift, deliberate and unexpected, and affords the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> ensuring its commission without risk to the aggressor, without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  What is decisive in treachery is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself or retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  Treachery may also be appreciated even if the victim was warned of the danger to his life where he was defenseless and unable to flee at the time of the infliction of the <i>coup de grace</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Here, Bernabe was suddenly shot without any warning by appellant at a distance of about 3 to 4 meters.  An unexpected and sudden attack, which renders the victim unable and unprepared to defend himself by reason of the suddenness of the attack, constitutes <i>alevosia</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  Even a frontal attack could be treacherous when unexpected and on an unarmed victim would be in no position to repel the attack or avoid it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><i style="font-weight: bold;">On the penalty and</i><br style="font-weight: bold;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">award of damages</i><br><br>Murder is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  There being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> appellant was correctly sentenced by the RTC and the CA to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>We, however, modify the award of damages.<br><br>Both the RTC and the CA awarded the heirs of Bernabe the amount of P75,000.00 as actual damages. It is settled that actual damages must be duly substantiated by documentary evidence, such as receipts to prove the expenses incurred as a result of the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Here, only the amount of P6,030.00 is supported by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  Too, the alleged miscellaneous expenses of P68,970.00 cannot be the basis of an award because they were not sufficiently proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>However, consistent with Our ruling in <i>People v.

As well stated in said cases, to rule otherwise would be anomalous and unfair because the victim's heirs who tried but succeeded in proving actual damages of an amount less than P25,000 would be in a worse situation than those who might have presented no receipts at all but would now be entitled to  P25,000 temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><h5 style="font-weight: normal;"><font size="3">Civil indemnity of P50,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 were correctly awarded.
