Pruna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court laid down the following guidelines in determining&nbsp; the age of the victim:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.<br><br></li><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.<br><br></li><li>If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;<br><br></li><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;<br><br></li><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.<br><br></li></ol></li><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.<br><br></li><li>It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.<br><br></li><li>The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.</li></ol></blockquote>Despite the trial court's conclusion that "AAA was born on 15 April&nbsp; 1981" we find that the records of the case do not support such finding.<br><br>The prosecution failed to present the birth certificate or any other document to prove the age of AAA.&nbsp; The only evidence presented was the bare testimony of AAA that she was 10 years old when she was first raped by her father.<br><br>Since the prosecution failed to prove the age of AAA at the time of the first rape, appellant cannot be convicted of statutory rape.&nbsp; However, appellant may still be convicted of rape under Article 335(1) of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. MC98-311-H.&nbsp; The gravamen of this crime is carnal knowledge of a woman by using force, violence, intimidation, or threat which was properly alleged in the information. In several cases, the Court ruled that the element of force or intimidation is not essential in cases of rape committed by a father against his own daughter, as the father's moral ascendancy or influence substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><i> </i>That ascendancy or influence necessarily flows from the father's parental authority, such that a father&nbsp; can&nbsp; control his&nbsp; daughter's&nbsp; will forcing&nbsp; her to follow his biddings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Regarding the first rape, AAA unequivocally testified that appellant touched her private part, then forced his private part into her private part causing her pain.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant threatened to kill her if she would tell anyone about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. MC98-312-H to MC98-314-H, the Court finds that the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to show that appellant raped AAA during the periods alleged in the informations to warrant conviction.&nbsp; This is especially so since AAA stated on the witness stand that appellant raped her two to three times a week after the commission of the first rape:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="center">- </div></td> <td width="85%"> <div align="justify">How many times if you can recall that your father inserted his penis to your vagina?

Considering the size of their home, it would be highly unlikely that the rapes would have taken place without AAA's sisters knowing about it.<br><br></li><li>AAA's sisters testified that appellant never sexually molested them. Thus, it would seem incredible that AAA was the only one raped by their father.<br><br></li><li>AAA had a boyfriend and it was possible that he was the father of her child. Since no paternity test was conducted, it would be unfair to conclude that appellant was the father of AAA's child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></li></ol>The Court finds that the points raised by appellant are but desperate attempts to obtain a reversal of the convictions and are of no merit.<br><br> The Court has in the past ruled that rape may be committed even when rapist and victim are not alone.&nbsp; In fact, rape was held to have been committed in the same room while the rapist's spouse was asleep, or in a small room where other family members also slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; As AAA stated in her testimony, her father molested her during times when they were alone in the room. This explains why the other members of the family were not aware that appellant was sexually abusing AAA.<br><br>That appellant never sexually molested his other daughters and that AAA had a boyfriend are inconsequential facts that do not cast a doubt on AAA's claim that appellant raped her several times.<br><br>In sum, the prosecution had established by clear and convincing evidence that appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA, his minor daughter, on at least four occasions.<br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. MC98-311-H and 312-H, appellant is guilty of rape under Article 335(1) of the Revised Penal Code with the aggravating circumstance that the offender is the parent of the victim.<br><br>In Criminal Case Nos.&nbsp; MC98-313-H and 314-H, appellant is guilty of rape qualified by the circumstances that the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is the parent of the victim.<br><br>As the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship were alleged and proved, the death penalty imposed by the trial court is proper.&nbsp; In view, however, of the subsequent enactment on 24 June 2006 of Republic Act No. 9346, An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines, the appellate court correctly reduced the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole.<br><br>We sustain the awards of P75,000 and P25,000 as civil indemnity and exemplary damages, respectively, for each count of rape but increase the award of moral damages from P50,000 to P75,000 for each count in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decisions of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 211, Mandaluyong City in Criminal Case Nos.
