However, if the error subject of the recourse is one of jurisdiction, or the act complained of was granted by a court with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the proper remedy is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the said Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> These few significant exceptions are: when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates, or when the broader interests of justice so require, or when the writs issued are null, or when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the Court gives due course to the petition for certiorari in the broader interest of justice and in view of the substantive issues raised. The Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion in ruling that petitioners can no longer enforce the judgment of the trial court. Petitioners, in whose names the title of the subject property was registered, were stripped of their rights of ownership contrary to the provisions of Section 47 of P.D. No. 1529. The Court of Appeals erred in appreciating the tax declarations presented by respondents as evidence of ownership vis-à-vis the transfer certificate of title of the petitioners. Moreover, the issue of ownership over the subject property had long been adjudicated in favor of petitioners, which judgment has become final and executory. Thus, the Court of Appeals exceeded its authority in ruling on the issue of ownership. The only issue submitted for its resolution is whether petitioners' independent action to revive the October 2, 1985 Decision of the trial court was timely filed. Likewise, the appellate court was without authority to rule that the trial court erred in ordering respondents to vacate the premises on the ground that the writ of execution was not specific as to which area is claimed.<br><br>Section 47 of P.D. No. 1529 provides that "no title to registered land in derogation of the title of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession." Since petitioners are the registered owners of the lot in question, the adverse possession by the respondents cannot result to the forfeiture of their ownership. The trial court's declaration that petitioners are the owners of the subject property only affirms petitioners' ownership which requires no specific and positive act of execution which a sheriff may perform for enforcement unlike the other aspects of the decision ordering the defendants to vacate the premises and to pay rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In recognition of such ownership, it would be more in keeping with justice and equity to allow the revival of the subject judgment.<br><br>An action for revival of judgment is governed by Article 1144 (3) of the Civil Code and Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to Section 6 of Rule 39, once a judgment becomes final and executory, the prevailing party can have it executed as a matter of right by mere motion within five years from date of entry of the judgment. If the prevailing party fails to have the decision enforced by a motion after the lapse of five years from the date of its entry, the said judgment is reduced to a right of action which must be enforced by the institution of a complaint in a regular court within 10 years from the time the judgment became final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, petitioners are seeking to revive the judgment rendered on October 2, 1985 by Branch 52 of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon in Civil Case No. 639 declaring them as rightful owners of the property, and ordering respondents to vacate the premises, and to pay rents and other damages. The judgment became final and executory on January 28, 1987 as shown in the Entry of Judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, petitioners have five years therefrom to execute said judgment by mere motion and, should they fail to do so, have ten years from said date to revive the judgment by an independent action, which they filed on January 30, 1998.<br><br>The purpose of the law in prescribing time limitations for enforcing judgments by action is to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In the instant case, far from sleeping on their rights, petitioners pursued every available remedy to recover the subject property but failed due to the machinations of respondents. After the decision declaring them as rightful owners of the property became final and executory on January 28, 1987, petitioners filed on May 8, 1987 a motion for execution which was granted. However, the same was not served on defendant Juan Dino. Consequently, petitioners applied for the issuance of an alias writ of execution. Thereafter, the sheriff executed a Delivery of Possession. However, respondents refused to sign the same and remained in the premises. Thus, petitioners applied for a writ of demolition. Although the same was granted, it was not implemented due to respondents' resistance. Thus, petitioners filed an action to revive the judgment of the trial court declaring them as owners of the property. Despite diligent efforts and the final and executory nature of the Decision, petitioners have yet to regain possession of what is legally their own. These circumstances clearly demonstrate that the failure to execute the judgment was due to respondents' refusal to follow the several writs ordering them to vacate the premises. It would be unfair for the Court to allow respondents to profit from their defiance of valid court orders.<br><br>It is a better rule that courts, under the principle of equity, will not be guided or bound strictly by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches when to do so, manifest wrong or injustice would result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It would be more in keeping with justice and equity to allow the revival of the judgment rendered by Branch 52 of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon in Civil Case No. 639. To rule otherwise would result in an absurd situation where the rightful owner of a property would be ousted by a usurper on mere technicalities. Indeed, it would be an idle ceremony to insist on the filing of another action that would only unduly prolong respondents' unlawful retention of the premises which they had, through all devious means, unjustly withheld from petitioners all these years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court also notes that petitioners claim of ownership and right to recovery of possession was by virtue of a title registered in their names. The ruling of the trial court regarding the identity of the land in question and its inclusion in the said title was duly proven in the proceedings before it and said decision has attained finality. Thus, it was improper for the Court of Appeals to appreciate the tax declarations presented by respondents as evidence of ownership. It should be stressed that the issue of who has better rights of possession and ownership over the properties has long been adjudicated by the courts and has attained finality. The Court of Appeals likewise erred in reversing the order to vacate the premises on the ground that the writ of execution was not specific as to which area is claimed as the identity of the property under litigation was resolved in the earlier proceedings between the parties. Besides, the sufficiency of the writ should have been raised in the proceedings in Civil Case No. 639 before Branch 52; it is not an issue in the complaint for execution which is an independent action the cause of action of which is the judgment sought to be revived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
