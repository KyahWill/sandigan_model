SP No. 86977 which had respectively dismissed Michael Padua's petition for certiorari and denied his motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Padua's petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals assailed the Orders dated May 11, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><b> </b>and July 28, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><b> </b>of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 168, Pasig City, which had denied his petition for probation.<br><br>The facts, culled from the records, are as follows:<br><br>On June 16, 2003, petitioner Michael Padua and Edgar Allan Ubalde were charged before the RTC, Branch 168, Pasig City of violating Section 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><b> </b>Article II of Republic Act No. 9165,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002," for selling dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; The Information reads:<br><blockquote>The Prosecution, through the undersigned Public Prosecutor, charges <b>Edgar Allan Ubalde y Velchez a.k.a.

Panis, a police poseur-buyer, one (1) folded newsprint containing 4.86 grams of dried marijuana fruiting tops, which was found positive to the tests for marijuana, a dangerous drug, in violation of the said law.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>When arraigned on October 13, 2003, Padua, assisted by his counsel <i>de oficio</i>, entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>During the pre-trial conference on February 2, 2004, however, Padua's counsel manifested that his client was willing to withdraw his plea of not guilty and enter a plea of guilty to avail of the benefits granted to first-time offenders under&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp;&nbsp; 70<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; of Rep.&nbsp;&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 9165.&nbsp; The prosecutor interposed no objection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the RTC on the same date issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> stating that the former plea of Padua of not guilty was considered withdrawn. Padua was re-arraigned and pleaded guilty.&nbsp; Hence, in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated February 6, 2004, the RTC found Padua guilty of the crime charged:<br><blockquote><i>In view of the foregoing</i>, the Court finds accused Michael Padua y Tordel guilty of [v]iolation of Sec. 5 Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 in relation to R.A. No. 8369 Sec. 5 par. (a) and (i) thereof, and therefore, sentences him to suffer an indeterminate sentence of six (6) years and one (1) day of Prision Mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal as maximum and a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>No subsidiary imprisonment, however, shall be imposed should [the] accused fail to pay the fine pursuant to Art. 39 par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Padua subsequently filed a Petition for Probation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated February 10, 2004 alleging that he is a minor and a first-time offender who desires to avail of the benefits of probation under Presidential Decree No. 968<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><b> </b>(P.D. No. 968), otherwise known as "The Probation Law of 1976" and Section 70 of Rep. Act No. 9165.&nbsp; He further alleged that he possesses all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications under the said laws.<br><br>The RTC in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated February 10, 2004 directed the Probation Officer of Pasig City to conduct a Post-Sentence Investigation and submit a report and recommendation within 60 days from receipt of the order.&nbsp; The City Prosecutor was also directed to submit his comment on the said petition within five days from receipt of the order.<br><br>On April 6, 2004, Chief Probation and Parole Officer Josefina J. Pasana submitted a Post-Sentence Investigation Report to the RTC recommending that Padua be placed on probation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>However, on May 11, 2004, public respondent Pairing Judge Agnes Reyes-Carpio issued an Order denying the Petition for Probation on the ground that under Section 24<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of Rep. Act No. 9165, any person convicted of drug trafficking cannot avail of the privilege granted by the Probation Law.&nbsp; The court ruled thus:<br><blockquote>Before this Court now is the Post-Sentence Investigation Report (PSIR) on minor Michael Padua y Tordel prepared by Senior Parole and Probation Officer Teodoro Villaverde and submitted by the Chief of the Pasig City Parole and Probation Office, Josefina J. Pasana.<br><br>In the aforesaid PSIR, Senior PPO Teodoro Villaverde recommended that minor Michael Padua y Tordel be placed on probation, anchoring his recommendation on Articles 189 and 192 of P.D. 603, otherwise known as the Child and Welfare Code, as amended, which deal with the suspension of sentence and commitment of youthful offender. Such articles, therefore, do not find application in this case, the matter before the Court being an application for probation by minor Michael Padua y Tordel and not the suspension of his sentence.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 70 is under Article VIII of R.A. 9165 which deals with the Program for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Drug Dependents. Sections 54 to 76, all under Article VIII of R.A. 9165 specifically refer to violations of either Section 15 or Section 11. Nowhere in Article VIII was [v]iolation of Section 5 ever mentioned.<br><br>More importantly, while the provisions of R.A. 9165, particularly Section 70 thereof deals with Probation or Community Service for First- Time Minor Offender in Lieu of Imprisonment, the Court is of the view and so holds that minor Michael Padua y Tordel who was charged and convicted of violating Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165, cannot avail of probation under said section in view of the provision of Section 24 which is hereunder quoted:<br><br>"Sec. 24.&nbsp; Non-Applicability of the Probation Law for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drug Traffickers and Pushers</span>. - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any person convicted for drug trafficking or pushing</span> under this Act, regardless of the penalty imposed by the Court, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot avail of the privilege granted by the Probation Law</span> or Presidential Decree No. 968, as amended."&nbsp; (underlining supplied)<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition for Probation filed by Michael Padua y Tord[e]l should be, as it is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Padua filed a motion for reconsideration of the order but the same was denied on July 28, 2004. He filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the Court of Appeals assailing the order, but the Court of Appeals, in a Decision dated April 19, 2005, dismissed his petition.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit and ordered <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Padua filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals decision but it was denied.&nbsp; Hence, this petition where he raises the following issues:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE DENIAL OF THE PETITION FOR PROBATION WHICH DEPRIVED PETITIONER'S RIGHT AS A MINOR UNDER ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. [02-1-18-SC] OTHERWISE KNOWN AS [THE] RULE ON JUVENILES IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>WHETHER OR NOT [THE] ACCUSED['S] RIGHT [TO BE RELEASED UNDER RECOGNIZANCE] HAS BEEN VIOLATED OR DEPRIVED IN THE LIGHT OF R.A. 9344 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN ACT ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WELFARE SYSTEM, CREATING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WELFARE COUNCIL UNDER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND OTHER PURPOSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing public respondent, opted to adopt its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> as its Memorandum.&nbsp; In its Comment, the OSG countered that<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS HAVE LEGAL BASIS IN APPLYING SECTION 24, ARTICLE II OF R.A. 9165 INSTEAD OF SECTION 70, ARTICLE VIII OF THE SAME LAW.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>SECTION 32 OF A.M. NO. 02-1-18-SC OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE "<i>RULE ON JUVENILES IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW</i>" HAS NO APPLICATION TO THE INSTANT CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Simply, the issues are: (1) Did the Court of Appeals err in dismissing Padua's petition for certiorari<i> </i>assailing the trial court's order denying his petition for probation? (2) Was Padua's right under Rep. Act No. 9344,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the "Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006," violated? and (3) Does Section 32<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of A.M. No. 02-1-18-SC otherwise known as the "Rule on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law" have application in this case?<br><br>As to the first issue, we rule that the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Padua's petition for certiorari.<br><br>For certiorari to prosper, the following requisites must concur:&nbsp; (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>"Without jurisdiction" means that the court acted with absolute lack of authority.&nbsp; There is "excess of jurisdiction" when the court transcends its power or acts without any statutory authority.&nbsp; "Grave abuse of discretion" implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction. In other words, power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility, and such exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal either to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><b></b><br><br>A review of the orders of the RTC denying Padua's petition for probation shows that the RTC neither acted without jurisdiction nor with grave abuse of discretion because it merely applied the law and adhered to principles of statutory construction in denying Padua's petition for probation.<br><br>Padua was charged and convicted for violation of Section 5, Article II of Rep. Act No. 9165 for selling dangerous drugs.&nbsp; It is clear under Section 24 of Rep. Act No. 9165 that any person convicted of drug trafficking cannot avail of the privilege of probation, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 24.&nbsp; <i>Non-Applicability of the Probation Law for Drug Traffickers and Pushers</i>. - <b>Any person convicted for drug trafficking or pushing under this Act, regardless of the penalty imposed by the Court, cannot avail of the privilege granted by the Probation Law or Presidential Decree No. 968, as amended.</b>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The law is clear and leaves no room for interpretation.&nbsp; Any person convicted for drug trafficking or pushing, regardless of the penalty imposed, cannot avail of the privilege granted by the Probation Law or P.D. No. 968.&nbsp; The elementary rule in statutory construction is that when the words and phrases of the statute are clear and unequivocal, their meaning must be determined from the language employed and the statute must be taken to mean exactly what it says.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; If a statute is clear, plain and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation.&nbsp; This is what is known as the plain-meaning rule or <i>verba legis</i>. It is expressed in the maxim, <i>index animi sermo</i>, or speech is the index of intention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, there is the maxim <i>verba legis non est recedendum</i>, or from the words of a statute there should be no departure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals correctly pointed out that the intention of the legislators in Section 24 of Rep. Act No. 9165 is to provide stiffer and harsher punishment for those persons convicted of drug trafficking or pushing while extending a sympathetic and magnanimous hand in Section 70 to drug dependents who are found guilty of violation of Sections 11<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and 15<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the Act.&nbsp; The law considers the users and possessors of illegal drugs as victims while the drug traffickers and pushers as predators.&nbsp; Hence, while drug traffickers and pushers, like Padua, are categorically disqualified from availing the law on probation, youthful drug dependents, users and possessors alike, are given the chance to mend their ways.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also correctly stated that had it been the intention of the legislators to exempt from the application of Section 24 the drug traffickers and pushers who are minors and first time offenders, the law could have easily declared so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The law indeed appears strict and harsh against drug traffickers and drug pushers while protective of drug users.&nbsp; To illustrate, a person arrested for using illegal or dangerous drugs is meted only a penalty of six months rehabilitation in a government center, as minimum, for the first offense under Section 15 of Rep. Act No. 9165, while a person charged and convicted of selling dangerous drugs shall suffer life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) under Section 5, Rep. Act No. 9165.<br><br>As for the second and third issues, Padua cannot argue that his right under Rep. Act No. 9344, the "Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006" was violated.&nbsp; Nor can he argue that Section 32 of A.M. No. 02-1-18-SC otherwise known as the "Rule on Juveniles in Conflict with the Law" has application in this case. Section 68<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of Rep. Act No. 9344 and Section 32 of A.M. No. 02-1-18-SC both pertain to suspension of sentence and not probation.<br><br>Furthermore, suspension of sentence under Section 38<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; of Rep. Act No. 9344 could no longer be retroactively applied for petitioner's benefit. Section 38 of Rep. Act No. 9344 provides that once a child under 18 years of age is found guilty of the offense charged, instead of pronouncing the judgment of conviction, the court shall place the child in conflict with the law under suspended sentence. Section 40<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of Rep. Act No. 9344, however, provides that once the child reaches 18 years of age, the court shall determine whether to discharge the child, order execution of sentence, or extend the suspended sentence for a certain specified period <b>or until the child reaches the maximum age of 21 years</b>. Petitioner has already reached 21 years of age or over and thus, could no longer be considered a child<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> for purposes of applying Rep. Act 9344. Thus, the application of Sections 38 and 40 appears moot and academic as far as his case is concerned.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated April 19, 2005 and the Resolution dated June 14, 2005 of the Court of Appeals are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio-Morales, Tinga, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 18-24.&nbsp; Penned by Associate Justice Remedios A.
