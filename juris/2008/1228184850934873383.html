				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed before this Court is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 29, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in <i>CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00301</i> which affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kabacan, Cotabato, Branch 22, in Criminal Case No. 98-105, finding accused-appellant Rene Rosas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In the court of origin, accused-appellant was charged with the crime of Murder in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 13, 1998. The crime was alleged to have been committed, as follows:<br><blockquote>That on September 15, 1995, in the Municipality of Kabakan, Province of Cotabato, Philippines, the said accused, armed with a gun, with intent to kill did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and with treachery, attack, assault and shot NESTOR ESTACIO, thereby hitting and inflicting upon the latter multiple gunshot wounds on the different parts of his body, which caused his instantaneous death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>When arraigned on January 5, 1999, accused-appellant, assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.  Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued, in the course of which the prosecution presented the testimonies of Dr. Crisostomo Necessario, Jr., Municipal Health Officer of Kabacan, Cotabato; Wilfredo Bataga, mayor of Kabacan, Cotabato; Antonio Palomar Bataga, Jr.; and Arceli Estacio, widow of the victim.<br><br>For its part, the defense presented accused-appellant himself and his girlfriend, Karen Nayona.<br><br>The prosecution's version of the incident is succinctly summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General in its Appellee's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>On September 15, 1995, around eleven o'clock in the morning, Antonio Palomar Bataga, Jr. was outside the billiard hall along Aglipay Street near the public terminal and market of Kabacan, Poblacion, Kabacan, Cotabato. Around 15 meters away, he saw appellant Rene Rosas standing beside the post near a store across the street. Palomar knew appellant long before, as they were both into gambling.  Thereafter, the victim, Nestor Estacio, arrived alone on board his motorcycle.  He stopped in front of the Salcedo Newsstand to buy a newspaper without switching off his motorcycle's engine.  Before he could drive off, a Weena bus, which was leaving the Bus Terminal about that time, blocked his way.  Then, appellant, who was coming from the left side behind the victim, shot the latter with a pistol at close range.  After the victim fell on the ground, more gunshots were heard, which gunshots were fired at him to make sure that he was dead.  After the shooting, appellant jumped into a motorcycle and escaped.<br><br>Meanwhile, around that same time and fifteen (15) meters away, in a <i>carinderia</i> located at the Bus Terminal in Poblacion, Kabacan, Cotabato, several gunshots were heard. Wilfredo Bataga, who was the owner of the said carinderia and also the commanding officer of the 39<sup>th</sup> Infantry Batallion assigned in Kabacan, Cotabato, immediately proceeded to where the gunshots came from.  He saw appellant about to run and a dead body being carried by four persons into a tricycle. Wilfredo upon seeing that appellant was armed with a 45-caliber pistol, ran after the latter but lost him in the crowd.<br><br>On October 27, 1995, Wilfredo was handed with a cartographic sketch of the suspect made by the National Bureau of Investigation.  He indorsed the cartographic sketch to the police of the Poblacion and reported the incident.<br><br>On August 5, 1998, around 5:30 in the afternoon, appellant was spotted a meter away in front of Wilfredo's house. Wilfredo upon seeing appellant took out his copy of the cartographic sketch and confronted appellant that it was his picture.  Appellant answered "<i>Siguro ako nga</i>." Appellant was then immediately arrested.<br><br>The post-mortem examination conducted by Dr. Crisostomo Necessario, Municipal Health Officer of  Kabacan, Cotabato revealed that the victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds in the lumbar region (lower back area), a gunshot wound in the epigastric area (upper mid-portion of the abdomen near the chest) and the mid-left portion of the hypogastric area (left abdomen).  Thereafter, Dr. Necessario issued a Medical Report attributing the victim's death to hypovolemic shock caused by gunshot wounds.<br></blockquote>On the other hand, accused-appellant's version is hinged mainly on denial and alibi. He testified that in the morning of September 15, 1995, he was at his boarding house located along USM Avenue, Kabacan, Cotabato.  The following day, he went home to Mintal Relocation in Davao City and came back to Kabacan, Cotabato on August 5, 1998.  On that day, while accused-appellant was in a public market, a certain Dodong Rivera approached and informed him that he should talk to Mayor Wilfredo Bataga because a group of men was out to kill him.  So, accused-appellant proceeded to the house of Mayor Bataga who showed him a cartographic sketch.  When accused-appellant was asked if it was him on the sketch, he replied, "<i>Siguro, ako nga</i>."  He was then taken to the Kabacan Police Station where he was detained.<br><br>Karen Nayona, accused-appellant's girlfriend, merely corroborated his testimony that he was in the boarding house at USM Avenue, Kabacan, Cotabato in the morning of September 15, 1995.  Then, at around 11 o'clock in the morning, they met and went to a fastfood restaurant located along USM Avenue. There, she told accused-appellant that she was two months pregnant with his baby.<br><br>In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 1, 2001, the trial court rendered its decision convicting accused-appellant of the crime of murder, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing and finding the accused Rene Rosas alias Boy Rosal guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified by treachery, judgment is hereby rendered sentencing the accused with penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of Nestor Estacio the sum of P50,000.00 for his death, P40,000.00 for funeral and burial expenses and P50,000.00 for moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>Pursuant to Section 3(c) of Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> accused-appellant appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court <i>via</i> a notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On February 4, 2002, this Court accepted the appeal and docketed the same as G.R. No. 148879.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On September 22, 2004, conformably with our pronouncement in <i>People v. Mateo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><i> </i>which modified the provisions of the Rules of Court insofar as they provide for direct appeals from the RTC to this Court in cases where the penalty imposed by the trial court is death, <i>reclusion perpetua </i>or life imprisonment, this Court resolved to refer the case to the Court of Appeals, whereat it was docketed as <i>CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00301, </i>for appropriate action and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i></i><br><br>In its decision dated November 29, 2006, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction of accused-appellant. The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed decision is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, with modification that the award for actual damages is <b>DELETED</b> for reasons already discussed; in lieu thereof, an award of temperate damages in the amount of Twenty Five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>From the Court of Appeals, the case was then elevated to this Court upon filing by accused-appellant of a notice of appeal on January 2, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  In its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of July 23, 2007, the Court resolved to require both parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire.  The parties, however, opted not to file supplemental briefs and manifested that they were merely adopting their briefs filed before the appellate court.<br><br>In this appeal, accused-appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF MURDER WHEN THE LATTER'S GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT WITH MURDER WHEN THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY WAS NOT ALLEGED WITH SPECIFICITY IN THE INFROMATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8, RULE 110 OF THE REVISED RULES ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant insists that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  He assails the credibility of the prosecution witnesses whose testimonies he pictured as inconsistent and fabricated.  He also avers that the prosecution failed to establish his identity as the perpetrator of the crime as nobody actually saw him shoot the victim.<br><br>After a careful consideration of the evidence of this case, we find no reason to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the RTC decision in Criminal Case No. 98-105.<br><br>Accused-appellant cites an inconsistency in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Wilfredo Bataga and Antonio Palomar Bataga, Jr.  While Wilfredo testified that he saw accused-appellant about to run from the crime scene after the shooting, Antonio, on the other hand, testified that accused-appellant jumped into a motorcycle and escaped after the incident. According to accused-appellant, their contradicting testimonies should not be accorded any weight and credence.<br><br>To our mind, the alleged inconsistency in the testimonies of the aforesaid prosecution witnesses is not sufficient to adversely affect the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.  It merely pertains to accused-appellant's mode of escape, which cannot overcome the categorical and positive identification of accused-appellant by both witnesses as the person who shot the victim.  It is perfectly natural for different witnesses testifying on the occurrence of a crime to give varying details as there may be some details which one witness may notice while the other may not observe or remember.  In fact, jurisprudence even warns against a perfect dovetailing of narration by different witnesses as it could mean that their testimonies were fabricated and rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  In the instant case, while prosecution witnesses Antonio and Wilfredo differ in their narration of minor details, they identified without equivocation the accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime. Antonio declared on the witness stand:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

Just like Antonio, Wilfredo could also not have been mistaken as to accused-appellant's identity considering that he was just 15 meters away from the crime scene and the crime was committed in broad daylight.<br><br>Verily, the testimonies of Wilfredo and Antonio on material details are coherent, unequivocal and consistent with each other.  Antonio, who was standing just a few meters away, saw accused-appellant shoot the victim from behind, then board a motorcycle.  On the other hand, Wilfredo saw accused-appellant immediately after the shooting fleeing from the scene of the crime carrying a 45-caliber pistol.  Clearly, both witnesses personally saw accused-appellant at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed. Contrary to accused-appellant's assertion, the declarations and testimonies of Antonio and Wilfredo established beyond reasonable doubt his identity as the author of the crime.<br><br>The trial court gave full faith and credence to the testimonies of Wilfredo and Antonio.  The time-tested doctrine is that a trial court's assessment of the credibility of a witness is entitled to great weight, and is even conclusive and binding on this Court.  The reason is obvious.  The trial court has the unique opportunity to observe at firsthand the witnesses, particularly their demeanor, conduct and attitude in the course of the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant has not shown any evidence of improper motive on the part of Wilfredo and Antonio that would have driven them to falsely testify against him. Where there is nothing to indicate that the witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by improper motive, their positive and categorical declarations on the witness stand under the solemnity of an oath deserve full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>There being no fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would otherwise warrant a different conclusion, the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses must be sustained.<br><br>Accused-appellant relies on his alibi that he was in his boarding house located along USM Avenue, Kabacan, Cotabato the whole morning of September 15, 1995.  For alibi to prosper, however, the accused must establish by clear and convincing evidence (a) his presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense and (b) the physical impossibility of his presence at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  Where there is even the least chance for the accused to be present at the crime scene, the defense of alibi will not hold water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Here, the evidence shows that USM Avenue, Kabacan, Cotabato where accused-appellant allegedly was on September 15, 1995 is only 1.5 kilometers away from the public market and terminal in Poblacion, Kabacan, Cotabato where the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  According to the trial court, this distance between the crime scene and the whereabouts of accused-appellant can easily be negotiated by foot within 10 to 15 minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  In short, accused-appellant failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence the physical impossibility of his presence at the scene of the crime on the date and time of its commission.  Moreover, the defense of alibi crumbles in the face of the positive identification of accused-appellant by the aforesaid prosecution witnesses as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In his last-ditch effort to relieve him of liability for the crime charged, accused-appellant argues that he cannot be convicted of murder because the Information failed to state that treachery was a qualifying circumstance.<br><br>Accused-appellant's argument deserves scant consideration. The recent case of <i>People v. Sayaboc</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> reiterated the pronouncement in <i>People v. Aquino<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></b></i> that even after the recent amendments to the Rules of Criminal Procedure, qualifying circumstances need not be preceded by descriptive words such as "qualifying" or "qualified by" to properly qualify an offense. Section 8 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> does not require the use of such words to refer to the circumstances which raise the category of an offense.  It is not the use of the words "qualifying" or "qualified by" that raises a crime to a higher category, but the specific allegation of an attendant circumstance which adds the essential element raising the crime to a higher category.  It is sufficient that the qualifying circumstances be specified in the Information to apprise the accused of the charges against him to enable him to prepare fully for his defense, thus precluding surprises during trial.<br><br>The Information in this case sufficiently alleged the qualifying circumstance of treachery, thus:<br><blockquote>"xxx, accused armed with a gun, with intent to kill, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, and <b>with treachery</b>, attack, assault and shot Nestor Esatcio, xxx." (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Not only was treachery sufficiently alleged, it was likewise proven beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence on record.  It is a well-entrenched rule that treachery is present when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.  The essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected attack, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Nestor Estacio was attacked from behind and assaulted without warning and provocation.  Even when the already wounded Nestor fell on the ground, accused-appellant mercilessly fired several more shots at him.  He obviously wanted to ensure the execution of the killing, without risk to himself, and deprive Nestor of any opportunity to retaliate or defend himself.  The fact that accused-appellant brought a gun with him indicated that he made a deliberate and conscious adoption of the means to kill Nestor.  Further, the autopsy conducted by Dr. Necessario revealed multiple gunshot wounds at the lower back area of the lumbar region of Nestor.  This autopsy indubitably indicates that the shots were fired from behind on the unsuspecting victim.  Clearly then, treachery or <i>alevosia</i> has been sufficiently established.<br><br>We, thus, sustain the conviction of Rene Rosas for the crime of murder as well as the penalty imposed upon him.  Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for the crime of murder is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Accused-appellant was correctly sentenced to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the lower of the two indivisible penalties, since there was no other aggravating circumstance attending the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>We now come to the award of damages.<br><br>Conformably with existing jurisprudence, the heirs of Rene Rosas are entitled to civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, which is mandatory and is granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Likewise, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 shall be awarded in favor of the heirs of the victim.  Moral damages are awarded despite the absence of proof of mental and emotional suffering of the victim's heirs.  As borne out by human nature and experience, a violent death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the victim's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Accused-appellant is also liable to pay exemplary damages in the sum of P25,000.00 in view of the presence of the qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>With respect to actual damages, the victim's widow, Arceli Estacio, testified that she spent a total of P40,000.00 as burial and funeral expenses but she failed to present receipts to substantiate her claim.  In <i>People v. Abrazaldo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we laid down the doctrine that where the amount of actual damages for funeral expenses cannot be determined because of the absence of receipts to prove them, temperate damages may be awarded in the amount of P25,000.00.  Thus, in lieu of actual damages, temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 must be awarded to the heirs of Rene Rosas because although the exact amount was not proved with certainty, it was reasonable to expect that they incurred expenses for the coffin and burial of the victim.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision dated November 29, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in <i>CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00301</i> is hereby <b>AFFIRMED. </b>Accused-appellant Rene Rosas is found <b>G</b><b>UIL</b><b>TY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
