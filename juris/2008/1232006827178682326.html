During the lifetime of Bulado, respondent National Housing Authority (NHA) awarded her a lot located at 942 R. Higgins St., CAA Compound, Bgy. 185, Pasay City.  The award was made pursuant to the "Land for the Landless" program of respondent.  She resided at the said property until her death.<br><br>When Bulado died, petitioner Winnie assumed the obligation to pay the monthly amortizations.   Respondent NHA recognized petitioner spouses' assumption of obligations as their names were reflected in the receipts.  They were allowed to occupy the lot up to the present.  To prove their occupancy over the lot, petitioners offered as evidence the following documents, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Tag Card No. 77-02830-03 issued by then Pasay City Mayor Pablo Cuneta and then NHA General Manager Gaudencio Tobias;<br><br></li><li>Application and Contract for Water Services No. 295319 in the name of Bulado but the same was signed by petitioner Winnie;<br><br></li><li>Tax Declaration No. B-007-27566 over the land issued by the Assessor's Office of Pasay City in the name of defendant recognizing its   beneficial use in favor of petitioners;<br><br></li><li>Tax Declaration No. B-007-27667 over the residential structure erected on the land and issued by the Assessor's Office of Pasay City in the names of petitioners;<br><br></li><li>`<i>Pagpapatunay</i>' dated September 5, 1989 signed by neighbors and acquaintances of petitioners attesting to their long time residence in the property;<br><br></li><li>Deposit Receipt No. 286444 dated September 27, 1989 issued by the Manila Electric Company attesting to the installation of electric service in the name of petitioner Winnie on the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>On September 14, 1989, petitioners completed the payments of the amortizations due on the property.  Reflected on the left side portion of the official receipt evidencing full payment is the annotation "full payment."  Consequently, petitioners demanded that respondent NHA issue in their favor a deed of sale and a title over the property.   Respondent, however, refused.<br><br>On January 28, 2003, petitioners, by counsel, sent respondent a letter to issue a deed of sale and title.  Despite receipt, respondent did not issue the requested documents.  On March 6, 2003, respondent wrote petitioners informing them that petitioner Winnie's name does not appear as beneficiary.  Petitioners replied that Winnie was representing her mother, the late Lourdes Bulado.  Respondent did not respond to the reply.<br><br>Left with no recourse, petitioners instituted a complaint for mandamus before the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br><center><b>RTC Order</b><br></center><br>On April 22, 2003, the RTC dismissed the complaint for <i>mandamus</i>, disposing thus:<br><blockquote>Considering that the petition is insufficient in form and substance, there being no reference to any law which the respondent by reason of its office, trust or station is especially enjoined as a duty to perform or any allegation that respondent is unlawfully excluding petitioners from using or enjoying any right or office which said petitioners are entitled to, the above-entitled petition is hereby DISMISSED, pursuant to Section 3 Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners moved for reconsideration but they did not succeed.    Thus, petitioners seasonably appealed to the CA.<br><br><center><b>CA Disposition</b><br></center><br>On August 23, 2004, the CA affirmed the RTC dismissal of the mandamus petition.<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED. </b> Accordingly, the assailed Order of Dismissal is <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>In agreeing with the court <i>a quo</i>, the appellate court rationalized as follows:<br><blockquote>It is essential to the issuance of the writ of mandamus that the petitioner should have a clear legal right to the thing demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required.  It is a command to exercise a power already possessed and to perform a duty already imposed.<br><br>It well settled that the legal right of petitioner to the performance of the particular act which is sought to be compelled must be clear and complete.  A clear legal right within the meaning of the rule means a right which is clearly founded in, or granted by law; a right which is inferable as a matter of law.  Likewise, mandamus refers only to acts enjoined by law  to  be  done. The duties to be enforced must be such as are clearly peremptorily enjoined by law or by reason of official station.  However, appellants failed to point out in their petition the specific law by which defendant is duty bound to perform the act sought to be performed, as well as the law which would grant them the clear legal right to the issuance of the writ of mandamus.<br><br>Foregoing discussed, we find no error on the part of the court <i>a quo</i> in dismissing the petition for mandamus filed by plaintiffs-appellants.<br></blockquote>On September 20, 2004, petitioners moved for reconsideration but it was denied by the CA on February 22, 2005.

It has a prayer and the date when it was prepared.  The signature page shows the signature and name of petitioners' counsel, the counsel's IBP, PTR and Roll of Attorney's Numbers.

It declared that there was no allegation in the petition below that respondent is unlawfully excluding petitioners from using or enjoying any right or office which said petitioners are entitled to.<br><br>Although the complaint was captioned as Mandamus, petitioners' averments, as well as the relief sought, called for an action for specific performance.  Pertinent portions of the complaint for <i>mandamus</i> provide:<br><blockquote>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plaintiff Winnie Munsalud is the daughter of the late Lourdes Bulado, and as such is one of Bulado's compulsory heirs.</span> x x x;<br><br>4. During the lifetime of Bulado, she was awarded a parcel of land at a "land for the landless" program of the defendant;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>6. When Bulado died in 1985, Plaintiffs assumed her obligations over the aforesaid property, particularly the payment of the amortizations therein;<br><br>7. <b><i>Defendant recognized this assumption of Bulado's obligations by the Plaintiffs considering that in the receipts covering the amortizations, the names of the Plaintiffs as the ones paying the Defendant were indicated therein</i></b>;<br><br>8. <b><i>In fact, Defendant also allowed Plaintiffs to move into, and occupy, as they continue to occupy up to now, the above described premises</i></b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>10. <b><i>On September 14, 1989, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plaintiffs completed the payment of the amortizations due over the property in question</span>, and this is evidenced    by an official receipt, numbered 19492, which Defendant's cashier,   Yasmin D.

One of the obligations of an awardee  is  to  pay  the  monthly amortizations.  Petitioners complied with said obligation and religiously paid the amortizations until these were fully paid.<br><br>Indeed, petitioners have complied with what is incumbent upon them under the program.  Hence, it is now the turn of respondent  to  comply with  what  is incumbent upon it.<br><br>In a letter dated February 21, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> respondent informed petitioners' counsel that per its records, the name of petitioner Winnie Munsalud does not appear as a beneficiary.  For the guidance of respondent, Winnie Munsalud is not actually a beneficiary.  The beneficiary of its program is Lourdes Bulado, her deceased mother.  This fact was made known to respondent when another letter dated March 6, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was sent by the counsel of the heirs of Lourdes Bulado.  In the same letter, respondent was informed that petitioner Winnie is representing her deceased mother, Lourdes Bulado, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>In view of the contents of that letter, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we would like to notify you that Ms. Munsalud is actually representing her deceased mother, </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Lourdes Bulado</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, who, on September 14, 1989 completed her payment for Lot 12, Block 79 of the Maricaban Estate</span>.  A copy of the receipt evidencing that completed is attached hereto as <b>Annex B </b>for your easy reference.<br><br>In view thereof, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may we reiterate our request for the issuance of the title over the aforesaid property in the name of Lourdes Bulado</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The letter was received by respondent on March 12, 2003.  On account of this second letter, respondent could have easily verified if the name of Lourdes Bulado appears as a beneficiary and awardee of its "Land for the Landless Program."  However, respondent never responded to the second letter.  This left petitioners with no recourse but to bring the action to the trial court.<br><br>Evidently, the action commenced by petitioners before the trial court, although designated as mandamus, is in reality an action to perform a specific act.  The averments of the complaint are clear.  The essential facts are sufficiently alleged as to apprise the court of the nature of the case.  The relief sought to be obtained aims to compel respondent to issue a deed of sale and the corresponding title over the property awarded to Bulado.  Thus, the Court finds the complaint sufficient in substance.<br><br><b><i>The designation or caption is not controlling, more than the allegations in the complaint, for it is not even an indispensable part of the complaint</i></b>.<br><br>Instead of focusing on what an action for mandamus should contain, the court <i>a quo</i> should have proceeded to examine the essential facts alleged in  petitioners'  complaint.  For what determines the nature of the action and which court has jurisdiction over it are the allegations  in  the  complaint and the character of the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The cause of action in a complaint is not determined by the designation given to it by the parties.  The  allegations  in  the  body  of the complaint define or describe it.  The designation or caption is not controlling more than the allegations in the complaint. It is not even an indispensable part of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>There is no need to make reference to any law which respondent by reason of its office is enjoined as a duty to perform.  Respondent's duty arose from its contractual obligation under the "Land for the Landless Program."<br><br>The trial  court  is reminded  that  the caption of the complaint is not determinative of the nature of the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The caption of the pleading should not be the governing factor, but rather the allegations  in  it  should determine the nature of the action, because  even  without the  prayer  for a specific remedy, the courts may nevertheless grant the proper relief as may be warranted by the facts alleged in the complaint and the evidence introduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>All told, whether or not petitioner Winnie, in her capacity as a compulsory heir of the awardee, becomes a beneficiary of the program is a question best ventilated during trial on the merits.  The conditions, terms, and provisions of the program in case an awardee dies are evidentiary and should be presented for determination of the court.  Even the effect and the consequence of the assumption of obligation of the awardee as well as the presence of other compulsory heirs are issues that should be addressed for the court's evaluation on the basis of the evidence to be laid down before its eyes.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appealed Decision is <b>REVERSED  AND  SET ASIDE</b>.
