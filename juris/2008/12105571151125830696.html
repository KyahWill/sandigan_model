				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Nicanor del Mundo (del Mundo) was the owner of two adjacent lots, Lot No. 9-B-1 and Lot No. 9-B-2, located at Sunrise Drive, Magdalena Subdivision, Quezon City.<br><br>In early 1981, del Mundo's nephew-herein petitioner Abner Anchinges (Abner) and Abner's wife co-petitioner Estrella Anchinges (Estrella) bought 150 square meters of Lot No. 9-B-1 via a deed of conditional sale.  The spouses constructed a two-unit duplex residential house on that portion of Lot No. 9-B-1 which they bought and on a portion of Lot No. 9-B-2, with del Mundo's permission.  The second unit of the duplex was intended to be occupied in the old age of Natividad Anchinges (Natividad) and Juanito Anchinges Sr. - the parents of Abner and respondents Lorna Albarillo (Lorna) and Lenida Anchinges (Lenida).<br><br>In 1983, respondent spouses Lorna and Fermin Albarillo bought Lot No. 9-B-2 and thereafter moved, along with Lenida, to the second unit of the duplex.<br><br>Disagreements later arose between petitioners and respondents over the expenses incurred in the construction of the duplex, culminating in petitioners' filing of an ejectment case against respondents, docketed as Civil Case No. 4132, before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City.<br><br>During the pendency of the ejectment case, respondent spouses vacated the second unit of the duplex.  Lenida remained, however.<br><br>Branch 32 of the Quezon City MeTC later dismissed the ejectment case, without prejudice to petitioners' right to file another action on their money claims against respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioner-spouses thereafter filed on March 8, 1993 a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against respondents for sum of money with damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City,  alleging that their uncle del Mundo allowed them to construct the second unit of the duplex on Lot No. 9-B-2 on the understanding that it would ultimately be given to Natividad after they shall have recovered the cost of construction thereof from the rentals paid by third party lessees;  respondents, however, without their knowledge, moved into the second unit of the duplex which was then 95% complete; because of family ties, they (petitioners) eventually acquiesced to respondents' occupation of the second unit;  and in September 1990, after del Mundo executed a Deed of Absolute Sale of a portion of Lot No. 9-B-1 in petitioners' favor, they proposed to respondents an arrangement on payment of rentals on the second unit until they (petitioners) recover the total amount they spent for its construction but respondents did not agree thereto.<br><br>Petitioners thus prayed for judgment<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>Ordering defendants jointly and severally to pay the plaintiffs the amount of One Hundred Sixty Thousand Pesos (P160,000.00), representing the total expenses incurred by plaintiffs for the construction of the duplex unit occupied by the defendants, plus reasonable interest thereon;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants, in the event that they choose not to lay further claim on the said duplex unit in question, to pay the plaintiffs as follows:<br><br>(a) In the case of the defendants Albarillos, the sum of P74,000.00;<br><br>(b) In the case of the defendant Lenida Anchinges, the sum of P86,000.00, or the total rentals over the duplex unit reckoned at P4,000.00 per month up to the time she vacates the premises thereof, with interest;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants Albarillos to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P96,000.00 as actual damages incurred by plaintiffs in the prosecution of Civil Case No. 4132 in the Municipal [<i>sic</i>] Trial Court;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs attorney's fees in the amount of P30,000.00, plus all other litigation expenses in the present case, including counsel's appearance fees in court, as may be proved in the course [of] trial;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiffs moral and exemplary damages in such amounts as this Honorable Court may deem reasonable;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to pay the costs of suit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>and for other reliefs as may be just and equitable.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Respondents, denying petitioners' claim that the second unit was 95% complete when they moved in, claimed that only the roofing, posts, and rough walling were installed by petitioners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with Natividad providing cash <br> in the amount of P120,000 and construction materials worth P30,000; when Natividad was unable to provide additional funds, she asked respondent spouses to finish the construction which they did, after which, with the permission of Natividad, they moved therein on August 9, 1983;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and during their occupancy of the second unit, petitioners demanded the reimbursement of P40,000 which they already did.<br><br>Branch 77 of the Quezon City RTC decided the case in petitioners' favor, disposing as follows:<br><br>PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>ordering defendants jointly and severally to pay plaintiffs the amount of P160,000.00 representing the total expenses incurred by plaintiffs for the construction of the duplex unit occupied by the defendants;<br><br></li><li>in the event that the defendants choose not to hold on to the duplex unit in question, they are still liable to pay the plaintiffs, as follows:<br><br>(2.1) the amount of P74,000.00 in the case of the Albarillos [spouses] as rentals of the premises in question from November 1, 1990 up to May 14, 1992;<br><br>(2.2) in case of the defendant Lenida Anchinges, the amount representing the monthly rental of P4,000.00 of the premises from May 15, 1992 until she shall have vacated the premises.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>On petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the RTC awarded interests on the judgment debt, moral damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court of Appeals, finding that petitioners failed to prove their case by preponderance of evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  reversed and set aside the RTC decision and dismissed their complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for Review which imputes to the Court of Appeals the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>In holding that petitioners have no authority to build a duplex house on the site in question;<br><br></li><li>In decreeing that there is no evidence to show that it was petitioners who constructed the second unit of the duplex house;<br><br></li><li>In finding that there is no evidence to show that the second unit of the duplex house was indeed 95% complete;

The RTC's conclusion that respondents "admitted [in the ejectment case] their obligation to refund the expenses incurred by [herein petitioners] for completing 95% of the construction" is thus incorrect.<br><br>Petitioners' Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2," the two-page "Bill of Materials and Cost Estimates of One (1) Unit Residential Bldg. for Mr. and Mrs. Abner Anchinges,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> does not indicate which unit of the duplex the same referred to.
