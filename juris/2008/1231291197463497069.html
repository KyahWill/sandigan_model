The Manila RTC granted the NNC's petition and issued a Stay Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  on April 1, 2004. The said Order reads:<br><blockquote>Petitioner Negros Navigation Co., Inc. filed a Petition alleging that it is a domestic corporation with principal place of business at Pier 2, North Harbor, Tondo, Manila; that since its incorporation, it had been very viable and financially profitable; that because of the Asian Currency Crisis and the devaluation of the Peso, it found itself in difficulty in paying its obligations with creditors; that as a consequence, petitioner foresees its inability to meet its obligations as they fall due; that since the obligations would not be met, complications and problems will arise that will impair and affect the operation of the corporation and its effort to rehabilitate its business; that one of its creditors, Tsuneishi Heavy Industries, Inc., already attached one shipping vessel of the corporation; and other creditors are threatening to sue; but despite the foregoing, petitioner still foresee the prospect of paying its debts if only given a "breathing spell."  Hence, it is presenting a Rehabilitation Plan for approval of its creditors as well as this Court.<br><br>Finding the Petition, together with its annexes, sufficient in form and substance, the Court hereby:<br><ol type="1"><li>Appoints Mr. Sulficio O.

The first was an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  admitting the amended complaint as a matter of right since NNC had not yet filed a responsive pleading when the same was filed. The second was an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> for the arrest of the vessels of NNC in the <i>in rem </i>aspect of  the case. The <i>fallo</i> of the Order reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the sheriff, or other proper officers of this court and such other person(s) as they may deputize, is/are hereby directed to arrest and detain the following vessels: M/V San Sebastian, M/S Princess of Negros, M/V Nossa Senhora de Fatima (Nuestra Senora de Fatima), M/V St. Peter the Apostle, M/V Sta. Ana and M/V San Paolo. The Philippine Ports Authority, the Philippine Coast Guard, the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), the Philippine National Police, the National Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies and all other government agencies and instrumentalities are hereby ordered to assist.  Assistance shall include but not be limited to preventing the vessel from sailing or trading except as this admiralty court shall direct.  Keep the vessels in custody until further order of this court, sitting as an admiralty court.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>On April 12, 2004, NNC's Rehabilitation Receiver filed with the Manila RTC a Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for the clarification of the stay order. It sought to confirm whether the claim sought to be enforced by THI against the vessels of NNC is covered by the stay order. On the same date, the Manila RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> addressing the said motion. The pertinent portion of the Order reads:<br><blockquote>The Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation does not distinguish the kind of claims covered, whether in rem or in personam, due or not due. Hence, when the law does not distinguish, courts ought not to distinguish.  So the stay order applies to all CLAIMS.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>On April 13, 2004, NNC filed a Motion to Suspend Proceedings and to Lift the Writ of Attachment and Arrest Orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  before the Cebu RTC by virtue of the April 12, 2004 Order of the Manila RTC. However, on April 29, 2004, the CA issued the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  assailed in what is before this Court as G.R. No. 163156, wherein the appellate court temporarily restrained the implementation of the Orders of the Manila RTC dated April 1, 2004 and April 12, 2004. The pertinent portion of the assailed Resolution reads:<br><blockquote>To preserve the <i>status quo </i>and so as not to render ineffectual and nugatory the judgment that will be rendered in this petition, a temporary restraining order valid for sixty (60) days is issued enjoining respondents and all persons acting for them and on their behalf or third persons from enforcing or implementing the Orders dated April 1, 2004 and April 12, 2004 of the public respondent.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>From this CA Resolution, NNC sought recourse before us.  On May 4, 2004, this Court in G.R. No. 163156 issued a Temporary Restraining Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, YOU, RESPONDENTS are REQUIRED to file comment on the petition within ten (10) days from notice, and RESTRAINED from implementing the Court of Appeals resolution dated 29 April 2004, which issued a temporary restraining order in CA-GR SP No. 83526 entitled "Tsuneishi Heavy Industries (CEBU), Inc. vs. Hon. Artemio S. Tipon, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Manila, Br. 46, Negros Navigation Co., Inc. and Sulficio O. Tagud, Jr." enjoining the implementation of the Orders dated 1 April 2004 and 12 April 2004 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Br. 46 in SP Proc. No. 04-109532, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, and YOU, PETITIONER, are ordered to POST a BOND in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P500,000.00) in cash or surety issued by a reputable bonding company of indubitable solvency with terms and conditions acceptable to this Court within five (5) days from notice hereof, otherwise this temporary restraining order shall be rendered of no force and effect.<br></blockquote>On October 6, 2004, the CA issued the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  assailed in what is now G.R. No. 166845, denying the petition of THI that sought to annul and enjoin the enforcement and implementation of the Orders of the Manila RTC dated April 1, 2004 and April 12, 2004. The <i>fallo</i> of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is <b>DENIED DUE COURSE</b> and is <b>DISMISSED </b>for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>THI filed a motion for reconsideration. The same was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated January 24, 2005. Hence, this petition in G.R. No. 166845.<br><center><br><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br>NNC, in G.R. No. 163156, presented the sole issue of whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the Resolution dated April 29, 2004 embodying the temporary restraining order which enjoined the implementation of the Orders of the Manila RTC dated April 1, 2004 and April 12, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, THI, in G.R. No. 166845, assigned the following errors in the decision and resolution of the CA:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>The CA Decision erred in ruling that neither THI's enforcement/the efficacy of its maritime liens against the Vessels nor the Admiralty Court's jurisdiction over those liens is impaired by the Stay Orders issued by the Manila RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br></li><li>The CA Decision, it is respectfully submitted, gravely erred    in ruling that THI's maritime liens are covered by, and are  subject     to the Manila RTC's jurisdiction in, [NNC's] rehabilitation     proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><center><b><i>The Ruling of the Court</i></b><br></center><br><b>In G.R. No. 163156</b><br><br>The issue presented by NNC in G.R. No. 163156 was rendered moot and academic by the promulgation of the CA Decision and Resolution dated October 6, 2004 and January 24, 2005, respectively. We find it unnecessary to discuss it extensively because the arguments presented by NNC and THI in support of their respective positions are, ultimately, the very same issues we now resolve in G.R. No. 166845.<br><br><b>In G.R. No. 166845</b><br><br>On the first issue, THI maintains that its maritime liens against the vessels of NNC were impaired by the issuance of the stay order. THI argues that the issuance of the stay order by the Manila RTC, acting as rehabilitation court, was erroneous considering that maritime liens cannot be enforced, divested, and otherwise affected or dealt with except by an admiralty court in an admiralty proceeding <i>in rem</i>. THI cited various foreign jurisprudence to the effect that maritime liens are enforceable only by a suit <i>in rem</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It further averred that the mere suspension of the <i>in rem</i> proceedings in the admiralty case prejudiced its substantive rights under Presidential Decree (PD) 1521.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The argument of THI is misplaced. There is no conflict as to which law should apply to the case at bench. THI wishes to impress this Court that its claim for repairman's lien is a maritime lien and, accordingly, may be enforced only in a proceeding <i>in rem.</i> The Court agrees that PD 1521 is the governing law concerning its maritime lien for the services it rendered to NNC. However, when NNC filed a petition for corporate rehabilitation and suspension of payments, and the Manila RTC found that the petition was sufficient in form and in substance and appointed the rehabilitation receiver, the admiralty proceeding was appropriately suspended in accordance with Section 6 of the Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Rehabilitation contemplates continuance of corporate life and activities in an effort to restore and reinstate the corporation to its former position of successful operation and solvency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  The purpose of rehabilitation proceedings is precisely to enable the company to gain a new lease on life and thereby allow creditors to be paid their claims from its earnings. The rehabilitation of a financially distressed corporation benefits its employees, creditors, stockholders and, in a larger sense, the general public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The governing law concerning rehabilitation and suspension of actions for claims against corporations is PD 902-A, as amended. Republic Act No. 8799 (RA 8799), otherwise known as The Securities Regulation Code, amended Section 5 of PD 902-A, thereby transferring to the Regional Trial Courts the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over cases, among others, involving petitions of corporations, partnerships or associations to be declared in the state of suspension of payments where the corporation, partnership or association possesses property to cover all its debts but foresees the impossibility of meeting them when they respectively fall due, or where the corporation, partnership or association has no sufficient assets to cover its liabilities, but is under the management of a rehabilitation receiver or a management committee.<br><br>The Court adopted the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation on December 15, 2000, and these rules apply to petitions for rehabilitation filed by corporations, partnerships, and associations pursuant to PD 902-A.<br><br>PD 902-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> mandates that upon appointment of a management committee, rehabilitation receiver, board or body, all actions for claims against corporations, partnerships or associations under management or receivership pending before any court, tribunal, board or body shall be suspended. PD 902-A does not make any distinction as to what claims are covered by the suspension of actions for claims against corporations under rehabilitation. No exception is made therein in favor of maritime claims. Thus, since the law does not make any exemptions or distinctions, neither should we. <i>Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemos.</i><br><br>The justification for the suspension of actions or claims, without distinction, pending rehabilitation proceedings is to enable the management committee or rehabilitation receiver to effectively exercise its/his powers free from any judicial or extra-judicial interference that might unduly hinder or prevent the "rescue" of the debtor company. To allow such other actions to continue would only add to the burden of the management committee or rehabilitation receiver, whose time, effort and resources would be wasted in defending claims against the corporation instead of being directed toward its restructuring and rehabilitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It is undisputed that THI holds a preferred maritime lien over NNC's assets by virtue of THI's unpaid services. The issuance of the stay order by the rehabilitation court does not impair or in any way diminish THI's preferred status as a creditor of NNC. The enforcement of its claim through court action was merely suspended to give way to the speedy and effective rehabilitation of the distressed shipping company. Upon termination of the rehabilitation proceedings or in the event of the bankruptcy and consequent dissolution of the company, THI can still enforce its preferred claim upon NNC.<br><br>PD 902-A was designed not only to salvage an ailing corporation but also to protect the interest of investors, creditors and the general public. Section 6 (d) of PD 902-A provides: "the management committee or rehabilitation receiver, board or body shall have the power to take custody of, and control over, all the existing assets and property of such entities under management; to evaluate the existing assets and liabilities, earnings and operations of such corporations, partnerships or other associations; to determine the best way to salvage and protect the interest of the investors and creditors; to study, review and evaluate the feasibility of continuing operations and restructure and rehabilitate such entities if determined to be feasible by the [court]. It shall report and be responsible to the [court] until dissolved by order of the [court]: Provided, however, That the [court] may, on the basis of the findings and recommendation of the management committee, or rehabilitation receiver, board or body, or on its own findings, determine that the continuance in business of such corporation or entity would not be feasible or profitable nor work to the best interest of the stockholders, parties-litigants, creditors, or the general public, order the dissolution of such corporation entity and its remaining assets liquidated accordingly. The management committee or rehabilitation receiver, board or body may overrule or revoke the actions of the previous management and board of directors of the entity or entities under management notwithstanding any provision of law, articles of incorporation or by-laws to the contrary."<br><br>When a distressed company is placed under rehabilitation, the appointment of a management committee follows to avoid collusion between the previous management and creditors it might favor, to the prejudice of the other creditors. The stay order is effective on all creditors of the corporation without distinction, whether secured or unsecured. All assets of a corporation under rehabilitation receivership are held in trust for the equal benefit of all creditors to preclude one from obtaining an advantage or preference over another by the expediency of attachment, execution or otherwise. As between the creditors, the key phrase is equality in equity. Once the corporation threatened by bankruptcy is taken over by a receiver, all the creditors ought to stand on equal footing. Not any one of them should be paid ahead of the others. This is precisely the reason for suspending all pending claims against the corporation under receivership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  promulgated by the Court <i>en banc </i>before the effectivity of the Interim Rules on Corporate Rehabilitation, is still valid case law up to the present. It enumerates the guidelines in the treatment of claims involving corporations undergoing rehabilitation, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>All claims against corporations, partnerships, or associations that are pending before any court, tribunal, or board, without distinction as to whether or not a creditor is secured or unsecured, shall be suspended effective upon the appointment of a management committee, rehabilitation receiver, board, or body in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 902-A.<br><br></li><li>Secured creditors retain their preference over unsecured creditors, but enforcement of such preference is equally suspended upon the appointment of a management committee, rehabilitation receiver, board, or body. In the event that the assets of the corporation, partnership, or association are finally liquidated, however, secured and preferred credits under the applicable provisions of the Civil Code will definitely have preference over unsecured ones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>On the second issue, THI argues that the Manila RTC, in granting the stay order, divested the Cebu RTC, which is acting as an admiralty court, of its jurisdiction over the maritime case of THI. It insists that its maritime liens over the vessels of NNC must be upheld, notwithstanding NNC's rehabilitation proceedings. It stresses that in <i>in rem</i> proceedings to enforce maritime liens, the vessels alone may be impleaded as defendants. The vessels themselves answer for the liens, and lienholders like THI have the substantive statutory right under PD 1521 to insist on the vessels' responsibility because an action <i>in rem</i> is a proceeding against the ship itself. Furthermore, it emphasizes that a maritime lien is not affected by bankruptcy or reorganization, citing Gilmore and Black as reference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>True enough, a maritime lien is not affected by bankruptcy or reorganization. However, in the instant case, we are not dealing with bankruptcy or reorganization; rather, we are confronted with NNC's rehabilitation. If we follow the argument of THI and allow the continued enforcement of its claims against NNC, we would, in effect, violate provisions of PD 902-A. To reiterate, the rationale behind PD 902-A is to effect a feasible and viable rehabilitation of an ailing corporation.<br><br>There is no conflict between PD 1521 and PD 902-A. The Manila RTC acting as a rehabilitation court merely suspended the proceedings in the admiralty case in the Cebu RTC. It did not divest the Cebu RTC of its jurisdiction over the maritime claims of THI against NNC. The preferred maritime lien of THI can still be enforced upon the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings, or if it such be unsuccessful, upon the dissolution of the corporation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing disquisitions, judgment is rendered as follows:<br><br>(1) In G.R.
