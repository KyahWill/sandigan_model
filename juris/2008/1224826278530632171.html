The decision is now before this Court.<br><br>Through the Office of the Solicitor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> NPC makes a three-pronged challenge to the valuations submitted by the commissioners in determining the amount of just compensation.&nbsp; First, it argues that the computation of just compensation should have been based on Section 3-A(b) of R.A. No. 6395, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 938,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the governing law on eminent domain complaints for easement of right-of-way.&nbsp; Second, it impugns the rectified report of the first set of commissioners in giving weight to "Opinion Value."&nbsp; Third, it avers that the appraisal report of the second set of commissioners relied on hearsay evidence, consisting of the opinion of the barangay chairman and the estimate of the provincial assessor.<br><br>In sum, the NPC faults the appellate court in upholding the trial court's decision, which, according to it, is based on speculative and baseless recommendations of the commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In their comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> respondents counter that Section 3-A(b) of R.A. No. 6395, as amended, does not apply.&nbsp; They contend that the use of the lands to be expropriated is not limited to "easement of right-of-way" purposes, stressing that the nature and effect of the construction and maintenance of the San Pascual Cogeneration Associated Transmission Line Project have effectively deprived them of the ordinary use of their lands. On that basis, they justify the recommended valuation of the property, which also took into account the nature and consequential damages incurred by the affected properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The instant petition essentially brings forth two issues, one of law and the other of fact.&nbsp; The legal issue is whether NPC should be made to pay just compensation in terms of the full market value of the properties traversed by the transmission lines.&nbsp; This matter has long been decided by this Court in a plethora of cases and must now be laid to rest.<br><br>In <i>National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> involving an easement of a right-of-way over a parcel of land that would be traversed by high-powered transmission lines, the Court held that the nature and effect of the installation of power lines and the limitations on the use of the land for an indefinite period would deprive the owners of the normal use of their properties. Thus, just compensation must be based on the full market value of the affected properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; This ruling was reiterated in <i>NPC v. Bongbong</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> </i>which also pertained to the acquisition of a simple right-of-way easement for the passage of overhead transmission lines.<br><br>In the case of <i>NPC v. Purefoods</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> NPC had to acquire an easement of right-of-way over certain parcels of land in Bulacan for the construction and maintenance of the San Jose-San Manuel 500 KV Transmission Line Project.&nbsp; The Court, invoking <i>National Power Corporation v. Aguirre-Paderanga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> also sustained the affected property owner's right to recover consequential damages in addition to the market value, in cases where only a part of a certain property is expropriated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Section 3A-(b) of R.A. No. 6395, as amended, is not binding on the Court.&nbsp; It has been repeatedly emphasized that the determination of just compensation in eminent domain cases is a judicial function<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and that any valuation for just compensation laid down in the statutes may serve only as a guiding principle or one of the factors in determining just compensation but it may not substitute the court's own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at such amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the factual issue is whether the determinations of just compensation made by the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are correct.<br><br>As a general rule, the Court will not disturb the factual findings of the trial and appellate courts unless they are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The aforecited exception partly obtains in this case.<br><br>Challenged by the NPC are the reports submitted by two separate sets of commissioners. The first set of commissioners' report deals with the property of the Baguis while the second set of commissioners' report covers the properties of respondents Macaraig and Valdez.<br><br>The trial court found the appraisal valuations reasonable and fair.&nbsp; The appellate court saw no basis to disturb these valuations, thus:<br><blockquote>As can be gleaned from the Records, the lower court and the groups of Commissioners did not abuse their authority in evaluating the evidence submitted to them nor misappreciate the clear preponderance of evidence.&nbsp; The amount fixed by the court a quo is not grossly exorbitant.&nbsp; Be it reminded that the Commissioners are considered as experts, with general knowledge of the appraisal of land and the prevailing prices of land in the vicinity of the land in question so that their opinion on the valuation of the property cannot be lightly brushed aside.&nbsp; The prevailing market value of the land in the present case were clearly shown, hence, We find no ground to depart from the lower court's findings. (citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator.&nbsp; In this case, this simply means the property's fair market value at the time of the filing of the complaint, or that sum of money which a person desirous but not compelled to buy, and an owner willing but not compelled to sell, would agree on as price to be given and received therefor.&nbsp; The measure is the not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>While market value may be one of the bases of determining just compensation, the same cannot be arbitrarily arrived at without considering the factors to be appreciated in arriving at the fair market value of the property, <i>e.g.</i>, the cost of acquisition, the current value of like properties, its size, shape, location, as well as the tax declarations thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The first set of commissioners' report covering the property of respondent Baguis has a recommended valuation of P1,654.40 per square meter. NPC questions the factors considered by the commissioners in arriving at their valuation. It assails the employment of opinions which were not supported by actual sales transactions. Moreover, it also disputes the usage of the CALABARZON value in that none of the affected lots lie along the stretch of the CALABARZON road.<br><br>Incidentally, the opinion and CALABARZON values were relatively high<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>.&nbsp; However, these were only two of the many factors that were looked into by the commissioners in their valuation.&nbsp; They also considered the average sales data, zonal valuation, and loan value in coming up with a reasonable estimate of just compensation.&nbsp; The valuation was arrived at after carefully weighing in all these factors and should thus be upheld.<br><br>A different valuation treatment was accorded by the second set of commissioners to the properties of respondents Macaraig and Valdez.&nbsp; As argued by the NPC, the condition of the properties was not considered, instead the commissioners relied solely on the assessment made by the Provincial Appraisal Committee in Resolution No. 03-99 involving a property similarly situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Section 4, Rule 67 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that just compensation is to be determined as of the date of the taking or the filing of the complaint whichever came first.&nbsp; In this case, the complaint for expropriation was filed on 10 March 2000 while the trial court issued a writ of possession on 19 December 2000. Resolution No. 03-99 setting the fair market value of the property in Banaba, San Pascual, Batangas at P250.00 per square meter was issued on 2 March 1999.&nbsp; Clearly, the market value could no longer be accurate as prices might have been distorted after a year.&nbsp; Furthermore, the commissioners did not bother to explain the similarities in the nature, character or condition between the properties of respondents and the properties subject of the resolution.<br><br>Worse, the commissioners' valuation of the Valdez' property was based only on an information that a similar lot in the same subdivision was sold at P350.00.&nbsp; The source of that information was not stated.&nbsp; Being unsubstantiated, the valuation cannot support the compensation award.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 72399 is AFFIRMED insofar as it refers to the properties of the Baguis. This case is REMANDED to the trial court for the proper determination of the amount of just compensation with respect to the properties of respondents Macaraig and Valdez.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Rollo, </i>pp. 9-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>Id. at 30-35; penned by Associate Justice Jose L.
