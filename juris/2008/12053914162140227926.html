CR No. 01038<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> affirming the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Laoag City, Branch 16 in Crim.

He went with Great Ceasar Martinez, Banie Mosilet, Clinton Badinas and Tom Tejada in an owner-type jeep arriving at the place at 9:30 o’clock in the morning. As the jeep was parked near one of the cottages in the area, the victim was conversing with a (former) teacher inside a cottage about two (2) meters away, while Great Ceasar Martinez, Tom Tejada, Jay-Arr Martinez and Banie Mosilet were at the jeep. Suddenly, Roger Domingo came and shouted to Great Ceasar Martinez “You are fooling; I am from Bangued (Abra)!” The latter was allegedly mad and drunk at that instance. The victim came to pacify Roger Domingo by placing his arm over his shoulder and saying “pacencia ka ta nabartek.” The victim eventually led Domingo away. At that juncture, the accused came behind the victim and Domingo, and when near, drew a knife. Using his left hand, he stabbed the left side of the body of the victim. Immediately, the accused ran towards the mini-bus (presumably their vehicle for the field trip) eighty (80) meters away, chased by the victim, Banie Mosilet and Great Ceasar Martinez. They were not able to catch the accused though because the victim pleaded to be rushed to the hospital. Using the jeep, the victim was brought to the Laoag City General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.<br><br>According to Dr. Rodrigo Catcatan the victim sustained the following wounds: Stab wound, 3-4 centimeters, level 6-7 Intercostal Space (ICS), left. The penetration could have damaged the heart and lungs of the victim, which caused his death and the assailant could have been southwest of the victim.<br><br>The defense, on the other hand, presented a different scenario. According to the accused, they were on a field trip together with the other Criminology students of the Abra Valley College at the Fort Ilocandia Beach Resort (Calayab Beach), Brgy. Calayab, Laoag City. After hearing a lecture on Police Photography, they had a drinking session inside one of the cottages, together with Roger Domingo, Adrian Benabese and others. The victim, Great Ceasar Martinez and Jay-Arr Martinez likewise participated in the drinking session. About five together with Great Ceasar Martinez and Jay-Arr Martinez used in joining the field trip.<br><br>It was after the group finished drinking at about three to four o’clock in the afternoon that the accused heard Roger Domingo and Great Ceasar Martinez quarreling in front of the cottage. Next, he heard Great Ceasar shouted “Uncle Clinton, come here!” Clinton Badinas then appeared in front of the cottage coming from the back, and in the process picked up a bottle and broke it (by using) a post.<br><br>Afterwards, the victim chased Domingo around the jeep. The accused, seeing the circumstances unfolding, shouted for Roger to stop, to which the victim reacted by next facing the accused. At a distance of one to two (1-2) meters away from each other, the victim tried to stab the chest of the accused, reason for which the latter moved backwards in an attempt to evade the stabbing act. Unfortunately, he fell down to the ground as result. The victim allegedly continued going near the accused, stopping to stab him, to which the latter responded by wiggling and sliding back to avoid the attack. While doing so, the victim was continuously assaulting him with the broken bottle he was holding. The accused consequently threw a water pitcher hitting the breast of the victim, and likewise continued to wiggle backwards and attempted to hold a knife used in chopping ice. However, the victim still tried to stab him by going “on top of him” when accused was sitting on his buttocks and wiggled away with his two hands. The victim pushed him on his breast while holding the broken bottle and accused was leaning backward, supporting himself with his two hands. In that position, the accused was able to grasp the knife and swayed it upward with his right hand. The knife hit the area below the armpit of the victim. The accused then took this opportunity to run at the parked mini bus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court found the version of the prosecution credible thus rejecting appellant’s theory of self-defense. On May 6, 2005, the trial court rendered a Decision finding appellant guilty of murder, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, for failure of the accused to prove self-defense, complete or incomplete, and the fact that the prosecution was able to prove the qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery beyond reasonable doubt in the killing of CLINTON BADINAS, the accused CHRISTOPHER TABUELOG is hereby found GUILTY of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua will all its accessory penalties is imposed upon him.<br><br>He is also Ordered to pay the heirs of CLINTON BADINAS Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages; and One Hundred Thirteen Thousand Seven Hundred Seventy Six Pesos (P113,776.00) as actual damages being the amount agreed upon during the trial; and the Costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Decision of the trial court.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Appellant alleges that the justifying circumstance of self-defense was not properly considered in his favor; that assuming the killing was committed not in self-defense, still the courts below erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<br><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>In invoking self-defense, whether complete or incomplete, the onus probandi is shifted to the accused to prove by clear and convincing evidence all the elements of justifying circumstance, namely: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (b) the reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The accused, in cases of self-defense, must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution’s evidence since he admits the commission of the alleged criminal act. One who admits the infliction of injuries which caused the death of another has the burden of proving self-defense with sufficient and convincing evidence, for even if the evidence of the prosecution were weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the killing. Self-defense, like alibi, is a defense which can easily be concocted. If the accused’s evidence is of doubtful veracity, and it is not clear and convincing, the defense must necessarily fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We agree with the findings of the trial court as affirmed by the Court of Appeals that the defense miserably failed to establish the elements of self-defense namely: a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; b) the reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br><br>Unlawful aggression presupposes not merely a threatening or an intimidating attitude, but an actual, sudden and unexpected attack or an imminent danger thereof, which imperils one’s life or limb. It is the first and primordial element of self-defense. Without it, the justifying circumstance cannot be invoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, appellant failed to establish unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; moreover, his narration of the events was unbelievable. As correctly observed by the trial court, considering the alleged disadvantageous position of the appellant and the relentless assault from the victim, it is surprising that appellant remained unscathed. The presence of a pitcher and a knife conveniently within the reach of appellant was highly suspect and coincidental. As noted by the trial court, “the presence of a pitcher of water which the accused picked up to repel the attack of the deceased and the knife which the accused was able to grasp and swung it to the (victim) hitting him near the left armpit seems to suggest that pitchers and knives are scattered around Fort Ilocandia.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Moreover, if it were true that the victim was pursuing Roger Domingo with a broken bottle, then it is preposterous for the appellant to shout at and order Domingo, instead of the victim, to stop, thus putting Domingo’s life at risk. Further, if Domingo stopped as narrated by appellant, then it is inconceivable that he was not harmed by his alleged pursuer.<br><br>The testimony of Roger Domingo who was presented as a defense witness did not help or strengthen the defense’s theory. In fact, Domingo’s testimony was full of inconsistencies and improbabilities that it deserves no credence at all. Prosecution witness Jay-arr Martinez, as well as the appellant, testified that the stabbing incident was precipitated by an argument between Great Ceasar Martinez and Roger Domingo, to

It was inconsistent with the narration of the appellant that there was an altercation between Domingo and Great Ceasar Martinez prior to the stabbing. Appellant’s testimony that the victim was pursuing Domingo likewise contradicted Domingo’s version that he was rooted to the ground and was not moving while the victim was pursuing him.<br><br>In fine, the trial court correctly held that the defense failed to prove the element of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. There being no unlawful aggression, there is no need to discuss whether the means employed to repel the attack was reasonable or whether appellant sufficiently provoked the victim into attacking him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>However, we cannot agree with the findings of the trial court that treachery attended the commission of the crime. The trial court appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery because “the attack by the accused upon the victim was sudden and coming from behind, thus, precluding any possible way for the victim to defend himself.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Nevertheless, mere suddenness of the attack does not amount to treachery.<br><br>The only prosecution evidence on the matter was the testimony of Jay-arr Martinez that while the victim and Roger Domingo were walking, the appellant stabbed the victim from behind, thus:<br>  <br><table align="center" border="0"

It must be proved with the same quantum of evidence as the crime itself. The fact that the victim might have been unaware or helpless when he was stabbed does not constitute proof of treachery. The prosecution has the burden to prove that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself, and that the offender consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, method and forms of attack employed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In the instant case, there was no proof that appellant consciously adopted the mode of attack, hence he may only be held liable for homicide, not murder.<br><br>The penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>. There being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the maximum imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period, pursuant to Article 64, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, the range of which is from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum imposable penalty is <i>prision mayor</i> the range of which is from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years. Hence, the penalty of imprisonment that should be imposed on appellant should be 10 years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, up to 17 years and 4 months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum.<br><br>The trial court correctly awarded P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages in line with prevailing jurisprudence. However, we cannot sustain the trial court’s award for actual damages in the amount of P113,776.00. While the victim’s mother, Marqueza Badinas, testified on the civil aspect of the case, she only presented a list of expenses without submitting the corresponding receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The trial court awarded the same noting that it was “agreed upon during trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This is not allowed. The award of actual damages is proper only if the actual amount of loss was proven with a reasonable degree of certainty. It should be supported by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, actual or compensatory damages cannot be awarded.<br><br>Current jurisprudence, however, allows the grant of P25,000.00 as temperate damages when it appears that the heirs of the victim suffered pecuniary loss but the award thereof cannot be established with certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
