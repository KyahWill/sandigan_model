<center>The Facts <br><br></center></b>Petitioner is engaged in the export business operating under the name Wilderness Trading. Respondent is a domestic banking corporation organized under Philippine laws. <br><br>The case arose out of a business transaction for the sale of dried sea cucumber for export to South Korea between Wilderness Trading, as seller, and Goldwell Trading of Pusan, South Korea, as buyer. To facilitate payment of the products, Goldwell Trading opened a letter of credit in favor of Wilderness Trading in the amount of US$87,500.00 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>with the Bank of Seoul, Pusan, Korea. <br><br>On November 12, 1992, petitioner applied for credit accommodation with respondent bank for pre-shipment financing. The credit accommodation was granted. Petitioner was successful in his first two export transactions both drawn on the letter of credit. The third export shipment, however, yielded a different result. <br><br>On February 22, 1993, petitioner submitted to respondent the necessary documents for his third shipment. Wanting to be paid the value of the shipment in advance, petitioner negotiated for a documentary sight draft to be drawn on the letter of credit, chargeable to the account of Bank of Seoul. The sight draft represented the value of the shipment in the amount of US$59,640.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4] <br><br></sup>As a condition for the issuance of the sight draft, petitioner executed a letter of undertaking in favor of respondent. Under the terms of the letter of undertaking, petitioner promised that the draft will be accepted and paid by Bank of Seoul according to its tenor. Petitioner also held himself liable if the sight draft was not accepted. The letter of undertaking provided:

Respondent then sent all the documents pertinent to the export transaction to the Bank of Seoul. Respondent failed to collect on the sight draft as it was dishonored by non-acceptance by the Bank of Seoul. The reasons given for the dishonor were late shipment, forged inspection certificate, and absence of countersignature of the negotiating bank on the inspection certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Goldwell Trading likewise issued a stop payment order on the sight draft because most of the bags of dried sea cucumber exported by petitioner contained soil. Due to the dishonor of the sight draft and the stop payment order, respondent demanded restitution of the sum advanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7] </sup>Petitioner failed to heed the demand. On June 3, 1993, respondent filed a complaint for recovery of sum of money<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</span></sup> with the RTC in Cebu City. In his answer, petitioner alleged that his liability under the sight draft was extinguished when respondent failed to protest its non-acceptance, as required under the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL). He also alleged that the letter of undertaking is not binding because it is a superfluous document, and that he did not violate any of the provisions of the letter of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><b><center><br>RTC and CA Dispositions <br><br></center></b>On September 25, 1996, the RTC rendered judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in favor of respondent with the following fallo:

<blockquote>This court is not convinced with the defendant’s argument that because of plaintiff’s failure to protest the dishonor of the sight draft, his liability is extinguished because <i>his liability remains under the letter of undertaking which he signed and without which plaintiff would not have advanced or credited to him the amount.</i> <br><br>Section 152 of the Negotiable Instruments Law under which defendant claims extinguishment of his liability to plaintiff is not a bar to the filing of other appropriate remedies which the aggrieved party may pursue to vindicate his rights and in this instant case, plaintiff wants his right vindicated by virtue of the letter of undertaking which defendant signed. <i>By the letter of undertaking, defendant bound himself to pay on demand all damages including attorney’s fees which plaintiff may suffer arising by reason of or on account of negotiating the above draft</i> because of the following discrepancies or any other discrepancy or reasons whatsoever and further to pay on demand full amount of any unpaid balance with interest at the prevailing rate. <i>He should be bound to the fulfillment of what he expressly obligated himself to do and perform in the letter of undertaking</i> without which, plaintiff would not have advance (sic) and credited to him the amount in the draft. He should not enrich himself at the expense of plaintiff.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[12]</sup></font> (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote>Disagreeing, petitioner elevated the matter to the CA. On June 27, 2002, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC decision, disposing as follows: 
<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Decision is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Defendant-appellant Marlou L. Velasquez is hereby ordered to pay plaintiff-appellee Solidbank Corporation, the following: (1) the principal amount of One Million Four Hundred Ninety-Five Thousand One Hundred Fifteen and Sixteen Centavos (P1,495,115.16) plus interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum from February 22, 1993 until fully paid, (2) attorney’s fees equivalent to five percent (5%) of the total amount due, and (3) costs of the suit. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </blockquote>In ruling against petitioner, the CA opined: 
<blockquote>The fact that said draft was dishonored and not paid by the Bank of Seoul-Korea, (sic) it is incumbent upon defendant-appellant Velasquez to comply with his obligation under the Letter of Undertaking. He cannot be allowed to impugn the contract of undertaking he entered into by saying that it was a superfluous document, and therefore, not binding on him. <i>The contract of undertaking is the law between them, and must be enforced accordingly.</i> This is in accord with Article 1159 of the New Civil Code, which provides that “obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.” <i>And parties to a contract are bound to the fulfillment of what has expressly been stipulated therein, regardless of the fact that it turn (sic) out to be financially disadvantageous.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
<center><br>x x x x <br></center><br>The fact that Defendant-appellant benefited from the advance payment made by Plaintiff appellee, (sic) it is incumbent upon him to return what he received because the purpose of the advance payment was not attained and/or realized, as the sight draft was not paid accordingly, otherwise, it will result to unjust enrichment on the part of Defendant-appellant at the expense of Plaintiff- appellee, in violation of Articles 19 and 22 of the New Civil Code. The doctrine of unjust enrichment and restitution simply means that “the exercise of a right ends when the right disappears, and it disappears when it is abused, especially to the prejudice of others.”<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[15] </sup></font>(Emphasis added) </blockquote>Petitioner moved for reconsideration<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[16] </sup></font>but his motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Hence, the present recourse. <br><br>
<center><b>Issues</b> <br><br></center>Petitioner raises twin issues for Our consideration, to wit: <br>
<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE, NOT HERETOFORE DETERMINED BY THIS HONORABLE COURT, OR HAS DECIDED IT IN A WAY PROBABLY <u>NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW</u> OR WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT, IN THAT: 
<blockquote>
<center>I. <br><br></center>THE COURT OF APPEALS RULED THAT PETITIONER IS LIABLE ON THE ACCESSORY CONTRACT, THE LETTER OF UNDERTAKING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT <u>PETITIONER WAS ALREADY RELEASED FROM LIABILITY</u> UNDER THE SIGHT DRAFT, THE PRINCIPAL CONTRACT, UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS LAW AND THE CIVIL CODE. 
<center>II. <br><br></center>THE COURT OF APPEALS HELD PETITIONER LIABLE UNDER THE ACCESSORY CONTRACT, THE LETTER OF UNDERTAKING, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS <u>NO PROOF WHATSOEVER THAT PETITIONER VIOLATED EITHER THE PRINCIPAL CONTRACT, THE SIGHT DRAFT, OR EVEN THE LETTER OF UNDERTAKING</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The main issue is whether or not petitioner should be held liable to respondent under the sight draft or the letter of undertaking. There is no dispute that petitioner duly signed and executed these documents. It is likewise admitted that the sight draft was dishonored by non acceptance by the Bank of Seoul.<br><center><b><br>Our Ruling</b> <br><br></center>The petition is without merit. <br><br><i><b>Petitioner is not liable under the <br>sight draft but he is liable under <br>his letter of undertaking; liability<br>under the letter of undertaking <br>was not extinguished by non- <br>protest of the dishonor of the <br>sight draft.</b></i> <br><br>Petitioner argues that he cannot be held liable under either the sight draft or the letter of undertaking. He claims that the failure of respondent to protest the dishonor of the sight draft under Section 152 of the NIL discharged him from liability under the negotiable instrument. It is also contended that his liability under the letter of undertaking is that of a mere guarantor; that the letter of undertaking is only an accessory contract to the sight draft. Since he was discharged from liability under the sight draft, he cannot be held liable under the letter of undertaking. <br><br>For its part, respondent counters that petitioner’s liability springs from the letter of undertaking, independently of the sight draft. It would not have advanced the amount without the letter of undertaking. According to respondent, the letter of undertaking is an independent agreement and not merely an accessory contract. To permit petitioner to escape liability under the letter of undertaking would result in unjust enrichment. <br><br>Petitioner’s liability under the letter of undertaking is independent from his liability under the sight draft. He may be held liable under either the sight draft or the letter of undertaking or both. <br><br>Admittedly, petitioner was discharged from liability under the sight draft when respondent failed to protest it for non-acceptance by the Bank of Seoul. A sight draft made payable outside the Philippines is a foreign bill of exchange.<sup><font color="#ff0000">[19]</font></sup> When a foreign bill is dishonored by non-acceptance or non-payment, protest is necessary to hold the drawer and indorsers liable. Verily, respondent’s failure to protest the non-acceptance of the sight draft resulted in the discharge of petitioner from liability under the instrument. Section 152 of the NIL is explicit: 
<blockquote>Section 152. <i>In what cases protest necessary. – Where a foreign bill appearing on its face to be such is dishonored by non-acceptance, it must be duly protested for non- acceptance,</i> and where such a bill which has not been previously dishonored by non- acceptance, is dishonored by non-payment,<i> it must be duly protested for non-payment. If it is not so protested, the drawer and indorsers are discharged.</i> Where a bill does not appear on its face to be a foreign bill, protest thereof in case of dishonor is unnecessary. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>Petitioner, however, can still be made liable under the letter of undertaking. It bears stressing that it is a separate contract from the sight draft. The liability of petitioner under the letter of undertaking is direct and primary. It is independent from his liability under the sight draft. Liability subsists on it even if the sight draft was dishonored for non-acceptance or non-payment. <br><br>Respondent agreed to purchase the draft and credit petitioner its value upon the undertaking that he will reimburse the amount in case the sight draft is dishonored. The bank would certainly not have agreed to grant petitioner an advance export payment were it not for the letter of undertaking. The consideration for the letter of undertaking was petitioner’s promise to pay respondent the value of the sight draft if it was dishonored for any reason by the Bank of Seoul. <br><br>We cannot accept petitioner’s thesis that he is only a mere guarantor under the letter of credit. Petitioner cannot be both the primary debtor and the guarantor of his own debt. This is inconsistent with the very purpose of a guarantee which is for the creditor to proceed against a third person if the debtor defaults in his obligation. Certainly, to accept such an argument would make a mockery of commercial transactions. <br><br>Petitioner bound himself liable to respondent under the letter of undertaking if the sight draft is not accepted. He also warranted that the sight draft is genuine; will be paid by the issuing bank in accordance with its tenor; and that he will be held liable for the full amount of the draft upon demand, without necessity of proceeding against the drawee bank.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[20]</sup></font> Petitioner breached his undertaking when the Bank of Seoul dishonored the sight draft and Goldwell Trading ordered a stop payment order on it for discrepancies in the export documents. <br><br><b><i>Petitioner is liable without need for <br>respondent to establish collateral <br>facts such as violations of the <br>letter of credit.</i></b> <br><br>It is also argued that petitioner cannot be held liable under the letter of undertaking because respondent failed to prove that he violated any of the provisions in the letter of credit or that sixty (60) of the seventy-one (71) bags shipped to Goldwell Trading contained soil instead of dried sea cucumber. <br><br>We cannot agree. Respondent need not prove that petitioner violated the provisions of the letter of credit in order to be held liable under the letter of undertaking. Parties are bound to fulfill what has been expressly stipulated in the contract.<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[21]</sup></font> Petitioner’s liability under the letter of undertaking is clear. He is liable to respondent if the sight draft is not accepted by the Bank of Seoul. Mere non-acceptance of the sight draft is sufficient for liability to attach. Here, the sight draft was dishonored for non- acceptance. The non-acceptance of the sight draft triggered petitioner’s liability under the letter of undertaking. <br><br>Records also show that the Bank of Seoul found discrepancies in the documents submitted by petitioner. Goldwell Trading issued a stop payment order because the products shipped were defective. It found that most of the bags shipped contained soil instead of dried sea cucumber. If petitioner disputes the finding of Goldwell Trading, he can file a case against said company but he cannot dispute his liability under either the sight draft or the letter of undertaking. As We see it, this is a straightforward case of collection of sum of money on the basis of a letter of undertaking. Respondent advanced the export payment to petitioner on the understanding that the draft will be honored and paid. The draft was dishonored. Justice and equity dictate that petitioner be held liable to respondent bank. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 27, 2002 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b> <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b> <br><br><br><i>Austria-Martinez, (acting chairperson), Tinga, Chico-Nazario,</i> and <i>Nachura., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br>
