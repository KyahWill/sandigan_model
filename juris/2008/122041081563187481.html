Please find attached a copy of his title to the said property.<br><br>Our client decided not to renew or extend any lease agreement you may have entered with the previous owner. We understand that your lease of the property is on a month-to-month basis. Hence, your lease contract ends on April 30, 2004 and will no longer be renewed. Any stay in the premises beyond the said date should not be construed as a renewal of your monthly lease, but merely by tolerance of our client. At any rate, you are hereby given notice to vacate the premises of 1682 Blumentritt St., Sta. Cruz, Manila within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this letter. Your failure to do so will compel us to institute an ejectment suit against you to enforce our clients' rights, and charge you with attorney's fees and all attendant damages that will be incurred by our client, including lost business opportunities and income.<br><br>We trust that you will see yourself clear on this matter and surrender peacefully the possession of the leased premises to our client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>As their demand went unheeded, respondents filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 16, Manila (MeTC) a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for Ejectment with Prayer for Issuance of Injunction against petitioner, praying that the latter be ordered to vacate Unit 1682 and to pay reasonable monthly rent of P25,000.00 and attorney's fees.<br><br>In her Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><sup> </sup> petitioner questioned the jurisdiction of the MeTC in view of an issue of title over Unit 1682 that she raised in a&nbsp; complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> she filed with the<sup> </sup>Regional Trial Court (RTC) to annul&nbsp; the April 1, 2004 deed of assignment for violation of Sec. 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1517 (P.D.

Within the Urban Zones legitimate tenants who have resided on the land for ten years or more who have built their homes on the land and residents who have legally occupied the lands by contract, continuously for the last ten years shall not be dispossessed of the land and shall be allowed the right of first refusal to purchase the same within a reasonable time and at reasonable prices, under terms and conditions to be determined by the Urban Zone Expropriation and Land Management Committee created by Section 8 of this Decree.<br></blockquote>She pointed out that the MeTC could not decide the complaint for ejectment without determining whether the assignment of Unit 1682 to&nbsp; respondents impinged on her preemptive rights under P.D. No. 1517; that the MeTC would also have to determine whether respondents could legally eject her despite the express prohibition against her dispossession under said law; and that, therefore, as the issues of possession and title could not be adjudicated separately, the case should have been brought before the RTC, not the MeTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argued that respondents had no cause of action for ejectment because they did not serve on her a valid demand to pay rent and vacate, or resort to <i>barangay</i> conciliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><sup> </sup> Petitioner was never remiss in her obligations under the monthly lease contract; and under the Rent Control Law, expiration of contract is not a valid ground for ejectment. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><sup> </sup><br><br>After the parties submitted their position papers, the MeTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated June 7, 2005, in favor of respondents, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff [respondents] and against the defendant [petitioners]:<br><ol><li>Ordering the defendant [petitioner] and all persons claiming right under her to vacate the subject premises and peacefully surrender possession of the property located at 1682 Blumentritt, Sta.

The defenses set up in an answer are not determinative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup><br><br>A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer&nbsp; if it recites that: a) initially, possession of the property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff; b) eventually, such possession&nbsp; became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession; c) thereafter, defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and d) within one year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property,&nbsp; plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><sup> </sup><br><br>The complaint for ejectment which respondents filed against petitioner alleges:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<blockquote><ol start="3"><li>Plaintiffs [respondents] are the absolute and registered owners of the land located at No. 1682 Blumentritt St., Sta. Cruz, Manila, including improvements therein xxx.<br><br>xxx<br></li></ol><ol start="5"><li>xxx The first unit, designated as 1682 Blumentritt St., Sta. Cruz, Manila xxx is presently being occupied by herein defendant [petitioner].<br><br></li><li>Defendant's [petitioner's] lease of Unit 1682 xxx with LKT,<sup>[sic] </sup> as with the others, was on a month-to-month basis. The property was transferred to plaintiffs [respondents] on April 2, 2004. Plaintiffs [respondents] have no plans to have the premises leased as they acquired the property for some other urgent business purpose in mind. Thus, plaintiffs [respondents] talked to and appealed to the occupants of the building to voluntarily vacate the premises and peacefully surrender possession thereof to plaintiffs [respondents].<br><br></li><li>However, defendant [petitioner] did not cooperate and instead stubbornly remained on the subject premises.<br><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ol><ol start="9"><li>Thus, plaintiffs [respondents], through their counsel, formally wrote to defendant Victoria Fernando [petitioner], informing the latter that her lease of the aforegmentioned premises, which is on a month-to-month basis, ended on April 30, 2004&nbsp; and will no longer be renewed. Defendant [petitioner] was also informed that if she ever continued to stay in the premises beyond April 30, 2004, it should not be construed as a renewal of whatever lease agreement defendant [petitioner] previously had with LKT.<br><br></li><li>Defendant, who duly received the letter, was given fifteen (15) days to peacefully surrender possession of the subject premises, particularly 1682 Blumentritt, St., Sta. Cruz, Manila, to herein plaintiffs.&nbsp; A copy of said letter dated April 29, 2004 is hereto attached and made an integral part hereof as "Annex C".<br><br></li><li>However, despite oral and written demands to vacate subject premises, defendant failed and refused, and still fails and refuses, without justifiable reason, to vacate the said subject premises and to peacefully surrender possession thereof to plaintiffs, to the damage and prejudice of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>In essence, the complaint recites that when respondents acquired Unit 1682 from LKTSI, petitioner was still in possession of the property by virtue of a month-to-month lease contract with LKTSI;&nbsp; that said lease contract was set to expire on April 30, 2005; that respondents verbally&nbsp; informed petitioner that her lease contract would not be renewed when it expired; and that respondents also served a written demand dated April 29, 2004 on petitioner to vacate Unit 1682, but the latter refused to do so.&nbsp; By these allegations, the complaint clearly drew up a case for unlawful detainer. It was therefore correctly filed with the MeTC which has jurisdiction over ejectment cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><sup> </sup><br><br>Petitioner, however, has raised an issue of title, to question the jurisdiction of the MeTC. She claims that respondents have no right&nbsp; to institute the action for unlawful detainer because they did not validly acquire the property in view of the prohibition under P.D. No. 1517 against her dispossession or the transfer of the property without first offering it for sale to her. She insists that&nbsp; such issue of title prevents the MeTC from acquiring jurisdiction over the case; it&nbsp; should have deferred to the jurisdiction of the RTC where there is a pending case for annulment of the title of respondents.<br><br>As a rule, the nature of a complaint for unlawful detainer and the jurisdiction of a court over it are not altered by the mere claim of the defendant of title to the property subject matter of the ejectment case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Even a pending action involving title to the property which the defendant may have instituted in another court will not abate or suspend the summary proceedings for unlawful detainer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup>The underlying reason for this rule is to prevent the defendant from trifling with the summary nature of the case by the simple expedient of asserting ownership over the disputed property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Respondents cite <i>Solanda</i><i> Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> It <sup> </sup>involves an action for ejectment&nbsp; filed by the vendee of a parcel of land against the vendor's lessees on the property. In turn, the lessees filed an action for annulment of&nbsp; the sale of the property between the vendor and vendee on the ground that the sale violated their [lessees'] preemptive rights over the property as guaranteed under P.D. No. 1517. The Court held that the action for ejectment may proceed independently of the action for annulment, citing the following reason:<br><blockquote>xxx the consistent case law is that ejectment suits deal only with the issue of physical possession. The pendency of an action for the annulment of the sale and the reconveyance of the disputed property may not be successfully pleaded in abatement of an action for ejectment. Private respondent's alleged right of possession is conditioned on his right to acquire ownership over the land. His right of the possession is, at best, only inchoate.<b><i> In any event, the private respondent's expectation of being granted the preemptive right to purchase the property neither establishes his right to possess nor justifies the dismissal of the ejectment case against him.</i></b> [Emphasis added.]<br></blockquote>It is important to bear in mind that in <i>Solanda</i>, it was conclusively found that the property in dispute was not within the coverage of P.D. No.&nbsp; 1517 as defined under Proclamation No. 1967<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; and certified to by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB).<br><br>But then, there have been two rare cases in which the Court allowed the suspension of an action for unlawful detainer to make way for an action for annulment of title.<br><br>In <i>Vda</i><i>. de Legaspi v. Avendaño</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup>the Court suspended the enforcement of a writ of demolition rendered in an ejectment case until after a case for annulment of title involving the property to be demolished was decided.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>x x x. <b><i>Where the action, therefore, is one of illegal detainer, as distinguished from one of forcible entry, and the right of the plaintiff to recover the premises is seriously placed in issue in a proper judicial proceeding</i></b>, it is more equitable and just and less productive of confusion and disturbance of physical possession, with all its concomitant inconvenience and expenses. For the Court in which the issue of legal possession, whether involving ownership or not, is brought to restrain, should a petition for preliminary injunction be filed with it, the effects of any order or decision in the unlawful detainer case in order to await the final judgment in the more substantive case involving legal possession or ownership. It is only where there has been forcible entry that as a matter of public policy the right to physical possession should be immediately set at rest in favor of the prior possession regardless of the fact that the other party might ultimately be found to have superior claim to the premises involved, thereby to discourage any attempt to recover possession thru force, strategy or stealth and without resorting to the courts. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>More in point is <i>Dulay</i><i> v. Tabago,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62] </sup>in which the Court sustained the RTC in suspending the eviction of Spouses Tabago from the property of Spouses Dulay in view of the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 2016,&nbsp; which placed the disputed property under the coverage of P.D. No. 1517&nbsp; and prohibited the eviction of&nbsp; the tenants therein.&nbsp; As there was no dispute over the status of&nbsp; Spouses Tabago as tenants on the property since 1959, or over the status of the property as an urban land reform area, the Court therein held:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2 of P.D. No. 2016, which was promulgated to forestall violations of P.D. No. 1517, provides that "No tenant or occupant family, residing for ten years or more, reckoned from the date of issuance of Presidential Decree No. 1517 [June 11, 1978] otherwise known as the Urban Land Reform Law, in land proclaimed as Areas of Priority Development . . . shall be evicted from the land or otherwise dispossessed" (emphasis added). <b><i>Considering that respondents have been occupants of the lot in question since 1959 and in view of the subsequent classification of the said land as an APD, petitioners' action for ejectment cannot prosper.</i></b><br></blockquote>To be entitled to the beneficence of P.D. No. 1517, a party must provide <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the following facts: a) that the property being leased falls within&nbsp; an Area for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform Zone;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> b) that the party is a tenant on said property as defined under Section 3 (f)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of P.D. No. 1517;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> c) that the party built a house on said property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and d) that the party has been residing on the property continuously for the last ten (10) years or more, reckoned from 1968.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The question is, did petitioner establish the foregoing requisites as to avail herself of the "suspensive" effect of P.D. No. 1517 as in <i>Sps</i><i>. Dulay</i> and <i>Vda</i><i>. de Legaspi</i>?<br><br>It is noted that the MeTC rejected the claim of petitioner to preferential rights over the property, but petitioner objected on the ground that the MeTC had no jurisdiction to resolve such subject matter.<br><br>Petitioner's objection was frivolous. Under Section 33<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of <i>Batas Pambansa Blg</i>. 129, the MeTC is conditionally vested with authority to resolve the question of ownership raised as an incident in the case, the determination of which is necessary for a complete adjudication of the issue of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In the present case, the MeTC's foray into the issue of whether under P.D. No. 1517, petitioner has preferential rights to the purchase and occupation of Unit 1682 as against respondents' rights was necessary to resolve the issue of material possession.<br><br>The <b><i>provisional</i></b> ruling of the MeTC on said issue is that P.D. No. 1517 does not apply to the case because there was no sale between LKTSI and respondents but a mere distribution of liquidating dividends on account of the dissolution of LKTSI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The share of each stockholder in the remaining assets of the corporation upon liquidation, after the payment of all corporate debts and liabilities, is what is known as liquidating dividend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; In its interpretation of recent tax laws, the&nbsp; Bureau of Internal Revenue&nbsp; viewed the distribution of liquidating dividends not as a sale of asset by the liquidating corporation to its stockholder but as <b><i>a sale of shares by the stockholder to the corporation or the surrender of the stockholder's </i></b><b><i>interest in the corporation, in place of which said stockholder receives property or money from the corporation about to be dissolved</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup>Thus, on the part of the stockholder, any gain or loss is subject to tax, while on the part of the liquidating corporation,&nbsp; no tax is imposed on its receipt of the shares surrendered by the stockholder or transfer of assets to said stockholder because said transaction is not treated as a sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><sup> </sup><br><br>Preliminarily, therefore, the Court agrees with the view of the MeTC that the April 1, 2004 assignment of Unit 1682 is not covered by the prohibition under P.D. No. 1517. It should be emphasized that such interim ruling is without prejudice to how the complaint for annulment of the April 1, 2004 deed of assignment is resolved by the RTC.<br><br>In addition to the foregoing reason, the Court also finds no <b><i>prima facie</i></b> evidence that petitioner qualifies as a tenant under P.D. No. 1517.<br><br>Respondents presented a Land Transaction Certificate issued by the HLURB, stating that Unit 1682 is outside any Area for Priority Development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><sup> </sup> However, Proclamation No. 1967 identifies in Appendix "J"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><sup>&nbsp; </sup>thereof 244 sites in Metropolitan Manila that fall within the coverage of P.D. No. 1517. In the West Sector (Manila), one&nbsp; identified site&nbsp; is&nbsp; "8. Sta. Clara to Blumentritt."&nbsp; Thus, it would appear that Unit 1682, which is located in Blumentritt Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, is within the scope of P.D. No. 1517,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><sup> </sup>the HLURB Certification to the contrary notwithstanding.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner had a month-to-month lease contract with LKTSI on Unit 1682, which expired on April 30, 2004. Thus, up to that time, petitioner was a rightful occupant of the property as defined under Sec. 3 of P.D. No. 1517.<br><br>However, other than her bare claim that she owns the structure on Unit 1682 because she allegedly rebuilt it after it was burned down, petitioner offered no concrete evidence of when the original structure was burned down and when she rebuilt it. She presented no detail on how she spent for the construction of the structure, or proof that LKTSI allowed her to claim ownership thereof. On the other hand,&nbsp; it was respondents who presented Tax Declaration No. 00182 which indicates that they are the registered owners of the improvements, including Unit 1682, on the land covered&nbsp; by TCT No. 264835.<br><br>Furthermore, except for her empty allegation -- which respondents dispute --<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> that she has been occupying Unit 1682 for more than thirty (30) years, petitioner presented no concrete evidence of the exact period of her occupation, even when she could have easily produced receipts of past rental payments similar to the receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> she easily presented for her March 2004 rental payment. Such unexplained omission prevents an adjudication on whether petitioner's period of occupation qualifies her&nbsp; to exercise the right of first refusal under P.D. No. 1517.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Therefore, unlike in <i>Sps</i><i>. Dulay</i> or <i>Guardacasa</i><i> de Legaspi</i>, there is no <i>prima facie</i> showing in this case that petitioner is protected under P.D. No. 1517 from dispossession of Unit 1682, or that she has the right of first refusal in the sale of said property.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner, therefore, cannot invoke P.D. No. 1517 in abatement of the complaint for unlawful detainer.<br><br>Another matter raised by petitioner relating to the jurisdiction of the MeTC is the personality of respondents to give notice to vacate and to file an ejectment case.&nbsp; The Court need not belabor the point for it is well-settled that, as vendees of the property, respondents were placed in the shoes of the original lessor LKTSI and vested with the right to evict petitioner as the lessee from the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp; Whether the transfer of the property to respondents was valid is of no moment, for all that is to be resolved in the ejectment case is whether the latter are entitled to the material possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>All told, the Court sustains the CA in affirming the ruling of the RTC that the MeTC correctly exercised jurisdiction over the complaint for unlawful detainer.<br><br><i>On the issue of the correctness of the judgment of eviction</i><br><br>Petitioner poses no serious challenge to the concurrent findings of the MeTC, RTC and CA that her right to possession of Unit 1682 has expired; that her continued possession thereof unlawfully deprives respondents of the enjoyment of the property; and that, therefore, she must now peacefully surrender possession thereof to respondents.&nbsp; Her remaining defense is that, under the rent control laws, respondents cannot eject her because she has been religiously paying her rent.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9161,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> otherwise known as the "Rental Reform Act of 2002," was the rent control law in force at the time the complaint for unlawful detainer was filed.&nbsp; Sec. 7(e) thereof allows for judicial ejectment of a lessee on the ground of expiration of the period of the lease contract. As already discussed, the month-to-month lease contract of petitioner expired on April 30, 2004 and was not renewed by respondents; hence, the latter acted well within their rights to file a complaint for unlawful detainer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Petitioner has also questioned the award of reasonable rent of P15,000.00. Trial courts are authorized&nbsp; to fix the reasonable value for the continued use and occupancy of the leased premises after the termination of the lease contract; and they are not bound by the stipulated rental in the contract of lease, since it is<i> </i>equally settled that upon termination or expiration of said contract, the rental stipulated therein may no longer be the reasonable value for the use and occupation of the premises as a result or by reason of the change or rise in values.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>&nbsp; As to what amount would constitute a reasonable rent of Unit 1682, the same is a question of fact&nbsp; on which the determination of the CA binds the Court, unless the latter finds reason to reverse it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the CA reduced the award of reasonable rent from P25,000.00 to P15,000.00 based on the finding that such amount represents the reasonable amount of lost opportunity income respondents would have derived from the conversion of Unit 1682 into a San Miguel Food shop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner has not adduced evidence in refutation of the factual findings of the CA.<br><br>Considering that no error has been committed by the CA in its August 31, 2006 Decision and January 15, 2007 Resolution,&nbsp; the Court affirms the same.<br><br><i>On the issue of whether the temporary restraining order should be lifted</i><br><br>The Court finds respondents' September 12, 2007 Manifestation and Motion, January 23, 2008 Reiterative Motion to Lift the Temporary Restraining Order and May 13, 2008 Manifestation to be well-taken.&nbsp; It notes petitioner's January 28, 2008 Comment and March 9, 2008 Manifestation and Compliance, and finds unsatisfactory the explanation put forth therein why she failed to deposit to the RTC unpaid monthly rentals in the amount of P10,932.60 from date of receipt of the MeTC Decision. It should be emphasized that while petitioner may have questioned before the RTC the computation of back rentals, the same cannot muddle the July 9, 2007 and March 12, 2008 Resolution of the Court which are rather explicit in the amount of unpaid monthly rentals she is required to pay. The Court further notes that petitioner utterly failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; show proof of compliance with the foregoing resolutions.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
