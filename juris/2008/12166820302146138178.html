				<BR><BR><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" align="justify">Petitioners – non-government organizations, Congresspersons, citizens and taxpayers – seek via the present petition for mandamus and prohibition to obtain from respondents the full text of the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA) including the Philippine and Japanese offers submitted during the negotiation process and all pertinent attachments and annexes thereto.<br><br>Petitioners Congressmen Lorenzo R. Tañada III and Mario Joyo Aguja filed on January 25, 2005 House Resolution No. 551 calling for an inquiry into the bilateral trade agreements then being negotiated by the Philippine government, particularly the JPEPA.  The Resolution became the basis of an inquiry subsequently conducted by the House Special Committee on Globalization (the House Committee) into the negotiations of the JPEPA.<br><br>In the course of its inquiry, the House Committee requested herein respondent Undersecretary Tomas Aquino (Usec. Aquino), Chairman of the Philippine Coordinating Committee created under Executive Order No. 213 ("Creation of A Philippine Coordinating Committee to Study the Feasibility of the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement")<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to study and negotiate the proposed JPEPA, and to furnish the Committee with a copy of the latest draft of the JPEPA.  Usec. Aquino did not heed the request, however.<br><br>Congressman Aguja later requested for the same document, but Usec. Aquino, by letter of November 2, 2005, replied that the Congressman shall be provided with a copy thereof "once the negotiations are completed and as soon as a thorough legal review of the proposed agreement has been conducted."<br><br>In a separate move, the House Committee, through Congressman Herminio G. Teves, requested Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita to furnish it with "all documents on the subject including the latest draft of the proposed agreement, the requests and offers etc."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Acting on the request, Secretary Ermita, by letter of June 23, 2005, wrote Congressman Teves as follows:<br><blockquote>In its letter dated 15 June 2005 (copy enclosed), [the] D[epartment of] F[oreign] A[ffairs] explains that <b>the Committee's request to be furnished all documents on the JPEPA may be difficult to accomplish at this time, since the proposed Agreement has been a work in progress for about three years</b>.  A copy of the draft JPEPA will however be forwarded to the Committee as soon as the text thereof is settled and complete. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Congressman Aguja also requested NEDA Director-General Romulo Neri and Tariff Commission Chairman Edgardo Abon, by letter of July 1, 2005, for copies of the latest text of the JPEPA.<br><br>Chairman Abon replied, however, by letter of July 12, 2005 that the Tariff Commission does not have a copy of the documents being requested, albeit he was certain that Usec. Aquino would provide the Congressman with a copy "once the negotiation is completed."  And by letter of July 18, 2005, NEDA Assistant Director-General Margarita R. Songco informed the Congressman that his request addressed to Director-General Neri had been forwarded to Usec. Aquino who would be "in the best position to respond" to the request.<br><br>In its third hearing conducted on August 31, 2005, the House Committee resolved to issue a subpoena for the most recent draft of the JPEPA, but the same was not pursued because by Committee Chairman Congressman Teves' information, then House Speaker Jose de Venecia had requested him to hold in abeyance the issuance of the subpoena until the President gives her consent to the disclosure of the documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Amid speculations that the JPEPA might be signed by the Philippine government within December 2005, the present petition was filed on December 9, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The agreement was to be later signed on September 9, 2006 by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in Helsinki, Finland, following which the President endorsed it to the Senate for its concurrence pursuant to Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution.  To date, the JPEPA is still being deliberated upon by the Senate.<br><br>The JPEPA, which will be the first <b>bilateral</b> free trade agreement to be entered into by the Philippines with another country in the event the Senate grants its consent to it, covers a broad range of topics which respondents enumerate as follows: trade in goods, rules of origin, customs procedures, paperless trading, trade in services, investment, intellectual property rights, government procurement, movement of natural persons, cooperation, competition policy, mutual recognition, dispute avoidance and settlement, improvement of the business environment, and general and final provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>While the final text of the JPEPA has now been made accessible to the public since September 11, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> respondents do not dispute that, at the time the petition was filed up to the filing of petitioners' Reply - when the JPEPA was still being negotiated - the initial drafts thereof were kept from public view.<br><br>Before delving on the substantive grounds relied upon by petitioners in support of the petition, the Court finds it necessary to first resolve some material procedural issues.<br><br><b><u>Standing</u></b><br><br>For a petition for mandamus such as the one at bar to be given due course, it must be instituted by a party aggrieved by the alleged inaction of any tribunal, corporation, board or person which unlawfully excludes said party from the enjoyment of a legal right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  Respondents deny that petitioners have such standing to sue.  "[I]n the interest of a speedy and definitive resolution of the substantive issues raised," however, respondents consider it sufficient to cite a portion of the ruling in <i>Pimentel v. Office of Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which emphasizes the need for a "personal stake in the outcome of the controversy" on questions of standing.<br><br>In a petition anchored upon the right of the people to information on matters of public concern, which is a public right by its very nature, petitioners need not show that they have any legal or special interest in the result, it being sufficient to show that they are citizens and, therefore, part of the general public which possesses the right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>   As the present petition is anchored on the right to information and petitioners are all suing in their capacity as citizens and groups of citizens including petitioners-members of the House of Representatives who additionally are suing in their capacity as such, the standing of petitioners to file the present suit is grounded in jurisprudence.<br><br><b><u>Mootness</u></b><br><br>Considering, however, that "[t]he principal relief petitioners are praying for is the disclosure of the contents of the JPEPA prior to its finalization between the two States parties,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> public disclosure of the text of the JPEPA after its signing by the President, during the pendency of the present petition, has been largely rendered moot and academic.<br><br>With the Senate deliberations on the JPEPA still pending, the agreement as it now stands cannot yet be considered as final and binding between the two States. Article 164 of the JPEPA itself provides that the agreement does not take effect immediately upon the signing thereof.  For it must still go through the procedures required by the laws of each country for its entry into force, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Article 164<br>Entry into Force<br></div><br>This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which the Governments of the Parties exchange diplomatic notes informing each other <b>that their respective legal procedures necessary for entry into force of this Agreement have been completed.</b> It shall remain in force unless terminated as provided for in Article 165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>President Arroyo's endorsement of the JPEPA to the Senate for concurrence is part of the legal procedures which must be met prior to the agreement's entry into force.<br><br>The text of the JPEPA having then been made accessible to the public, the petition has become moot and academic to the extent that it seeks the disclosure of the "full text" thereof.<br><br>The petition is not entirely moot, however, because petitioners seek to obtain, not merely the text of the JPEPA, but also the Philippine and Japanese<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> offers in the course of the negotiations</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>A discussion of the substantive issues, insofar as they impinge on petitioners' demand for access to the Philippine and Japanese offers, is thus in order.<br><br><b><u>Grounds relied upon by petitioners</u></b><br><br>Petitioners assert, <i>first</i>, that the refusal of the government to disclose the documents bearing on the JPEPA negotiations violates their right to information on  matters  of  public concern<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and  contravenes other constitutional provisions on transparency, such as that on the policy of full public disclosure of all transactions involving public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Second</i>, they  contend that non-disclosure of the same documents undermines their right to effective and reasonable participation in all levels of social, political, and economic decision-making.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  <i>Lastly</i>, they proffer that divulging the contents of the JPEPA only after the agreement has been concluded will effectively make the Senate into a mere rubber stamp of the Executive, in violation of the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>Significantly, the grounds relied upon by petitioners for the disclosure of the <b>latest text</b> of the JPEPA are, except for the last, the same as those cited for the disclosure of the Philippine and Japanese <b>offers</b>.<br><br>The first two grounds relied upon by petitioners which bear on the merits of respondents' claim of privilege shall be discussed.  The last, being purely speculatory given that the Senate is still deliberating on the JPEPA, shall not.<br><br><b><u>The JPEPA is a matter of public concern</u></b><br><br>To be covered by the right to information, the information sought must meet the threshold requirement that it be a matter of public concern.  <i>Apropos </i>is the teaching of <i>Legaspi</i><i> v. Civil Service Commission</i>:<br><blockquote>In determining whether or not a particular information is of public concern there is no rigid test which can be applied.  `Public concern' like `public interest' is a term that eludes exact definition.  Both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen.  In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine on a case by case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>From the nature of the JPEPA as an international trade agreement, it is evident that the Philippine and Japanese offers submitted during the negotiations towards its execution are matters of public concern.  This, respondents do not dispute.  They only claim that diplomatic negotiations are covered by the doctrine of <b>executive privilege</b>, thus constituting an exception to the right to information and the policy of full public disclosure.<br><br><b><u>Respondents' claim of privilege</u></b><br><br>It is well-established in jurisprudence that neither the right to information nor the policy of full public disclosure is absolute, there being matters which, albeit of public concern or public interest, are recognized as privileged in nature.  The types of information which may be considered privileged have been elucidated in <i>Almonte</i><i> v. Vasquez,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Chavez v. PCGG,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> Chavez v. Public Estate's Authority,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><i> </i>and most recently in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> where the Court reaffirmed the validity of the doctrine of executive privilege in this jurisdiction and dwelt on its scope.<br><br>Whether a claim of executive privilege is valid depends on the<b> </b>ground invoked to justify it and the<b> </b>context in which it is made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>   In the present case, the ground for respondents' claim of privilege is set forth in their <b>Comment</b>, <i>viz</i><i>:</i><br><blockquote>x x x The categories of information that may be considered privileged includes matters of diplomatic character and under negotiation and review.  In this case, the privileged character of the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">diplomatic negotiations </span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">has been categorically invoked and clearly explained by respondents</span> particularly respondent DTI Senior Undersecretary.<br><br>The documents on the proposed JPEPA as well as the text which is subject to negotiations and legal review by the parties fall under the exceptions to the right of access to information on matters of public concern and policy of public disclosure.  They come within the coverage of executive privilege.  At the time when the Committee was requesting for copies of such documents, the negotiations were ongoing as they are still now and the text of the proposed JPEPA is still uncertain and subject to change. Considering the status and nature of such documents then and now, these are evidently covered by executive privilege consistent with existing legal provisions and settled jurisprudence.<br><br>Practical and strategic considerations likewise counsel against the disclosure of the "rolling texts" which may undergo radical change or portions of which may be totally abandoned.  <u>Furthermore, the <b>negotiations of the representatives of the Philippines as well as of Japan must be allowed to explore alternatives in the course of the negotiations in the same manner as judicial deliberations and working drafts of opinions are accorded strict confidentiality</b></u><b>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The ground relied upon by respondents is thus not simply that the information sought involves a diplomatic matter, but that it pertains to diplomatic negotiations then in progress.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Privileged character of diplomatic negotiations</b><br><br>The privileged character of diplomatic negotiations has been recognized in this jurisdiction.  In discussing valid limitations on the right to information, the Court in <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i> held that "information on inter-government exchanges prior to the conclusion of treaties and executive agreements may be subject to reasonable safeguards for the sake of national interest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Even earlier, the same privilege was upheld in <i>People's Movement for Press Freedom (PMPF) v. Manglapus</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> wherein the Court discussed the reasons for the privilege in more precise terms.<br><br>In <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i>, the therein petitioners were seeking information from the President's representatives on the state of the then on-going negotiations of the RP-US Military Bases Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court denied the petition, stressing that "<b><u>secrecy of negotiations</u> with foreign countries is not violative </b>of the constitutional provisions of freedom of speech or of the press nor<b> of the freedom of access to information</b>."  The Resolution went on to state, thus:<br><blockquote><b>The nature of diplomacy requires centralization of authority and expedition of decision which are inherent in executive action.  <u>Another essential characteristic of diplomacy is its confidential nature.</u></b>  Although much has been said about "open" and "secret" diplomacy, with disparagement of the latter, Secretaries of State Hughes and Stimson have clearly analyzed and justified the practice.  In the words of Mr. Stimson:<br><blockquote>"<b>A complicated negotiation . . . cannot be carried through without many, many private talks and discussion, man to man; many tentative suggestions and proposals.  <u>Delegates from other countries come and tell you in confidence of their troubles at home and of their differences with other countries and with other delegates; they tell you of what they would do under certain circumstances and would not do under other circumstances. . . If these reports </u>. . . <u>should become public</u> . . . <u>who would ever trust</u> American Delegations in another conference?</b> (United States Department of State, Press Releases, June 7, 1930, pp. 282-284.)."<br></blockquote><center>x x x x<br></center><br><b>There is frequent criticism of the secrecy in which negotiation with foreign powers on nearly all subjects is concerned.  This, it is claimed, is incompatible with the substance of democracy. </b>As expressed by one writer, "It can be said that there is no more rigid system of silence anywhere in the world." (E.J. Young, Looking Behind the Censorship, J. B. Lippincott Co., 1938)  President Wilson in starting his efforts for the conclusion of the World War declared that we must have "open covenants, openly arrived at."  He quickly abandoned his thought.<br><br>No one who has studied the question believes that such a method of publicity is possible.  <b>In the moment that negotiations are started, pressure groups attempt to "muscle in."  An ill-timed speech by one of the parties or a frank declaration of the concession which are exacted or offered on both sides would quickly lead to widespread propaganda to block the negotiations.  After a treaty has been drafted and its terms are fully published, there is ample opportunity for discussion before it is approved.</b> (The New American Government and Its Works, James T. Young, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, p. 194)  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Still in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus, </i>the Court adopted the doctrine in <i>U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that the President is the sole organ of the nation in its negotiations with foreign countries, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"x x x In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation.  He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.  As Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representatives, <b>"The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations."</b> Annals, 6<sup>th</sup> Cong., col. 613. . . (Emphasis supplied; underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>Applying the principles adopted in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus,</i> it is clear that while the final text of the JPEPA may not be kept perpetually confidential - since there should be "ample opportunity for discussion before [a treaty] is approved" - the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">offers</span> exchanged by the parties during the negotiations continue to be privileged even after the JPEPA is published.  It is reasonable to conclude that the Japanese representatives submitted their offers with the understanding that "<b>historic confidentiality</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> would govern the same.  Disclosing these offers could impair the ability of the Philippines to deal not only with Japan but with other foreign governments <b>in future</b> <b>negotiations</b>.<br><br>A ruling that Philippine offers in treaty negotiations should now be open to public scrutiny would discourage future Philippine representatives from frankly expressing their views during negotiations.  While, on first impression, it appears wise to deter Philippine representatives from entering into compromises, it bears noting that treaty negotiations, or any negotiation for that matter, normally involve a process of <i>quid pro quo</i>, and <b>oftentimes negotiators have to be willing to grant concessions in an area of lesser importance in order to obtain more favorable terms in an area of greater national interest</b>.  <i>Apropos </i>are the following observations of Benjamin S. Duval, Jr.:<br><blockquote>x x x <b>[T]hose involved in the practice of negotiations appear to be in agreement that publicity leads to "grandstanding," tends to freeze negotiating positions, and inhibits the give-and-take essential to successful negotiation.</b> As Sissela Bok points out, if "negotiators have more to gain from being approved by their own sides than by making a reasoned agreement with competitors or adversaries, then they are inclined to 'play to the gallery . . .''  In fact, <b>the public reaction may leave them little option</b>. It would be a brave, or foolish, Arab leader who expressed publicly a willingness for peace with Israel that did not involve the return of the entire West Bank, or Israeli leader who stated publicly a willingness to remove Israel's existing settlements from Judea and Samaria in return for peace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Indeed, by hampering the ability of our representatives to compromise, we may be jeopardizing higher national goals for the sake of securing less critical ones.<br><br>Diplomatic negotiations, therefore, are recognized as privileged in this jurisdiction, the JPEPA negotiations constituting no exception.  It bears emphasis, however, that such privilege is only <b>presumptive</b>.  For as <i>Senate v. Ermita </i>holds, recognizing a type of information as privileged does not mean that it will be considered privileged in all instances.  Only after a consideration of the context in which the claim is made may it be determined if there is a public interest that calls for the disclosure of the desired information, strong enough to overcome its traditionally privileged status.<br><br>Whether petitioners have established the presence of such a public interest shall be discussed later.  For now, the Court shall first pass upon the arguments raised by petitioners against the application of <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> to the present case.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Arguments proffered by petitioners <i>against </i>the application of <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i></b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> Petitioners argue that<i> PMPF v. Manglapus</i> cannot be applied <i>in toto </i>to the present case, there being <u>substantial factual distinctions between the two.</u><br><br><u>To petitioners, the <i>first </i>and most fundamental distinction</u> lies in the nature of the treaty involved.  They stress that <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> involved the Military Bases Agreement which necessarily pertained to matters affecting <u>national security</u>; whereas the present case involves <u>an economic treaty</u> that seeks to regulate trade and commerce between the Philippines and Japan, matters which, unlike those covered by the Military Bases Agreement, are not so vital to national security to disallow their disclosure.<br><br>Petitioners' argument betrays a faulty assumption that information, to be considered privileged, must involve national security.  The recognition in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> that executive privilege has encompassed claims of varying kinds, such that it may even be more accurate to speak of "executive privileges," cautions against such generalization.<br><br>While there certainly are privileges grounded on the necessity of safeguarding national security such as those involving military secrets, not all are founded thereon.  One example is <b>the "informer's privilege,"</b> or the privilege of the Government not to disclose the identity of a person or persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with the enforcement of that law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  The suspect involved need not be so notorious as to be a threat to national security for this privilege to apply in any given instance.  Otherwise, the privilege would be inapplicable in all but the most high-profile cases, in which case not only would this be contrary to long-standing practice. It would also be highly prejudicial to law enforcement efforts in general.<br><br>Also illustrative is the <b>privilege accorded to presidential communications</b>, which are presumed privileged without distinguishing between those which involve matters of national security and those which do not, the rationale for the privilege being that<br><blockquote>x x x  [a] <b>frank exchange</b> of exploratory ideas and assessments, free from the glare of publicity and pressure by interested parties, is essential to protect <b>the independence of decision-making</b> of those tasked to exercise Presidential, Legislative and Judicial power. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the same way that the privilege for judicial deliberations does not depend on the nature of the case deliberated upon, so presidential communications are privileged whether they involve matters of national security.<br><br>It bears emphasis, however, that the privilege accorded to presidential communications is <b>not absolute</b>, one significant qualification being that "the Executive <b>cannot</b>, any more than the other branches of government, invoke a general confidentiality privilege to <b>shield </b>its officials and employees from investigations by the proper governmental institutions into <b>possible criminal wrongdoing</b>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  This qualification applies whether the privilege is being invoked in the context of a judicial trial or a congressional investigation conducted in aid of legislation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Closely related to the "presidential communications" privilege is the <b>deliberative process privilege </b>recognized in the United States. As discussed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  deliberative process covers documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.  Notably, the privileged status of such documents rests, <b>not on the need to protect national security</b> but, on the "obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news," the objective of the privilege being to enhance the quality of agency decisions. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b>The diplomatic negotiations privilege </b>bears a close resemblance to the deliberative process and presidential communications privilege.  It may be readily perceived that the rationale for the confidential character of diplomatic negotiations, deliberative process, and presidential communications is similar, if not identical.<br><br>The earlier discussion on <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> shows that the privilege for diplomatic negotiations is meant to encourage a frank exchange of exploratory ideas between the negotiating parties by shielding such negotiations from public view. Similar to the privilege for presidential communications, the diplomatic negotiations privilege seeks, through the same means, to protect the independence in decision-making of the President, particularly in its capacity as "the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, and its sole representative with foreign nations." And, as with the deliberative process privilege, the privilege accorded to diplomatic negotiations arises, not on account of the content of the information <i>per se</i>, but because the information is part of a process of deliberation which, in pursuit of the public interest, must be presumed confidential.<br><br>The decision of the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia in <i>Fulbright &amp; Jaworski v. Department of the Treasury</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><i> </i>enlightens on the close relation between diplomatic negotiations and deliberative process privileges.  The plaintiffs in that case sought access to notes taken by a member of the U.S. negotiating team during the U.S.-French <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> negotiations. Among the points noted therein were the issues to be discussed, positions which the French and U.S. teams took on some points, the draft language agreed on, and articles which needed to be amended. Upholding the confidentiality of those notes, Judge Green ruled, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Negotiations between two countries to draft a treaty represent a true example of a deliberative process. Much give-and-take must occur for the countries to reach an accord.</b> A description of the negotiations at any one point would not provide an onlooker a summary of the discussions which could later be relied on as law. It would not be "working law" as the points discussed and positions agreed on would be subject to change at any date until the treaty was signed by the President and ratified by the Senate.<br><br><b>The policies behind the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deliberative process privilege support non-disclosure.</span></b>  <b>Much harm could accrue to the negotiations process if these notes were revealed. </b> <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Exposure of the pre-agreement positions of the French negotiators might well offend foreign governments and would lead to less candor by the </b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">U.

S. negotiating team. Further disclosure would reveal prematurely adopted policies. If these policies should be changed, public confusion would result easily.<br><br> <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Finally, releasing these snapshot views of the negotiations would be comparable to releasing drafts of the treaty</b><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> particularly when the notes state the tentative provisions and language agreed on. As drafts of regulations typically are protected by the deliberative process privilege, </b>Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. v. Internal Revenue Service, C.A. No. 80-705 (D.C.Cir., May 21, 1982)<b>, drafts of treaties </b>should<b> be accorded the same protection.</b> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><b>Clearly, the privilege accorded to diplomatic negotiations follows as a logical consequence from the privileged character of the deliberative process</b>.<br><br>The Court is not unaware that in <i>Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), et al. v. Office of U.S. Trade      Representative</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> - where the plaintiffs sought information relating to the just-completed negotiation of a United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement - the same district court, this time under Judge Friedman, consciously refrained from applying the doctrine in <i>Fulbright</i> and ordered the disclosure of the information being sought.<br><br>Since the factual milieu in <i>CIEL</i> seemed to call for the straight application of the doctrine in <i>Fulbright</i>, a discussion of why the district court did not apply the same would help illumine this Court's own reasons for deciding the present case along the lines of <i>Fulbright</i>.<br><br>In both <i>Fulbright</i> and <i>CIEL</i>, the U.S. government cited a statutory basis for withholding information, namely, Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  In order to qualify for protection under Exemption 5, a document must satisfy two conditions: (1) it must be either <b>inter-agency or intra-agency</b> in nature, and (2) it must be both <b>pre-decisional and part of the agency's deliberative or decision-making process</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Judge Friedman, in <i>CIEL</i>, himself cognizant of a "superficial similarity of context" between the two cases, based his decision on what he perceived to be a significant distinction: he found the negotiator's notes that were sought in <i>Fulbright</i> to be "clearly internal," whereas the documents being sought in <i>CIEL</i> were those produced by or exchanged with an outside party, <i>i.e</i>. Chile.  The documents subject of <i>Fulbright </i>being clearly internal in character, the question of disclosure therein turned not on the threshold requirement of Exemption 5 that the document be inter-agency, but on whether the documents were part of the agency's pre-decisional deliberative process. On this basis, Judge Friedman found that "Judge Green's discussion [in <i>Fulbright</i>] of the harm that could result from disclosure therefore is irrelevant, <b>since</b> <b>the documents at issue [in <i>CIEL</i>] are not inter-agency, and the Court does not reach the question of deliberative process.</b>" (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>In fine, <i>Fulbright</i> was not overturned.  The court in <i>CIEL</i> merely found the same to be irrelevant in light of its distinct factual setting.  Whether this conclusion was valid - a question on which this Court would not pass - the ruling in <i>Fulbright</i> that "[n]egotiations between two countries to draft a treaty represent a true example of a deliberative process" was left standing, since the <i>CIEL</i> court explicitly stated that it did not reach the question of deliberative process.<br><br>Going back to the present case, the Court recognizes that the information sought by petitioners includes documents produced and communicated by a party external to the Philippine government, namely, the Japanese representatives in the JPEPA negotiations, and to that extent this case is closer to the factual circumstances of <i>CIEL</i> than those of <i>Fulbright</i>.<br><br>Nonetheless, for reasons which shall be discussed shortly, this Court echoes the principle articulated in <i>Fulbright</i> that the public policy underlying the deliberative process privilege requires that diplomatic negotiations should also be accorded privileged status, even if the documents subject of the present case cannot be described as purely internal in character.<br><br>It need not be stressed that in <i>CIEL</i>, the court ordered the disclosure of information based on its finding that the first requirement of FOIA Exemption 5 - that the documents be inter-agency - was not met.  In determining whether the government may validly refuse disclosure of the exchanges between the U.S. and Chile, it necessarily had to deal with this requirement, it being laid down by a statute binding on them.<br><br>In this jurisdiction, however, there is no counterpart of the FOIA, nor is there any statutory requirement similar to FOIA Exemption 5 in particular.  Hence, Philippine courts, when assessing a claim of privilege for diplomatic negotiations, are more free to focus directly on the issue of <b>whether the privilege being claimed is indeed<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> supported by public policy</span></b>, without having to consider - as the <i>CIEL</i> court did - if these negotiations fulfill a formal requirement of being "inter-agency."  Important though that requirement may be in the context of domestic negotiations, it need not be accorded the same significance when dealing with international negotiations.<br><br>There being a public policy supporting a privilege for diplomatic negotiations for the reasons explained above, the Court sees no reason to modify, much less abandon, the doctrine in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i>.<br><br>A  <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">second  </span></i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">point  petitioners  proffer  in  their attempt  to differentiate </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">PMPF v. Manglapus</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> from the present case</span> is the fact that the petitioners therein consisted entirely of members of the mass media, while petitioners in the present case include members of the House of Representatives who invoke their right to information not just as citizens but as members of Congress.<br><br>Petitioners thus conclude that the present case involves the right of members of Congress to demand information on negotiations of international trade agreements from the Executive branch, a matter which was not raised in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i>.<br><br>While indeed the petitioners in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> consisted only of members of the mass media, it would be incorrect to claim that the doctrine laid down therein has no bearing on a controversy such as the present, where the demand for information has come from members of Congress, not only from private citizens.<br><br><b>The privileged character accorded to diplomatic negotiations does not <i>ipso facto </i>lose all force and effect simply because the same privilege is now being claimed under different circumstances</b>.  The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">probability </span>of the claim succeeding in the new context might differ, but to say that the privilege, as such, has no validity at all in that context is another matter altogether.<br><br>The Court's statement in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i> that "presidential refusals to furnish information may be actuated by any of at least three distinct kinds of considerations [state secrets privilege, informer's privilege, and a generic privilege for internal deliberations], and may be asserted, <b>with differing degrees of success</b>, in the context of either judicial or legislative investigations,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> implies that a privilege, once recognized, may be invoked under different procedural settings.  That this principle holds true particularly with respect to diplomatic negotiations may be inferred from <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> itself, where the Court held that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is the President alone who negotiates treaties, and not even the Senate or the House of Representatives, unless asked, may intrude upon that process.</span><br><br>Clearly, the privilege for diplomatic negotiations may be invoked not only against citizens' demands for information, but also in the context of legislative investigations.<br><br>Hence, the recognition granted in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> to the privileged character of diplomatic negotiations cannot be considered irrelevant in resolving the present case, the contextual differences between the two cases notwithstanding.<br><br>As <i style="text-decoration: underline;">third </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and last point raised against the application of </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">PMPF v. Manglapus</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in this case</span>, petitioners proffer that "the socio-political and historical contexts of the two cases are worlds apart."  They claim that the constitutional traditions and concepts prevailing at the time <i>PMPF v. Manglapus </i>came about, particularly the school of thought that the requirements of foreign policy and the ideals of transparency were incompatible with each other or the "incompatibility hypothesis," while valid when international relations were still governed by power, politics and wars, are no longer so in this age of international cooperation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Without delving into petitioners' assertions respecting the "incompatibility hypothesis," the Court notes that the ruling in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> is grounded more on the nature of treaty negotiations as such than on a particular socio-political school of thought.   If petitioners are suggesting that the nature of treaty negotiations have so changed that "[a]n ill-timed speech by one of the parties or a frank declaration of the concession which are exacted or offered on both sides" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer</span> "lead[s] to widespread propaganda to block the negotiations," or that parties in treaty negotiations <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer</span> expect their communications to be governed by historic confidentiality, the burden is on them to substantiate the same. This petitioners failed to discharge.  <br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Whether the privilege applies only at certain stages of the negotiation process </b><br><br>Petitioners admit that "diplomatic negotiations on the JPEPA are entitled to a reasonable amount of confidentiality so as not to jeopardize the diplomatic process."  They argue, however, that the same is privileged "only at certain stages of the negotiating process, after which such information must necessarily be revealed to the public."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  They add that the duty to disclose this information was vested in the government when the negotiations moved from the formulation and exploratory stage to the firming up of definite propositions or official recommendations, citing <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  and <i>Chavez v. PEA</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The following statement in <i>Chavez v. PEA</i>, however, suffices to show that the doctrine in both that case and <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i> with regard to the duty to disclose "definite propositions of the government" does not apply to diplomatic negotiations:<br><blockquote>We rule, therefore, that the constitutional right to information includes official information on on-going negotiations<i> </i>before a final contract. <b>The information, however, must constitute definite propositions by the government and should not cover recognized exceptions like privileged information, military and diplomatic secrets and similar matters affecting national security and public order</b>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It follows from this ruling that even definite propositions of the government may not be disclosed if they fall under "recognized exceptions." The privilege for diplomatic negotiations is clearly among the recognized exceptions, for the footnote to the immediately quoted ruling cites <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> itself as an authority.<br><br><b><u>Whether there is sufficient <i>public interest</i> to overcome the claim of privilege</u></b><br><br>It being established that diplomatic negotiations enjoy a presumptive privilege against disclosure, even against the demands of members of Congress for information, the Court shall now determine whether petitioners have shown the existence of a public interest sufficient to overcome the privilege in this instance.<br><br>To clarify, there are at least two kinds of public interest that must be taken into account.  One is the presumed public interest <b>in favor of keeping the subject information confidential</b>, which is the reason for the privilege in the first place, and the other is the public interest <b>in favor of disclosure</b>, the existence of which must be shown by the party asking for information. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The criteria to be employed in determining whether there is a sufficient public interest in favor of disclosure may be gathered from cases such as <i>U.S. v.

The arguments they proffer to establish their entitlement to the subject documents fall short of this standard.<br><br>Petitioners go on to assert that the non-involvement of the Filipino people in the JPEPA negotiation process effectively results in the bargaining away of their economic and property rights without their knowledge and participation, in violation of the due process clause of the Constitution.  They claim, moreover, that it is essential for the people to have access to the initial offers exchanged during the negotiations since only through such disclosure can their constitutional right to effectively participate in decision-making be brought to life in the context of international trade agreements.<br><br>Whether it can accurately be said that the Filipino people were not involved in the JPEPA negotiations is a question of fact which this Court need not resolve. Suffice it to state that respondents had presented documents purporting to show that public consultations were conducted  on the JPEPA.

Were the Senate to concur with the validity of the JPEPA at this moment, there has already been, in the words of <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i>, "ample opportunity for discussion before [the treaty] is approved."<br><br>The text of the JPEPA having been published, petitioners have failed to convince this Court that they will not be able to meaningfully exercise their right to participate in decision-making unless the initial offers are also published.<br><br>It is of public knowledge that various non-government sectors  and private citizens have already publicly expressed their views on the JPEPA, their comments not being limited to general observations thereon but on its specific provisions.  Numerous articles and statements critical of the JPEPA have been posted on the Internet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>    Given these developments, there is no basis for petitioners' claim that access to the Philippine and Japanese offers is essential to the exercise of their right to participate in decision-making.<br><br>Petitioner-members of the House of Representatives additionally anchor their claim to have a right to the subject documents on the basis of Congress' inherent power to regulate commerce, be it domestic or international.  They allege that Congress cannot meaningfully exercise the power to regulate international trade agreements such as the JPEPA without being given copies of the initial offers exchanged during the negotiations thereof.  In the same vein, they argue that the President cannot exclude Congress from the JPEPA negotiations since whatever power and authority the President has to negotiate international trade agreements is derived only by delegation of Congress, pursuant to Article VI, Section 28(2) of the Constitution and Sections 401 and 402 of Presidential Decree No. 1464.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The subject of Article VI Section 28(2) of the Constitution is not the power to negotiate treaties and international agreements, but the power to fix tariff rates, import and export quotas, and other taxes.  Thus it provides:<br><blockquote>(2) The Congress may, by law, authorize the President to fix within specified limits, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as it may impose, tariff rates, import and export quotas, tonnage and wharfage dues, and other duties or imposts within the framework of the national development program of the Government.<br></blockquote>As to the power to negotiate treaties, the constitutional basis thereof is Section 21 of Article VII - the article on the Executive Department - which states:<br><blockquote>No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.<br></blockquote>The doctrine in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> that the treaty-making power is exclusive to the President, being the sole organ of the nation in its external relations, was echoed in <i>BAYAN v. Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>where the Court held:<br><blockquote><b style="font-weight: bold;">By </b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">constitutional fiat</span> and by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intrinsic nature of his office,</span> the President, as head of State, is the sole organ and authority in the external affairs of the country. In many ways, the President is the chief architect of the nation's foreign policy; his "dominance in the field of foreign relations is (then) conceded."  Wielding vast powers and influence, his conduct in the external affairs</span> of the nation, as Jefferson describes, is "<i>executive altogether</i>."<br><br><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As regards the power to enter into treaties or international agreements, the Constitution vests the same in the President, subject only to the concurrence of at least two thirds vote of all the members of the Senate</span>.</b> In this light, the negotiation of the VFA and the subsequent ratification of the agreement are exclusive acts which pertain solely to the President, in the lawful exercise of <b>his <i>vast executive and diplomatic powers<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> granted him no less than by the fundamental law itself. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude, and Congress itself is powerless to invade it</span></i>. </b>x x x<b> </b>(Italics in the original;  emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The same doctrine was reiterated even more recently in <i>Pimentel v.

Hence, <b>the President is vested with the authority to</b> deal with foreign states and governments, extend or withhold recognition, maintain diplomatic relations, <b>enter into treaties</b>, and otherwise transact the business of foreign relations.  <b style="text-decoration: underline;">In the realm of treaty-making, the President has the sole authority to negotiate with other states.</b><br><br><b>Nonetheless, while the President has the sole authority to negotiate and enter into treaties, the Constitution provides a limitation to his power by requiring the concurrence of 2/3 of all the members of the Senate for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">validity </span>of the treaty entered into by him</b>. x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>While the power then to fix tariff rates and other taxes clearly belongs to Congress, and is exercised by the President only by delegation of that body, it has long been recognized that the power to enter into treaties is vested directly and exclusively in the President, subject only to the concurrence of at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate for the validity of the treaty.  In this light, the authority of the President to enter into trade agreements with foreign nations provided under P.D. 1464<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> may be interpreted as an acknowledgment of a <b>power already inherent in its office</b>.  It may not be used as basis to hold the President or its representatives accountable to Congress for the conduct of treaty negotiations.<br><br>This is not to say, of course, that the President's power to enter into treaties is unlimited but for the requirement of Senate concurrence, since the  President must still ensure that all treaties will substantively conform to all the relevant provisions of the Constitution.<br><br>It follows from the above discussion that Congress, while possessing vast legislative powers, may not interfere in the field of treaty negotiations. While Article VII, Section 21 provides for Senate concurrence, such pertains only to the validity of the treaty under consideration, not to the conduct of negotiations attendant to its conclusion.  Moreover, it is not even Congress as a whole that has been given the authority to concur as a means of checking the treaty-making power of the President, but only the Senate.<br><br>Thus, as in the case of petitioners suing in their capacity as private citizens, petitioners-members of the House of Representatives fail to present a <i>"sufficient showing of need" </i>that the information sought is critical to the performance of the functions of Congress, functions that do not include treaty-negotiation.<br><br><b><u>Respondents' alleged failure to timely claim executive privilege</u></b><br><br>On respondents' invocation of executive privilege, petitioners find the same defective, not having been done seasonably as it was raised only in their Comment to the present petition and not during the House Committee hearings.<br><br>That respondents invoked the privilege for the first time only in their Comment to the present petition does not mean that the claim of privilege should not be credited.  Petitioners' position presupposes that an assertion of the privilege should have been made during the House Committee investigations, failing which respondents are deemed to have waived it.<br><br>When the House Committee and petitioner-Congressman Aguja <span style="text-decoration: underline;">requested </span>respondents for copies of the documents subject of this case, respondents replied that the negotiations were still on-going and that the draft of the JPEPA would be released once the text thereof is settled and complete.  There was no intimation that the requested copies are confidential in nature by reason of public policy. The response may not thus be deemed a claim of privilege by the standards of <i>Senate v. Ermita</i>, which recognizes as claims of privilege only those which are accompanied by <b>precise and certain reasons</b> for preserving the <b>confidentiality</b> of the information being sought.<br><br>Respondents' failure to claim the privilege during the House Committee hearings may not, however, be construed as a waiver thereof by the Executive branch. As the immediately preceding paragraph indicates, what respondents received from the House Committee and petitioner-Congressman Aguja were mere requests for information.  And as priorly stated, the House Committee itself refrained from pursuing its earlier resolution to issue a subpoena <i>duces</i><i> tecum </i>on account of   then Speaker Jose de Venecia's alleged request to Committee Chairperson Congressman Teves to hold the same in abeyance.<br><br>While it is a salutary and noble practice for Congress to refrain from issuing subpoenas to executive officials - out of respect for their office - until resort to it becomes necessary, the fact remains that such requests are not a compulsory process.

PIATCO</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> - and in other cases both before and since - should be applied:<br><blockquote><b>This Court has long and consistently adhered to the legal maxim that those that cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.</b><b> </b><i>To declare the PIATCO contracts valid despite the clear statutory prohibition against a direct government guarantee <b>would not only make a mockery of what the BOT Law seeks to prevent</b> -- which is to expose the government to the risk of incurring a monetary obligation resulting from a contract of loan between the project proponent and its lenders and to which the Government is not a party to -- <b>but would also render the BOT Law useless for what it seeks to achieve</b> -- to make use of the resources of the private sector in the "financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure and development projects" which are necessary for national growth and development but which the government, unfortunately, could ill-afford to finance at this point in time.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote> Similarly, while herein petitioners-members of the House of Representatives may not have been aiming to participate in the negotiations directly, opening the JPEPA negotiations to their scrutiny - even to the point of giving them access to the offers exchanged between the Japanese and Philippine delegations -<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> would have made a mockery of what the Constitution sought to prevent and rendered it useless for what it sought to achieve</span> when it vested the power of direct negotiation solely with the President.<br><br>What the U.S. Constitution sought to prevent and aimed to achieve in defining the treaty-making power of the President, which our Constitution similarly defines, may be gathered from Hamilton's explanation of why the U.S. Constitution excludes the House of Representatives from the treaty-making process:<br><blockquote>x x x The fluctuating, and taking its future increase into account,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the multitudinous composition of that body, forbid us to expect in it those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of such a trust.</span>  Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign politics; a steady and systematic adherence to the same views; a nice and uniform sensibility to national character, decision,<b style="text-decoration: underline;"> <i>secrecy </i> </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> dispatch</b>; are incompatible with a body so variable and so numerous.  The very complication of the business by introducing a necessity of the concurrence of so many different bodies, would of itself afford a solid objection.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The greater frequency of the calls upon the house of representatives, and the greater length of time which it would often be necessary to keep them together when convened, to obtain their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty, would be source of so great inconvenience and expense, as alone ought to condemn the project</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>These considerations <i>a fortiori </i>apply in this jurisdiction, since the Philippine Constitution, unlike that of the U.S., does not even grant <b>the Senate</b> the power <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to advise</span> the Executive in the making of treaties, but only vests in that body the power to concur in the validity of the treaty after negotiations have been concluded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  Much less, therefore, should it be inferred that the House of Representatives has this power.<br><br>Since allowing petitioner-members of the House of Representatives access to the subject JPEPA documents would set a precedent for future negotiations, leading to the contravention of the public interests articulated above which the Constitution sought to protect, the subject documents should not be disclosed.<br><br></li><li>The dissent also asserts that respondents can no longer claim the diplomatic secrets privilege over the subject JPEPA documents now that negotiations have been concluded, since their reasons for nondisclosure cited in the June 23, 2005 letter of Sec. Ermita, and later in their Comment, necessarily apply only for as long as the negotiations were still pending;<br><br>In their Comment, respondents contend that "the negotiations of the representatives of the Philippines as well as of Japan must be allowed to explore alternatives in the course of the negotiations <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the same manner as judicial deliberations and working drafts of opinions are accorded strict confidentiality</span>."  <b>That respondents liken the documents involved in the JPEPA negotiations to judicial deliberations and working drafts of opinions evinces, by itself, that they were claiming confidentiality not only until, but even after, the conclusion of the negotiations.</b><br><br>Judicial deliberations do not lose their confidential character once a decision has been promulgated by the courts.  The same holds true with respect to working drafts of opinions, which are comparable to intra-agency recommendations.  Such intra-agency recommendations are privileged even after the position under consideration by the agency has developed into a definite proposition, hence, the rule in this jurisdiction that agencies have the duty to disclose only definite propositions, and not the inter-agency and intra-agency communications during the stage when common assertions are still being formulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br></li><li>The dissent claims that petitioner-members of the House of Representatives have sufficiently shown their need for the same documents to overcome the privilege.   Again, We disagree.<br><br>The House Committee that initiated the investigations on the JPEPA did not pursue its earlier intention to subpoena the documents.  This strongly undermines the assertion that access to the same documents by the House Committee is critical to the performance of its legislative functions.  If the documents were indeed critical, the House Committee should have, at the very least, issued a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> or, like what the Senate did in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i>, filed the present petition<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> as a legislative body</span>, rather than leaving it to the discretion of individual Congressmen whether to pursue an action or not.  Such acts would have served as strong indicia that Congress itself finds the subject information to be critical to its legislative functions.<br><br>Further, given that respondents have claimed executive privilege, petitioner-members of the House of Representatives should have, at least, shown <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> its lack of access to the Philippine and Japanese offers would hinder the intelligent crafting of legislation.  <b>Mere assertion that the JPEPA covers a subject matter over which Congress has the power to legislate would not suffice</b>.  As <i>Senate Select Committee v. Nixon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> held, the showing required to overcome the presumption favoring confidentiality turns, not only on the nature and appropriateness of the function in the performance of which the material was sought,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> but also the degree to which the material was necessary to its fulfillment.</span> This petitioners failed to do.<br><br>Furthermore, from the time the final text of the JPEPA including its annexes and attachments was published, petitioner-members of the House of Representatives have been free to use it for any legislative purpose they may see fit. Since such publication, petitioners' need, if any, specifically for the Philippine and Japanese offers leading to the final version of the JPEPA, has become even less apparent.<br><br>In asserting that the balance in this instance tilts in favor of disclosing the JPEPA documents, the dissent contends that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the Executive</span> has failed to show how disclosing them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> the conclusion of negotiations would impair the performance of its functions.  The contention, with due respect, misplaces the <i>onus probandi</i>.  While, in keeping with the general presumption of transparency, the burden is initially on the Executive to provide precise and certain reasons for upholding its claim of privilege, once the Executive is able to show that the documents being sought are covered by a recognized privilege, the burden shifts to the party seeking information to overcome the privilege by a strong showing of need.<br><br>When it was thus established that the JPEPA documents are covered by the privilege for diplomatic negotiations pursuant to <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i>, the presumption arose that their disclosure would impair the performance of executive functions.  It was then incumbent on petitioner- requesting parties to show that they have a strong need for the information sufficient to overcome the privilege.  They have not, however.<br><br></li><li>Respecting the failure of the Executive Secretary to explicitly state that he is claiming the privilege "by order of the President," the same may not be strictly applied to the privilege claim subject of this case.<br><br>When the Court in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i> limited the power of invoking the privilege to the President alone, it was laying down a new rule for which there is no counterpart even in the United States from which the concept of executive privilege was adopted.  As held in the 2004 case of <i>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Justice</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> citing <i>In re Sealed Case</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"the issue of whether a President must personally invoke the [presidential communications] privilege remains an open question</span>." <i>U.S. v. Reynolds</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> on the other hand, held that "[t]here must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by the head of the department which has control over the matter,</span> after actual personal consideration by that officer."<br><br>The rule was thus laid down by this Court, not in adherence to any established precedent, but with the aim of preventing the abuse of the privilege in light of its highly exceptional nature.  The Court's recognition that the Executive Secretary also bears the power to invoke the privilege, provided he does so "by order of the President," is meant to avoid laying down too rigid a rule, the Court being aware that it was laying down a new restriction on executive privilege.  It is with the same spirit that the Court should not be overly strict with applying the same rule in this peculiar instance, where the claim of executive privilege occurred before the judgment in <i>Senate v. Ermita</i> became final.<br><br></li><li>To show that <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> may not be applied in the present case, the dissent implies that the Court therein erred in citing <i>US v. Curtiss Wright</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and the book entitled <i>The New American Government and Its Work</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> since these authorities, so the dissent claims, may not be used to calibrate the importance of the right to information in the Philippine setting.<br><br>The dissent argues that since <i>Curtiss-Wright</i> referred to a conflict between the executive and legislative branches of government, the factual setting thereof was different from that of <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> which involved a collision between governmental power over the conduct of foreign affairs and the citizen's right to information.<br><br>That the Court could freely cite <i>Curtiss-Wright</i> - a case that upholds the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations against congressional demands for information - in the course of laying down a ruling on the public right to information only serves to underscore the principle mentioned earlier that the privileged character accorded to diplomatic negotiations does not <i>ipso facto</i> lose all force and effect simply because the same privilege is now being claimed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under different circumstances.</span><br><br><i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> indeed involved a demand for information from private citizens and not an executive-legislative conflict, but so did <i>Chavez v. PEA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> which held that "the [public's] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right to information</span> . . . does not extend to matters recognized as privileged information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">under the separation of powers.</span>"  What counts as privileged information in an executive-legislative conflict is thus also recognized as such in cases involving the public's right to information.<br><br><i>Chavez v. PCGG</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> also involved the public's right to information, yet the Court recognized as a valid limitation to that right the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privileged information based on separation of powers -</span> closed-door Cabinet meetings, executive sessions of either house of Congress, and the internal deliberations of the Supreme Court.<br><br>These cases show that the Court has always regarded claims of privilege, whether in the context of an executive-legislative conflict or a citizen's demand for information, as closely intertwined, such that the principles applicable to one are also applicable to the other.<br><br>The reason is obvious.  If the validity of claims of privilege were to be assessed by entirely different criteria in each context, this may give rise to the <i>absurd result</i> where <b>Congress</b> would be denied access to a particular information because of a claim of executive privilege, but <b>the general public</b> would have access to the same information, the claim of privilege notwithstanding.<br><br><i>Absurdity </i>would be the ultimate result if, for instance, the Court adopts the "clear and present danger" test for the assessment of claims of privilege against <span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens</span>' demands for information.  If executive information, when demanded by a citizen, is privileged only when there is a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that the State has a right to prevent, it would be very difficult for the Executive to establish the validity of its claim in each instance.  In contrast, if the demand comes from Congress, the Executive merely has to show that the information is covered by a recognized privilege in order to shift the burden on Congress to present a strong showing of need.  <b>This would lead to a situation where it would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more difficult for Congress</span> to access executive information <span style="text-decoration: underline;">than it would be for private citizens.  </span></b><br><br>We maintain then that when the Executive has already shown that an information is covered by executive privilege, the party demanding the information must present a "strong showing of need," whether that party is Congress or a private citizen.<br><br>The rule that the same "showing of need" test applies in both these contexts, however, should not be construed as a denial of the importance of analyzing the context in which an executive privilege controversy may happen to be placed. Rather, it affirms it, for it means that the specific need being shown by the party seeking information in every particular instance is highly significant in determining whether to uphold a claim of privilege.  <b>This "need" is, precisely, part of the context in light of which every claim of privilege should be assessed.</b><br><br>Since, as demonstrated above, there are common principles that should be applied to executive privilege controversies across different contexts, the Court in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> did not err when it cited the <i>Curtiss</i><i>-Wright</i> case.<br><br>The claim that the book cited in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> entitled <i>The</i> <i>New American Government and Its Work</i> could not have taken into account the expanded statutory right to information in the FOIA assumes that the observations in that book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in support of the confidentiality of treaty negotiations</span> would be different had it been written after the FOIA.  Such assumption is, with due respect, at best, speculative.<br><br>As to the claim in the dissent that "[i]t is more doubtful if the same book be used to calibrate the importance of the right of access to information in the Philippine setting considering its elevation as a constitutional right," we submit that the elevation of such right as a constitutional right did not set it free from the legitimate restrictions of executive privilege which is itself <b>constitutionally-based</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>  Hence, the comments in that book which were cited in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> remain valid doctrine.<br><br></li><li>The dissent further asserts that the Court has never used "need" as a test to uphold or allow inroads into rights guaranteed under the Constitution.  With due respect, we assert otherwise.  The Court has done so before, albeit without using the term "need."<br><br>In executive privilege controversies, the requirement that parties present a "sufficient showing of need" only means, in substance, that they should show <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a public interest in favor of disclosure sufficient in degree to overcome the claim of privilege</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  Verily, the Court in such cases engages in a <b>balancing of interests</b>.  Such a balancing of interests is certainly not new in constitutional adjudication involving fundamental rights.  <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary of Justice v. Lantion,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">[78]</sup> which was cited in the dissent, applied just such a test.<br><br>Given that the dissent has clarified that it does not seek to apply the "clear and present danger" test to the present controversy, but the balancing test, there seems to be no substantial dispute between the position laid down in this <i>ponencia</i> and that reflected in the dissent as to what test to apply.  It would appear that the only disagreement is on the results of applying that test in this instance.<br><br>The dissent, nonetheless, maintains that "it suffices that information is of public concern for it to be covered by the right, regardless of the public's need for the information," and that the same would hold true even "if they simply want to know it because it interests them."  As has been stated earlier, however, there is no dispute that the information subject of this case is a matter of public concern.  The Court has earlier concluded that it is a matter of public concern, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not on the basis of any specific need shown by petitioners,</span> but from the very nature of the JPEPA as an international trade agreement.<br><br><b>However</b>, when the Executive has - as in this case - invoked the privilege, and it has been established that the subject information is indeed covered by the privilege being claimed, can a party overcome the same by merely asserting that the information being demanded is a matter of public concern, without any further showing required?  Certainly not, for that would render the doctrine of executive privilege of no force and effect whatsoever as a limitation on the right to information, because then the sole test in such controversies would be whether an information is a matter of public concern.<br><br>Moreover, in view of the earlier discussions, we must bear in mind that, by disclosing the documents of the JPEPA negotiations, the Philippine government runs the grave risk of betraying the trust reposed in it by the Japanese representatives, indeed, by the Japanese government itself.  How would the Philippine government then explain itself when that happens?  Surely, it cannot bear to say that it just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> release the information because certain persons simply wanted to know it "because it interests them."<br><br>Thus, the Court holds that, in determining whether an information is covered by the right to information, a specific "showing of need" for such information is not a relevant consideration, but only whether the same is a matter of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">public concern</span>.  When, however, the government has claimed executive privilege, and it has established that the information is indeed covered by the same, then the party demanding it, if it is to overcome the privilege, must show that that the information is vital, not simply for the satisfaction of its curiosity, but for its ability to effectively and reasonably participate in social, political, and economic decision-making.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br></li><li>The dissent maintains that "[t]he treaty has thus entered the ultimate stage where the people can exercise their <b>right to participate</b> in the discussion whether the Senate should concur in its ratification or not." (Emphasis supplied) It adds that this right "will be diluted unless the people can have access to the subject JPEPA documents".  What, to the dissent, is a dilution of the right to participate in decision-making is, to Us, simply a recognition of the qualified nature of the public's right to information.  It is beyond dispute that the right to information is not absolute and that the doctrine of executive privilege is a recognized limitation on that right.<br><br>Moreover, contrary to the submission that the right to participate in decision-making would be diluted, We reiterate that our people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been exercising</span> their right to participate in the discussion on the issue of the JPEPA, and they have been able to articulate their different opinions without need of access to the JPEPA negotiation documents.<br><br>Thus, we hold that the balance in this case tilts in favor of executive privilege.<br><br></li><li>Against our ruling that the principles applied in <i>U.S. v. Nixon</i>, the <i>Senate Select Committee</i> case, and <i>In re Sealed Case</i>, are similarly applicable to the present controversy, the dissent cites the caveat in the <i>Nixon</i> case that the U.S. Court was there addressing only the President's assertion of privilege in the context of a criminal trial, not a civil litigation nor a congressional demand for information.  What this caveat means, however, is only that courts must be careful not to hastily apply the ruling therein to other contexts.  It does not, however, absolutely mean that the principles applied in that case may never be applied in such contexts.<br></li></ol>Hence, U.S. courts have cited <i>U.S. v. Nixon</i> in support of their rulings on claims of executive privilege <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in contexts other than a criminal trial,</span> as in the case of <i>Nixon v. Administrator of General Services</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><i> </i>- which involved former President Nixon's invocation of executive privilege to challenge the constitutionality of the "Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> - and the above-mentioned <i>In re Sealed Case</i> which involved a claim of privilege against a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> issued in a grand jury investigation.<br><br>Indeed, in applying to the present case the principles found in <i>U.S. v. Nixon</i> and in the other cases already mentioned, We are merely affirming what the Chief Justice stated in his Dissenting Opinion in <i>Neri</i><i> v. Senate Committee on Accountability</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> - a case involving an executive-legislative conflict over executive privilege.  That dissenting opinion stated that, while <i>Nixon</i> was not concerned with the balance between the President's generalized interest in confidentiality and congressional demands for information, "<b>[n]onetheless the [</b><b>U.S.</b><b>] Court laid down principles and procedures that can serve as torch lights to illumine us on the scope and use of Presidential communication privilege in the case at bar.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  While the Court was divided in <i>Neri</i>, this opinion of the Chief Justice was not among the points of disagreement, and We similarly hold now that the <i>Nixon</i> case is a useful guide in the proper resolution of the present controversy, notwithstanding the difference in context.<br><br><b>Verily, while the Court should guard against the abuse of executive privilege, it should also give full recognition to the validity of the privilege whenever it is claimed within the proper bounds of executive power, as in this case.  </b>Otherwise, the Court would undermine its own credibility, for it would be perceived as no longer aiming to strike a balance, but seeking merely to water down executive privilege to the point of irrelevance.<br><br><b><u>Conclusion</u></b><br><br>To recapitulate, petitioners' demand to be furnished with a copy of the <b>full text </b>of the JPEPA has become moot and academic, it having been made accessible to the public since September 11, 2006.  As for their demand for copies of the Philippine and Japanese <b>offers</b> submitted during the JPEPA negotiations, the same must be denied, respondents' claim of executive privilege being valid.<br><br>Diplomatic negotiations have, since the Court promulgated its Resolution in <i>PMPF v. Manglapus</i> on September 13, 1988, been recognized as privileged in this jurisdiction and the reasons proffered by petitioners against the application of the ruling therein to the present case have not persuaded the Court.  Moreover, petitioners - both private citizens and members of the House of Representatives - have failed to present a <i>"sufficient showing of need" </i>to overcome the claim of privilege in this case.<br><br>That the privilege was asserted for the first time in respondents' Comment to the present petition, and not during the hearings of the House Special Committee on Globalization, is of no moment, since it cannot be interpreted as a waiver of the privilege on the part of the Executive branch.<br><br>For reasons already explained, this Decision shall not be interpreted as departing from the ruling in <i>Senate v.

In compliance, petitioners manifested that the offers have not yet been made public and reiterated their prayer that respondents be compelled to provide them with copies thereof, including all pertinent attachments and annexes thereto (Manifestation and Motion dated September 17, 2007).

Advancing by thousands of years, the early inhabitants of our land began to trade with neighboring countries. They exchanged wax, rattan, and pearls for porcelain, silk, and gold of China, Indo-China, and Malaysia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  The 16<sup>th</sup> century then ushered in the galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco.  The 1700s saw the genesis of the Filipino trading with the British, followed by the German and the French in the 1800s. The 1900s opened commerce between the Philippines and the United States of America.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Today, with the onset of globalization of the economy and the shrinking of the world through technology, a far more complicated international trade has become a matter of survival - much like gathering food and hunting 22,000 years ago - to both countries and individuals.<br><br>The growth and development envisioned by globalization are premised on the proposition that the whole world economy would expand and become more efficient if barriers and protectionist policies are eliminated.  Expansion will happen as each country opens its doors to every other producer, and more efficient producers start to compete successfully with countries that produce at higher costs because of special protections that domestic laws and regulations provide.  Smaller countries and small enterprises will then concentrate their resources where they can be most competitive.  The logic is that ultimately, the individual consumer will benefit and lower cost will stimulate consumption, thus increasing trade and the production of goods and services where it is economically advantageous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Not a few world leaders, however, have cautioned against the downside of globalization.  Pope John Paul II observed that "(g)lobalization has also worked to the detriment of the poor, tending to push poorer countries to the margin of international economic and political relations.  Many Asian nations are unable to hold their own in a global market economy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Mahatma Gandhi's words, although referring to infant industrialization, are prescient and of similar import: "The world we must strive to build needs to be based on the concept of genuine social equality...economic progress cannot mean that few people charge ahead and more and more are left behind."<br><br>The key to resolving the decisive issue in the case at bar turns on the proper framework of analysis.  The instant case involves primarily not an assessment of globalization and international trade or of the extent of executive privilege in this global arena, but a valuation of the <b>right of the individual and his representatives in Congress to participate in economic governance</b>.  Economic decisions such as forging comprehensive free trade agreements impact not only on the growth of our nation, but also on the lives of individuals, especially those who are powerless and vulnerable in the margins of society.<br><br><b>First, the facts.   </b><br><br>In 2002, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi introduced the "Initiative for Japan-ASEAN Comprehensive Economic Partnership."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo proposed the creation of a working group to study the feasibility of an economic partnership with Japan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  In October of that year, the Working Group on the Japan-Philippine Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA) was formed, consisting of representatives <br> from concerned government agencies of the Philippines and Japan.

Annals, 6th Cong., col. 613.  The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations at a very early day in our history (February 15, 1816), reported to the Senate, among other things, as follows:<br><br>`The President is the constitutional representative of the United States with regard to foreign nations. He manages our concerns with foreign nations and must necessarily be most competent to determine when, how, and upon what subjects negotiation may be urged with the greatest prospect of success. For his conduct he is responsible to the Constitution. The committee considers this responsibility the surest pledge for the faithful discharge of his duty.  They think the interference of the Senate in the direction of foreign negotiations calculated to diminish that responsibility and thereby to impair the best security for the national safety.  <b>The nature of transactions with foreign nations, moreover, requires caution and unity of design, and their success frequently depends on secrecy and dispatch.'</b> 8 U.S. Sen. Reports Comm. on Foreign Relations, p. 24.<br><br>It is important to bear in mind that <b>we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations - a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.</b>  It is quite apparent that if, in the maintenance of our international relations, embarrassment -perhaps serious embarrassment- is to be avoided and success for our aims achieved, congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry within the international field must often accord to the President a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved. Moreover, he, not Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the conditions which prevail in foreign countries, and especially is this true in time of war.  He has his confidential sources of information.  He has his agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials.  <b>Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful results.  </b>Indeed, so clearly is this true that the first President refused to accede to a request to lay before the House of Representatives the instructions, correspondence and documents relating to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty - a refusal the wisdom of which was recognized by the House itself and has never since been doubted. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>(emphasis supplied)</i><br></blockquote>In examining the validity of respondents' contention and the <i>ponencia</i>'s affirmation thereof, that the executive has sole authority in treaty negotiations, and that information pertaining to treaty negotiations is confidential, let me begin by <b>tracing respondents' and the <i>ponencia</i>'s steps back to U.S. jurisdiction </b>as they heavily rely on <b>Curtiss-Wright, </b>which was quoted in <b>PMPF v.

This grant of power to the Philippine Congress is not new in the 1987 Constitution.

He explained the rationale for adding the phrase, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The reason I am proposing this insertion is that an economic program has to be internally consistent.

Congress can legislate and conduct an inquiry in aid of legislation on this subject matter, as it did pursuant to House Resolution No. 551.  The <b>purpose of the legislative inquiry in which the subject JPEPA documents are needed is to aid legislation</b>, which is <b>different from the purpose of the negotiations conducted by the Executive, which is to conclude a treaty</b>.  Exercised within their proper limits, the power of the House of Representatives to conduct a legislative inquiry in aid of legislation and the power of the executive to negotiate a treaty should not collide with each other.<br><br>It is worth noting that petitioner members of the House of Representatives are <b>not seeking to directly participate</b> in the negotiation of the JPEPA, <b>nor are they indirectly interfering</b> with the Executive's negotiation of the JPEPA.  They seek access to the subject JPEPA documents for purposes of their inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the forging of bilateral trade and investment agreements with minimal public scrutiny and debate, as evinced in the title of <b>House Resolution No.</b> <b>551, "Directing the Special Committee on Globalization to Conduct an Urgent Inquiry in Aid of Legislation on Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreements that Government Has Been Forging, with Far Reaching Impact on People's Lives and the Constitution But with Very Little Public Scrutiny and Debate</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>  In relation to this, the <i>ponencia </i>states, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Whether it can accurately be said that the Filipino people were not involved in the JPEPA negotiations is a question of fact which this Court need not resolve.  Suffice it to state that respondents had presented documents purporting to show that public consultations were conducted on the JPEPA. Parenthetically, petitioners consider these "alleged consultations" as "woefully selective and inadequate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br></blockquote>Precisely, the inquiry in aid of legislation under House Resolution No. 551 seeks to investigate the sufficiency of public scrutiny and debate on the JPEPA, considering its expansiveness, which is well within the foreign trade power of Congress.  At this point, it is in fact impossible for petitioners to interfere with the JPEPA negotiations, whether directly or indirectly, as the negotiations have already been concluded.  Be that as it may, the earlier discussion on the allocation of international trade powers between the Executive and Congress in U.S. jurisdiction has shown that it is not anathema to the preservation of the treaty-making powers of the President for Congress to indirectly participate in trade agreement negotiations.<br><br>Let us now proceed to respondents' argument that the subject JPEPA documents are covered by the diplomatic secrets privilege and should <br> therefore be withheld from Congress.  In so proceeding, it is important to bear in mind the interdependence of the power of Congress over foreign trade and the power of the executive over treaty negotiations.<br><center><br><b>C.

In that case, petitioners sought to compel the representatives of the President in the then <b>ongoing</b> negotiations of the <b>RP-U.S. Military Bases Agreement</b> to give them access to the negotiations, to treaty items already agreed upon, and to the R.P. and U.S. positions on items that were still being contested.<br><br>In determining the applicability of the diplomatic secrets privilege to the case at bar, I <b>reiterate the primordial principle in Senate v.

I especially take note of the fact that unlike <b>PMPF v. Manglapus,</b> which involved a request for access to information <b>during negotiations</b> of a <b>military treaty</b>, the case at bar involves a request for information <b>after the conclusion of negotiations</b> of an <b>international trade agreement</b>.  Bearing this context in mind, let me now delve into the merits of the invocation of executive privilege.<br><br><b>Almonte, Chavez, Senate v. Ermita, and PMPF v.

This case involved the military secrets privilege, which can be analogized to the diplomatic secrets privilege, insofar as they are both based on the nature and the content of the information withheld.  I submit that we should follow the procedure laid down in <b>Reynolds </b>to determine whether the diplomatic secrets privilege is properly invoked, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The privilege belongs to the Government and must be asserted by it; it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party. It is not to be lightly invoked.  There must be a <b>formal claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the department</b> which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer.

As respondents further explain in their Comment, if premature disclosure is made while negotiations are ongoing, the Philippine panel and the President would be "hampered and embarrassed by criticisms or comments from persons with inadequate knowledge of the nuances of treaty negotiations or worse by publicity seekers or idle kibitzers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>Without ruling on the confidentiality of the subject JPEPA documents during negotiations (as this is no longer in issue), I submit that <b>the reasons provided by respondents for invoking the diplomatic secrets privilege while the JPEPA negotiations were ongoing no longer hold now that the negotiations have been concluded. </b> That respondents were claiming confidentiality of the subject JPEPA documents <b>during -- not after</b> --<b> negotiations </b>and providing reasons therefor is indubitable.  The 23 June 2005 letter of respondent Secretary Ermita to Congressman Teves states that the "proposed Agreement has been a <b>work in progress for about three years</b>."  Likewise, respondents' Comment states that "(a)t the time when the Committee was requesting the copies of such documents<b>, the negotiations were ongoing as they are still now</b>."  Both statements show that the subject JPEPA documents were being withheld from petitioners<b> during and not after negotiations, and that the reasons provided for withholding them refer to the dangers of disclosure while negotiations are ongoing and not after they have been concluded. </b><br><br>In fact, respondent Secretary Ermita's 23 June 2005 letter states that a "copy of the <b>draft JPEPA</b>" as soon as "the <b>text thereof is settled and complete</b>" would be forwarded to the Committee, which is precisely one of the subject JPEPA documents, <i>i.e.</i>, the <b>final text of the JPEPA prior to its signing by the President</b>.  Similarly, in his letter dated 2 November 2005, respondent Undersecretary Aquino replied that the Committee would be provided the <b>latest draft</b> of the agreement "once the <b>negotiations are completed</b> and as soon as a thorough legal review of the proposed agreement has been conducted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup>  Both letters of Secretary Ermita and Undersecretary Aquino <b>refer to the</b> <b>draft texts of the JPEPA</b> that they would provide to the Committee once the <b>negotiations and text are completed, and not to the final text of the JPEPA after it has been signed by the President</b>.  The discussion <i>infra</i> will show that in the case of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the complete text of the agreement was released<b> prior </b>to its signing by the Presidents of the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

It is the task of the Executive to show the Court the reason for the privilege <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the context in which it is invoked</span>, as required by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Senate v.

The requirement to show the reason for the privilege is especially important in the case at bar, considering that the subject JPEPA documents are part of trade agreement negotiations, which involve the interdependent powers of the Executive over treaty negotiations and the legislature over foreign trade, as recognized in both Philippine and U.S. jurisdictions.  Upon the Executive's showing of the reason and circumstances for invoking the diplomatic secrets privilege, the Court can then consider whether the application of the privilege to the information or document in dispute is warranted.  As the Executive is given the opportunity to show the applicability of the privilege, there is a safeguard for protecting what should rightfully be considered privileged information to uphold national interest.<br><br>With respondents' failure to provide reasons for claiming the diplomatic secrets privilege after the conclusion of negotiations, the inevitable conclusion is that respondents cannot withhold the subject JPEPA documents.<br><br>The contentions in the Concurring Opinion of Justice Carpio that a State may wish to keep its offers "confidential even after the signing of the treaty because it plans to negotiate similar treaties with other countries and it does not want its negotiating positions known beforehand by such countries," and that "(i)f the Philippines does not respect the confidentiality of the offers and counter-offers of its negotiating partner State, then other countries will be reluctant to negotiate in a candid and frank manner with the Philippines"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> are speculative and matters for respondents to show the  Court.  The same holds true as regards the assertion in the Separate Opinion of Justice Tinga that "with respect to the subject treaty, the Government of the Philippines should expectedly heed Japan's normal interest in preserving the confidentiality of the treaty negotiations and conduct itself accordingly in the same manner that our Government expects the Japanese Government to observe the protocol of confidentiality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>Respondents having failed in shielding the subject JPEPA documents with the diplomatic secrets privilege, let us now proceed to determine whether they can keep these documents secret under the deliberative process privilege, which is a distinct kind of executive privilege.  The Separate Opinion of Justice Tinga asserts, however, that while there is a distinction between the diplomatic secrets privilege and the deliberative process privilege, "they should be jointly considered if the question at hand, as in this case, involves such diplomatic correspondences related to treaty negotiations...Thus, it would not be enough to consider the question of privilege from only one of these two perspectives as both species of privilege should be ultimately weighed and applied in conjunction with each other."<br><br>Indeed, the diplomatic character of the JPEPA deliberations or negotiations and the subject JPEPA documents was considered in determining the applicability of the diplomatic secrets privilege in the above discussion.  But as respondents have failed in protecting the subject JPEPA documents with this kind of privilege that considers the diplomatic character of negotiations, the next question to consider is whether another kind of privilege -- that does not hinge on the diplomatic nature of negotiations, but on the deliberative status of information alone - can shield the subject JPEPA documents.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.

(<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Symmetrical to this right to information are the following provisions of the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>Article II, Section 28, Declaration of State Principles and Policies:<br><br>Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a <b>policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest</b>.

(<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>The objective of the 1987 Constitution is to attain an <b>open and honest government</b> predicated on the people's right to know, as shown by the following portion of the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission, <i>viz:</i><br><blockquote>MR. OPLE.  Mr. Presiding Officer, this amendment is proposed jointly by Commissioners Ople, Rama, Treñas, Romulo, Regalado and Rosario Braid.  It reads as follows: "SECTION 24.

I want to comment that Section 6 (referring to Section 7, Article III on the right to information) talks about the right of the people to information, and corresponding to every right is a duty.  In this particular case, <b>corresponding to this right of the people is precisely the duty of the State to make available whatever information there may be needed that is of public concern.</b>  <b>Section 6 is very broadly stated so that it covers anything that is of public concern</b>.  It would seem also that the <b>advantage of Section 6 is that it challenges citizens to be active in seeking information rather than being dependent on whatever the State may release to them.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx                 xxx                 xxx<br></div><br>MR.

The basic difference is that the Bill of Rights contemplates collision between the rights of the citizens and the State.  Therefore, it is <b>the right of the citizen to demand information.</b>  While under the Declaration of Principles, <b>the State must have a policy, even without being demanded, by the citizens, without being sued by the citizen, to</b> <b>disclose information and transactions</b>.

In this system, governmental agencies and institutions operate within the limits of the authority conferred by the people.  Denied access to information on the inner workings of government, the citizenry can become prey to the whims and caprices of those to whom the power had been delegated...<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx            xxx            xxx<br></div><br>...The right of access to information ensures that these freedoms are not rendered nugatory by the government's monopolizing pertinent information.

It is in the interest of the State that the channels for free political discussion be maintained to the end that the government may perceive and be responsive to the people's will.  Yet, this <b>open dialogue can be effective only to the extent that the citizenry is informed and thus able to formulate its will intelligently.  Only when the participants in a discussion are aware of the issues and have access to information relating thereto can such bear fruit</b>.<br><br><b>The right to information is an essential premise of a meaningful right to speech and expression.</b>  But this is not to say that the right to information is merely an adjunct of and therefore restricted in application by the exercise of the freedoms of speech and of the press.  Far from it<b>.  The right to information goes hand-in-hand with the constitutional policies of <i>full public disclosure </i>(footnote omitted) and <i>honesty in the public service </i>(footnote omitted). </b> <b>It is meant to enhance the widening role of the citizenry in governmental decision-making as well as in checking abuse in government.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup><b> </b>(<i>emphases supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Notably, the right to information was written in broad strokes, as it merely required that information sought to be disclosed must be a <b>matter of public concern.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup>  In Legaspi v.

Both terms embrace a broad spectrum of subjects which the public may want to know, either because these <b>directly affect their lives, or simply because such matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen.</b>  In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine on a case by case basis whether the <b>matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it relates to or affects the public</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>Under both the 1973 and the 1987 Constitutions, the right to information is <b>self-executory</b>.

As the Court found that no military or diplomatic secrets would be disclosed by the production of these records and there was no law making them classified, it held that disclosure of the records to the Office of the Ombudsman was warranted.  In arriving at this conclusion, the Court noted that <b>the case did not concern a demand by a citizen for information under the freedom of information guarantee of the Constitution</b>, but involved the power of the Office of the Ombudsman to obtain evidence in connection with an investigation conducted by it vis-a-vis the claim of privilege of an agency of the Government.

As afore-discussed, the Court, in denying the petition in an unpublished Resolution, quoted at length <b>Curtiss-Wright's</b> disquisition on the necessity of secrecy in foreign negotiations. Again, the relevant portion of that quote, which was cited by respondents, reads, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>In this vast external realm, with its important, complicated, delicate and manifold problems, the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation.  He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate; but <b>he alone negotiates</b>.  <b>Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.  </b>As Marshall said in his great argument of March 7, 1800, in the House of Representatives, `The <b>President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations</b>, and its <b>sole representative with foreign nations</b>.'  Annals, 6th Cong., col. 613.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx            xxx            xxx<br></div><br>It is important to bear in mind that <b>we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations - a power which does not require as a basis for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution.</b> It is quite apparent that if, in the maintenance of our international relations, embarrassment -perhaps serious embarrassment- is to be avoided and success for our aims achieved, congressional legislation which is to be made effective through negotiation and inquiry within the international field must often accord to the President a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved. Moreover, he, not Congress, has the better opportunity of knowing the conditions which prevail in foreign countries, and especially is this true in time of war.  He has his confidential sources of information.  He has his agents in the form of diplomatic, consular and other officials.  <b>Secrecy in respect of information gathered by them may be highly necessary, and the premature disclosure of it productive of harmful results.  </b>Indeed, so clearly is this true that the first President refused to accede to a request to lay before the House of Representatives the instructions, correspondence and documents relating to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty - a refusal the wisdom of which was recognized by the House itself and has never since been doubted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> <i>(emphasis supplied)</i><br></blockquote>The Court followed this quote with the <b>conclusion</b> that "<b>(w)e have the same doctrine of separation of powers</b> in the Constitution and the same grant of authority in foreign affairs to the President as in the American system.  The same reasoning applies to treaty negotiations by our Government."<br><br><b>Taking a hard look</b> at the facts and circumstances of <b>PMPF v. Manglapus, </b>it cannot escape one's eye that<b> </b>this <b>case did not involve a question of separation of powers arising from a legislative inquiry</b>, as in the case of the House of Representative's demand on President Washington for papers relating to the Jay Treaty.  In <b>PMPF v. Manglapus</b>, petitioners invoked their right to information under Article III, Section 7; and freedom of speech and the press under Article III, Section 4. They sought to compel the representatives of the President of the Philippines in the then ongoing negotiations of the <b>RP-U.S. Military Bases Agreement</b> to (1) open to petitioners the negotiations/sessions of respondents with their U.S. counterparts on the RP-U.S. Military Agreement; (2) reveal and/or give petitioners access to the items which they (respondents) had already agreed upon with their American counterparts relative to the review of the RP-U.S. Military Bases Agreement; and (3) reveal and/or make accessible to petitioners the respective positions of respondents and their U.S. counterparts on items they had not agreed upon, particularly the compensation package for the continued use by the U.S. of their military bases and facilities in the Philippines.  The above quote from <b>Curtiss-Wright, </b>referring to a conflict between the executive and the legislative branches of government, was therefore <b>different</b> from the factual setting of <b>PMPF</b> <b>v. Manglapus.  </b>The latter case which involved a collision between governmental power over the conduct of foreign affairs with its secrecy prerogative on the one hand, and the citizen's right to information under the Constitution on the other.<br><br>The <b>PMPF Court</b> did stress that secrecy of negotiations with foreign countries did not violate freedom of access to information and freedom of speech and of the press.  Significantly, it quoted <b><i>The New American Government and Its Work</i>,</b> <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The nature of diplomacy requires centralization of authority and expedition of decision which are inherent in executive action.  Another essential characteristic of diplomacy is its confidential nature. Although much has been said about "open" and "secret" diplomacy, with disparagement of the latter, Secretaries of State Hughes and Stimson have clearly analyzed and justified the practice. In the words of Mr. Stimson:<br><br>"A complicated negotiation... cannot be carried through without many, many private talks and discussions, man to man; many tentative suggestions and proposals.  Delegates from other countries come and tell you in confidence of their troubles at home and of their differences with other countries and with other delegates; they tell you of what they do under certain circumstances and would not do under other circumstances... If these reports...should become public...who would ever trust American Delegations in another conference?

This, it is claimed, is incompatible with the substance of democracy.  As expressed by one writer, `It can be said that there is no more rigid system of silence anywhere in the world.'  (E.J. Young, Looking Behind the Censorship, J.B. Lippincott Co., 1938)  President Wilson in starting his efforts for the conclusion of the World War declared that we must have `open covenants, openly arrived at.'  He quickly abandoned his thought.<br><br><b>"No one who has studied the question believes that such a method of publicity is possible.  In the moment that negotiations are started, pressure groups attempt to `muscle in.'

The <b><i>New American Government and Its Work</i></b><i> </i>was published in 1940, <b>long before</b> the Freedom of Information Act was passed in the U.S. in 1966.  It did not and could not have taken into account the expanded statutory right to information in FOIA.  <b>It is more doubtful if this book can be used to calibrate the importance of the right of access to information in the Philippine setting, considering its elevation as a constitutional right.</b><br><br><b>Be that as it may,</b> I submit that as both <b>Chavez v.

In <b>Chavez v. PCGG</b>, the Court cited the following deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission in recognizing that "inter-government exchanges prior to the conclusion of treaties and executive agreements may be subject to reasonable safeguards for the sake of national interest," <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>MR. SUAREZ. And when we say "transactions" which should be distinguished from contracts, agreements, or treaties or whatever, does the Gentleman refer to the steps leading to the consummation of the contract, or does he refer to the contract itself?<br><br>MR. OPLE. The "transactions" used here, I suppose, is generic and, therefore, it can <b>cover both steps leading to a contract, and already a consummated contract</b>, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>MR. SUAREZ. This contemplates <b>inclusion of negotiations leading to the consummation of the transaction</b>?<br><br>MR. OPLE. Yes, <b>subject to reasonable safeguards on the national interest.</b><br><br>MR. SUAREZ.  Thank you. Will the <b>word "transactions" here also refer to treaties, executive agreements</b> and service contracts particularly?<br><br>MR. OPLE.  I suppose that is <b>subject to reasonable safeguards on national interest</b> which include the national security."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>The above deliberations show that negotiation of treaties and executive agreements may or may not come within the purview of "transactions" covered by the right to information, <b>subject to reasonable safeguards to protect national interest</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup>  In other words, the diplomatic secrets privilege over treaty negotiations may provide a ground for exemption, but <b>may be overcome if there are reasonable safeguards to protect the national interest</b>.  It is thus <b>not an absolute</b> <b>exemption or privilege, but a qualified one.  </b><br><br><b>  </b>The Freedom of Information Act 2000 of the <b>United Kingdom </b>provides that<b> </b>when an exemption is <b>qualified, the right to information will not be upheld only if the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the information.  </b>The Act treats as <b>qualified exemptions</b> information that "would be <b>likely to prejudice</b>...relations between the United Kingdom and any other State"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> and "confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup>  As such, these exemptions may be overcome by a higher public interest in disclosure.<br><br>It may be argued that the subject JPEPA documents consist of information similar to information covered by the above-cited qualified exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.  The qualification of the above exemptions in the United Kingdom is made in the context of a statutory grant of a right to information.  In the Philippines where the right to information has more force and effect as a constitutional right, there is all the more reason to give it stronger muscle by qualifying the diplomatic secrets privilege exemption.  This approach minimizes the risk of unjustifiably withholding diplomatic information that is of public concern but covered by overly broad absolute exemptions.<br><br>We thus come to the <b>task of cobbling the appropriate test</b> to weigh the <b>public interest in maintaining the exemption or privilege over diplomatic secrets and the public interest in upholding the constitutional right to information and disclosing the subject JPEPA documents.</b><br><center><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.The test to use in adjudicating the constitutional</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">right to information vis-à-vis executive privilege</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">is the "balancing of interests," and not the "showing of need"</span><br></center><br>While I agree with the <i>ponencia's</i> treatment of the diplomatic secrets privilege as a qualified privilege and its recognition of the need to formulate a weighing test, it is my humble view that, contrary to its position, we cannot use the test laid down in <b>U.S. v. Nixon</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> <b>Senate Select Committee v.

The requirement of "showing of need" applies when executive privilege is invoked against an<b> evidentiary need for information, such as in the case of another government</b> <b>entity seeking information in order to perform its function;</b> that is, the court in <b>U.S. v. Nixon</b>, the Senate in <b>Senate Select Committee</b>, and the grand jury in <b>In re Sealed Case (Espy)</b>.<br><br><b>In the adjudication of rights guaranteed in the Constitution, however, the Court has never used "showing of need" as a test to uphold rights or allow inroads into them</b>.  I respectfully submit that we ought not to weigh the need to exercise the right to free speech or free assembly or free practice of religion.  These are freedoms that have been won by all for the benefit of all, without the requisite showing of need for entitlement.  When we valuate these constitutional rights, we do not consider their necessity for the performance of a function, as in the case of government branches and entities.  The <b>question</b> in the adjudication of constitutional rights is whether the incursion into a right is <b>peripheral or essential</b>, as when there is only a "<b>soft restraint</b>" on the potential extraditee's right to procedural due process;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> or whether there is a <b>heavier public interest</b> that must prevail <br> over a constitutional right in order to preserve an ordered society, such as when there is a "<b>clear and present danger</b>" of a substantive evil that the State has a right to prevent as demonstrated in free speech cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> or when there is a "<b>compelling state interest</b>" that must override the free exercise of religion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup><br><br><b>The right to information lies at the heart of a government that is not only republican but also democratic</b>.  For this reason, Article III, Section 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> of the 1987 Constitution, calls for<b> </b>"an informed citizenry with access to the diverse currents in political, moral and artistic thought and data relative to them, and the free exchange of ideas and discussion of issues thereon is vital to the democratic government envisioned under our Constitution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup>  Thus, employing the <b>"balancing of interests" test</b>, the public interest in upholding this constitutional right of the public to information must be carefully <b>balanced</b> with the public interest in nondisclosure of information in relation to treaty negotiations.  This test is in line with the approach adopted in the right to access statute of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.<br><br>There is a <b>world of difference</b> between employing the "balancing of interests" test and the "showing of need" test adopted by the <i>ponencia </i>from <b>U.S. v. Nixon</b>, <b>Senate Select Committee v. Nixon</b>, and <b>In re Sealed Case (Espy)</b>.  In <b>U.S. v. Nixon</b>, the "showing of need" was necessary, as the information was being sought by a court as <b>evidence in a criminal proceeding.  </b>In <b>Senate Select Committee</b>, the information was being sought by the Senate to <b>resolve conflicting testimonies in an investigation conducted in the exercise of its oversight functions over the executive branch and in aid of legislation pertaining to executive wrongdoing.  </b>Finally,<b> </b>in <b>In re Sealed Case (Espy)</b>, the information was being sought by the grand jury to <b>investigate whether a government official had committed a crime</b>.<br><br>In weighing the "showing of need" in all three cases, the courts considered the relevance of the evidence, the availability of other evidence, and the criticality of the information sought in the performance of the functions of the court, the Senate, and the grand jury, respectively. These considerations have no meaning in petitioners' assertion of their right to information, for there is no proceeding in relation to which these considerations can be measured. It easily leaps to the eye that these considerations do not apply to adjudication on the constitutional right to information in relation to executive privilege, but the <i>ponencia</i> does not state what the "showing of need" consists of in the context of the public's assertion of the right to information.<br><br>Insofar as the constitutional right of access is concerned, the writing on the wall indicates that it <b>suffices that information is of public concern for it to be covered by the right, regardless of the public's need for the information</b> - whether to assess the performance of the JPEPA Philippine negotiating panel and express satisfaction or dissatisfaction, or to protest the inclusion of repulsive provisions in the JPEPA, or to keep public officials on their toes by making them aware that their actions are subject to public scrutiny - <b>or regardless of the public's lack of need for the information, if they simply want to know it because it interests them.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup> <br><br>The right to information is a constitutional right <b>in and of itself </b>and does not derive its significance only in relation to the exercise of another right, such as the right to free speech or a free press if that is the kind of "function" of an individual that can be equated with the functions of government agencies in the above cases cited by the <i>ponencia</i>.  To reiterate, <b>Valmonte</b> teaches that the right to information is not merely an adjunct of the right to free speech and a free press.  Stated another way, <b>the right to information is an end in itself,</b> even as it may be exercised in furtherance of other rights or purposes of an individual.  To say that one exercises the right to information simply to be informed, and not because of a particular need, is not a meaningless tautology.  Thus, instead of using "showing of need" as a passport to access purportedly privileged information, as in the case of government entities needing information to perform a <b>constitutionally mandated duty</b>, the yardstick with respect to individuals exercising a <b>constitutionally granted right </b>to information should be the importance of the right and the public interest in upholding it.<br><br>Prescinding from these premises, I respectfully submit that the test laid down by the <i>ponencia</i> -- which predicates access to information on a "showing of need" understood in the context of <b>U.S. v. Nixon</b>, <b>Senate Select Committee v. Nixon</b>, and <b>In re Sealed Case (Espy) -- </b>will have the <b>pernicious effect</b> of subverting the nature, purpose and wisdom of including the "right to information on matters of public concern" in the Bill of Rights as shown in the above-quoted deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission.  It sets an <b>emasculating precedent</b> on the interpretation of this all-important constitutional right and <b>throws into perdition</b> the philosophy of an open government, painstakingly enshrined by the framers of the 1987 Constitution in the many scattered provisions from beginning to end of our fundamental law.<br><br>Applying the <b>balancing of interests test</b> to the case at bar leads to the ineluctable conclusion that the scale must be tilted in favor of the people's right to information for, as shown earlier, the <b>records are bereft of basis for finding a public interest to justify the withholding of the subject JPEPA documents after the negotiations</b> have been concluded.  Respondents have <b>not shown a sufficient and specific public interest</b> to defeat the recognized public interest in exercising the constitutional right to information to <b>widen the role of the citizenry in governmental decision-making by giving them a better perspective of the vital issues confronting the nation,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup> <b>and to check abuse in government.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup><b> </b><br><br>As aforestated, the <b>negotiations are already concluded</b> and the JPEPA has been submitted to the Senate for its concurrence.  The <b>treaty has thus entered the ultimate stage</b> in which the people can exercise their right to participate in the discussion on whether the Senate should concur in its ratification or not. <b>This right will be diluted, unless the people can have access to the subject JPEPA documents. </b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> cites <b>PMPF v. Manglapus</b>, <b>Chavez v. PCGG and Chavez v. Public Estates Authority</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup><b> and Senate v.

Advocates against the JPEPA contend that these provisions run afoul of the 1987 Constitution, primarily Article XII, on the National Economy and Patrimony.  Article 89 of the JPEPA provides for National Treatment, <i>viz</i>:<blockquote><center>Article 89<br>National Treatment<br></center><br>Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and to their investments treatment <b>no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors and to their investments</b> with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, operation, maintenance, use, possession, liquidation, sale, or other disposition of investments.<br></blockquote>In the opinion rendered by <b>Justice Feliciano</b> in response to the invitation to deliver a statement at a hearing of the Senate Joint Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Trade and Commerce, he explained that the "national treatment" obligation requires the Philippines to "treat Japanese investors as if they were Philippine nationals, and to treat Japanese investments in the Philippines as if such investments were owned by Philippine nationals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup>  This provision raises serious constitutional questions and need untrammeled discussion by the public, as entry into certain sectors of economic activity in our country is restricted to natural persons who are Philippine citizens or to juridical persons that are at least sixty, seventy or one hundred percent owned by Philippine citizens.

Compensation by the Japanese government to its investor under such contract will give rise to the right of the Japanese government to be subrogated to the right or claim of the Japanese investor against the Philippine government.

If true, it would be in the public's interest to know why said provisions were put back, as they affect the public welfare; and how it is in the Philippine interest to include them in the JPEPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup><br><br>Various concerned sectors have also expressed their objection to some provisions of the JPEPA.  A substantial number of <b>fishermen</b> harp on the inadequacy of protection given to their sector and the violation of the Philippine Constitution with respect to deep-sea fishing.   In Annex 7, 2B (Schedule of the Philippines)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup> of the JPEPA, the Philippine government made a reservation on national treatment by invoking Article 12 of the 1987 Constitution under the heading: "Sector: Fisheries, Sub-sector: Utilization of Marine Resource."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup>  The measures invoked by the Philippine government are: 1) no foreign participation is allowed for small-scale utilization of marine resources in archipelagic waters, territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zones; 2) for deep-sea fishing corporations, associations or partnerships having a maximum 40 percent foreign equity can enter into co-production, joint venture or production-sharing agreement with the Philippine government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[303]</sup>  Concerned sectors contend, however, that the second measure violates Article XII, Section 2 of the Philippine Constitution which mandates, without qualification, the protection of the nation's marine wealth in Philippine archipelagic waters, territorial sea and EEZ; and reserves "its use and enjoyment exclusively to Filipino citizens."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup><br><br>The <b>food sector</b> also complains about the insufficiency of protection from export subsidies under Article 20 of the JPEPA, which, according to it, makes it possible for Japan to engage in <b>agriculture dumping</b>, one of the most trade-distorting practices of rich countries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[305]</sup>  Article 20 of the JPEPA, provides <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><center>Article 20<br>Export Duties<br></center><br>Each Party shall exert its <b>best efforts</b> to eliminate its duties on goods exported from the Party to the other Party. (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>This sector raises the objection that while the JPEPA only requires "best efforts," both the Japan-Indonesia Economic Partnership Agreement (JIEPA) and the Japan-Malaysia Economic Partnership Agreement (JMEPA) disallow the introduction or the maintenance of agriculture export subsidies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[306]</sup><br><br><b>    </b>Without adjudging the merits of objections to the above provisions of the JPEPA, the fact that these concerns are raised and that these provisions will impact on the lives of our people stress the need for an <b>informed debate</b> by the public on the JPEPA.  Rooted in the unique Philippine experience, <b>the 1987 Constitution strengthened participatory democracy not only in our political realm but also in the economic arena.  Uninformed participation in the governance of the country impairs the right of our people to govern their lives while informed debate serves as the fountainhead from which truth and the best interest of the country will spring.    </b><br><br>By upholding the constitutional right to information over the invocation of executive privilege in the instant case, it is my considered view that <b>the subject JPEPA documents</b> should be disclosed considering the <b>particular circumstances of the case at bar</b>.  In arriving at this conclusion, a <b>balancing of interests test</b> has to be employed which will allow the executive to show the public interest it seeks to protect in invoking executive privilege.  The test serves as a <b>safeguard </b>against disclosure of information that should properly be kept secret.  There is thus no foundation for the fears expressed in the Separate Opinion of <b>Justice Tinga</b>, <i>viz</i>: "(The ruling) would establish a general rule that diplomatic negotiations of treaties and other international agreements...belong to the public record since it is encompassed within the constitutional right to information...if indeed the Philippines would become unique among the governments of the world in establishing that these correspondences related to treaty negotiations are part of the public record, I fear that such doctrine would impair the ability of the Philippines to negotiate treaties or agreements with foreign countries."  As afore-discussed, allowing public access to trade agreement negotiations and draft texts, in various degrees and ways, has gained momentum in the landscape of U.S. diplomatic and foreign relations.  I submit that, when warranted, <b>we must overcome the entropy of the old tradition of secrecy</b>.<br><br><b>Contrary </b>to the Separate Opinion of Justice Tinga, the Executive as the custodian of records of negotiations of treaties and other international agreements has the <b>discretion</b> to classify information as confidential in accordance with applicable laws, and not let it become part of the public record of a government in the sunshine.  But when the executive is haled to court to enforce a constitutional right to this information, it is the court's task <b>in each particular case to balance the executive's need for secrecy in treaty negotiations with the constitutional right to information</b>, and decide whether that particular information should be disclosed or kept confidential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[307]</sup>  Finally, the discussion in the Separate Opinion of Justice Tinga on the application of Article 32, Supplementary Means of Interpretation, of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[308]</sup> and the question of whether the subject JPEPA documents constitute "preparatory work" under this provision are <b>premature,</b> as the Philippine Senate has not concurred in the ratification of the JPEPA; hence, it has not entered into force.  I submit that the question is not relevant to the resolution of the case at bar, as we are not here engaged in an interpretation of the JPEPA.<br><br><b>In sum</b>, transparency and opacity are not either-or propositions in the conduct of international trade agreement negotiations. The degree of confidentiality necessary in a particular negotiation is a point in a continuum where complete disclosure and absolute secrecy are on opposite ends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[309]</sup>  In assigning this fulcrum point, it is my humble view that the Court should balance the need for secrecy of the Executive and the demand for information by the legislature or the public.  The balancing act in every case safeguards against disclosure of information prejudicial to the public interest and upholds the fundamental principle enunciated in <b>Senate v. Ermita</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[310]</sup> <b>-- </b>that a claim of executive privilege "may be valid or not <b>depending on the ground invoked to justify it and the context in which it is made.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[311]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">We elevated</span> t<b>he right to information to constitutional stature not without reason.

These allegations led to the appointment of an Independent Counsel, to investigate the allegations and to prosecute any related violations of federal law that the Office of the Independent Counsel (OIC) reasonably believed had occurred. The same allegations led the President of the United States to direct the White House Counsel to investigate Espy's conduct in order to advise the President on whether he should take executive action against Espy.  The White House publicly released a report on Espy produced by the White House Counsel. Subsequently, a grand jury issued the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> at issue in this case. The subpoena sought all documents on Espy and other subjects of the OIC's investigation that were "accumulated for, relating in any way to, or considered in any fashion, by those persons who were consulted and/or contributed directly or indirectly to all drafts and/or versions" of the White House Counsel's report.

Office of the United States Trade Representative </b>(237 F. Supp. 2d 17) which the <i>ponencia </i>discusses.  However, <b>CIEL</b> was litigated under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the U.S. which requires that information/communication should be "inter-agency" for it to come within the protection of the deliberative process privilege.  The FOIA does not have a counterpart in the Philippines.  Instead, the above conclusion on the non-application of the deliberative process privilege to the subject JPEPA documents was reached by going back to the rationale and history of deliberative process privilege.<br><br>In <b>CIEL,</b> nonprofit groups monitoring international trade and environmental issues brought a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the Office of the United States Trade Representative, seeking information related to the <b>negotiation of the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement.</b> Under the FOIA, deliberative and pre-decisional communications <b>between and within agencies of the U.S. government are exempt from government duty to disclose information.</b>  Accordingly, the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia held that <b>communications between the U.S. and Chile, in the course of treaty negotiations, were not "inter-agency" within the meaning of FOIA exemption and thus should be disclosed to the nonprofit groups seeking access to them.  </b><br><br>The District Court explained its ruling, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>For purposes of the <b>inter-agency requirement</b>, the Supreme Court has noted that the term <b>"`agency' means `each authority of the Government of the United States</b>,' § 551(1), and `includes any executive department, military department,  Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government ..., or any independent regulatory agency,' § 522(f)." <i>Klamath Water Users,</i> 532 U.S. at 9, 121 S.Ct. 1060. In general, this definition establishes that <b>communications between agencies and outside parties are not protected under Exemption 5 (deliberative process privilege)</b>... <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brownstein Zeidman &amp; Schomer v. Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 781 F.Supp. 31, 35 (D.D.C.1991) ("While FOIA exemption 5 does protect intra-governmental deliberations, it <b>does not cover negotiations between the government and outside parties</b>."); <i>see also </i><i>Mead Data Central, Inc. v. United States Dep't of the Air Force,</i> 566 F.2d at 257-58 (policy objectives of Exemption 5 <b>not applicable to negotiations between agency and outside party</b>).<br><br>... Chilean officials are not "enough like the agency's own personnel to justify calling their communications `intra-agency.' " <i>Klamath Water Users,</i> 532 U.S. at 12, 121 S.Ct. 1060. Nor did the documents that Chile submitted to USTR play "essentially the same part in <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[the]</sup>  agency's process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel might have done." ...<b>It may be true, as defendants assert, that Chilean proposals and responses are essential to USTR's development of its own negotiating positions, but the role played by such documents is unmistakably different from the role of internally created documents; Chile shares its positions not in order to advise or educate USTR but in order to promote its own interests.</b> <i>See</i> Def. Mem. at 22 (acknowledging that "Chile seeks to achieve its own objectives through the negotiations"). Nor does the fact that USTR "needs to understand what is important to Chile in order to develop its own positions" confer inter-agency status on these external documents. Def. Mem. at 21. ( 237 F.

In <i>Ryan,</i> the court of appeals held that communications produced by Senators in response to an agency questionnaire regarding nominating procedures for judicial candidates fell within the narrow ambit of Exemption 5 (deliberative process privilege). The court characterized the Senators as "temporary consultants" who were "solicited to give advice only for specific projects." ... <b>In the instant case, by contrast, the Chilean officials were not solicited for advice but rather negotiated with and treated as adversaries openly seeking to advance their</b> <b>own interests</b>... (237 F. Supp. 2d 17, 28). (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>The District Court of the District of Columbia distinguished the <b>CIEL case</b> from <b>Fulbright &amp; Jaworski v.

The court held that "releasing these snapshot views of the negotiations would be comparable to releasing drafts of the treaty" and consequently would risk great harm to the negotiations process... </b>Despite the superficial similarity of context - the "give-and-take" of treaty negotiations - the <b>difference is that the negotiator's notes at issue in <i>Fulbright &amp; Jaworski</i> were clearly internal.</b> The question of disclosure turned not on the inter-agency requirement of Exemption 5 but on whether or not the documents were part of the agency's pre-decisional deliberative process... Judge Green's discussion of the harm that could result from disclosure therefore is <b>irrelevant</b>, since the <b>documents at issue here are not inter-agency</b>, and <b>the Court does not reach the question of deliberative process</b>.

Overall, when considering international trade agreements, most members of Congress may be divided into two groups: those who are protectionist at all times and give interest groups whatever they need to retain their tariffs; and those who do not, in principle, favor protectionism but feel they must not let their constituents down while a tariff bill is pending.  As a result, allowing legislative input into the process of enacting trade agreements led only to increased tariffs with relatively few instances of tariff reductions.  To avoid the evils of logrolling and partisan politics, Congress enacted legislation establishing general policies to be carried out by the administration.

There is no dispute on this.</li><li>After the signing of the treaty, the public disclosure of such offers and counter-offers depends on the consent of <b>both</b> negotiating States.  A State may wish to keep its offers and counter-offers confidential even after the signing of the treaty because it plans to negotiate similar treaties with other countries and it does not want its negotiating positions known beforehand by such other countries.  The offers and counter-offers of a negotiating State usually include references to or discussions of the offers and counter-offers of the other negotiating State.  Hence, a negotiating State cannot decide alone to disclose publicly its own offers and counter-offers if they refer to or discuss the offers and counter-offers of the other negotiating State.</li><li>If the Philippines does not respect the confidentiality of the offers and counter-offers of its negotiating partner State, then other countries will be reluctant to negotiate in a candid and frank manner with the Philippines. Negotiators of other countries will know that Philippine negotiators can be forced to disclose publicly offers and counter-offers that their countries want to remain confidential even after the treaty signing.  Thus, negotiators of such countries will simply repeat to Philippine negotiators offers and counter-offers that they can disclose publicly to their own citizens, which offers and counter-offers are usually more favorable to their countries. This denies to Philippine negotiators the opportunity to hear, and explore, other more balanced offers or counter-offers from negotiators of such countries.    A writer on diplomatic secrets puts it this way:<br><blockquote>x x x  Disclosure of negotiating strategy and goals impairs a party's ability to negotiate the most favorable terms, because a negotiating party that discloses its minimum demands insures that it will get nothing more than the minimum. Moreover, those involved in the practice of negotiations appear to be in agreement that publicity leads to `grandstanding,' tends to freeze negotiating positions, and inhibits the give-and-take essential to successful negotiation. As Sissela Bok points out, if `negotiators have more to gain from being approved by their own sides than by making a reasoned agreement with competitors or adversaries, then they are inclined to `play to the gallery . . . .' In fact, the public reaction may leave them little option. It would be a brave, or foolish, Arab leader who expressed publicly a willingness for peace with Israel that did not involve the return of the entire West Bank, or Israeli leader who stated publicly a willingness to remove Israel's existing settlements from Judea and Samaria in return for peace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup></blockquote></li><li>In the present case, at least one negotiating State - the Philippines - does not want to disclose publicly the offers and counter-offers, including its own.  The Philippines is expected to enter into similar treaties with other countries.  The Court cannot force the Executive branch to telegraph to other countries its possible offers and counter-offers that comprise our negotiating strategy. That will put Philippine negotiators at a great disadvantage to the prejudice of national interest. Offers and counter-offers in treaty negotiations are part of diplomatic secrets protected under the doctrine of executive privilege. Thus, in <i>United States v. Curtiss-Wright</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the leading case in American jurisprudence on this issue, the U.S. Supreme Court, quoting with approval a letter of President George Washington, held:<br><blockquote>x x x Indeed, so clearly is this true that the first President refused to accede to a request to lay before the House of Representatives the instructions, correspondence and documents relating to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty - <b>a refusal the wisdom of which was recognized by the House itself and has never since been doubted</b>. In his reply to the request, President Washington said:<blockquote>The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a full disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions which may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely impolitic<b>; for this might have a pernicious influence on future negotiations, or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and mischief, in relation to other powers</b>. The necessity of such caution and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties in the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the principle on which that body was formed confining it to a small number of members. To admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives to demand and to have as a matter of course all the papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous precedent.   (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote></li><li>The negotiation of treaties is different from the awarding of contracts by government agencies.   In diplomatic negotiations, there is a traditional expectation that the offers and counter-offers of the negotiating States will remain confidential even after the treaty signing.  States have honored this tradition and those that do not will suffer the consequences.  There is no such expectation of keeping confidential the internal deliberations of government agencies after the awarding of contracts.<br><br></li><li>However, in the ratification of a treaty, the Senate has the right to see in <b>executive session<i>, </i></b>the offers and counter-offers made in the treaty negotiations even in the absence of consent from our treaty partner State.  Otherwise, the Senate cannot examine fully the wisdom of the treaty.

What appears to have been forgotten is an equally important and fundamental power and duty of Congress and that is its informing function by way of investigating for the purpose of enlightening the electorate.<br><br>Arthur M. Schlesinger, in THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY, aptly quotes Wilson on CONGRESSIONAL GOVERNMENT on this power:<blockquote>Congress's "only whip," Wilson said, "is investigation," and that "the chief purpose of investigation, even more than the direction of affairs, was the enlightenment of the electorate.  The inquisitiveness of such bodies as Congress is the best conceivable source of information....  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function."

Neither is the Philippines the only country that has done this.  Only last year, 2007, Mexico amended its Constitution to raise to the level of a fundamental right the public's right to know the truth, thereby providing that:  "All information in the possession of any federal, state and municipal authority, entity, body or organization is public xxxx." The amendment reads:<blockquote>The Amendment to Article 6 of the Constitution<br><br>The Permanent Commission of the Honorable Congress, in full use of the power bestowed on it by Article 135 of the Constitution, and after approval by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of Mexico, as well as the legislatures, decrees:<br><br>A second paragraph with seven subsections is hereby added to Article 6 of the Mexican Constitution.<br><br>Single Article.

The reason lies in the recognition under international law of the fundamental human right of a citizen to take part in governance, as set forth in the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a right that cannot be realized without access to information.<br><br>And even in the United States from where the privilege originated no President has claimed a general prerogative to withhold but rather the Executive has claimed particular exceptions to the general rule of unlimited executive disclosure:<blockquote>Conceding the idea of Congress as the grand inquest of the nation, Presidents only claimed particular exceptions to the general rule of unlimited executive disclosures - Washington, the protector of the exclusive constitutional jurisdiction of one house of Congress against invasion by the other house; Jefferson, the protector of presidential relationship within the executive branch and the defense of that branch against congressional harassment; Taylor, the protection of ongoing investigation and litigation; Polk, the protection of state secrets in intelligence and negotiation.  While exceptions might accumulate, no President had claimed a general and absolute prerogative to withhold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>The President, therefore, has the burden to show that a particular exception obtains in every case where the privilege is claimed.  This has not been done in the present case.  All that the Senate is asking for are copies of the starting offers of the Philippines and of Japan. What is the deep secret in those papers?  If the final product is and has been disclosed, why cannot the starting offers be revealed?  How can anyone, the Senate or the electorate included, fathom - to use the favorite word of a counsel - the end product if one is not told the starting positions?<br><br>Furthermore, Executive Secretary Ermita did not really invoke the privilege.  All he said was that, at the time of the request, negotiations were on-going, so that it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">difficult </span>to provide <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all the papers</span> relative to the proposed Treaty (which was then the request of the Senate).  He did not say it was privileged or secret or confidential but that it was difficult at the time to comply with the request as the Executive understandably had its hands full in the midst of the negotiations.<br><br>Now the negotiations are over.  The proposed treaty has been signed and submitted to the Senate for ratification.  There is no more difficulty in complying with the now reduced request of giving copies of the starting offers of the Philippines and of Japan.<br><br>Since the privilege is an exception to the rule, it must be properly, seasonably and clearly invoked.

Had the present question involved the legislative consideration of a domestic enactment, rather than a bilateral treaty submitted for ratification by the Senate, I would have no qualms in voting to grant the petition. However, my vote to dismiss the petition, joining in the result of the <i>ponencia </i>of the esteemed Justice Morales, is due to my inability to blithely disregard the diplomatic and international ramifications should this Court establish a rule that materials relevant to treaty negotiations are demandable as a matter of right. The long-standing tradition of respecting the confidentiality of diplomatic negotiations is embodied in the rule according executive privilege to diplomatic secrets.<br><br>The <i>ponente</i> engages in a thorough and enlightening discussion on the importance and vitality of the diplomatic secrets privilege, and points out that such privilege, which is a specie of executive privilege, serves to balance the constitutional right to information invoked in this case. If I may add, in response to the Dissenting Opinion which treats the deliberative process privilege as "a distinct kind of executive privilege" from the "diplomatic secrets privilege", notwithstanding the distinction, both deliberative process privilege and diplomatic secrets privilege should be jointly considered if the question at hand, as in this case, involves such diplomatic correspondences related to treaty negotiations.  The diplomatic character of such correspondences places them squarely within the diplomatic secrets privilege, while the fact that the ratification of such treaty will bestow on it the force and effect of law in the Philippines also places them within the ambit of the deliberate process privilege.  Thus, it would not be enough to consider the question of privilege from only one of those two perspectives, as both species of executive privilege should be ultimately weighed and applied in conjunction with each other.<br><br>In ascertaining the balance between executive privilege and the constitutional right to information in this case, I likewise consider it material to consider the implications had the Court established a precedent that would classify such documents relating to treaty negotiations as part of the public record since it is encompassed within the constitutional right to information. The Dissenting Opinion is unfortunately unable to ultimately convince that establishing such a general rule would not set the Philippines so far apart from the general practice of the community of nations. For if indeed the Philippines would become unique among the governments of the world in establishing that these correspondences related to treaty negotiations are part of the public record, I fear that such a doctrine would impair the ability of the Philippines to negotiate treaties or agreements with foreign countries.  The Philippines would become isolated from the community of nations, and I need not expound on the negative and destabilizing implications of such a consequence.<br><br>It should be expected that national governments, including our own, would insist on maintaining the presumptive secrecy of all documents and correspondences relating  to treaty negotiations.  Such approach would be maintained upon no matter how innocuous, honest or above-board the privileged information actually is, since an acknowledgment that such information belongs to the public record would diminish a nation's bargaining power in the negotiation of treaties.  This truth may be borne moreso out of <i>realpolitik</i>, rather then the prevalence of a pristine legal principle, yet it is a political reality which this Court has to contend with since it redounds to the ultimate wellbeing of the Philippines as a sovereign nation.  On the premise that at least a significant majority of the most relevant players in the international scene adhere to the basic confidentiality of treaty negotiations no matter the domestic implications of such confidentiality, then it can only be expected that such nations will hesitate, if not refuse outright, to negotiate treaties with countries which do not respect that same rule.<br><br>The Dissenting Opinion does strive to establish that in certain countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, there is established a statutory right to information that allows those states' citizens to demand the release of documents pertinent to public affairs. However, even the dissent acknowledges that in the United Kingdom for example, "confidential information obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom" or information that would be likely to prejudice relations between the United Kingdom and other countries are exempt from its own Freedom of Information Act of 2000. It is impossible to conclude, using the examples of those countries, that there is a general presumptive right to access documents relevant to diplomatic negotiations.<br><br>It would be a different matter if the petitioners or the dissent were able to demonstrate that a significant number of nations have adopted a paradigm that incorporates their treaty negotiations into the public record out of recognition of the vital right to information, transparency, good governance, or whatever national interest revelation would promote; or that there is an emerging trend in international law that recognizes that treaty negotiations are not privileged in character, or even if so, that the privilege is of such weak character that it may easily be overcome.  If either circumstance was established, it would be easier to adopt the position of the dissent, which admirably attempts to infuse full vitality into the constitutional rights of the people, as it would assure that such constitutional affirmation would not come at the expense of the country's isolation from the community of nations.<br><br>Unfortunately, neither  the Dissenting Opinion nor the petitioners herein, have attempted to engage such perspective.  A cursory inquiry into foreign jurisprudence and international law does not reveal that either of the two trends exist a the moment.  In the United Kingdom, the concept of State interest immunity (formerly known as "Crown Privilege") guarantees that information, the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the interests of the State, may not be disclosed.  In the <i>Corfu Channel Case</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  the International Court of Justice affirmed the United Kingdom's refusal to turn over certain documents relevant to its dispute with Albania on the ground of national security.  In Australia, the Attorney General's certification that information may not be disclosed for the reason that it would prejudice the security, defense or international relations of Australia is authoritative and must be adhered to by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>According to commentaries on the law on evidence in Pakistan, "if the privilege is claimed on the ground that the document relates to the affairs of the State which means maters of public nature in which  a State is concerned and disclosure of which will be prejudicial to public interest or endangers national defense or is detrimental to good diplomatic relations then the general rule [of judicial review] ceases to apply and the Court shall not inspect the document or show it to the opposite party unless the  validity of the privilege claimed is determined."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The International  Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in a decision dated 18 July 1997, did recognize an international trend that in cases where national security or state secrets privilege is invoked, the courts may nonetheless assess the validity of the claim, thus requiring the disclosure of such documents to the courts or its designates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Nonetheless, assuming that such a ruling is indicative of an emerging norm in international law, it only establishes that the invocation of state secrets cannot be taken at face value but must be assessed ;by the courts.  The Dissenting Opinion implicitly goes further and establishes that documents involved in diplomatic negotiations relating to treaty agreements should form part of the public record as a consequence of the constitutional right to information.  I would have been more conformable to acknowledge such a doctrine if it is supported by a similar trend in foreign jurisprudence or international law.<br><br>Where the contracting nations to a treaty share a common concern for the basic confidentiality of treaty negotiations it is understandable that such concern may evolve unto a firm norm of conduct between them for as long as no conflict between them in regard to the treaty emerges.  Thus, with respect to the subject treaty the Government of the Philippines should expectedly heed Japan's normal interest in preserving the confidentiality of the treaty negotiations and conduct itself accordingly in the same manner that our Government expects the Japanese Government to observe the protocol of confidentiality.<br><br>Even if a case arises between the contracting nations concerning the treaty it does not necessarily follow that the confidentiality of the treaty negotiations may be dispensed with and looked into by the tribunal hearing the case, except for the purposes mentioned in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties.  The Article provides:</span></span><span><span><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Article 32</b><br><i>Supplementary means of interpretation</i><br></div><br>Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:<br><br>(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or<br><br>(b) leaves to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</blockquote>The aforequoted "preparatory work" or <i>travaux preparatiores </i> may be used either to confirm the meaning of the treaty or as an aid to interpretation where, following the application of Article 32, the meaning is ambiguous or obscure or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The article may be limited in design as a rule in the interpretation of treaties.<br><br>Moreover, it is less clear what exactly classifies documents or correspondences as "preparatory work."  Should such preparatory work have been cleared for disclosure by the negotiating countries?  In 1995, the International Court of Justice, in <i>Qatar v. Bahrain,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></i>  dealt with Bahrain's claim that following Article 32, the ICJ should adopt its theory concerning a territorial dispute based on the text of a documents headed "Minutes" signed at Doha on 25 December 1990 by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. While the ICJ ultimately rejected Bahrain's contention on the ground that such minutes could not provide conclusive supplementary elements for the interpretation of the text adopted, it is useful to dwell on the fact that such a document classified as "preparatory work" was, at the very least, expressly approved by the negotiating parties through their Foreign Ministers.<br><br>In the case at bar, it appears that the documents which the petitioners are particularly interested in their disclosure are the various drafts of the JPEPA. It is not clear whether such drafts were ever signed by the Philippine and Japanese governments, or incorporated in minutes or similar documents signed by the two governments.  Even assuming that they were signed but without any intention to release them for public documentation, would such signatures already classify the minutes as part of "preparatory work" which, following the Vienna Convention, provides supplementary means of interpretation and should logically be within the realm of public disclosure? These are manifestly difficult questions which unfortunately, the petitioners and the Dissenting Opinion did not adequately address.<br><br>Finally, I wish to add that if the petitioner in this case is the Senate of the Philippines, and that it seeks the requested documents in the process of deliberating on the ratification of the treaty, I will vote for the disclosure of such documents, subject to mechanisms such as <i>in camera</i> inspection or executive sessions that would have accorded due regard to executive privilege. However, the reason behind such a position will be based not on the right to information, but rather, on the right of the Senate to fully exercise its constituent function of ratifying treaties.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> United Kingdom v.
