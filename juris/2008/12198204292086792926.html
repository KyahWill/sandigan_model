The memorandum provides:<br><blockquote>All employees corporate-wide who attain 60 years of age on or before April 30, 1991 shall be considered retired on May 31, 1991.<br><br>Henceforth, any employee shall be considered retired 30 days after he attains age 60.<br><br>Personnel department shall prepare the retirement notices to be co-signed and served by respective Department managers to employees concerned.

Agripino averred that URSUMCO illegally dismissed him from employment on June 24, 1997 when he was forced to retire upon reaching the age of sixty (60) years old.  Upon the termination of his employment, he accepted his separation pay and applied for retirement benefits with the Social Security System (SSS). Earlier, on April 15, 1997, Alejandro turned 60 years old. On May 28, 1997, he filed his application for retirement with URSUMCO, attaching his birth and baptismal certificates. On July 23, 1997, he accepted his retirement benefits and executed a quitclaim in favor of URSUMCO.<br><br>Thereafter, on August 6, 1997, Agripino filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for illegal dismissal, damages and attorney's fees before the Labor Arbiter (LA) of Dumaguete City.  He alleged that his compulsory retirement was in violation of the provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) 7641 and, was in effect, a form of illegal dismissal.<br><br>On August 26, 1997, Alejandro likewise filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> for illegal dismissal, underpayment of retirement benefits, damages and attorney's fees before the LA, alleging that he was given only 15 days per year of service by  way of  retirement  benefits and   further  assails that  his   compulsory retirement was discriminatory considering that there were other workers over sixty (60) years of age who were allowed to continuously report for work.<br><i><b><center><br>The LA's Ruling<br></center><br></b></i>On September 30, 1998, the LA rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the respondent guilty of illegal dismissal and thus ordered to pay complainants: Agripino Caballeda and Alejandro Cadalin their respective backwages from: June 23, 1997 and from June 15, 1997 up to the promulgation of this Decision.

On January 27, 2000, the NLRC held that Alejandro voluntarily retired because he freely submitted his application for retirement together with his birth and baptismal certificates. Moreover, he had his clearance processed and he received the amount of P33,476.77 as retirement benefit. Nevertheless, the NLRC found that since Alejandro's retirement benefit was based merely on fifteen (15) days salary for every year of service, such benefit should be recomputed to conform to the provisions of Art. 287 of the Labor Code as amended. With respect to Agripino, the NLRC held that URSUMCO's claim that Agripino was a mere casual employee was obviously designed to avoid paying Agripino his retirement benefit. Thus, the NLRC ruled:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby <b>SET ASIDE and VACATED</b> and a new one entered <b>DISMISSING</b> the complaint for illegal dismissal.

The CA found that there is no existing CBA or employment contract between the parties that provides for early compulsory retirement. Hence, the CA held:<br><blockquote>It is beyond doubt that [petitioner] violated the rights of the [respondents] [insofar] as the latter were not given the prerogative to choose for themselves to retire early or wait for the compulsory retirement age which is sixty[-five] (65) years. "If the intention to retire is not clearly established or if the retirement is involuntary, it is to be treated as discharge" (San Miguel Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 293 SCRA 13, 21[,] citing the case of De Leon vs. NLRC, 100 SCRA 691 [1980]). Corollary, such involuntary retirement on the part of [respondents] was in effect an illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>However, the CA held that the NLRC properly computed the retirement benefits of the respondents.

With respect to Agripino, petitioners claim that he is merely a seasonal or project worker and not a casual worker since the sugar milling business is seasonal in nature; that as such, Agripino was not forced to retire, rather the termination of his employment was essentially based on the fact that the period stated in his contract with URSUMCO had already lapsed; and that assuming Agripino is not a project employee, his retirement pay should be reduced proportionately by the number of months per year that his services were not engaged by URSUMCO since the milling season covers only six months within a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <br><br>On the other hand, respondents aver that petitioners' plea for this Court to review the facts and pieces of evidence presented below is contrary to the rule that the issues in cases brought before this Court via a petition for review under Rule 45 are limited only to questions of law; that respondents were forced to retire at the age of 60 by virtue of the Memorandum which the employees did not ratify or freely agree upon, hence, respondents' dismissal from work was without valid cause and due process, amounting to illegal dismissal; that the Memorandum which unilaterally directed the compulsory retirement of employees reaching the age of 60 is contrary to the security of tenure guaranteed in the Constitution, Art. 287 of the Labor Code as amended by R.A. 7641, pertinent Labor and Civil Code provisions, public policy and good customs; and that the respondents were merely compelled to sign the prepared retirement forms and comply with the other retirement requirements because they were no longer given any work assignment and they could only receive their retirement benefits if they sever their employment relations with URSUMCO and comply with the latter's directives. Respondents submit that they were given no option but to follow URSUMCO's orders regarding their retirement, hence, the same was not voluntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing, this Court is called upon to resolve three ultimate issues, as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>Whether R.A.7641 can be given retroactive effect;<br><br></li><li>Whether Agripino is a seasonal or project employee; and<br><br></li><li>Whether respondents were illegally terminated on account of  compulsory retirement or the same voluntarily retired.<br></li></ol></blockquote><center><i><b>The Court's Ruling</b></i><br></center><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>First.</i> The issue of the retroactive effect of R.A. 7641 on prior existing employment contracts has long been settled. In <i>Enriquez Security Services, Inc. v. Cabotaje,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>RA 7641 is undoubtedly a social legislation. The law has been enacted as a labor protection measure and as a curative statute that -- absent a retirement plan devised by, an agreement with, or a voluntary grant from, an employer -- can respond, in part at least, to the financial well-being of workers during their twilight years soon following their life of labor. <b>There should be little doubt about the fact that the law can apply to labor contracts still existing at the time the statute has taken effect, and that its benefits can be reckoned not only from the date of the law's enactment but retroactively to the time said employment contracts have started.</b><br></blockquote>This doctrine has been repeatedly upheld and clarified in several cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Pursuant thereto, this Court imposed two (2) essential requisites in order that R.A. 7641 may be given retroactive effect:  (1) the claimant for retirement benefits was still in the employ of the employer at the time the statute took effect; and (2) the claimant had complied with the requirements for eligibility for such retirement benefits under the statute.<br><br>It is evident from the records that when respondents were compulsorily retired from the service, R.A. 7641 was already in full force and effect. The petitioners failed to prove that the respondents did not comply with the requirements for eligibility under the law for such retirement benefits.  In sum, the aforementioned requisites were adequately satisfied, thus, warranting the retroactive application of R.A. 7641 in this case.<br><br><i>Second. </i> It is a well-established rule that a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should raise only questions of law, subject to certain exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Whether or not Agripino was a seasonal/project employee or a regular employee is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  As such, this Court is not at liberty to review the said factual issue because our jurisdiction is generally limited to reviewing errors of law that the CA may have committed. Time and again, we have held that this Court is not a trier of facts, and it is not for us to re-examine and re-evaluate the probative value of evidence presented before the LA, the NLRC and the CA, which formed the basis of the assailed decision. Indeed, when their findings are in absolute agreement, the same are accorded not only respect but even finality as long as they are amply supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <br><br>In this case, it is noteworthy that the LA, the NLRC and the CA are one in ruling that Agripino was not a casual employee much less a seasonal or project employee. In their findings, Agripino was considered a regular employee of URSUMCO. Consequently, such uniform finding of the LA, the NLRC, and the CA binds this Court.  We find no cogent reason to depart from this ruling.<br><br><i>Third</i>. Retirement is the result of a bilateral act of the parties, a voluntary agreement between the employer and the employee whereby the latter, after reaching a certain age, agrees to sever his or her employment with the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The age of retirement is primarily determined by the existing agreement between the employer and the employees. However, in the absence of such agreement, the retirement age shall be fixed by law. Under Art. 287 of the Labor Code as amended, the legally mandated age for compulsory retirement is 65 years, while the set minimum age for optional retirement is 60 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In this case, it may be stressed that the CBA does not per se specifically provide for the compulsory retirement age nor does it provide for an optional retirement plan.  It merely provides that the retirement benefits accorded to an employee shall be in accordance with law.  Thus, we must apply Art. 287 of the Labor Code which provides for two types of retirement: (a) compulsory and (b) optional. The first takes place at age 65, while the second is primarily determined by the collective bargaining agreement or other employment contract or employer's retirement plan. In the absence of any provision on optional retirement in a collective bargaining agreement, other employment contract, or employer's retirement plan, an employee may optionally retire upon reaching the age of 60 years or more, but not beyond 65 years, provided he has served at least five years in the establishment concerned. That prerogative is exclusively lodged in the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><sup></sup><br><br>Indubitably, the voluntariness of the respondents' retirement is the meat of the instant controversy. Petitioners postulate that respondents voluntarily retired particularly when Alejandro filed his application for retirement, submitted all the documentary requirements, accepted the retirement benefits and executed a quitclaim in favor of URSUMCO. Respondents claim otherwise, contending that they were merely forced to comply as they were no  longer given any work assignment and considering that the severance of their employment with URSUMCO is a condition precedent for them to receive their retirement benefits.<br><br>We rule in favor of respondents.<br><br>Generally, the law looks with disfavor on quitclaims and releases by employees who have been inveigled or pressured into signing them by unscrupulous employers seeking to evade their legal responsibilities and frustrate just claims of employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They are frowned upon as contrary to public policy. A quitclaim is ineffective in barring recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The reason is laid down in <i>Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote>The reason is plain. Employer and employee, obviously, do not stand on the same footing. The employer drove the employee to the wall. The latter must have to get hold of money.  Because, out of the job, he had to face harsh necessities of life. He thus found himself in no position to resist money proferred. His, then, is a case of adherence, not of choice. One thing sure, however, is that petitioners did not relent their claim. They pressed it. They are deemed not to have waived any of their rights. <i>Renuntiatio non praesumitur.</i><br></blockquote>In exceptional cases, the Court has accepted the validity of quitclaims executed by employees if the employer is able to prove the following requisites: (1) the employee executes a deed of quitclaim voluntarily; (2) there is no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (3) the consideration of the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (4) the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  In this case, petitioners failed to establish all the foregoing requisites.<br><br>To be precise, only Alejandro was able to claim a partial amount of his retirement benefit. Thus, it is clear from the decisions of the LA, NLRC and CA that petitioners are still liable to pay Alejandro the differential on his retirement benefits. On the other hand, Agripino was actually and totally deprived of his retirement benefit.<br><br>Moreover, the petitioners, not the respondents, have the burden of proving that the quitclaim was voluntarily entered into.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  In previous cases, we have considered, among others, the educational attainment of the employees  concerned in  upholding  the validity  of  the quitclaims  which they have executed in favor of their employers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, in <i>Becton Dickinson Phils., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>There is no nexus between intelligence, or even the position which the employee held in the company when it concerns the pressure which the employer may exert upon the free will of the employee who is asked to sign a release and quitclaim. A lowly employee or a sales manager, as in the present case, who is confronted with the same dilemma of whether signing a release and quitclaim and accept what the company offers them, or refusing to sign and walk out without receiving anything, may do succumb to the same pressure, being very well aware that it is going to take quite a while before he can recover whatever he is entitled to, because it is only after a protracted legal battle starting from the labor arbiter level, all the way to this Court, can he receive anything at all. The Court understands that such a risk of not receiving anything whatsoever, coupled with the probability of not immediately getting any gainful employment or means of livelihood in the meantime, constitutes enough pressure upon anyone who is asked to sign a release and quitclaim in exchange of some amount of money which may be way below what he may be entitled to based on company practice and policy or by law.<br></blockquote>It is worth mentioning that the respondents are rank-and-file employees. They are simple folks who rely on their work for the daily sustenance of their respective families. Absent any convincing proof of voluntariness in the submission of the documentary requirements and in the execution of the quitclaim, we cannot simply assume that respondents were not subjected to the very same pressure mentioned in <span style="font-style: italic;">Becton</span>. Furthermore, the fact that respondents filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against petitioners completely negates their claim that respondents voluntarily retired. To note, respondents vigorously pursued this case against petitioners, all the way up to this Court. Without doubt, this is a manifestation that respondents had no intention of relinquishing their employment, wholly incompatible to petitioners' assertion that respondents voluntarily retired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>We find no reversible error and, thus, sustain the ruling of the CA that respondents did not voluntarily retire but were rather forced to retire, tantamount to illegal dismissal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
