				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By letter dated August 9, 2005 addressed to Deputy Court Administrator Jose Perez, respondent Judge Moises M.

Tuldague in payment of the "Motion Fee for Special Raffle" in the amount of Five Hundred Pesos (Php500.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>By Resolution of April 26, 2006, this Court referred the Judge's letter and Tuldague's comment/explanation to the OCA for evaluation, report, and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In its July 21, 2006 Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the OCA evaluated the case against Tuldague, thus:<br><blockquote>With respect to respondent Tuldague, we find that his action and deportment properly call for scrutiny by this Court.&nbsp; He <span style="text-decoration: underline;">admits that in one instance, he proceeded with the raffle of a foreclosure of mortgage on the presumption that Judge Pardo may not be interested in conducting it himself</span>.&nbsp; Certainly such is not an acceptable and valid reason that could justify his act of usurping the authority of the judge.&nbsp; We cannot accept his explanation that he did that out of pure concern for the service.&nbsp; The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">circumstances point to </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">defiance of authority</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> considering that there are indications that bad blood exists between them</span>.&nbsp; As respondent Tuldague himself admitted in his letter dated 18 October 2005, there is a "legal controversy and friction" between them.&nbsp; Moreover, his statement in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his comment that personally </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">he has no more respect for respondent Pardo</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, his statement in his letter dated 18 October 2005 that </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">"<i>from now on I will be forwarding to your office all petitions for extrajudicial foreclosure so you can always be present and conduct the raffle yourself"</i></b><i style="text-decoration: underline;">,</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> his statement that </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>"if you want to make the issue big, then you can bring this small matter up to the Supreme Court again,</i></b><i style="text-decoration: underline;"> and I'm willing and ready to answer"</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, and his assertion that it is respondent Pardo's </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">"misguided principles and bloated pride that keeps him [in] his wrong court practices despite honest to goodness corrections being undertaken by him</i><i>"</i> <b>speak volumes about Tuldague's disrespect towards his superior</b>.&nbsp; The <b style="text-decoration: underline;">belligerence</b> too evident to ignore indicates that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent's act of personally conducting the raffle in the absence of respondent judge was </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">intentional</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>As for the case against the judge, the OCA observed:<br><blockquote>With respect to respondent Judge Pardo, we find that the records of the case do not sufficiently establish enough basis for his liability.&nbsp; Respondent Judge denied that he ever allowed respondent Clerk of Court impliedly or expressly to conduct the raffle of cases/application of extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage in his absence as Executive Judge.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such denial is supported by the records which show his vehement objection against respondent Tuldague's act of raffling cases even in his absence as chairman of the raffle committee and which is the very root of the present administrative matter.</span>&nbsp; In fact respondent Tuldague denies that he personally conducts the raffle of cases which denial supports respondent Judge['s] assertion that it is [he] who personally presides over the proceedings.&nbsp; As regards his alleged act of assigning an LRC Case to Branch 32 without the benefit of a raffle, the accusation is not supported by the records of the case.&nbsp; The evidence submitted by respondent Tugaldue [<i>sic</i>] to support his accusation is an incompletely filled-pro-forma form of minutes of special raffle, the only entries of which were the case name and number under the space provided for the cases assigned to Branch 32 and the name and signature of the receiving Clerk of Court of said court.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This evidence does not speak of any capricious, arbitrary or whimsical disposition on respondent Pardo's part to unilaterally assign the subject LRC case to Branch 32 or of any deliberate intent on his part to violate the rule on raffle of cases.</span>&nbsp; On the contrary, we find acceptable respondent Pardo's explanation that he presumed said case to be regularly docketed in said court.&nbsp; Besides, no ill motive can be attributed to him which could have moved him to disregard the rules on raffle to ensure that Branch 32 would get the case.&nbsp; There are only two branches of the RTC in Cabarroguis, Quirino, Branches 31 and 32. <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondent is the presiding judge of Branch 31 and then acting presiding judge of Branch 32.&nbsp; Regardless therefore of where the case would be assigned, it would still be respondent Pardo who would be hearing and deciding the case, which in fact was what happened.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><b> </b>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote> The OCA accordingly recommended that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="3%"><div align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[1]</span></div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">the explanation of respondent Judge Moises Pardo with respect to his alleged act of allowing the Clerk of Court to conduct the raffle of cases in his station without being personally present thereat for a long period of time and comment on the allegation that he took the records of LRC Case No. 264-05 without the benefit of a raffle be considered <b>SUFFICIENT </b>and <b>SATISFACTORY</b>.<br> </div></td></tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[2]</span></div></td> <td><div align="justify">that respondent Clerk of Court Atty.
