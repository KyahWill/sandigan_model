More importantly, the OSG points out that the memorandum of encumbrances on the certificate of title shows that several transactions involving the lots embraced therein have been entered into, proving that TCT No. 11356 had already been cancelled. These transactions allegedly belie petitioners' claim that the owner's duplicate copy of the "Transfer Certificate of Title No. 11356 has not been delivered to any person or entity to secure the payment or performance of any obligation whatsoever, nor any transaction or document relating to the same was presented for or pending registration in the office of the Registry of Deeds of Camarines Norte."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In their Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 15 January 2007, petitioners insist that the cancellation of TCT No. 11356 was merely partial because the transactions inscribed in the title pertain only to 75.5642 hectares out of the 99.5693 hectares comprising the entire landholding. They claim that except for the partial cancellation of the title in view of the Deed of Absolute Sale involving Lot 5 executed in favor of Eusebio Madera, <i>et al</i>., all the other transactions in favor of the national government in connection with its implementation of the CARP and that the inscriptions pertaining to these transactions do not state that the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title was delivered to a third person. Thus, petitioners advance that they cannot be said to have misrepresented the fact that their copy of TCT No. 11356 had not been delivered to any third person or entity.<br><br>The case at bar is merely for the replacement of a lost owner's duplicate certificate of title.&nbsp; As such, Section 109, Chapter X of Presidential Decree No. 1529, which governs actions for the replacement of lost duplicate certificates of title, applies. The provision states:<br><blockquote> Sec. 109. <i>Notice and replacement of lost duplicate certificate.—</i>In case of loss or theft of an owner's duplicate certificate of title, due notice under oath shall be sent by the owner or by someone in his behalf to the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies as soon as the loss or theft is discovered. If a duplicate certificate is lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced by a person applying for the entry of a new certificate to him or for the registration of any instrument, a sworn statement of the fact of such loss or destruction may be filed by the registered owner or other person in interest and registered.<br><br>Upon the petition of the registered owner or other person in interest, the court may, after notice and due hearing, direct the issuance of a new duplicate certificate, which shall contain a memorandum of the fact that it is issued in place of the lost duplicate certificate, but shall in all respects be entitled to like faith and credit as the original duplicate, and shall thereafter be regarded as such for all purposes of this decree.</blockquote>The record reveals that in compliance with the jurisdictional requirement that notice of the loss be sent to the Register of Deeds of the province where the land lies, petitioners submitted Aytona's Affidavit of Notice of Loss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; dated 28 November 2001, duly stamped "Received" by the Registry of Deeds of Daet, Camarines Norte. They then attached to their petition for the issuance of a new TCT Aytona's affidavit of loss which states that the title was entrusted to him but he later discovered that it was among the personal belongings which he could no longer locate. The relevant portions of the said affidavit state: <br><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>That since the same has been entrusted to me, I had been in possession of the Owner's duplicate copy of said title and I kept the same in my files;<br><br></li><li>That however, lately when I look for the same in my files I discovered that it was among those personal belongings which I could no longer locate and despite diligent efforts in search of the said title, the same could no longer be found up to this date [there by] creating in my mind a conclusion that the same has been lost and already beyond recovery;<br><br></li><li>That said Owner's duplicate copy of TCT#11356 has not been delivered to any person of entity to secure payment of performance of any obligation [whatsoever], nor any transaction in the office of the [R]egistry of Deeds of Camarines Norte;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>To bolster the allegation that the certificate of title had been lost, Aytona gave the following testimony:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q:</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Do you have the title in your possession right now?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">I don't have.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">The title was somewhat lost because when I was looking for the title I cannot find the title in my possession.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">What did you do after learning that said title has already been lost?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Well, I check with my wife and other relative if they borrowed it from me and I found out that the said title is not in their possession so they advised me to search on it and what I did was I still kept on searching for it and after that I really cannot find it anymore.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">For how long did you search?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">More than a year.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">After exerting diligent effort to locate the same and search seem to be futile[,] what did you do next, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">I decided to execute an Affidavit of Loss of the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>We deem the foregoing evidence sufficient to prove the loss of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 11356 and the consequent entitlement of petitioners to the issuance of a new owner's duplicate copy.&nbsp; After all, in civil cases such as the one at bar, mere preponderance of evidence suffices. Preponderance of evidence is a phrase which, in the last analysis, means probability of the truth. It is evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthy of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Strait Times, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>cited by the OSG, the Court annulled the trial court's decision granting a petition for the issuance of an owner's duplicate certificate of title because there was clear proof that the same had not been lost but was in fact in the possession of another person.&nbsp; Similarly in <i>Rexlon Realty Group, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>also relied upon by the OSG, there was no proof adduced to support the actual loss of the owner's duplicate copies of the TCTs in question. Hence, the Court said that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction and the new titles issued in replacement thereof were void.<br><br>Verily, the issuance of a new owner's duplicate of TCT No. 11356 is the only means by which petitioners can attain their ultimate objective of receiving just compensation for the parcels of land covered by the title which had been compulsorily taken by the government for agrarian reform purposes. To deny them the remedy under Section 109 of P.D. No. 1529 would leave them no recourse because the submission of the owner's duplicate of the title to the LBP is a condition to the payment of just compensation.<br><br>In this regard, we deem this an opportune time to steer the course which petitioners should take to finally put order to their property.&nbsp; P.D. No.&nbsp; 1529, specifically Section 49 thereof, provides the procedure by which the distinct parcels of land embraced by petitioners' title can be issued separate titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Section 58 of the same law also lays down the procedure in cases such as the one at bar where the conveyances involve only certain portions of land described in a certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
