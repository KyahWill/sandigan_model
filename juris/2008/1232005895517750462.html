SP No. 77451.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The CA set aside the Labor Arbiter's Order dated March 28, 2003 and annulled the writ of execution dated October 15, 2002 in so far as it ordered the satisfaction of the decision from Surety Bond No. SPAC-01061/2001 issued by respondent Security Pacific Assurance Corporation (SPAC).<br><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br>On January 14, 1999, petitioner Kenji Okada filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, payment of service incentive leave, 13th month pay, damages, and attorney's fees against then Meiyu Technology Corporation (Meiyu)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> before the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp; The complaint, docketed as NLRC NCR Case No. 00-01-00520-99, likewise impleaded Meiyu officers, namely: Hideaki Terraya, Keiji Sobana, and Voltaire Soriano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; The case was raffled off to Labor Arbiter Fatima Jambaro-Franco.<br><br>On&nbsp; July 12, 1999,&nbsp; the Labor Arbiter rendered judgment in favor of petitioner.&nbsp; The dispositive part of the Arbiter ruling reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; Meiyu Technology Corporation/Hideaki Terraya/Keiji Sobana and Voltaire Soriano are hereby directed to pay, jointly and severally complainant Kenji Okada the amount of SIX MILLION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PESOS (P6,380,000.00), representing the monetary awards as above-computed and attorney's fees.<br><br>All other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Expectedly, Meiyu appealed the decision to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; It posted an appeal bond issued by Wellington Insurance Co., Inc. in the amount equivalent to the monetary judgment.&nbsp; In their appeal memorandum, Meiyu argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that the action for reinstatement and payment of benefits has prescribed.<br><br>On November 5, 1999, the NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter, on the ground of prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The NLRC resolved:<br><br><blockquote>Article 291 of the Labor Code, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>"All money claims arising from employer-employee relations accruing during the effectivity of this Code shall be filed within three (3) years from the time the cause of action accrued; otherwise they shall be forever barred."<br></blockquote><br>In connection therewith, the Supreme Court in <i>Calianta v. Carnation Philippines,</i> G.R. 70615, Feb. 28, 1986, ruled that the period of prescription mentioned under Article 291 of the Labor Code refers to and is "limited to money claims," all other cases of injury to rights of working man being governed by the Civil Code.&nbsp; Hence, an action for reinstatement is four years, for the injury to the employee's right as provide[d] under Article 1146 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; The four-year prescriptive period under Article 1146 of the New Civil Code is applied by way of supplement.<br><br>In the case at bar, there is no dispute that complainant's employment was terminated on 5 May 1993. Hence, complainant had until 5 May 1997 within which to file the complaint for reinstatement or until 5 May 1996 for his money claims.<br><br>In relation thereto, Article 217 of the Labor Code declares that,<br><br><blockquote>"a) x x x the Labor Arbiter shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide x x x the following cases involving all workers x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>2. Termination disputes."<br></blockquote><br>Article 292 of the Labor Code also mandates that "money claims specified in the immediately preceding Article shall be filed before the appropriate entity."<br><br>In connection therewith, Article 1155 of the New Civil Code also states that "the prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court."&nbsp; And the phrase "before the court" should only mean before appropriate court, quasi or quasi-judicial body.<br><br>Therefore, the filing of the petition for reinstatement with the SEC which is not the appropriate court did not have the effect of suspending or interrupting&nbsp; the prescriptive&nbsp; period for the&nbsp; filing of an action&nbsp; for&nbsp; illegal dismissal and money claims.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter also seriously erred in holding that the respondents are estopped from questioning the Order dated 8 April 1993 (denying the motion to dismiss on ground of prescription), "inasmuch as the respondents' failure to appeal and question the Order means that they have acquiesced to the said findings."<br><br>Obviously, the Labor Arbiter <i>a quo</i> failed to consider Section 15, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure which provides that,<br><br><blockquote>"Any motion to dismiss on the ground x x x that the cause of action, i.e. barred x x x by prescription, shall be immediately resolved by the Labor Arbiter by a written order.&nbsp; An order denying the motion to dismiss x x x <u>is not appealable.</u>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration of the NLRC judgment.&nbsp; In his motion for reconsideration, petitioner averred that the appeal was not perfected because the bond posted by Meiyu was spurious.&nbsp; It had no legal effect.&nbsp; Hence, the decision of the Labor Arbiter became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon verification, the NLRC found that the appeal bond was, indeed, spurious.&nbsp;

Meiyu opposed petitioner's motion for execution pending appeal, alleging it did not know that the appeal bond it earlier filed was spurious.&nbsp; Together with the petition, it posted another appeal bond, this time issued by private respondent SPAC, with the purpose of staying the execution of the Labor Arbiter's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated August 6, 2001, the CA denied Meiyu's petition.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellate court held&nbsp; that Meiyu failed&nbsp; to perfect its&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; because a fake or spurious bond produces no legal effect.&nbsp; The appellate court further ruled that the Labor Arbiter's decision lapsed into finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Predictably, on October 15, 2002, a writ of execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> was issued by the Labor Arbiter.&nbsp;

Respondent posited that it should be discharged from any liability on the bond it issued to Meiyu on the following grounds: (1) the bond would not have served its purpose of staying the execution or perfecting the appeal required under Article 223 of the Labor Code; (2) the bond was filed only when the case was already with the CA or long after the Honorable Commission declared the appeal from the Labor Arbiter's decision ineffective; and (3) said bond was not approved at all by the tribunals concerned because the CA sustained the NLRC's dismissal of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>Labor Arbiter and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated March 28, 2003, the Labor Arbiter denied SPAC's motion to quash writ of execution.&nbsp;

The same is deducible from this Court's decision in CA-G.R.

An appeal bond timely filed is indispensable to the perfection of an appeal in a labor case.&nbsp; Conversely, the validity, worth, and efficacy of an appeal bond are conditioned and dependent on, and subordinated to, the perfection of the appeal</i></b>.<br><br>The indispensability of an appeal bond in the perfection of an appeal cannot be gainsaid.&nbsp; A cash or surety bond is a requirement <i>sine qua non</i> for the perfection of an appeal from the Labor Arbiter's monetary award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Viron Garments Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>The intention of the lawmakers to make the bond an indispensable requisite for the perfection of an appeal by the employer is clearly limned in&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision that&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal by the employer may be perfected "<i>only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond</i>." The word `only' makes it perfectly clear, that the lawmakers intended that the posting of a cash or surety bond by the employer to be the exclusive means by which an employer's appeal may be perfected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The doctrine was reiterated with greater firmness in the more recent case of <i>Mary Abigail's Food Services, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Clear it is from the above that an appeal to the NLRC from any decision, award or order of the Labor Arbiter must have to be made within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decision, award or order with proof of payment of the required appeal bond accompanied by a memorandum&nbsp; of&nbsp; appeal. And where, as here, the decision of the Labor Arbiter involves a monetary award, the appeal is deemed perfected only upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; posting of&nbsp; a&nbsp; cash or surety bond also within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decision in an amount equivalent to the monetary award.<br><br>The posting of a cash or surety bond is a requirement <i>sine qua non</i> for the perfection of an appeal from the labor arbiter's monetary award.&nbsp; <u>Notably, the perfection of an appeal within the period and in the manner prescribed by law is jurisdictional and non-compliance with the requirements therefore is fatal and has the effect of rendering the judgment sought to be appealed final and executory.&nbsp; Such requirement cannot be trifled with</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In the case under review, Meiyu appealed the Labor Arbiter's decision to the NLRC.&nbsp; However, its appeal was deemed imperfect because its appeal bond turned out to be spurious.&nbsp; The bond was invalid.&nbsp; It did not effectively serve its purpose.&nbsp; It cannot thus be held liable to satisfy the money judgment of the Arbiter.<br><br>Absent a perfected appeal, the original parties stand in the same place as they were when the decision appealed from was rendered.&nbsp; Here, the Labor Arbiter issued its order declaring Meiyu liable to pay petitioner the amount of Six Million Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Pesos (P6,380,000.00) as monetary awards and attorney's fees on July 12, 1999. Meiyu failed to appeal the said judgment in accordance with the Labor Code and its implementing rules.<br><br>We quote with approval the CA observation and conclusion along this line:<br><br><blockquote>In&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, the&nbsp; Surety Bond&nbsp; issued by petitioner SPAC&nbsp; did not stay the execution of the public respondent Labor Arbiter's decision because it was belatedly filed.&nbsp; The same is deducible from this Court's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 61472.&nbsp; <u>In fact, this Court's Former Sixth Division did not even consider the fact that a new Surety Bond issued by petitioner SPAC was filed before this Court.&nbsp; This Court did not take cognizance of the Surety Bond issued by petitioner SPAC designed to replace the fake bond issued to the NLRC.</u><br><br><u>The non-acceptance of the Surety Bond issued by petitioner SPAC brought the original parties in the labor dispute into a situation where no appeal was filed, hence no appeal bond to proceed against.</u>&nbsp; The subject bond cannot be held answerable because of the non-fulfillment of the condition precedent for its issuance - the perfection of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioner insists that a surety contract was perfected between respondent SPAC and Meiyu; and that the contract should be made answerable for the monetary obligations of the employer.&nbsp; It is likewise contended that the appellate court should not have considered the perfection of an appeal as a condition precedent for the validity of the surety bond.<br><br>We cannot agree.&nbsp; This Court in <i>U-Sing Button and Buckle Industry v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> held:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he obvious and logical purpose of an appeal bond is to insure, <b><u>during the period of appeal</u></b>, against any occurrence that would defeat or diminish recovery under the judgment if subsequently affirmed; it also validates and justifies, at least <i>prima facie</i>, an interpretation that would limit the amount of the bond to the aggregate of the sums awarded other than in the concept of moral and exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>From the employer's standpoint, the purpose of the bond is to perfect one's appeal and stay the execution of monetary awards.&nbsp; From the standpoint of social justice, the rule in itself accords protection of the employee's monetary recovery during the period of appeal. Looking at it from either end, it is clear that the bond exists only during the appeal of the judgment. Without any appeal being perfected, there is also no appeal bond to speak of or to proceed against.<br><br>The records bear out&nbsp; that Meiyu contracted&nbsp; respondent SPAC for&nbsp; a surety bond after the NLRC ruled with finality that its first surety bond from Wellington Insurance Co., Inc. was spurious.&nbsp; Evidently,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the SPAC bond was issued, the period to appeal had already lapsed.&nbsp; As a consequence, the Labor Arbiter decision became final and executory.<br><br>Hence, the CA did not err in setting aside the Arbiter's March 28, 2003 Order denying the motion to quash the writ of execution dated October 15, 2002.<br><br>It may well be noted that respondent SPAC involved itself unnecessarily in the controversy when it issued the appeal bond to Meiyu.&nbsp; To stress, the period to appeal had lapsed and the Arbiter award had become final and executory at the time of issuance of the bond.&nbsp; It is for this reason that <u>there can be no recourse on the said appeal bond but only against the employer Meiyu.</u><br><br>A belated filing of an appeal bond in labor cases will never ripen into a perfected appeal.&nbsp; When the period to appeal lapses, the questioned decision becomes final and executory.&nbsp; In such cases, this Court orders the petitioner to pay the monetary awards.&nbsp; Money judgments were never levied on the likewise unperfected bond. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In pursuit of the constitutional mandate, the appeal bond is designed to give additional protection to labor.&nbsp; However, it should never be used as a tool for injustice against the employer.&nbsp; <i>Justicia nemini neganda est</i>.&nbsp; Justice is to be denied to none.&nbsp; <b><i>Ang hustisya ay hindi ipagkakait kaninuman.&nbsp; Ito'y para sa lahat</i></b>.&nbsp; Justice is for all.<br><br><b><i>II. Failure to furnish copy of petition to the other party is not fatal, especially when there is substantial compliance with the rules</i></b>.<br><br>Petitioner next contends that respondent's failure to furnish him a copy of its petition is fatal.<br><br>The contention is untenable.&nbsp; In <i>Remerco Garments Manufacturing v. Minister of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; The mere failure to furnish copy of the appeal memorandum to adverse party is not a fatal defect.&nbsp; We have consistently adhered to the principle clearly held in <i>Alonso v. Villamor</i> that "technicality when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and become its great hindrance and chief enemy deserves scant consideration from court."&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; Finally, labor law determinations, to quote from Bultmann, should be not only <i>secundum retionem</i> but also <i>secundum caritatem</i>. More recently, we held that in appeals in labor cases, non-service of the copy of the appeal or appeal memorandum to the adverse party is not a jurisdictional defect, and does not justify dismissal of the appeal.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Taking into consideration that justice should not be sacrificed for technicality, this Court reiterated the aforementioned ruling in <i>Modern Fishing Gear Labor Union v.

Dennis Ancheta.<br><br>Without the benefit of a proper notice of petitioner's substitution of counsel, respondent had no recourse but to serve the copy of its petition to whom it knew and perceived as being petitioner's counsel of record.&nbsp; In faithful compliance and with no intention of delay, service was made on Atty.

It could not have appealed the order of the Arbiter to the NLRC.&nbsp; Verily, respondent has no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In fine, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is the best available remedy to protect respondent's rights.<br><br>In a long line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court has consistently ruled that "the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i> is always available where there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."&nbsp; In <i>Jaca v.
