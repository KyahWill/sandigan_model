				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 14, 2000, appellant Pancho Entrialgo was charged with two counts of murder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Puerto Princesa City, Branch 49<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> under the following information:<br><blockquote><b>Criminal Case No. 16095</b><br><br>That on or about the 30<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2000 at about 8:20 in the evening of [Brgy.] Sta Cruz, Puerto Princesa City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, [appellant] with intent to kill with treachery, evident premeditation, grave abuse of superior strength and taking advantage of nighttime and while armed with a bolo, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and hack therewith one Benjamin Tabang, hitting him and inflicting upon him mortal wounds at the different parts of his body, which were the direct and immediate cause of his death shortly thereafter.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><b>Criminal Case No. </b>&nbsp; <b>16096</b><br><br>That on or about the 30<sup>th</sup> day of July, 2000 at about 8:20 in the evening of [Brgy.] Sta Cruz, Puerto Princesa City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, [appellant] with intent to kill with treachery, evident premeditation, grave abuse of superior strength and taking advantage of nighttime and while armed with a bolo, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and hack therewith one Avelina M. Tabang, hitting [her] and inflicting upon [her] mortal wounds at the different parts of [her] body, which were the direct and immediate cause of his death shortly thereafter.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, the appellant pleaded not guilty.<br><br>In the absence of an eyewitness, the prosecution presented the theory that appellant had the motive to kill the victims as he in fact killed the spouses Benjamin and Avelina Tabang.<br><br>Appellant's brother-in-law, Rolly Panaligan, was the prosecution's principal witness. Rolly testified that he and appellant were both <i>tanods</i> of Barangay Sta. Cruz in Puerto Princesa City. However, appellant was dismissed by their <i>barangay</i> chairman, victim Benjamin Tabang, sometime before July 30, 2000. As a result thereof, appellant harbored ill-feelings towards Benjamin.<br><br>On the evening of July 30, 2000, Rolly met the Tabangs on his way to the <i>sari-sari</i> store. Soon thereafter, appellant (armed with a bolo) saw him and inquired about Benjamin's whereabouts. He told appellant that Benjamin was on his way to report for duty as <i>barangay</i> captain. Appellant then divulged his plan to kill Benjamin. Rolly discouraged appellant but appellant did not respond.<br><br>Later that evening, appellant went to Rolly's house and confessed that he had killed Benjamin and his wife, Avelina.<br><br>The next morning, Rolly heard about the Tabangs' death. Out of remorse, he surrendered to police authorities and executed a statement regarding the incident.<br><br>Rolly's wife (appellant's sister), Mary Ann Panaligan, corroborated the testimony of the principal witness. Mary Ann testified that appellant went to see her husband on the evening of July 30, 2000 and the two spoke in a dimly lit area. She brought an improvised light to the area but appellant told her not to light it so she went home.<br><br>Dr. Carla Vigonte was presented as an expert witness. According to Dr. Vigonte, Benjamin suffered four hacking wounds while Avelina bore three hacking wounds and two lacerated wounds. Both victims died due to multiple hacking wounds.<br><br>Appellant denied the allegations against him. According to him, he slept at around 7 p.m. on July 30, 2000 after a long day at work. He did not present any evidence to corroborate his testimony.<br><br>Weighing the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses <i>vis-à-vis</i> appellant's uncorroborated denial, the RTC ruled that denials cannot prevail over the positive declarations of the prosecution's witnesses. Thus, it concluded that appellant killed the Tabangs but found that the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> was present only with respect to Benjamin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In a decision dated August 2, 2004, the RTC found appellant guilty of murder and homicide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for the deaths of Benjamin and Avelina, respectively. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>Therefore, upon a consideration of the foregoing facts and circumstances, the Court:<br><ol><li>Finds [appellant] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <b>Murder </b>in <b>Criminal Case No. 16095</b>, and taking into consideration the presence of aggravating circumstance of nighttime, there being no mitigating circumstance, is meted the penalty of <b>death</b><i> </i>and is ordered to pay by way of civil indemnity the heirs of the victim in the amount of <b>seventy-five thousand pesos </b>(<b>P75,000</b>).<br><br></li><li>Finds [appellant] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <b>Homicide </b>in <b>Criminal Case No. 16096</b>, taking into consideration the presence of the aggravating circumstance of nighttime, there being no mitigating circumstance of, is meted the penalty of <b>imprisonment for seventeen</b> (<b>17</b>) <b>years</b>, <b>four</b> (<b>4</b>) <b>months and one day to twenty years</b> and is directed to pay the heirs of the victim by way of civil indemnity the amount of <b>fifty thousand</b> <b>pesos</b> (<b>P50,000</b>).<br></li></ol>The City Warden of Puerto Princesa City is hereby directed to immediately bring and commit [appellant] to the National Penetentiary in Muntinlupa City.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals (CA), on intermediate appellate review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> affirmed the findings and the ruling of the RTC <i>in toto.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>We affirm appellant's guilt and the penalties and civil liabilities imposed on him.<br><br>With regard to Criminal Case No. 16095, in view of Section 2 of RA 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> appellant is sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole.
