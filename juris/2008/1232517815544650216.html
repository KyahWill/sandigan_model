				<BR><BR>THIS is a tale of a bank officer-depositor clinging to his position after violating&nbsp; bank regulations&nbsp; and falsifying&nbsp; his passbook&nbsp; to cover&nbsp; up a&nbsp; false transaction.<br><div align="justify"><br>Before the Court is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking the reversal of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA).&nbsp; The appealed decision reversed those of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and the Labor Arbiter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal and damages of Ramon Brigido L.

At&nbsp; that&nbsp; time, the account had a balance of US$15,486.07.&nbsp; The Ligao Branch is an off-line branch, i.e., one with no network connection or computer linkage with other PNB branches and the head office.&nbsp; The transaction was evidenced by an Interoffice Savings Account Withdrawal Slip, also known as the Ticket Exchange Center (TEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On July 10, 1995, PNB Escolta Branch received the TEC covering the withdrawal.&nbsp; It was included among the proofsheet entries of Cashier IV Ruben Francisco, Jr.&nbsp; The withdrawal was not, however, posted in the computer of the Escolta Branch when it received said advice.&nbsp; This means that the withdrawal was not recorded.&nbsp; Thus, the account of Velasco had an <u>overstatement</u> of US$15,000.00.<br><br>Sometime in September 1995, while Velasco was on a provincial audit,&nbsp; he claimed&nbsp; calling through&nbsp; phone&nbsp; a kin in&nbsp; Manila who&nbsp; just arrived from abroad.&nbsp; This kin allegedly told him that his New York-based brother, Gregorio Velasco, sent him various checks through his kin totaling US$15,000.00 and that the checks would just be deposited in time in Velasco's account.<br><br>On October 6, 1995, Velasco updated his dollar savings account by depositing US$12.78, reflecting a balance of US$15,486.01.&nbsp; He was allegedly satisfied with the updated balance, as he thought that the US$15,000.00 in his account was the amount given by his brother.<br><br>On different dates, Velasco made several inter-branch withdrawals from the dollar savings account, to wit:<br> <blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%"><b>PNB </b><b>Branch</b> </td> <td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date</b></td> <td width="60%"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amount</b></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>PNB Legaspi </td> <td>November 7, 1995 </td> <td>US $2,000.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>PNB Legaspi </td> <td>November 13, 1995</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,329.97 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Cash Dept.</td> <td>November 23, 1995</td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4,000.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total</b> </td> <td>US $9,329.97</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Mrs. Belen Velasco <del cite="mailto:Supreme%20Court" datetime="2008-06-13T11:57"></del>also withdrew several amounts on the dollar account, <i>viz.</i>:<br> <blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%"><b>PNB</b><b> Branch</b></td> <td width="20%"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date</b></td> <td width="60%"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amount</b></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>PNB CEPZ</td> <td>December 6, 1995</td> <td>US$11,494.00</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>PNB Frisco</td> <td>January 2, 1996 </td> <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,292.32 </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total</b> </td> <td>US$12,786.32 </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Subsequently, the dollar savings account of the spouses was closed.<br><br>On February 6, 1996, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; course of conducting&nbsp; an audit&nbsp; at&nbsp; PNB Escolta Branch, Molina D.

Hermoso, required<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Velasco to submit a written explanation concerning the incident.<br><br>On February 12, 1996, he submitted his sworn letter-explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; He described the inter-branch withdrawal at PNB Ligao, Albay Branch on June 30, 1995 as "<u>no-book</u>," i.e., without the corresponding presentation to the bank teller of the savings passbook.&nbsp; He stated, among others, that his withdrawal was accommodated as the statement of account showed a balance of US$15,486.01, and that he is personally known to the officers and staff, being a former colleague at the PNB Ligao, Albay Branch.<br><br>On February 27, 1996, PNB Ligao, Albay Branch division chief III, Rexor Quiambao, financial specialist II, Emma Gacer, and division chief II, Renato M. Letada, confirmed the "no-book" withdrawal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 1996, PNB formally charged Velasco with "<i>Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and/or Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service for the irregular handling of Dollar Savings Account No. </i><i>010-7146</i><i>98-9</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The administrative charge alleged that: (1) he transacted a no-book withdrawal against his Dollar Savings Account No. 010-714698-9 at PNB Ligao, Albay Branch&nbsp; in violation of Section&nbsp; 1216&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Manual&nbsp; of Regulations for Banks; (2) in transacting the no-book withdrawal, he failed to present any letter of introduction as required under General Circular 3-72/92; (3) the irregular inter-branch withdrawal was aggravated by the failure of Escolta Branch to post/enter the withdrawal into the computer upon receipt of the TEC advice, resulting in the overstatement of the account balance by US$15,000.00; and (4) since he was presumed to be fully aware that neither the deposit nor withdrawal of the US$15,000.00 was reflected on the passbook, he was able to appropriate the amount for his personal benefit, free of interest, to the damage and prejudice of PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On April 8, 1996, PNB withheld his rice and sugar subsidy, dental/optical/outpatient medical benefits, consolidated medical benefits, commutation of hospitalization benefits, clothing allowance, longevity pay, anniversary bonus, Christmas bonus and cash gift, performance incentive award, and mid-year financial assistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; On April 10, 1996, he was placed under preventive suspension for a period of ninety (90) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On May 2, 1996, Velasco submitted his sworn Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to the administrative charge against him.&nbsp; Unlike his previous answer, he here claimed that his withdrawal on June 30, 1995 was "<u>with passbook</u>." As proof, he attached a copy of his passbook<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> bearing the withdrawal entry of&nbsp; US$15,000.00 on June 30, 1995. <b> </b>Explaining the inconsistency with his sworn letter-explanation on February 12, 1996, he said his initial answer was made under&nbsp; pressing&nbsp; circumstances.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; find&nbsp; his passbook which was then kept by his wife who could not be contacted at that moment.<br><br>On October 2, 1996, the Administrative Adjudication Office (AAO) of PNB composed of Fernando R. Mangubat, Jr., Wilfredo S. Verzosa, Celso D. Benologa, and Jesse L. Figueroa exonerated Velasco of the charges of dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service.&nbsp; However, he was found <u>guilty of grave misconduct</u>, mitigated by length of service and absence of actual loss to PNB.&nbsp; Thus, he was meted the penalty of forced <u>resignation with benefits</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On October 31, 1996, Velasco was formally notified of the findings of the AAO after its approval by the management.&nbsp; As of that time, he had been employed with PNB for eighteen (18) years, holding the position of <u>Manager 1 of the IAD</u>.&nbsp; He was earning P14,932.00 per month plus a monthly allowance of P3,940.00 or a total salary of P18,872.00 per month.<br><br>On December 22, 1997, he filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> against PNB for illegal suspension, illegal dismissal, and damages before the NLRC.<br><center><br><b>Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On July 9, 1999, Labor Arbiter Pablo C. Espiritu gave judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal against respondents for want of merit.<br><br></li><li>Ordering PNB to pay complainant unpaid wages for the period May 12, 1996 to October 31, 1996 in the amount of P103,796.00.<br><br></li><li>Dismissing complainant's claims for damages and other monetary claims for lack of merit.<br></li></ol><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>In his ruling, the Labor Arbiter opined that as an employee and officer of PNB for eighteen (18) years, Velasco is expected to know bank procedures, including the expected entries in a savings passbook.&nbsp; Even if it should be assumed that he presented his passbook when he withdrew US$15,000.00 at the PNB Ligao Branch on June 30, 1995, he should have known that there was something wrong with the amounts credited to his account when he made an update on October 6, 1995. Being an audit officer, and fully aware of his withdrawal of US$15,000.00, he should have made inquiries on the inconsistency of the entries in his passbook.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter also found as flimsy the argument that the additional&nbsp; US$15,000.00 was&nbsp; the amount given to&nbsp; Velasco by&nbsp; his&nbsp; brother from the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; As early as October 6, 1995, when he updated his passbook, Velasco should have known that (1) his brother's checks in the amount of US$15,000.00 have not been deposited in his dollar savings account and (2) he appears to have been improperly credited with US$15,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Labor Arbiter held that the entry in the passbook purportedly reflecting the withdrawal of US$15,000.00 is a forgery.&nbsp; It was done to conform to the defense of Velasco that he presented his passbook on June 30, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the charge of illegal suspension, the Labor Arbiter held that the preventive suspension of Velasco was reasonable in view of the sensitive nature of his position. It was also necessary to protect the records of PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It follows that the withholding of his company benefits is reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Nonetheless, he should be paid his salary from May 12, 1996 up to October 31, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>His claim for damages and attorney's fees must be denied because PNB did not violate his rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied with the decision of the Labor Arbiter, both Velasco<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and PNB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> appealed to the NLRC.<br><br>On&nbsp; July 31, 2000,&nbsp; the NLRC affirmed with modification the Labor Arbiter decision, disposing, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED to the extent that the award of unpaid salaries is hereby REDUCED to the complainant's salaries from May 27, 1996 to July 31, 1996. Other dispositions in the appealed decision stands (<i>sic</i>) affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>In sustaining the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC held that Velasco's lack of knowledge of the non-posting of his withdrawal is not credible.&nbsp; Even a cursory look&nbsp; at his&nbsp; passbook shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; no&nbsp; deposit of&nbsp; US$15,000.00 was ever made.&nbsp; That there was still a balance of more than US$15,000.00 in his account after the withdrawal he made on June 30, 1995 could only mean that the withdrawal was never posted.&nbsp; Worse, based also on the entries in his passbook, it is clear that the withdrawal on June 30, 1995 was a "no-book" transaction. The withdrawal of US$15,000.00 was not taken into consideration in the determination of the balance of June 30, 1995 and the succeeding dates.&nbsp; Thus, it is clear that the entry in question was falsified.&nbsp; It was made merely to bolster his subsequent claim that he presented his passbook when he withdrew on June 30, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The NLRC concluded that the falsification of the passbook shows deceit on the part of Velasco.&nbsp; He took advantage of his position.&nbsp; The posting of the falsified entry could not have been made without, or was at least facilitated by, his being an employee of the bank.&nbsp; Thus, his subsequent withdrawals amounted&nbsp; to losses&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank.&nbsp; He&nbsp; made those withdrawals&nbsp; from his&nbsp; account with&nbsp; full&nbsp; knowledge that&nbsp; the balance&nbsp; of his passbook of more than US$15,000.00 was attributed to the non-posting of the June 30, 1995 withdrawal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The&nbsp; NLRC also&nbsp; held that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; preventively suspended for more than thirty (30) days as of May 27, 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he was paid his salaries from August 1, 1996 to October 31, 1996, he may recover only his salary from May 27, 1996 to July 31, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Like the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC held that Velasco may not recover damages.&nbsp; His dismissal was not done oppressively or in bad faith.&nbsp; Neither was he subjected to unnecessary embarrassment or humiliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, Velasco elevated the matter to the CA by way of petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; On April 22, 2004, the CA rendered the assailed decision, the <i>fallo</i> stating, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>for the foregoing discussions, We <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the findings of public respondent NLRC and Labor Arbiter and hereby enter a decision ordering PNB to pay petitioner a separation pay equivalent to half-month salary for every year of service, plus backwages from the time of his illegal termination up to the finality of this decision.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>According to the CA, the failure of Velasco to present his passbook and a letter of introduction does not constitute misconduct.<b>&nbsp; </b>Assuming for the sake of argument that he committed a serious misconduct in not properly monitoring his account with ordinary diligence and prudence, the same may be said of PNB when it failed to make the necessary posting of his withdrawal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, the alleged offense of Velasco is not work-related to constitute just cause for his dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><center><br><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>PNB has filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, putting forth the following issues for Our resolution, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS <u>ERRED</u> AND GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION <u>IN FINDING THAT RESPONDENT HAS BEEN ILLEGALLY DISMISSED BY THE PETITIONERS</u>.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS <u>ERRED</u> AND GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION <u>IN DIRECTING PNB TO PAY RESPONDENT SEPARATION PAY AND BACKWAGES</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>We add a third issue which was raised by PNB before the CA but was, however, left unresolved: whether Velasco took the correct recourse when he elevated the decision of the NLRC to the CA by way of petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 43.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b>I.&nbsp; <i>Appeal does not lie from the decision of the NLRC</i></b>.<br><br>We first address the procedural question on the propriety of the Rule 43 petition.&nbsp; Rule 43 provides for appeal from quasi-judicial agencies to the CA by way of petition for review.&nbsp; Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> or appeal by <i>certiorari</i> is a recourse to the Supreme Court under Rule 45.<br><br>The mode of appeal resorted to by Velasco is wrong because appeal is not the proper remedy in elevating to the CA the decision of the NLRC.&nbsp; Section 2, Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is explicit that Rule 43 "shall not apply to judgments or final orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines."<br><br>The correct remedy that should have been availed of is the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.&nbsp; As this Court held in the case of <i>Pure Foods Corporation v.

Velasco violated bank rules when he transacted a "no-book" withdrawal by his failure to present his passbook to the PNB Ligao, Albay Branch on June 30, 1995.&nbsp; Section 1216 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks and Other Financial Intermediaries state that "[b]anks are prohibited from issuing/accepting `withdrawal authority slips' or any other similar instruments designed to effect withdrawals of savings deposits without following the usual practice of requiring the depositors concerned to present their passbooks and accomplishing the necessary withdrawal slips."<br><br>Further, he failed to present any letter of introduction as mandated under General Circular 3-72-92 which requires that "[b]efore going out-of-town, the Depositor secures a Letter of Introduction from the branch/office where his Peso Savings Account is maintained."<br><br>The presentation of passbook and letter of introduction is not without a valid reason.&nbsp; As aptly stated by the IAD of PNB:<br><blockquote>Considering that the PNB Ligao, Albay Branch is an offline branch, it is a must that an LOI and the passbook be presented by the depositor before any withdrawal is allowed.&nbsp; This procedure is required in order for the negotiating branch to determine or ascertain the available balance and the specimen signature of the withdrawing party. Moreover, the maintaining branch upon issuance of the LOI shall place a "hold" on the account in the computer as an internal control procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>True, a strict reading of General Circular 3-72-92 would lead one to conclude that only persons with peso savings account are required to secure a letter of introduction. However, simple logic dictates that those maintaining dollar savings account are also included.&nbsp; No cogent reason would be served by the rule if only persons with peso savings account are required to get a letter of introduction.&nbsp; Otherwise, there can be a circumvention of the rule.&nbsp; <i>Nemo</i><i> potest facere per alium qud non potest facere per directum</i>.&nbsp; No one is allowed to do indirectly what he is prohibited to do directly.&nbsp; <b><i>Sinuman</i></b><b><i> ay hindi pinapayagang gawin nang hindi tuwiran ang ipinagbabawal gawin nang tuwiran</i></b>.<br><br>As an audit officer, Velasco should be the first to ensure that banking laws, policies, rules and regulations, are strictly observed and applied by its officers in the day-to-day transactions. The banking system is an indispensable institution&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; modern&nbsp; world. It plays a vital role in the economic life of every civilized nation.&nbsp; Whether banks act as mere passive entities for the safekeeping and saving of money, or as active instruments of business and commerce, they have become an ubiquitous presence among the citizenry, who have come to regard them with respect and even gratitude and, most of all, confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The CA, however, opined that the failure of Velasco to abide by the rules is not serious misconduct because (1) from the admission of PNB itself, allowing bank personnel who are out-of-town to make a "no-book" transaction without a letter of introduction is considered a<b> </b>common practice, and (2) the approving officers of PNB Ligao Branch should have also been administratively charged considering that the "no-book" transaction could not have pushed through without their approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <i>Santos v.

People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> is illustrative on this score. Perez, an acting municipal treasurer, submitted two contradicting answers explaining the location of the missing funds under his custody and control: the <u>first</u>, reiterating his previous verbal admission before the audit team that part of the money was used to pay for the loan of his late brother, another portion was spent for the food of his family, and the rest for his medicine; and the <u>second</u>, claiming that the alleged missing amount was in the possession and custody of his accountable personnel at the time of the audit examination.<br><br>This Court held that the sudden turnaround of Perez was merely an afterthought.&nbsp; He "only changed his story to exonerate himself, after realizing that his first Answer put him in a hole, so to speak."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Neither did the Court believe that his alleged sickness affected the preparation of his first Answer.&nbsp; Perez "presented no convincing evidence that his disease at the time he formulated that Answer diminished his capacity to formulate a true, clear and coherent response to any query.&nbsp; In fact, its contents merely reiterated his verbal explanation to the auditing team on January 5, 1989 on how he disposed of the missing funds."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>We find no cogent reason to depart from Our ruling in <i>Perez</i>.&nbsp; The claim of Velasco that his initial answer was made under pressing circumstances is too flimsy an excuse.&nbsp; It partakes of the nature of an alibi.&nbsp; As such, it constitutes a self-serving negative evidence which cannot he accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testified on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; The Court has consistently frowned&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the defense&nbsp; of alibi,&nbsp; and&nbsp; received it&nbsp; with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it can be easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Also worth noting is that Velasco never imputed any ill motive on the part of Rexor, Gacer, and Letada who collectively narrated that the June 30, 1995 withdrawal was a no-book transaction.&nbsp; They confirmed his earlier version that he did not present his passbook when he withdrew the US$15,000.00 on June 30, 1995.&nbsp; In any case, the fact that he changed his stance puts his credibility in doubt.&nbsp; Was he lying when he submitted his sworn letter-explanation of February 12, 1996, or when he submitted his sworn Answer dated April 30, 1996?&nbsp; <i>Allegans</i> <i>contraria</i> <i>non est audiendus</i>.&nbsp; He is not to be heard who alleges things contradictory to each other.&nbsp; <b><i>Hindi dapat pakinggan ang nagsasabi ng mga bagay na salungat sa isa't-isa</i></b>.<b><i></i></b><br><br>Velasco did not only violate bank rules and regulations.&nbsp; What compounds his offense was his unusual silence.&nbsp; He never informed PNB about the huge overstatement of US$15,000.00 in his account.&nbsp; He updated his passbook on October 6, 1995 by depositing US$12.78.&nbsp; Thus, as early as that date, he should have known that something was wrong with the credited balance in his passbook and reported it immediately to the concerned officers of PNB.&nbsp; What he did, instead, was to keep mum until PNB discovered the incident and notified him on February 7, 1996, or almost eight (8) months after his no-book withdrawal on June 30, 1995.<br><br>With his silence, he clearly intended to gain at the expense of PNB. The omission to report is not trivial or inconsequential because it gave him the opportunity to withdraw from his dollar savings account more than its real balance, as what he actually did. He took advantage of the overstatement of his account, instead of protecting the interest of the bank.&nbsp; It would be impossible for him not to detect the error at the time he deposited US$12.78 on October 6, 1995, because his account had a big balance despite the fact that no large amount of money was deposited.<br><br>His claim that he was satisfied with the updated balance of US$15,486.01 on October 6, 1995, as he thought that the US$15,000.00 in his account was the amount given by his brother, is simply unbelievable.&nbsp; It is a desperate attempt at exculpation.&nbsp; The deposit of the money from his brother&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been reflected in&nbsp; the on-line&nbsp; computer&nbsp; of&nbsp; PNB.&nbsp; The deposit would have also been posted for update upon the presentation of the passbook on October 6, 1995.&nbsp; No deposit of US$15,000.00 was, however, reflected in the passbook.<br><br>In <i>Aboitiz</i><i> Shipping Corporation v.

Treating respondent in the same manner as the loyal and code-abiding employees, despite the timely discovery of her Code violations, may indeed have a demoralizing effect on the entire bank.
