				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Case</b><br></div><br>This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Regional Trial Court's Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 2 May 2002 in Civil Case No. 5343 as well as the 19 November 2002 Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration. In the assailed orders, Branch 8 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Batangas City (RTC-Branch 8) reversed the 28 March 2001 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> issued by Branch 3 of RTC-Batangas City (RTC-Branch 3). RTC-Branch 8 declared that under its legislative franchise, Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (petitioner) is not exempt from paying real property tax assessed by the Batangas City Government (respondent).<br><br><b>The Facts</b><br><br><div align="justify">On 17 February 1994, Republic Act No. 7678 (RA 7678)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> granted petitioner a 25-year franchise to install, operate and maintain telecommunications systems throughout the Philippines. Section 5 of RA 7678 reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>Tax Provisions</i>. - <b>The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property <u>exclusive of this franchise</u> as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay</b>. In addition thereto, the grantee shall pay to the Bureau of Internal Revenue each year, within thirty (30) days after the audit and approval of the accounts, a franchise tax as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under this franchise by the grantee; <i>Provided</i>, That the grantee shall continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 72 unless the latter enactment is amended or repealed, in which case the amendment or repeal shall be applicable thereto.<br><br>The grantee shall file the return with and pay the tax due thereon to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative in accordance with the National Internal Revenue Code and the return shall be subject to audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Sometime in 1997, respondent issued a building permit for the installation of petitioner's telecommunications facilities in Batangas City. After the installation of the facilities, petitioner applied with the Mayor's office of Batangas City for a permit to operate. Because of a discrepancy in the actual investment costs used in computing the prescribed fees for the clearances and permits, petitioner was not able to secure a Mayor's Permit for the year 1998. Petitioner was also advised to settle its unpaid realty taxes.  However, petitioner claimed exemption from the payment of realty tax, citing the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678, the Letter-Opinion of the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) dated 8 April 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and the letter of the Office of the President dated 12 March 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In 1999, respondent refused to issue a Mayor's Permit to petitioner without payment of its realty taxes.<br><br>On 22 June 1999, petitioner paid P68,890.39 under protest as fees for the permit to operate, but respondent refused to accept the payment unless petitioner also paid the realty taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 2 July 1999, respondent threatened to close down petitioner's operations. Hence, on 3 July 1999, petitioner instituted a complaint for prohibition and mandamus with prayer for a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction. This case was raffled to RTC-Branch 3.  On the same date, respondent served a Cease and Desist Order on petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 20 January 2000, during the pendency of the complaint, petitioner paid its realty taxes of P2,043,265 under protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Petitioner resumed its business, rendering the other issues raised in petitioner's complaint moot. Consequently, the only issue left for resolution is whether petitioner is exempt from the realty tax under Section 5 of RA 7678.<br><br><b>The Ruling of  RTC -Branch 3</b><br><br>On 28 March 2001, RTC-Branch 3 issued the following Order:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court hereby declares that the real estate, buildings and personal property of plaintiff Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. which are used in the operation of its franchise are exempt from payment of real property taxes, but those not so used should be held liable thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>RTC-Branch 3 reasoned that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 limits the real properties that are subject to realty tax only to those which are not used in petitioner's telecommunications business. In short, petitioner's real properties used in its telecommunications business are not subject to realty tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 1 May 2001, respondent moved for reconsideration. Before acting on the motion, the Presiding Judge of RTC-Branch 3 voluntarily inhibited himself because the newly-elected mayor of Batangas City was his <i>kumpadre</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  The case was re-raffled to RTC-Branch 8.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of  RTC -Branch 8</u></b><br></div><br>On 2 May 2002, RTC-Branch 8 issued an Order which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the defendants' Motion for Reconsideration is hereby granted. The Order of this Court dated March 21, 2001 is hereby set aside and, in lieu thereof, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff:<br><br>-   <b>DISMISSING</b> the Amended Complaint;<br><br>-   <b>DECLARING</b> that the plaintiff Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., under its legislative franchise RA No. 7678, is not exempted from the payment of real property tax being collected by the defendant City of Batangas and, accordingly,<br><br>-         <b>ORDERING</b> said plaintiff to pay the City of Batangas real estate taxes in the amount of Ph4,620,683.33 which was due as of January, 2000, as well as those due thereafter, plus corresponding interest and penalties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>On 29 May 2002, petitioner moved for reconsideration.   On 19 November 2002, RTC-Branch 8 denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></div><br>The sole issue for resolution is whether, under the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678, petitioner's real properties used in its telecommunications business are exempt from the realty tax.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Petitioner's Contentions</u></b><br></div><br>Petitioner contends that its exemption from realty tax is based on the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678.  Petitioner claims that the evident purpose of the phrase "<b>exclusive of this franchise</b>" is to limit the real properties that are subject to realty tax only to properties that are not used in petitioner's telecommunications business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Petitioner asserts that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" must not be construed as a useless surplusage. Petitioner points out that its exemption from realty tax was affirmed in two separate opinions, one rendered by the Office of the President on 12 March 1996 and the other by the BLGF on 8 April 1997 and reaffirmed on 4 January 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The BLGF declared that "the real properties of Digitel, which are used in the operation of its franchise are x x x found to be exempt from the payment of real property taxes beginning 1 January 1993. However, all other properties of that company not used in connection with the operation of its franchise shall remain taxable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argues that under the Local Government Code, the realty tax is imposed on all lands, buildings, machineries and other improvements attached to real property. A franchise is an incorporeal being, a special privilege granted by the legislature. Hence, to read the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 to mean that the franchisee shall pay taxes on its real properties used in its telecommunications business would render the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" meaningless.<br><br>Petitioner admits that the franchise granted under RA 7678 is a personal property, but the franchise is not the "personal property" referred to in the first sentence of Section 5. Petitioner asserts that the phrase "real estate, buildings, and personal property" in the first sentence of Section 5 refers solely to real properties and does not include personal properties. Petitioner explains thus:<br><blockquote>For PTEs (public telecommunication entities), these personal properties include the switches which were installed in the exchange buildings as well as the outside and inside plant equipment.  Initially, these telecommunications materials and equipment were personal property in character. But, having been installed and made operational by being attached to the exchange building, they are now converted into immovables or real property.  <b>That being the case, the phrase "<i>real estate, buildings and personal property</i>" actually refer[s] to properties that are liable for real estate tax.</b> And, Congress having made the qualification with the phrase "exclusive of this franchise," only such real properties that are not used in furtherance of the franchise are subject to real property tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondent's Contentions</b><br></div><br>Respondent contends that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" does not mean that petitioner is exempt from the realty tax on its real properties used in its telecommunications business. The first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 makes petitioner "liable to pay the same taxes for its real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of this franchise as other persons or corporations are or hereafter may be required by law to pay." This shows the clear intent of Congress to tax petitioner's real and personal properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Respondent asserts that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" is a qualification of the broad declaration on the franchisee's  liability for taxes which is the main thrust of the first sentence of Section 5. Respondent points out that petitioner is paying taxes and fees on all its motor vehicles, which are personal properties, without distinction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Respondent also points out that petitioner admits that the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 is ambiguous with respect to the phrase "exclusive of this franchise,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> thus petitioner resorted to the rules on statutory construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Respondent adds that the legislative franchises granted to other telecommunications companies contain the same phrase "exclusive of this franchise."  This shows the intent of Congress to make franchisees liable for the realty tax rather than exempt them even if the real properties are  used in their telecommunications business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), appearing for respondent,  contends that the first sentence of Section 5 provides for petitioner's general liability to pay taxes and does not provide for petitioner's exemption from  realty tax.  The OSG invokes the doctrine of last antecedent which is an aid in statutory construction.  The OSG argues that under this doctrine, the qualifying word or phrase only restricts the word or phrase to which the qualifying word or phrase is immediately associated and not the word or phrase which is distantly or remotely located. In the first sentence of Section 5, the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" restricts only the words "personal property" which immediately precede the phrase "exclusive of this franchise."  This means that the franchise, an intangible personal property,  should be excluded from the personal properties that are subject to taxes under the first sentence of Section 5.  The OSG adds that the use of the comma to separate "real estate, buildings" from "personal property" exerts a dominant influence in the application of the doctrine of last antecedent. Further, the OSG reiterates that laws granting exemption from tax are to be construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing power.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></div><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 5 of RA 7678 imposes taxes </span></i></b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>and does not exempt from realty tax</i></b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"></div><br>The issue in this case involves the interpretation of the phrase "<b>exclusive of this franchise</b>" in the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678.<br><br>Section 5 of RA 7678 states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>Tax Provisions</i>. - <b>The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of this franchise as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay</b>. In addition thereto, the grantee shall pay to the Bureau of Internal Revenue each year, within thirty (30) days after the audit and approval of the accounts, a franchise tax as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under this franchise by the grantee; <i>Provided</i>, That the grantee shall continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 72 unless the latter enactment is amended or repealed, in which case the amendment or repeal shall be applicable thereto.<br><br>The grantee shall file the return with and pay the tax due thereon to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative in accordance with the National Internal Revenue Code and the return shall be subject to audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 is the same provision found in almost all legislative franchises in the telecommunications industry dating back to 1905.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>   It is also the same provision that appears in the legislative franchises of other telecommunications companies like Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Smart Information Technologies, Inc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and Globe Telecom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>    Since 1905, no telecommunications company has claimed exemption from realty tax based on the phrase "exclusive of this franchise," until petitioner filed the present case on 3 July 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The first sentence of Section 5 clearly states that the legislative franchisee shall be liable to pay the following taxes: (1) "the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, <b>and personal property exclusive of this franchise</b> as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay"; (2) "franchise tax as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under this franchise";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and (3) "income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code."<br><br>The crux of the controversy lies in the interpretation of the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in the first sentence of Section 5.  Petitioner interprets the phrase to mean that its real properties that are used in its telecommunications business shall not be subject to realty tax.  Respondent interprets the same phrase to mean that the term "personal property" shall not include petitioner's franchise, which is an intangible personal property.<br><br>We rule that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" simply means that petitioner's franchise shall not be subject to the taxes imposed in the first sentence of Section 5.  The first sentence lists the properties that are subject to taxes, and <b>the list excludes the franchise</b>.  Thus, the first sentence provides:<br><blockquote>The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property <b>exc lusive of this franchise</b> as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A plain reading shows that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" is meant to <b>exclude</b> the legislative franchise from the properties subject to taxes under the first sentence.  In effect, petitioner's franchise, which is a personal property, is not subject to the taxes imposed on properties under the first sentence of Section 5.<br><br>However, petitioner's gross receipts from its franchise are subject to the "franchise tax" under the second sentence of Section 5.  Thus, the second sentence provides:<br><blockquote>In addition thereto, the grantee shall pay to the Bureau of Internal Revenue each year, within thirty (30) days after the audit and approval of the accounts, a <b>franchise tax</b> as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under this franchise by the grantee; x x x  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In short, petitioner's franchise is excluded from the properties taxable under the first sentence of Section 5 but the gross receipts from its franchise are expressly taxable under the second sentence of the same Section.<br><br>The first sentence of Section 5 imposes on the franchisee the "<b>same taxes</b>" that non-franchisees are subject to with respect to real and personal properties.  The clear intent is to put the franchisees and non-franchisees <b>in parity</b> in the taxation of their real and personal properties.  Since non-franchisees have obviously no franchises, the franchise must be excluded from the list of properties subject to tax to maintain the parity between the franchisees and non-franchisees.  However, the franchisee is taxable separately from its franchise.  Thus, the second sentence of Section 5 imposes the "franchise tax" on gross receipts, which under Republic Act No. 7716 has been replaced by the 10% Valued Added Tax effective 1 January 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Section 5 can be divided into three parts.  First is the first sentence which imposes taxes on real and personal properties, excluding one  property, that is, the franchise.   This puts in parity the franchisees and non-franchisees in the taxation of real and personal properties.    Second is the second sentence which imposes the franchise tax, which is  applicable solely to the  franchisee. And third is the proviso in the second sentence that imposes the income tax on the franchisee, the same income tax payable by non-franchisees.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the first sentence refers only to real properties, and that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" exempts petitioner from realty tax on its real properties used in its telecommunications business.  This claim has no basis in the language of the law as written in the first sentence of Section 5.   First, the first sentence expressly refers to taxes on "real estate" and on "personal property."  Clearly, the first sentence does not refer only to taxes on real properties, but also to taxes on personal properties. The trial court correctly observed that petitioner pays taxes on its motor vehicles,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which are personal properties, that are used in its telecommunications business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>   There is also the documentary stamp tax on transactions involving real and personal properties, which petitioner and other taxpayers are liable for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>A franchise granted by Congress to operate a private radio station for the franchisee's communications in deep-sea fishing shows that the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 does not refer to real properties alone.  Section 6 of Republic Act No. 3218 (RA 3218), entitled <i>An Act Granting Batas Riego De Dios A Franchise To Construct, Maintain And Operate Private Radio Stations For Radio Communications In Its Deep-Sea Fishing Industry</i>, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 6.   The grantee shall be liable (1) to pay the same taxes on its real estate, <b>building, fishing boats and personal property, exclusive of this franchise </b>as other persons or corporations are now, or hereafter may be required by law to pay, and shall further be liable (2) to pay all other taxes that may be imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code by reason of this franchise. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The inclusion of "<b>fishing boats</b>," personal properties that can never be attached to a land or building so as to make them real properties, demonstrates that Section 6 of RA 3218, like the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678, not only applies to real properties but also to personal properties.<br><br>Second, there is no language in the first sentence of Section 5 expressly or even impliedly exempting petitioner from the <b>realty tax</b>.  The phrases "exemption from real estate tax," "free from real estate tax" or "not subject to real estate tax" do not appear in the first sentence. No matter how one reads the first sentence, there is no grant of exemption, express or implied, from realty tax. In fact, the first sentence expressly imposes taxes on both real and personal properties, excluding only the intangible personal property that is the franchise.<br><br>A tax exemption cannot arise from vague inference. The first sentence of Section 5 does not grant any express or even implied exemption from  realty tax. On the contrary, the first sentence categorically states that the franchisee is subject to the "<b>same taxes</b> currently imposed, and those taxes that may be subsequently imposed, on other persons or corporations," taxpayers that admittedly are all subject to realty tax. The first sentence does not limit the imposition of the "same taxes" to realty tax only   but even to "those taxes" that may in the future be imposed on other taxpayers, which future taxes shall also be imposed on petitioner. Thus, the first sentence of Section 5 imposes on petitioner not only realty tax but also other taxes.<br><br>The phrase "personal property exclusive of this franchise" merely means that "personal property" does not include the franchise even if the franchise is an intangible personal property.  Stated differently, the first sentence of Section 5 provides that petitioner shall pay tax on its real properties as well as on its personal properties but the franchise, which is an intangible personal property, shall not be deemed personal property.<br><br>The historical usage of the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in franchise laws enacted by Congress indubitably shows that the phrase is not a grant of tax exemption, but an exclusion of one type of personal property subject to taxes, and the excluded personal property is the franchise.  Thus, the franchises of telecommunications companies in Republic Act Nos. 4137,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> 5692,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> 5739,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> 5785,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> 5790,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> 5791,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> 5795,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> 5810,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> 5847,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> 5848,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> 5856,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> 5857,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> 5913,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> 5914,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> 5929,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> 5937,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> 5958,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> 5959,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> 5974,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> 5993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> 5994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> 6002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> 6006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> 6007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> 6013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> 6024,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> 6097,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> 6510,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> 6536,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and 6530<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> contain the following <b>common tax provision</b>:<br><blockquote>The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes, <b>unless exempted therefrom</b>, on its business, real estate, buildings, and personal property, <b>exclusive of this franchise</b>, as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The phrase "<b>unless exempted therefrom</b>" in the common provision clearly clarifies that the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" does not grant any tax exemption.  To claim   tax exemption, there must be an express exemption from tax in another provision of law. On the other hand, the deletion of the phrase "unless exempted therefrom" from the common provision does not give rise to any tax exemption.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Bayantel</i> <i> and Digitel Cases</i></b><br></div><br>In <i>City Government of Quezon City v. Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> this Court's Second Division held that "all realties which are actually, directly and exclusively used in the operation of its franchise are `exempted' from any property tax." The Second Division added that Bayantel's franchise being national in character, the "exemption" granted applies to all its real and personal properties found anywhere within the Philippines. The Second Division reasoned in this wise:<br><blockquote>The legislative intent expressed in the phrase `<b>exclusive of this franchise'</b> cannot be construed other than distinguishing between two (2) sets of properties, be they real or personal, owned by the franchisee, namely, (a) those actually, directly and exclusively used in its radio or telecommunications business, and (b) those properties which are not so used. It is worthy to note that the properties subject of the present controversy are only those which are admittedly falling under the first category.<br><br>To the mind of the Court, Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 effectively works to grant or delegate to local governments of Congress' inherent power to tax the franchisee's properties belonging to the second group of properties indicated above, that is, all properties which, "exclusive of this franchise," are not actually and directly used in the pursuit of its franchise. As may be recalled, the taxing power of local governments under both the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions solely depended upon an enabling law. Absent such enabling law, local government units were without authority to impose and collect taxes on real properties within their respective territorial jurisdictions. While Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 3259 may be validly viewed as an implied delegation of power to tax, the delegation under that provision, as couched, is limited to impositions over properties of the franchisee which are not actually, directly and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise. Necessarily, other properties of Bayantel directly used in the pursuit of its business are beyond the pale of the delegated taxing power of local governments. In a very real sense, therefore, real properties of Bayantel, save those exclusive of its franchise, are subject to realty taxes. <b>Ultimately, therefore, the inevitable result was that all realties which are actually, directly and exclusively used in the operation of its franchise are "exempted" from any property tax. </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Digitel) v.  Province  of  Pangasinan ,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court's Third Division ruled that Digitel's real properties located within the territorial jurisdiction of Pangasinan that are actually, directly and exclusively used in its franchise are exempt from realty tax under the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678. The Third Division  explained thus:<br><blockquote>The more pertinent issue to consider is whether or not, by passing Republic Act No. 7678, Congress intended to exempt petitioner DIGITEL's real properties actually, directly and exclusively used by the grantee in its franchise.<br><br>The fact that Republic Act No. 7678 was a later piece of legislation can be taken to mean that Congress, knowing fully well that the Local Government Code had already withdrawn exemptions from real property taxes, chose to restore such immunity even to a limited degree. Accordingly:<br><br>The Court views this subsequent piece of legislation as an express and real intention on the part of Congress to once again remove from the LGC's delegated taxing power, all of the franchisee's x x x properties that are actually, directly and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise.<br><br>In view of the unequivocal intent of Congress to exempt from real property tax those real properties actually, directly and exclusively used by petitioner DIGITEL in the pursuit of its franchise, respondent Province of Pangasinan can only levy real property tax on the remaining real properties of the grantee located within its territorial jurisdiction not part of the above-stated classification. Said exemption, however, merely applies from the time of the effectivity of petitioner DIGITEL's legislative franchise and not a moment sooner.<br></blockquote>Nowhere in the language of the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678 does it expressly or even impliedly provide that petitioner's real properties that are actually, directly and exclusively used in its telecommunications business are exempt from payment of realty tax. On the contrary, the first sentence of Section 5 specifically states that the petitioner, as the franchisee, shall pay the "same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of this franchise as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay."<br><br>The heading of Section 5 is "Tax Provisions," not Tax Exemptions.  To reiterate, the phrase "exemption from real estate tax" or other words conveying exemption from realty tax do not appear in the first sentence of Section 5.  The phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in the first sentence of Section 5  merely qualifies the phrase "personal property" to exclude petitioner's legislative franchise, which is an intangible personal property.  Petitioner's franchise is subject to tax in the second sentence of Section 5 which imposes the "franchise tax."  Thus, there is no grant of tax exemption in the first sentence of Section 5.<br><br>The interpretation of the phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in the <i>Bayantel</i> and <i>Digitel</i> cases goes against the basic principle in construing tax exemptions. In <i>PLDT v. City of Davao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court held that "tax exemptions should be granted only by clear and unequivocal provision of law on the basis of language too plain to be mistaken. They cannot be extended by mere implication or inference."<br><br>Tax exemptions must be clear and unequivocal. A taxpayer claiming a tax exemption must point to a specific provision of law conferring on the taxpayer, in clear and plain terms, exemption from a common burden. Any doubt whether a tax exemption exists is resolved against the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>RCPI case</i></b><br></div><br>In <i>Radio Communications of the Philippines, Inc.

The Court added that:<br><blockquote>RCPI cannot also invoke the equality of treatment clause under Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925. <b>The franchises of Smart, Islacom, TeleTech, Bell, Major Telecoms, Island Country, and IslaTel,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><b> all expressly declare that the franchisee shall pay the real estate tax, using words similar to Section 14 of RA 2036, as amended.</b> The provisions of these subsequent telecommunication franchises imposing the real estate tax on franchisees only confirm that RCPI is subject to the real estate tax. Otherwise, RCPI will stick out like a sore thumb, being the only telecommunications company exempt from the real estate tax, in mockery of the spirit of equality of treatment that RCPI is invoking, not to mention the violation of the constitutional rule on uniformity of taxation.<br><br>It is an elementary rule in taxation that exemptions are strictly construed against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.

Rodriguez Jr. Avenue<br>Bagumbayan, Quezon City<br><br>Sir:<br><br>This refers to your letter dated January 28, 1997, requesting opinion concerning the exemption from real property taxes of DIGITEL pursuant to the provisions of its franchise (R.A. No. 7678), which was approved on February 17, 1994.<br><br>That company advanced the contention that Digitel "is not liable to pay the aforementioned tax" on its "real estate, buildings and personal property... inclusive of its franchise," in view of the provisions of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7678 (Digitel's legislative franchise) which, among others, provides that "[T]he grantee (Digitel) shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of this franchise, x x x."<br><br>Moreover, Digitel's position is based on the <i>ipso facto</i> provision of Section 12 of their abovementioned franchise, which reads:<br><br>SEC. 12. <i>Non-exclusivity of Franchise; Interpretation of Franchise</i>. - The franchise granted under this Act is not exclusive and shall not prevent the grant of similar franchise to other qualified persons or entities: x x x x Provided, finally, that if any subsequent franchise for telecommunications services is awarded or granted by the Congress of the Philippines with terms, privileges and conditions more favorable and beneficial than those contained in this Act, then the same privileges or advantages shall, ipso facto, accrue to the herein grantee and shall be deemed part of this Act.<br><br>It appears that the abovementioned request was prompted by the following:<br><ol type="1"><li>The letter dated March 12, 1996 of the Executive Secretary, Office of the President, Malacañang, Manila, which ruled as follows:<br><br>As clearly spelled out in the above <i>ipso facto</i> provision, it is the intent of the legislature to provide `equality of treatment in the telecommunications industy.' Equally clear is the fact that the tax exemption being enjoyed by telecommunications companies similarly situated with Digitel or those whose franchises provide similar benefits constitutes an `advantage, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity' granted under an existing franchise.<br><br>Hence, Section 6, R.A. No. 7293 granting a similar franchise to Pilipino Telephone Corporation (PILTEL) <i>ipso facto</i> became part of Digitel's franchise pursuant to Section 23 of R.A. No. 7925. Digitel, therefore, became entitled to the tax exemptions provided for under Section 6, R.A. No. 7293 immediately upon effectivity of R.A. No. 7925.<br><br></li><li>The 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated February 14, 1995 of the Department of Finance (DOF), concerning the request of the Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (PT&amp;T) for reconsideration of the DOF's ruling embodied under a 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated May 27, 1994 which held, in view of the withdrawal of exemption provision of Section 234 of R.A. No. 7160, that: "the real properties of PT&amp;T, although directly used in the operation of its franchise, shall be liable to the payment of real property taxes beginning January 1, 1992, the effectivity of R.A. No. 7160."<br><blockquote>The said February 14, 1995 ruling, which is relatively similar to that of the abovecited ruling of the Office of the President, held, thus:<br><br>In view thereof, such pertinent portion of the Tax Provisions of the franchises of SMART, Bell Telecommunication Philippines, Inc., and Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., stating that "(T)he grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this franchise," is again deemed a part of PT&amp;T's franchise when R.A. No. 7294 (SMART's franchise) took effect on April 15, 1992.<br><br>The stand of this Department under its 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated May 27, 1994, `that real properties of PT&amp;T, although directly used in the operations of its franchise, shall be liable to the payment of real property taxes beginning January 1, 1992,' is, therefore, hereby maintained. However, such real properties of the said company (PT&amp;T) which are directly used in the operation of its franchise, should again, in view of the foregoing considerations, be assessed as exempt from payment of real property taxes commencing January 1, 1993, the year after the franchise of SMART took effect, in line with Article III (B) (2) of the Manual on Real Property Tax Administration in the Philippines and Section 221 of R.A. No. 7160, x x x.<br><br>Moreover, it is emphasized that all other real properties of PT&amp;T not used in connection with the operations of its franchise shall remain subject to the payment of real property taxes.<br></blockquote>It is worthwhile to note that under the aforecited 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement of the Department of Finance, Digitel's real property tax exemption was already recognized in granting PT&amp;T's request for real property tax exemption.<br><blockquote>Moreover, attention is likewise invited to the letter dated July 24, 1996, of this Bureau, also treating on a similar subject matter, to wit:<br><br>Like the abovementioned telecommunications (PT&amp;T, SMART, BELL and DIGITAL), ISLACOM was granted, under Section 1 of R.A. No. 7372, the `right, privilege and authority to construct, operate and maintain all types of mobile communications, including cellular, personal communication network, paging and trunk radio services (such as but not limited to the transmission and reception of voice, data facsimile, audio and video and all other improvements and innovations pertaining to or as may be applicable to mobile telecommunication technology) as well as multi-channel microwave fiber optic and satellite distribution x x x.<br><br>The exemption provisions under the legislative franchise of PT&amp;T, SMART, BELL and DIGITAL is similarly found under Section 14 of ISLACOM's franchise (R.A. 7372), which provides as follows:<br><br>`x x x.'<br><br>Obviously, the same privilege (exemption from payment of real property taxes on properties used in the operation of franchise) should be enjoyed by ISLACOM, in the same way that exemption of the abovecited telecommunications companies (PT&amp;T, SMART, BELL and DIGITAL) were, in effect, considered by the Department of Finance (DOF).<br></blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, this Bureau finds merit in the abovementioned contention and claim of that company for real property tax exemption. Hence, the real properties of DIGITEL, which are used in the operation of its franchise, are hereby similarly found to be exempt from the payment of real property taxes, beginning January 1, 1993.<br><br>However, all other real properties of that company not used in connection with the operations of its franchise shall remain taxable.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Very truly yours,<br>LORINDA M.

No. 3662 (RETELCO's franchise) "has been construed to mean as excluding real estate, buildings and personal property of defendant RETELCO, Inc., directly used in the operation of its franchise, for which the latter is not subject to real estate tax as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay."<br><br>Apparently, the abovementioned "contrary opinion" of the Provincial Assessor of Batangas was prompted by the claim of DIGITEL for real property tax exemption on its real properties situated in Batangas Province, which are used in the operation of its franchise; and the Court of Appeals Decision, CA-GR CV No. 21897, promulgated on January 21, 1992, entitled, "The City Government of Batangas vs. Republic Telephone Company, Inc. (RETELCO), that "RETELCO is liable to pay the real property taxes on its real estate, building and personal property excluding its franchise." (Underscoring supplied) Hence, "RETELCO is ordered to pay the City of Batangas...the real property tax on said defendants' real estate, buildings and personal property located at Batangas City, covering the period from 1972 to June, 1980 and the real property tax due thereafter, plus the interest and penalty as provided by law."<br><br>In a letter dated October 19, 1998 (copy attached), the Senior Vice President Legal Service, Digital Telecommunications, Inc. (DIGITEL), advanced that, while most local government units "recognize and honor the said letter-opinion" of this Bureau, "the province of Batangas... rejected our (DIGITEL's) claim and refuses to honor the learned opinion of this (BLGF's) Office," thus, it argued that:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>"(T)he Court of Appeals Decision cannot be used as basis for the refusal to honor the opinion of this (BLGF's) Honorable Office and the denial of DIGITEL's claim for real property tax exemption" considering that DIGITEL "is not a party to the said case."<br><br></li><li>"(I)t cannot be said that the Court of Appeals decision has established a precedent upon which other telecommunications companies can be compelled to comply with. x x x In the case of Miranda Imperial (77 Phil. 1066), the Supreme Tribunal categorically stated that `only decision of this Honorable Court establish jurisprudence or doctrines in this jurisdiction.' Consequently, decisions of subordinate court are only persuasive in nature, and can have no mandatory effect (Paras, Civil Code of the Philippines annotated)."<br><br></li><li>"(R)eal property tax is not imposed on a franchise (as the said Court of Appeals Decision resolved it to be), because it (the real property tax) is imposed specifically on real properties such as land, buildings and machineries. A franchise is never subject to real property tax. It is subject to a franchise tax."<br></li></ol></blockquote>This Bureau finds the foregoing arguments of DIGITEL tenable considering the fact that, actually, even the Office of the President (OP) appears to share the same stand when OP, notwithstanding the subject January 21, 1992 Court of Appeals Decision, reaffirmed its position on the matter under a letter dated March 12, 1996, which categorically declared that "DIGITEL, too, shall be subject only to the following taxes, to wit:<br><blockquote>"1.
