				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 4, 1998, a Franco Transit bus bearing license plate number AVC 228 collided with the rear portions of a bus and truck wrecker both owned by respondent Victory Liner, Inc. (Victory Liner) which were stalled "along kilometer 63, North Expressway, San Felipe, San Fernando, Pampanga."  The collision damaged both vehicles of Victory Liner and killed Manuel Fabian, Rodel Ganelo, Caesar Santos, and Michael Figueroa.  The driver of the Franco Transit bus likewise died in the accident.<br><br>On February 11, 1998, Victory Liner and respondents Marites M. Ganelo, Catherine C. Santos, and Ma. Theresa Q. Fabian (Ma.

The appellate court thus held that the trial court's decision had become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Her Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the appellate court's Decision having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> petitioner filed the present Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>One of the requirements for certiorari to lie is that there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Any judgment which finally disposes of a case, leaving nothing more for the court to do in respect thereto - such as the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing petitioner's appeal as she had lost the right thereto - is appealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  Petitioner's remedy is, therefore, appeal, not certiorari.<br><br>As a general rule, the requirements for perfecting an appeal within the reglementary period specified in law must be strictly followed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  appeal not being a constitutional right but a mere statutory privilege.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is thus not only mandatory, but also jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues, however, that:<br><blockquote>The ruling of the respondent Court of Appeals contained in its questioned Decision dated March 30, 1999 that the Petitioner had lost her right to appeal is a patent nullity. What the respondent Court of Appeals missed is the fact that <u>before the period to appeal or file a Motion for Reconsideration expire[d], respondent Ma. Theresa Q. Fabian filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration</u> of the Decision of the lower court dated March 30, 1999, which motion asserted that the lower court erred in not awarding indemnity for the death of each victims [<i>sic</i>] to the plaintiffs and that it failed to clarify the award of attorney's fees of P50,000.00 as to its awardees and its division. <u>With the filing of such Partial Motion for Reconsideration by respondent Ma. Theresa Q. Fabian</u> which prayed for the modification and clarification of the Decision dated March 30, 1999, then, t<u>he said decision did not become final</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the records show that petitioner's counsel indeed received notice of the trial court's decision on April 29, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Following Rule 37, Section 1 <i>vis-à-vis </i>Rule 41, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, petitioner had 15 days or until May 14, 1999 to file a motion for reconsideration or notice of appeal.  She filed a motion for reconsideration on May 17, 1999, thus rendering the trial court's decision as to her final and executory.  <i>Testate Estate of Manuel v. Biascan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> so teaches:<br><blockquote>It is well-settled that judgments or orders become final and executory by operation of law and not by judicial declaration.  Thus, finality of a judgment becomes a fact upon the lapse of the reglementary period of appeal if no appeal is perfected or [no] motion for reconsideration or new trial is filed.  The trial court need not even pronounce the finality of the order as the same becomes final by operation of law.  In fact, <u>the trial court could not even validly entertain a motion for reconsideration after the lapse of the period for taking an appeal.  x x x <b>The subsequent filing of a motion for reconsideration cannot disturb the finality of the judgment or order</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The filing of a motion for reconsideration by respondent Ma. Theresa within the reglementary period prevented, <i>with respect to her, </i>the decision from becoming final, but not with respect to petitioner.<br><br>In <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Far East Molasses Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><i> </i>this Court, passing on Section 3, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court which provides that "[t]he appeal shall be taken within <u>fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from</u>" (underscoring supplied), held:<br><blockquote>x x x  the commencement of the period to appeal x x x should x x x be reckoned x x x from the respective dates each of the parties received a copy of the decision. <u>Therefore, <b>each party has a different period within which to appeal</b></u>, unless, of course, all of them received their copies on the same date and none filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Since each party has a different period within which to appeal, the <i>timely </i>filing of a motion for reconsideration by one party does not interrupt the other or another party's period of appeal.<br><br>In petitioner's case, her Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court's decision was filed three days after the expiration of the reglementary period for the purpose, hence, the Court of Appeals' dismissal of her appeal was in order.<br><br>The <i>faux pas</i> or negligence of petitioner's counsel, however, in failing to file a timely motion for reconsideration should not be taken against her.  Ordinarily, the negligence of counsel binds the client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  However, this Court has recognized the following exceptions to this rule:  (1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law; (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property; or (3) where the interests of justice require.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  In the case at bar, the application of the rule would result in petitioner being held liable for the damages suffered by respondents even without them having established the basis of her liability, thus depriving her of due process of law.<br><br>Compounding petitioner's plight is the trial court's procedural error which precluded petitioner from presenting evidence in her behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  The trial court denied her motion for reconsideration of its order declaring her "as in default" on the ground that <u>she failed to submit an affidavit of merit respecting her claim that she had meritorious defenses</u>.  This <i>ratio</i> is, of course, erroneous, for an affidavit of merit is not required to support a motion for reconsideration of an order allowing the <i>ex-parte</i> presentation of evidence by the plaintiff, <u>the defenses having already been laid down in the answer</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as in petitioner's case.<br><br>Petitioner, early on in the Affirmative Defenses segment of her <u>Answer</u>, already disclaimed the allegation in respondents' complaint that she is the registered owner of the bus, hence, not a real party-in-interest-ground to dismiss the complaint for lack of cause of action.  She raised it again in her <u>Motion for Reconsideration</u> from the order declaring her "as in default," to which motion she in fact attached the Certificate of Registration showing that the bus was registered in the name of Felicisima R. Franco.  Thus, petitioner had alleged and shown her meritorious defense by submitting the Certificate of Registration of the bus, which is evidence that she is not the registered owner of the bus, or that something would be gained by setting aside the order declaring her "as in default."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the merits of the case, a review of the evidence for respondents shows that individual respondents took the witness stand to testify on the damages they suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  And they presented the Victory Liner bus inspector;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> SPO2 Edgardo F.

Franco</b></u> which is conclusive proof of ownership.<br><br>Respondents, in maintaining their cause of action against petitioner, relied on the January 4, 1998 Traffic Accident Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of Balajadia, who conducted a spot investigation after the occurrence of the accident,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> wherein he stated that the Franco Transit bus was "<b>[r]egistered under the name of Marializa Franco-Cruz of Batac, Ilocos Norte</b>."  (Emphasis supplied)  How Balajadia arrived at such statement, he did not indicate in his Report.  Neither did he pass on it when he took the witness stand on February 11, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Rule 130, Section 44 of the Rules of Court, provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 44.  <i>Entries in official records. - </i>Entries in official records made in the performance of his duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law, are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts therein stated. (Italics in the original)<br></blockquote>For the entries in Balajadia's Report to qualify as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts therein stated, the following conditions must be present:<br><blockquote>x x x (a) that the entry was made by a public officer, or by another person specially enjoined by the law to do so; (b) that it was made by the public officer in the performance of his duties or by such other person in the performance of a duty enjoined by law; and (c) that the public officer or other person had <u>sufficient knowledge of the facts by him stated</u>, <u>which must have been acquired by him personally or through official information</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Balajadia's statement that the Franco Transit bus was "[r]egistered under the name of Marializa Franco-Cruz of Batac, Ilocos Norte" was not shown, however, to have been based on his personal knowledge or that he had sufficient knowledge thereof acquired by him personally or officially.<br><br>It bears emphasis that the presentation by respondents of evidence <i>ex-parte </i>did not relieve them of the burden of proving their claims against petitioner.<br><blockquote>As in other civil cases, <u>the burden of proof rests upon the party who, as determined by the pleadings or nature of the case, asserts an affirmative issue</u>.  Contentions must be proved by competent evidence and reliance must be had on the strength of the party's own evidence and not upon the weakness of the opponent's defense.  <u><b>This applies with more vigor where, as in the instant case, the plaintiff was allowed to present evidence <i>ex parte</i></b></u>.  The plaintiff is <u>not automatically entitled to the relief prayed for</u>.  The law gives the defendant some measure of protection as the plaintiff must still prove the allegations in the complaint.  Favorable relief can be granted only after the court is convinced that the facts proven by the plaintiff warrant such relief.  Indeed, <u>the party alleging a fact has the burden of proving it and a mere allegation is not evidence</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondents having failed to discharge the <i>onus</i> of proving that petitioner was, at the time of the accident, the registered owner of the bus, it was error for the trial court to credit respondents' evidence.<br><br>Just as it was error for it to hold that "the defendant [-herein petitioner] <u>failed</u> 1) <u>to rebut</u>" the evidence showing the accident was the result of the negligence of the Franco Transit bus driver and 2) <u>to present</u> evidence to overthrow the presumption of negligence against her pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code in light of its order allowing respondents to present evidence <b><i>ex-parte</i></b> and <u>denying petitioner's pleas to be allowed to participate in the proceedings and present evidence on her affirmative defenses</u>.<br><br>The trial court's decision in favor of respondents must thus be set aside.<br><br>Given the attendant facts and circumstances, in the interest of justice, this Court resolves to remand the case to the trial court to afford petitioner her right to due process.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED. </b>The<b> </b>decision of the Court of Appeals dated September 22, 2005 dismissing petitioner's appeal from the decision of Branch 121 of the Caloocan City Regional Trial Court is <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
