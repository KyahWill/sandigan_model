As Edgardo's bolo fell, Jovelyn and Juvy hastily entered the nearby house of Concepcion Abragan (Concepcion) who brought them inside a room, covered them with a towel, and advised them to keep still.<br><br>Edgardo pursued Juvy and Jovelyn and tried to enter the house of Concepcion but the door was locked. Concepcion then told Edgardo to pray, telling him that he was being "possessed by a devil,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to which Edgardo replied, "Since I was already wounded I might as well kill a person."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> As Edgardo was trying to force his way inside Concepcion's house, Elmer's wife arrived and told him to spare the little girls.<br><br>Elmer, his wife, and Edgardo thereafter proceeded to Bernadette's and Jerusalem's house where Edgardo hacked the couple's four-year-old son Junbert outside the doorway, hitting Junbert's right eye. Still incensed, Elmer and Edgardo hacked Bernadette's 11-month-old son Jonathan who was by the rail of the doorway.<br><br>Elmer and Edgardo were later arrested as Jerusalem, Jovelyn, Junbert, and Jonathan were brought to a hospital.<br><br>Seven-year-old Jovelyn sustained a wound on her right shoulder blade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Eleven-month-old Jonathan died on arrival at the hospital.

He retaliated by hitting the forearm of Jerusalem with a bolo. Edgardo tried to pacify him and Jerusalem, but the latter also hacked Edgardo on the forehead.<br><br>Jerusalem thereupon ran towards his house, and Edgardo pursued him (Jerusalem). He (Elmer) soon heard Bernadette shout that a child was hit and saw her descending the stairs of her house carrying a wounded child.<br><br>Policemen brought Elmer and Edgardo to a center for medical treatment after which they were brought to the municipal hall for preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><u>On Edgardo's part</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <u>he gave the following version</u>:<br><br>In the evening of June 23, 1998, while he was inside his house, he heard a man and a woman shouting at each other.

In the meantime, he heard Bernadette shout that somebody was wounded. He then left for home and on his way, he met his father who gave him a <i>bolo</i>.
