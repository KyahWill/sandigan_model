				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The original Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 filed by United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) General Insurance Corporation prays for the reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated February 28, 2008 in CA-G.R. CV No. 87074, which affirmed with modifications the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 8, dated March 19, 2006, dismissing the complaint against respondents Owner of <i>M/V "Sarinderjit</i>" Blue River Navigation Pte., Ltd., RCS Shipping Agencies., Inc., Asian Terminals, Inc., and Toepfer International Asia Pte., Ltd.<br><br>The relevant facts are as follows:<br><br>Petitioner filed with the RTC of Manila, Branch 8, a subrogation complaint to recover from respondents the sum of P1,234,950.83 it paid to San Miguel Foods for the shortage of 215.778 metric tons of Indian Soya Bean in bulk, out of 4,342.400 metric tons shipped on board <i>M/V "Sarinderjit</i>" on or about February 9, 1993. Respondent Blue River Navigation is sued as the carrier-owner of the vessel. Respondent RCS Shipping is sued as general agent, Asian Terminals as arrastre operator at the South Harbor, and Toepfer International as the supplier/shipper.<br><br>The complaint alleged that San Miguel Foods had purchased from Toepfer International the 4,342.400 metric tons of Indian Soya Bean in bulk. Toepfer, the seller and supplier, chartered <i>M/V "Sarinderjit</i>" and loaded the bulk shipment on board the vessel covered by Bill of Lading No. BEDI-2, with another 3,796.400 metric tons of Indian Soya Bean in bulk consigned to Purefoods Corporation under Bill of Lading No. BEDI-1. The bulk cargoes under the two bills of lading were commingled aboard <i>M/V "Sarinderjit</i>."  The complaint likewise stated that the shipment was insured by San Miguel Foods against loss in transit with UCPB General Insurance Corporation which issued Marine Policy No. 009-84/117.<br><br>Sometime in March 1993, the vessel arrived in Manila and the shipment was discharged by the arrastre operator Asian Terminals, unloaded onto barges alongside the vessel, then the barges were discharged at the terminal, where the bulk shipment was bagged and loaded onto trucks and delivered to the San Miguel Foods warehouse.<br><br>Upon delivery at the warehouse, the bagged shipment was weighed and the San Miguel Foods warehouse entry slip listed a shortage of 215.778 metric tons, as only 4,126.622 metric tons were delivered out of the 4,342.400 metric tons listed in Bill of Lading No. BEDI-2. Subsequently, SGS Far East Ltd., an independent surveyor, confirmed the shortage of 215.778 metric tons.<br><br>San Miguel Foods filed a claim for the 215.778 metric-ton shortage which petitioner paid in the amount of Php1,234,951.08. In consideration of the settlement, San Miguel Foods executed a release deed subrogating UCPB in its right to recover against all bailees. After demands for reimbursement were not heeded by respondents, petitioner filed the complaint.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered a decision dismissing the complaint on the ground that insurance coverage had not been proved, and awarding the respondents attorney's fees plus costs, the dispositive portion reading:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, Complaint is DISMISSED. Plaintiff UCPB is hereby ordered to pay:<br><ol><li>The amount of Php50,000.00 for each of the defendants (1) Blue River Navigation Pte. Ltd. / RCS Shipping Agencies Inc. (2) Asian Terminals Inc., and (3) Toepfer International-Asia Pte., Ltd., as attorneys fees; and<br><br></li><li> Costs of suit.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On appeal, the CA affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, but deleted the award of attorney's fees. Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, but it was denied in a Resolution dated April 18, 2008.<br><br>Aggrieved by the foregoing decisions, UCPB General Insurance Corporation filed this petition.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 30, 2008, we resolved to require the respondents to file their Comment on the instant petition.<br><br>Even as the Court awaited the Comment of the respondents, petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> praying, among others, for this Court to render judgment based on a Compromise Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> entered into by the parties in this case.
