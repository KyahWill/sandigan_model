				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is an Omnibus Motion praying, among others, for this Court to render judgment based on a Compromise Agreement entered into by the parties in this case. The original Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 filed by petitioners prayed for the reversal of the Court of Appeals Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 13, 2002 in CA-G.R. CV No. 50036, which reversed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 35, dated January 16, 1995 in Civil Case No. 92-59963.<br><br>The factual antecedents of this case are as follows:<br><br>Sweet Lines, Inc. leased under a bareboat charter with option to buy the ship M/V Sweet Glory from respondent Trust Union Shipping Corporation, a foreign corporation based in Panama.<br><br>Sometime in 1988, Sweet Lines applied for and obtained a credit line from petitioners Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) and FEB Investment, Inc. (FEBI). Sweet Lines originally applied for a P30 million credit facility but petitioners, through FEBTC, approved the application only to the extent of P20 million credit line and P500,000.00 Bills Purchase Line, or a total of P20.5 million credit facility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1988, Trust Union Shipping Corp. and FEBTC executed a Deed of Ship Mortgage over M/V Sweet Glory to secure payment of Sweet Lines' P20.5 million loan under the 1988 credit line agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The credit line expired with Sweet Lines failing to pay the P20.5 million loan. Nonetheless, the credit line was renewed, with FEBTC extending an additional P9.5 million loan to Sweet Lines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> secured by chattel mortgages over M/V Sweet Time and M/V Sweet Sail and a real estate mortgage over certain Cebu properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sweet Lines still failed to pay its outstanding obligation in the total amount of P30 million.<br><br>FEBTC filed a case before the RTC of Manila for judicial foreclosure of the ship mortgage in payment of the sum of P30 million. Upon FEBTC's posting of a P20.5 million bond, the trial court issued an order for the arrest of M/V Sweet Glory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On January 16, 1995, the RTC issued a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering defendant Sweet Lines, Inc. to pay plaintiff Far East Bank and Trust Company within ninety (90) days from service of this judgment the principal sum of P30,000,000.00; the interest thereon computed from January 27, 1992, at the following rates: (a) 26.8839% per annum on the sum of P26,000,000.00 (Exhibit C); (b) 27.50% per annum on the sum of P2,000,000.00 (Exhibit D); and (c) 29.00% on the sum of P2,000,000.00 (Exhibit E) until the principal obligation is fully paid; another sum equivalent to 25% of the principal amount due for attorney's fees; and the costs, inclusive of the port usage fees claimed by intervenor Philippine Ports Authority computed from January 30, 1992 until the departure of defendant "M/V Sweet Glory" also known as "M/V Sweet Roro 2", (sic) at the rates prescribed in the Port Tariff Rates for Vessels (Exhibits 11, 11-A, 12 amd (sic) 12-A), minus the sum of P65,346,02. This part of the costs should be paid directly to the intervenor.<br><br>In the event defendant Sweet Lines, Inc. fails to pay in full the aforementioned amounts, the vessel "M/V Sweet Glory" also known as "M/V Sweet Roro 2" is ordered sold at public auction in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Rule 68 of the Rules of Court which are not inconsistent with Presidential Decree No. 1521, the proceeds thereof to be applied in the order as follows:<br><ol><li>To pay the port usage fees claimed by intervenor Philippine Port Authority computed from the date and at the rates, minus the amount indicated above;<br><br></li><li>To pay the residue to the plaintiff until the amount of P20,500,000.00 is covered inclusive of the sum awarded to the intervenor;<br><br></li><li>To turn over the amount realized in excess of P20,500,000.00, if any, to defendant Trust Union Shipping Corporation; (sic)<br></li></ol>In the event the proceeds realized in the foreclosure sale is less than P20,500,000.00, after the claim of the intervenor has been satisfied, defendant Trust Union Shipping Corporation is ordered to pay the deficiency to the plaintiff until the sum of P20,500,000.00 is realized; (sic)<br><br>The principal balance, if any, of the principal obligation of defendant Sweet Lines, Inc., inclusive of attorney's fees and other costs, shall subsist as ordinary credits enforceable against the said defendant.<br><br>Defendant Sweet Lines, Inc. is ordered to reimburse to defendant Trust Union Shipping Corporation the full amount the latter actually paid to the plaintiff, not exceeding P20,500,000.00, plus another amount equal to 20% of the sum actually paid, as attorney's fees.<br><br>The Deputy Sheriff of this Court is hereby authorized and directed to take possession of the mortgaged vessel, the "M/V Sweet Glory", (sic) to enforce and undertake the foreclosure sale of said vessel in the event such sale becomes necessary.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Trust Union appealed the RTC Decision. In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated March 13, 2002, the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed and set aside the RTC Decision, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 31, dated January 16, 1995, is hereby <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b>, and a new one entered as follows:<br><ol><li>The foreclosure of the mortgage constituted over M/V Sweet Glory is declared null and void and the arrest of M/V Sweet Glory wrongful and unjustified.

The same was given due course in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated June 29, 2005.<br><br>In an Omnibus Motion, Trust Union and Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.

They alleged that when petitioners merged with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), the latter assigned the rights, title, interest, and causes of action in this case to Philippine Assets Investment (SPV-AMC), Inc. (PAII), which in turn assigned the same to PI One. They also prayed for this Court to direct Banco de Oro, Julia Vargas Branch, to close the escrow account deposited with it at the maturity next succeeding the receipt of this Court's resolution and to divide equally on a 50%-50% basis the remaining escrow deposit accruing interest between Trust Union and PI One. Lastly, they prayed for the dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to the right of PI One to further collect on Sweet Lines, Inc. pursuant to the Decision rendered by the CA on March 13, 2002.<br><br>The Compromise Agreement reads:<br><blockquote>This Compromise Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into at Makati City, Philippines on June 26, 2008, and at Tokyo, Japan on July 11, 2008 by and between:<br><blockquote><b>PHILIPPINE INVESTMENT ONE (SPV-AMC), INC.</b> ("PI One"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines, with principal office address at Unit 1615 Tower One, Exchange Plaza, corner Paseo de Roxas and Ayala Avenue, Makati City, herein represented by its Director, <b>MR.
