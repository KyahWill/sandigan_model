				<H3>RE: LETTER OF PRESIDING JUSTICE CONRADO M. VASQUEZ, JR. ON CA-G.R. SP NO. 103692 [ANTONIO ROSETE, ET AL. V. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ET AL.]<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Judiciary, which is acclaimed as the firmest pillar of our democratic institutions, is vested by the Constitution with the power to settle disputes between parties and to determine their rights and obligations under the law.  For judicial decisions, which form part of the law of the land, to be credible instruments in the peaceful and democratic resolution of conflicts, our courts must be perceived to be and, in fact be, impartial, independent, competent and just.  To accomplish this end, it is imperative that members of the Judiciary from its highest magistrates to its humblest employees adhere to the strictest code of ethics and the highest standards of propriety and decorum.  Indeed, it is unfortunate that one of the country's second highest courts, the Court of Appeals, should be presently embroiled in scandal and controversy.  It is this Court's bounden duty to determine the culpability or innocence of the members of the Judiciary involved in the said controversy and to discipline any one whose conduct has failed to conform to the canons of judicial ethics, which uphold integrity, independence, impartiality, competence and propriety in the performance of official functions.<br><br>The present administrative matter arose from the Letter dated August 1, 2008 of Court of Appeals Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. (Presiding Justice Vasquez), referring to this Court for appropriate action the much publicized dispute and charges of impropriety among the justices of the Court of Appeals (CA) involved in CA-G.R. SP No. 103692 entitled "<i>Antonio Rosete, et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, et al</i>."<br><br>To assist in its investigation of this sensitive matter, the Court in its Resolution dated August 4, 2008 constituted a three-person panel (the "Panel of Investigators") composed of retired Justices of the Court; namely, Mme. Justice Carolina Griño-Aquino as Chairperson, Mme. Justice Flerida Ruth P. Romero and Mr. Justice Romeo J. Callejo, Sr. as Members.  The Panel of Investigators was tasked to investigate the (a) alleged improprieties of the actions of the Justices of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 103692 (<i>Antonio V. Rosete, et al. v. SEC, et al.</i>); and (b) alleged rejected offer or solicitation of bribe disclosed respectively by Mr. Justice Jose Sabio and Mr. Francis de Borja.<br><br>A narration of relevant events and facts, as found by the Investigating Panel, follows:<br><br>On April 15, 2008, Justice Bienvenido L. Reyes (Justice Reyes), then Chairperson of the Ninth Division of the CA, filed an application for leave from May 15, 2008 to June 5, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In Office Order No. 149-08-CMV dated May 14, 2008 issued by Presiding Justice Vasquez, Justice Jose C. Mendoza (Justice Mendoza) was designated by the Raffle Committee as Acting Chairman of the Ninth Division during the absence of Justice Reyes.  Apart from his duties as regular senior member of the Fifth Division, Justice Mendoza was authorized "to act on all cases submitted to the Ninth Division for final resolution and/or appropriate action, except ponencia, from May 15, 2008 to June 5, 2008 or until Justice Reyes reports back for duty."  The said office order likewise applied to the other Division(s) where Justice Reyes had "participated or took part as regular member or in an acting capacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On May 29, 2008, Antonio V. Rosete, Manuel M. Lopez, Felipe B. Alfonso, Jesus P. Francisco, Christian S. Monsod, Elpidio L. Ibañez, and Francis Giles B. Puno, as officers, directors and/or representatives of the Manila Electric Company (hereinafter to be collectively referred to as "Meralco"), filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order (TRO) against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commissioner Jesus Enrique G. Martinez, Commissioner Hubert B. Guevarra, and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Aside from the application for immediate issuance of a TRO, petitioners prayed for the issuance of a preliminary injunction that should thereafter be declared permanent, as well as a declaration of nullity of the cease and desist and show cause orders issued by the SEC through Commissioner Martinez.  The petition was received by the CA at 10:49 a.m. on May 29, 2008 and docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 103692.<br><br>On the same day, petitioners simultaneously filed at 10:48 a.m. an urgent motion for a special raffle.  Presiding Justice Vasquez granted the motion in a handwritten note on the face of the urgent motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and CA-G.R. No. 103692 was raffled to Justice Vicente Q. Roxas (Justice Roxas).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  At 3:10 p.m., the Office of Presiding Justice Vasquez received a letter from Atty. Estrella C. Elamparo (Atty. Elamparo), Chief Legal Counsel of the GSIS, requesting the re-raffling of the case "in the presence of the parties in the interest of transparency and fairness."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  At 4:10 p.m. on that day, the GSIS filed an <i>ex-parte</i> motion to defer action on any incident in the petition pending the resolution of their motion for the re-raffle of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Atty. Elamparo, accompanied by Atty. Orlando P. Polinar, also of the GSIS Law Office, personally filed the urgent motion to defer action on the petition pending the resolution of their motion to re-raffle the case.  Since the receiving clerk of the Court of Appeals could not assure them that the motion would be transmitted to the Court of Appeals Division, Attys. Elamparo and Polinar allegedly went to the office of Justice Roxas "for the sole purpose of personally furnishing him a copy" of the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  They initially talked to a male clerk who referred them to one of the lawyers, who, however, told them that it was not possible for them to personally hand a copy of the motion to Justice Roxas.  Thus, Attys. Elamparo and Polinar left a copy of the motion to the staff but no one wanted to sign and acknowledge receipt of the copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On May 30, 2008, Justice Reyes filed an application for the extension of his leave until June 6, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  In the meantime, Justice Mendoza, who had been designated to replace Justice Reyes during the latter's absence, informed Justice Roxas through a letter that he (Justice Mendoza) was inhibiting from the case on the ground that he used to be a lawyer of the Meralco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Hence, in an "Emergency Request for Raffle," Justice Roxas informed the Raffle Committee about the inhibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Justice Jose L. Sabio, Jr. (Justice Sabio) was assigned as Acting Chairman of the Ninth Division by raffle, "in lieu of Justice Mendoza."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  At 11:30 a.m., the office of Justice Myrna Dimaranan-Vidal (Justice Dimaranan-Vidal) received a notice of emergency deliberation with the new Acting Chairman of the Special Ninth Division, apparently sent by Justice Roxas, stating that her presence and that of Justice Sabio, Jr. were "indispensable" on account of the "national interest" involved in CA-G.R. SP No. 103692.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Atty. Elamparo "received a telephone call from somebody who did not identify herself but (who) said that she had important information regarding the Meralco case."  The unidentified caller told Atty. Elamparo that "a TRO was already being prepared and that certain Meralco lawyers had in fact been talking to Justice Roxas."  The caller warned Atty. Elamparo against Justice Roxas who had "administrative cases and was `very notorious,'" but when prodded, the caller would not disclose more details.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At about 1:30 p.m. also on May 30, 2008, Justice Sabio received a telephone call in his chambers from his older brother, Chairman Camilo Sabio (Chairman Sabio) of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Chairman Sabio informed his brother that he (Justice Sabio) had been named the "third member" of the division to which the MERALCO-GSIS case had been raffled.  Justice Sabio was surprised as he had not yet been "officially informed" about the matter.  Chairman Sabio likewise informed him that a TRO had been prepared.  Chairman Sabio then tried to convince Justice Sabio "of the rightness of the stand of the GSIS and the SEC," and asked his brother to help the GSIS, which "represents the interest of the poor people."  Justice Sabio told his brother that he would "vote according to [his] conscience" and that the most that he could do was "to have the issuance of the TRO and the injunctive relief scheduled for oral arguments," at which the respondents "must be able to convince" him that the TRO indeed had no legal basis.<br><br>In his signed testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which he read before the Panel of Investigators, Chairman Sabio narrated the circumstances of this call to his brother on May 30, 2008. It appears to have been prompted by a call from a member of the Board of Trustees of GSIS. To quote from Chairman Sabio's testimony:<br><blockquote>Last May 30, 2008 I was in Davao City Airport with my wife, Marlene, waiting for our 1:25 P.M. PAL flight to Manila. xxx xxx xxx.<br><br>As we were boarding, I received a call from Atty. Jesus I. Santos, a Member of the Board of Trustees of GSIS. We had known each other and had become friends since before Martial Law because as Chief Counsel of the Federation of Free Farmers (FFF) we were opposing counsel in various cases in Bulacan.<br><br>Attorney Santos informed me that the dispute between the GSIS and MERALCO was now in the Court of Appeals; and, that as a matter of fact, my brother, Justice Sabio, was chair of the Division to which the case had been assigned. Being a Trustee, Attorney Santos requested me to help. I readily welcomed the request for help and thanked him. There was no mystery about his having known of the results of the raffle because the lawyers are notified thereof and are present thereat. As a Trustee, Attorney Santos should be concerned and involved. As such it is his duty to seek assistance for the GSIS where he could legitimately find it. He was right in seeking my assistance.<br><br>I was aware of the controversy between the GSIS and MERALCO. In essence this was in fact a controversy between the long suffering public and the mighty - financially and politically - controlling owners of MERALCO. MERALCO is not only a public utility but also a monopoly. Fortunately, GSIS had taken up the cudgels for the long suffering public, who are at the mercy of MERALCO.<br><br><center>x x x        x x x       x x x.<br></center><br>Immediately, I tried to contact Justice Sabio. But due to the noise I could not hear him. So I waited until we would arrive in Manila.<br><br>As we were leaving the Airport, I again got in touch with Justice Sabio. After, he confirmed that he was in fact in the Division to which the petition of MERALCO had been raffled. I impressed upon him the character and essence of the controversy. I asked him to help GSIS if the legal situation permitted. He said he would decide according to his conscience. I said: of course.<br><br><center>x x x         x x x        x x x.<br></center></blockquote>On the same day, May 30, 2008, GSIS filed an urgent ex-parte motion to inhibit Justice Roxas from CA-G.R. No. SP 103692.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  The Special Cases Section of the Court of Appeals received a copy of the motion at 11:58 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Claiming that the TRO was issued "to pre-empt the hearing" scheduled in the afternoon of that day before the SEC, the GSIS Law Office, through Atty. Marcial C. Pimentel, Jr., set forth its reason for the motion for inhibition as follows:<br><blockquote>3. Unfortunately, reports have reached respondent GSIS that the Honorable ponente has been in contact with certain lawyers of MERALCO and has in fact already prepared a draft resolution granting the TRO without affording respondents even a summary hearing. The records of this case was (sic), per information, immediately transmitted to the Honorable ponente upon his instructions. The worries of the respondent were exacerbated when it learned that there are supposedly two administrative cases pending against the Honorable ponente, both of which involve allegations of bias and prejudice.<br></blockquote>It turned out, however, that at that time, Justice Roxas had not yet been officially notified by the Raffle Committee that the case was raffled to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  Moreover, contrary to the allegation of Atty. Elamparo that the raffle was rigged, Justice Roxas had no hand in the raffle proceeding, which was handled by the Division chaired by Justice Mariano del Castillo with the use of a "fool-proof Las Vegas tambiolo, like the lotto machine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Justice Roxas brought to the office of Justice Sabio, for the latter's signature, the TRO which he had prepared, already signed by himself and Justice Dimaranan-Vidal.  Convinced of the urgency of the TRO, Justice Sabio signed it on condition that the case will be set for oral arguments.<br><br>Thus, at 2:08 p.m. on May 30, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Special Ninth Division composed of Justices Sabio, Roxas, and Dimaranan-Vidal, issued the Resolution granting the TRO prayed for by the petitioners and directing the respondents to file their respective comments (not a motion to dismiss) to the petition within ten days from notice, with the petitioners given five days from receipt of that comment within which to file their reply.  The Special Ninth Division also set the hearing on the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction for 10:00 a.m. on June 23 and 24, 2008.  In the same Resolution, parties were directed to file their respective memorandum of authorities in connection with the application for a writ of preliminary injunction together with their comments/reply.  After the parties had filed their memorandum of authorities relative to the application for a writ of preliminary injunction, the prayer for the said writ would be considered submitted for resolution "forty five (45) days from promulgation of this Resolution."  The SEC received a copy of the Resolution at 4:03 p.m. on that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>For Justice Roxas, the issuance of the TRO was an implied denial of the motion for inhibition filed against him.  There was no need to put in writing the action on the motion for inhibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>At 3:00 p.m., the Special Cases Section of the Court of Appeals received the Urgent Motion to Lift Temporary Restraining Order and To Hold Its Enforcement in Abeyance filed by the GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Justice Roxas did not act on the Urgent Motion because he did not consider it meritorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On May 31, 2008, Justice Sabio received a cellular phone call from Mr. Francis De Borja (Mr. De Borja), a person he had lost contact with for almost a year already.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Mr. De Borja greeted him with: <i>"Mabuhay ka, Justice."</i> When Justice Sabio, Jr. asked Mr. De Borja why he said that, Mr. De Borja told him that the Makati Business Club was happy with his having signed the TRO, to which Justice Sabio retorted, "I voted according to my conscience."<br><br>On June 5, 2008, the GSIS Law Office received a letter dated June 2, 2008 of Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. informing GSIS Chief Legal Counsel, Atty. Elamparo, that the Court of Appeals could not grant her request for the re-raffling of CA-G.R. SP No. 103692 "in the presence of the parties in the interest of transparency and fairness," as the case had been raffled in accordance with the procedure under the IRCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On June 10, 2008, Justice B. L. Reyes reported back to work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On June 11, 2008, at 3:50 p.m.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), appearing for the SEC, filed a manifestation and motion praying for the admission of the comment (to the petition) attached thereto, as well as the advance and additional copies of the memorandum of authorities.<br><br>On June 12, 2008, at 4:53 p.m., the GSIS filed its comment/opposition to the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 103692,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as well as its memorandum of authorities.<br><br>On June 16, 2008, the Division Clerk of Court, Atty. Teresita Custodio (Atty. Custodio), delivered to Justice Reyes the <i>cartilla </i>of the Meralco case, and informed him that a hearing on the prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction had been scheduled at 10:00 a.m. on June 23 and 24, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, on the same day, the Division Clerk of Court came back to retrieve the <i>cartilla </i>upon  instructions of Justice Sabio. Justice Reyes instructed his staff to return  the <i>cartilla </i>and when he asked the Division Clerk of Court why she  was retrieving it, she said that Justice Sabio "demanded" that it be  returned back to him. "Personally affronted" by the "domineering and  superior stance" of Justice Sabio, Justice Reyes "read and re-read Secs. 1, 2(d) &amp; 5, Rule VI (Process of Adjudication)" until he was satisfied that he should sit as Division Chairman in the Meralco case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On either June 17 or 18, 2008, Justice Sabio requested the <i>rollo </i>of CA-G.R. SP No. 103692 from Justice Roxas so that he could study the case before the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  Justice Roxas asked him whether Justice Reyes would preside over the hearing.  Justice Sabio explained the reason why he, not Justice Reyes, should preside.  Justice Roxas promised to instruct the Division Clerk of Court to send the <i>rollo </i>over to Justice Sabio.  The next day, the Division Clerk of Court told Justice Sabio that the <i>rollo </i>was with Justice Reyes.  When the <i>rollo </i>was eventually transmitted to Justice Sabio, the Division Clerk of Court asked him whether the <i>rollo</i> should be with Justice Reyes. Justice Sabio explained why the <i>rollo </i>should be with him.<br><br>On June 18, 2008, petitioners filed a motion for an extension of five days or until June 23, 2008 within which to file their consolidated memoranda of authorities and reply to the comment of the SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On June 19, 2008, MERALCO filed an <i>ex-parte </i>manifestation together with their reply to the comment of the GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  Meanwhile, Justice B. L. Reyes asked Atty. Custodio to report on "what transpired between her and Justice Sabio" when she returned the <i>cartilla.  </i>"Teary-eyed," Atty. Custodio begged off from making a report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Justice Reyes decided to consult the Presiding Justice "to avoid an ugly confrontation" with the Justices on the "highly politicized case involving giants of the Philippine society."  He explained to the Presiding Justice his understanding of the relevant IRCA rules and "the actual practice in similar situations in the past."  The Presiding Justice promised to talk with Justice Sabio and, "for the sake of transparency and future reference," Justice Reyes requested permission to write an inquiry on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On the same day, Justice Reyes wrote Presiding Justice Vasquez a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> calling the attention of Justice Edgardo P. Cruz ("Justice Cruz"), Chairperson of the Committee on Rules, to the "dilemma" as to who between him and Justice Sabio should "receive" CA-G.R. SP No. 103692. Justice Reyes posed these questions before the Presiding Justice:<br><blockquote>Will the case remain with Justice Jose Sabio, Jr. as Acting Chairman of the Special 9<sup>th</sup> Division and who participated in the initial Resolution of the case?<br><br>Will the case revert to the regular 9<sup>th</sup> Division with the undersigned as Chairman?<br></blockquote>For Justice Reyes, the "dilemma" was engendered by this provision of Section 2 of Rule VI of the IRCA:<br><blockquote>(2) When, in an original action or petition for review, any of these actions or proceedings, namely: (1) giving due course; (2) granting writ of preliminary injunction; (3) granting new trial; and (4) granting execution pending appeal have been taken, the case shall remain with the Justice to whom the case is assigned for study and report and the Justices who participated therein, regardless of their transfer to other Divisions in the same station.<br></blockquote>The hearing on the application for preliminary injunction having been scheduled for June 23 and 24, 2008, Justice Reyes considered it "necessary" that the issues be resolved before that date. Moreover, the referral of the controversy to the Presiding Justice would give him sufficient time to seriously study the case before the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On June 20, 2008, Presiding Justice Vasquez referred the letter of Justice Reyes to Justice Cruz, Chairperson of the Committee on Rules, noting "some urgency involved as the hearing of the case is on Monday, June 23, 2008."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On that same day, Justice Cruz wrote Justice Reyes a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> quoting Section 2 (d), Rule VI of the IRCA and stating that the "[i]ssuance of a TRO is not among the instances where `the Justices who participated' in the case shall `remain' therein." Hence, Justice Cruz opined that "[n]otwithstanding the issuance of the TRO (not writ of preliminary injunction), the case reverted to the regular Chairman (Justice Reyes) of the Ninth Division upon his return." Justice Reyes received a copy of the letter of Justice Cruz in the afternoon of that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>During the hearings of this case, Justice Cruz explained his opinion before the Panel. He opined that the motion to lift the TRO is not a motion for reconsideration because Rule 52 of the Rules of Court states that a motion for reconsideration may be filed with respect to a decision or a final resolution. A TRO is not a final resolution but an interlocutory order. Moreover, since the subject of the hearing on June 23, 2008 was on the application for preliminary injunction, Justice Sabio had no right to participate in the hearing because as an Acting Chairman, his authority was only to act on the motion to lift the TRO.  Under the IRCA, the position of Justice Sabio invoked the exception to the general rule in the IRCA.  However, the settled principle is to construe a rule strictly against the exception.  The participation of Justice Sabio in the hearing on June 23, 2008 was a "passport" to participation in the decision-making process, in violation of the IRCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Justice Reyes having consulted with him, the Presiding Justice referred the matter to Justice Sabio who in turn, opined that "a temporary restraining order is part of the injunctive relief or at least its initial action such that he should be the one to chair the Division." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In his office after that consultation with the Presiding Justice, Justice Reyes found that the Division Clerk of Court had given him a copy of the <i>cartilla</i> just in case he would preside over the hearing. In the evening, the Presiding Justice called up Justice Reyes to inform him that Justice Sabio "insisted that he would preside over the hearing of the case," and that the opinion of Justice Cruz, who was "junior" to Justice Sabio "was no better than his own opinion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>It turned out that, upon receipt of a copy of the letter of Justice Cruz, Justice Sabio told the Presiding Justice by telephone that he disagreed with the opinion of Justice Cruz "because he did not sign in an official capacity as Chairman of the Rules Committee, but in his personal capacity" and hence, the opinion of Justice Sabio "was as good as his, as in fact I (Justice Sabio, Jr.) am even more senior than he."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Justice Sabio told the Presiding Justice that he "smelled something fishy" about the move to transfer the case to the Ninth Division especially because Justice Reyes did not inform him about it despite the fact that they were seated together on three occasions.<br><br>Justice Sabio "smelled something fishy" because a couple or so weeks ago, he attended a Chairpersons' meeting regarding the leakage of the <i>ponencia </i>of Justice Bato, with Justice Reyes as Chairperson and Justice Jose Mendoza as senior member. The meeting was called because prior to the promulgation of the decision of Justice Bato, the losing party already filed a motion for the inhibition of the <i>ponente</i>. According to Justice Sabio information on the decision could not have been leaked by Justice Bato but by a member of the Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The Presiding Justice "did not do anything anymore" to prevent an "unpalatable" situation at the scheduled June 23, 2008 hearing, notwithstanding the "conflicting opinions" of Justices Reyes and Sabio. The "personal view" of the Presiding Justice was at the time "with Justice Cruz" but Justice Sabio had a "different interpretation." Neither did the Presiding Justice suggest that the Rules Committee be convened because the Committee then had only two members. He felt that it would be "better" if Justices Reyes and Sabio "could settle it between themselves." The Presiding Justice was seeing the Justices "practically" everyday because he did not want "these things to blow up." However, neither did it enter the mind of the Presiding Justice that the hearing on June 23 could be reset.

As the latter would have evening classes at the Ateneo Law School, and his wife and daughter would be waiting in their car after his classes, they just agreed to meet at the lobby-lounge of the School.  What Mr. De Borja knew about the MERALCO case allegedly came from news reports but he was interested in the news because he is a "confirmed free-enterpriser."

He gave the <i>balato </i>of 10% of the P3 million to Justice Sabio in cash at the Roa-owned bank in Cagayan de Oro. Since the Roas had a lot of "legal problems," Justice Sabio rendered advice and consultation at the time that he was an RTC judge in Cagayan de Oro.

He believed that since the question was "purely internal," the CA should not seek "enlightenment" from the litigants for it would only be construed against its "competence." He shared Justice Cruz's and Roxas' interpretation of the IRCA.

The Presiding Justice claimed having doubts on whether he possessed "the authority to decide the subject conflict" simply because under the IRCA, the Presiding Justice has control and supervision only over administrative affairs of the Court. The controversy was certainly not an administrative matter but Section 11 of Rule VIII of the IRCA provides that the Presiding Justice "has the authority to act on any matter not covered" by the Rules although such action should be reported to the Court <i>en banc.</i><br><br>The Presiding Justice expressed in his letter the view that "the (Special Ninth) Division that issued the temporary restraining order should continue resolving the injunctive prayer in the petition" because it was the Division that issued the Resolution granting the TRO and setting the hearing on the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, aside from the fact that the parties did not contest the authority of Justice Sabio as Division Chairman at the time, although Justice Reyes had reported back to work.  Moreover, the motion for inhibition and the urgent motion to lift the TRO "have a bearing" on the application of Section 2 of Rule VI of the IRCA, especially because Section 7 (b) of Rule VI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> points to the retention of the case by the Special Ninth Division.  Furthermore, the new Division headed by Justice Reyes may not be allowed to resolve the pending incidents because two of its members, Justices Reyes and Bruselas did not participate in the hearing on June 23, 2008.  He did not believe that Justice Reyes would be charged with dereliction of duty should he not assume the chairmanship. The Presiding Justice ended his letter with the hope that the matter would be "laid to rest" and that whoever would be dissatisfied "with its outcome may elevate the matter to the Supreme Court."<br><br>At 2:00 p.m. that day, Justice Sabio informed the Presiding Justice that a decision had been promulgated in the Meralco case the previous day.

Justice Sabio informed Justice Bruselas that, "after the injunction hearing" on June 23, 2008, Meralco offered him P10 Million "to either favor them or yield the chair" to Justice Reyes.  Justice Sabio told Justice Bruselas that he had informed the Presiding Justice of the "bribery incident" and that he "was disgusted over the turn of events because he should have remained chair of the Special 9<sup>th</sup> Division that issued the TRO on the case."  Justice Bruselas informed Justice Sabio that it was the first time that he heard of the matter and that he had "participated in the deliberation on the case and concurred with the <i>ponencia</i>" of Justice Roxas "without such information ever being taken up." Justice Sabio told Justice Bruselas that he would not leave the matter "as it is" because he would bring it up in the "open, to media, etc."  Justice Sabio asked Justice Bruselas that if P10M was offered to him, how much would have been offered to the "others."<br><br>Troubled by the information, Justice Bruselas went to the Presiding Justice where Justice Dimaranan-Vidal, who had received the same call from Justice Sabio, joined them.  After that meeting with the Presiding Justice, Justice Bruselas called up Justice Reyes who confirmed that he had heard about the "bribe offer" but that he did not reveal the same to Justice Bruselas as it "escaped" his mind.

Nos. 07-115-CA-J and CA-08-46-J, this Court imposed a P15,000 fine on Justice Roxas for unwarranted delay in resolving two motions for reconsideration in another case and sternly warned him that future commission any act of impropriety will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><i>Justice Roxas is guilty of gross dishonesty.</i><br><br>Apart from Justice Roxas' inexcusable inaction on pending incidents in the Meralco case, the Panel of Investigators found that he had been dishonest and untruthful in relation to the said case. The Court adopts the following findings of the Panel:<br><blockquote><b>2. Justice Roxas was dishonest and untruthful.</b><br><br>(a) Justice Roxas admitted that the "Transcript of Final Decision," which is supposed to be a transcript of the deliberation on July 14, 2008 of the Eighth Division on the final decision in the Meralco case was not a true "transcript" of the minutes of the meeting, but purely a "transcript from memory" because no notes were taken, no stenographer was present, and no tape recorder was used. It was in fact a drama which he composed "from my recollection" to comply with Sec. 9, Rule VI of the IRCA which requires that "minutes of the meeting, i.e., deliberation, shall be kept." <u>The so-called "transcript" is a <b>fabrication</b> designed to deceive that there had been compliance - when actually there was none -- with the prerequisite of the IRCA that consultation and/or deliberation among the members of the Division must precede the drafting of a decision.</u><br><br>(b) The statement in the "transcript" that it was a "recap from our previous deliberations" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was another </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">falsehood </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">because there had been no previous deliberations.</span><br><br>(c) The reference in the "transcript" to a "Final Report of Justice Roxas" <u>was also <b>false</b> for Justice Roxas admittedly did not submit a "report" as <i>ponente</i></u>, as required by Sec. 9, Rule VI of the IRCA,<u> for deliberation</u> by the Eighth Division on July 14, 2008. <u>The "Final Report" which he submitted was admittedly the decision itself</u> which he and Justice Bruselas, Jr. had already signed. The "Final Report" was merely the title of the page that served as the cover of the decision. Hence, Justice B.L. Reyes' supposed closing statement in the "transcript" that -- "We have covered every angle of the Final Report of Justice Roxas extensively" is also <b>false</b>. Justice B.L. Reyes testified at the investigation that he had not seen the "transcript" until the copy in the <i>rollo</i> was shown to him by Justice Callejo, Sr. during his cross-examination of Justice B. L. Reyes on August 26, 2008.<br><center>xxx  xxx  xxx</center><br>(e) <u>Justice Roxas' testimony that when he brought the Meralco decision to Justice Dimaranan-Vidal on July 8, 2008, it was only a draft for her to read, because she asked if she may read it, not for her to sign it, is <b>completely false .</b></u> This testimony was labelled by Justice Dimaranan-Vidal as <b>a lie</b>, and she called Justice Roxas <b>a liar</b>, because she did not ask to borrow the decision for her reading pleasure, but Justice Roxas personally brought it to her office for her to sign as a member of the Special Ninth Division. After poring over it the whole night, she signed it, as well as three (3) additional signature pages which were to be attached to three (3) other copies of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br>xxx  xxx  xxx<br></blockquote>Indeed, the fabrications and falsehoods that Justice Roxas blithely proferred to the Panel in explanation/justification of his questioned handling of the Meralco case demonstrated that he lacks the qualification of integrity and honesty expected of a magistrate and a member of the appellate court.<br><br>Under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, dishonesty is considered a serious offense that may warrant the penalty of dismissal from the service. Under the Rule IV, Section 52 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, dishonesty is likewise considered a grave offense and warrants the penalty of dismissal even for the first offense. In the past, the Court has had the occasion to rule that:<br><blockquote>...dishonesty and falsification are considered grave offenses warranting the penalty of dismissal from service upon the commission of the first offense. On numerous occasions, the Court did not hesitate to impose such extreme punishment on employees found guilty of these offenses.<br><br>Dishonesty, being in the nature of a grave offense, carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification for re-employment in the government service. <b>Dishonesty has no place in the judiciary</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup></sup><br></blockquote><i>Justice Roxas showed a lack of courtesy and <br>respect for his colleagues in the Court of <br>Appeals.</i><br><br>The Panel of Investigators reported on this matter in this wise:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx  xxx  xxx<br></div><br>(f) Justice Roxas was <b>thoughtlessly disrespectful</b> to a colleague and a lady at that, when he unceremoniously discarded, shredded, and burned the decision that Justice Dimaranan-Vidal had signed, because he allegedly forgot that Justice Dimaranan-Vidal and Justice Sabio, Jr. had already been "reorganized out" of the Special Ninth Division as of July 4, 2008,  hence, out of the Meralco case. Out of courtesy, he should have explained to Justice Dimaranan-Vidal the reason why he was not promulgating the decision which she had signed.<br><br>The truth, it seems, is that Justice Roxas, who had consulted Justice Villarama, Jr. on which Division should decide the Meralco case, may have been convinced that it should be the Special Ninth Division. That is why he brought his decision to Justice Dimaranan-Vidal for her signature. However, somehow, somewhere, during the night, while Justice Dimaranan-Vidal was patiently poring over his decision, Justice Roxas was persuaded to bring his decision to the Eighth Division (to which he and Justice B.L. Reyes belong after the July 4, 2008 reorganization of the Court), it may have dawned on him that if the case remained in the Special Ninth Division, Justice Sabio, Jr. might dissent, requiring the Presiding Justice to constitute a special division of five. If he (Justice Roxas) should fail to obtain a majority of the Division on his side, he would lose his <i>ponencia</i>; someone else would become the <i>ponente </i>(perhaps Justice Sabio, Jr.).  That may be the reason why he junked Justices Sabio, Jr. and Dimaranan-Vidal (even if the latter concurred with his decision) because he was unsure of Justice Sabio, Jr. He chose to cast his lot with his companions in the Eighth Division -- Justices B. L. Reyes and Bruselas, Jr. -- with whom he and Meralco were "comfortable".<br><br>(g) J. Roxas was <b>disrespectful to Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr.</b> whose ruling on his "Interpleader Petition" he sought on July 21, 2008,  but he promulgated the Meralco decision two (2) days later,  on July 23, 2008, without waiting for Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr.'s ruling which came out on July 24, 2008, only three (3) days after the Interpleader Petition was filed by him, and two (2) days after Justice B.L. Reyes also reiterated in writing his request for Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. to resolve the same chairmanship issue raised in the Interpleader. Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. was embarrassed and humiliated by Justices B.L. Reyes' and Roxas' <b>lack of courtesy and respect</b> for his position as head of the Court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx  xxx  xxx<br></div></blockquote>There is an old adage which says to gain respect one must learn to give it. If judges and justices are expected to treat litigants, counsels and subordinates with respect and fairness, with more reason, that judges and justices should give their fellow magistrates the courtesy and professional regard due to them as their colleagues in the Judiciary. Thus, in Canon 5, Section 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, judges are expected to "<b>carry out judicial duties with appropriate consideration for all persons</b>, <b>such as</b> the parties, witnesses, lawyers, court staff and <b>judicial colleagues</b>, without differentiation on any irrelevant ground, immaterial to the proper performance of such duties."<br><br>This Court cannot view lightly the discourteous manner that Justice Roxas, in his apparent haste to promulgate his decision in the Meralco case, treated his colleagues in the Court of Appeals. It behooves the Court to remind all magistrates that their high office demands compliance with the most exacting standards of propriety and decorum. <br><br><i>Justice Roxas' questionable handling of the<br> Meralco case demonstrates his undue <br>interest therein.</i><br><br>In the Report, the Panel of Investigators observed that Justice Roxas in fact began drafting his decision even prior to the submission of the parties' memoranda. As discussed in the Report:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx xxx  xxx<br></div><br>(d) Although the parties were given 15 days after the hearing on June 23, 2008, or up to July 8, 2008, to simultaneously submit their memoranda and memoranda of authorities, and actually submitted:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">On July 7, 2008 - GSIS's 39 page- memorandum<br>On July  9, 2008 - SEC's 62 page-memorandum<br>On July  10, 2008 - MERALCO's 555 page- memorandum (by messenger) with memorandum of authorities<br></div>Justice Roxas prepared the decision before the parties had filed their memoranda in the case and submitted it to Justice Dimaranan-Vidal for her signature on July 8, 2008. <u>His "rush to judgment" was indicative of "<b>undue interest and unseemly haste,</b>" according to J.Romero.</u><br><br>He <b>cheated</b> the parties' counsel of the time, effort, and energy that they invested in the preparation of their ponderous memoranda which, as it turned out, neither he nor the other members of the Eighth Division bothered to read before signing his decision. He made a mockery of his own order for the parties to submit memoranda, and rendered their compliance a futile exercise.<br>xxx  xxx  xxx<br><br>(underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>We agree with Mme. Justice Romero's observation that the "rush to judgment" (even before the filing of the parties' memoranda) was indicative of Justice Roxas' <b>undue interest</b> and unseemly haste, especially when taken together with other circumstances. This inexplicable haste in resolving the case on the merits is likewise apparent in Justice Roxas' failure to resolve the several pending incidents and instead jumping ahead to deciding the case on the merits; his "rushing" of Justice Dimaranan-Vidal into signing his draft Decision on July 8, 2008 when the parties' memoranda have not yet all been filed with the CA; his precipitate transfer of the case to the Eighth Division for promulgation of decision, without notice to Justice Dimaranan-Vidal of the Special Ninth Division who had already signed his draft Decision and despite the unresolved Chairmanship dispute between Justice Reyes and Justice Sabio which he (Justice Roxas) even submitted to the Presiding Justice for appropriate action, just a few days before the promulgation.<br><br>We reiterate here that as the visible representation of the law and justice, judges are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that would enhance respect and confidence of the people in the judicial system. The New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary mandates that judges must not only maintain their independence, integrity and impartiality; but they must also avoid any appearance of impropriety or partiality, which may erode the people's faith in the judiciary. This standard applies not only to the decision itself, but also to the process by which the decision is made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> This Court will not hesitate to sanction with the highest penalty magistrates who exhibit manifest undue interest in their assigned cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br> In sum, this Court finds that Justice Roxas' multiple violations of the canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct constitute grave misconduct, compounded by dishonesty, undue interest and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, which warrant his DISMISSAL from the service.<br><br><b><i>Findings regarding the conduct of <br>Associate Justice Jose L. Sabio, Jr.</i></b><br><br> In the Report, the Panel found that Justice Sabio likewise committed improprieties in relation to the Meralco case.<br><br><i>The circumstances of the telephone call of<br> Chairman Sabio to his brother Justice Sabio<br> showed that Justice Sabio failed to uphold <br>the standard of independence and propriety<br> expected of him as a magistrate of the <br>appellate court.<br><br></i>In his testimony before the Panel, Chairman Sabio admits that he called up Justice Sabio on May 30, 2008 from Davao City, in response to a resquest for help from a member of the Board of Trustees of Meralco. Notwithstanding the fact that Chairman Sabio called to relay to Justice Sabio the "rightness" of the GSIS' cause and asked him "to help GSIS" and that Justice Sabio allegedly told his brother that he would act in accordance with his conscience, the same still constituted a violation of Canon 13 of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i> for lawyers, which provides that:<br><blockquote><b>"A lawyer shall x x x refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence, or gives the appearance of influencing the Court."</b><br></blockquote>As they were both members of the Bar, it is incomprehensible to this Court how the brothers can justify their improper conversation regarding the Meralco case. As the Panel observed in its Report:<br><blockquote>Ironically, both of them found nothing wrong with brother Camilo's effort to influence his younger brother's action in the Meralco case, because both believe that our Filipino culture allows brother-to-brother conversation, even if the purpose of one is to influence the other, provided the latter does not agree to do something illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br></blockquote>For the Panel, Justice Sabio violated Sections 1, 4, and 5, Canon 1 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i>, which provide that -<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 1. Judges shall exercise the judicial function independently x x x free from extraneous influence, inducement, pressure, threat or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.</b><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><b>xxx xxx xxx</b><br></div><blockquote><b>Sec. 4. Judges shall not allow family, social, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. The prestige of judicial office shall not be used or lent to advance the private interests of others, nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge.</b><br><br><b>Sec. 5. Judges shall not only be free from inappropriate connections with, and influence by, the executive and legislative branches of government, but must also appear to be free therefrom to a reasonable observer.</b><br></blockquote>In the Investigators' mind, although Justice Sabio signed the TRO in favour of Meralco contrary to his brother's advice, Justice Sabio's "unusual interest in holding on to the Meralco case," seemed to indicate that he may have been actually influenced by his brother "to help GSIS." In arriving at this conclusion, the Panel noted the following circumstances: (1) Justice Sabio adamantly refused to yield the chairmanship of the Special Ninth Division although the regular chairman, Justice Reyes had returned to duty on June 10, 2008; and, (2) Justice Sabio officiously prepared and signed a resolution (a chore for the <i>ponente</i> Justice V. Roxas to perform), requiring the GSIS and the SEC to comment on Meralco's "Motion for Justice B. Reyes to Assume the Chairmanship of the 9<sup>th</sup> Division," which he probably intended to delay the decision on the preliminary injunction beyond the life of the TRO to the prejudice of Meralco and the advantage of the GSIS.<br><br>Based on the facts on record, the Court is wary of declaring that Justice Sabio had been influenced by his brother by speculating that he would have favored GSIS had he been a part of the division which rendered the decision in the Meralco case. However, we do find that it was improper for Justice Sabio to hold on to the chairmanship of the Ninth Division the despite the return of Justice Reyes, when Justice Sabio's designation as acting chairman was clearly only for the duration of Justice Reyes' leave of absence. We likewise note with disfavor his stubborn insistence on his own interpretation of the IRCA and hostile, dismissive attitude towards equally well-reasoned positions of his colleagues on the proper interpretation of their rules. Such conduct on the part of Justice Sabio did nothing to aid in the swift and amicable resolution of his dispute with Justice Reyes but rather fanned the flames of resentment between them. We deem this sort of behavior unbecoming for a magistrate of his stature.<br><br><i>Justice Sabio's conversations with Mr. De <br>Borja were improper and indiscreet. </i><br><br>On this matter, the Court accepts the following findings in the Report:<br><blockquote>Knowing the nature of De Borja's profession, Justice Sabio, Jr. should have been wary of the former. He should have foreseen that De Borja had the Meralco case on his mind when he called Justice Sabio, Jr. True enough, De Borja mentioned the Meralco case and congratulated Justice Sabio, Jr. for having signed the TRO in favour of Meralco.<br><br><u>But that was not the last time Justice Sabio, Jr. would hear from De Borja.</u> A month later, after Justice Sabio, Jr. had presided at the hearing of Meralco's prayer for preliminary injunction on June 23, 2008, and the case was ripening for decision or resolution, De Borja again called up Justice Sabio, Jr. and <u>asked to meet him over dinner to "chit chat" about the Meralco case.</u><br><br><u>Instead of telling off De Borja that he could not, and would not, talk about the Meralco case, Justice Sabio, Jr. agreed to meet De Borja in the lobby-lounge of the Ateneo Law School after his evening class in Legal Ethics in said school.</u><br><br>Justice Sabio Jr.'s action of discussing the Meralco case with De Borja <u>was highly <b>inappropriate and indiscreet </b></u><b>. </b>First, in talks with his brother; the second time in conversation with De Borja, Justice Sabio, Jr. broke the shield of <b>confidentiality </b>that covers the disposition of cases in the Court in order to preserve and protect the integrity and independence of the Court itself. <u>He ignored the injunction in Canon 1, Section 8 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i> that: <b>"Judges shall exhibit and promote high standards of judicial conduct (and discretion) in order to reinforce public confidence in the judiciary which is fundamental to the maintenance of judicial independence."</b></u> <br><br>It was during that meeting with De Borja in the lobby-lounge of the Ateneo Law School, that De Borja allegedly offered him P10 million, in behalf of Meralco, to step out of the case and allow Justice Bienvenido Reyes to assume the chairmanship of the Special Ninth Division because Meralco was "not comfortable" with him (Justice Sabio, Jr.). He rejected the bribe offer because he "could not in conscience accept it."<br><br>Justice Sabio, Jr. was allegedly shocked and insulted that De Borja would think that he (Justice Sabio, Jr.) could be bribed or bought. <u>The Panel is, however, honestly perplexed why in spite of his outraged respectability, Justice Sabio, Jr. called up De Borja two (2) days later (on July 3, 2008), to tell De Borja to stop "pestering" him with his calls. The Panel is nonplussed because, normally, a person who has been insulted would never want to see, much less speak again, to the person who had disrespected him. He could have just shut off his cell phone to De Borja's calls. </u>De Borja denied that he reiterated his offer of P10 million to Justice Sabio, Jr. He denied saying that even if the case should go up to the Supreme Court, GSIS would still lose, hence, "<i>saying lang yung</i> P10 million; <i>baka sisihin ka pa ng mga anak mo.</i>" He testified that his reply to Justice Sabio, Jr.'s call was "<i>deadma</i>" or indifference. Justice Sabio, Jr. blamed that call of his to a "lapse in judgment" on his part.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Investigating Panel finds more credible Justice Sabio, Jr.'s story about De Borja's P10 million-bribe-offer on behalf of Meralco, than De Borja's denial that he made such an offer. Why does the Panel believe him, and not De Borja?<br><br>First, because Justice Sabio, Jr. verbally reported the rejected bribe offer to CA Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. the next day - a fact admitted by Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr.<br><br>Second, even though Justice Sabio, Jr. did not mention the bribe-offeror's name in both his verbal and written reports to Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr., De Borja identified himself to the media as the person alluded to.<br><br>Third, De Borja's allegation, that Justice Sabio, Jr. wanted P50 million, not P10 million, is not believable, for, if Justice Sabio, Jr. quoted P50 million as his price, he would not have reported the P10 million bribe offer to Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. He would have waited for Meralco's reply to his counter-offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br>xxx  xxx  xxx<br></blockquote>Indeed, the Court agrees with the Panel that the allegation of solicitation on the part of Justice Sabio is not credible. Nevertheless, the continued communications between Justice Sabio and Mr. De Borja even after the latter's rejected bribery attempt is highly inappropriate and shows poor judgment on the part of Justice Sabio who should have acted in preservation of the dignity of his judicial office and the institution to which he belongs.<br><br>Premises considered, this Court is of the view that Justice Sabio's indiscreet and imprudent conversations regarding the Meralco case with his brother and Mr. De Borja and his actuations in the chairmanship dispute with Justice Reyes constitute simple misconduct and conduct unbecoming of a justice of the Court of Appeals which warrant the penalty of two (2) months suspension without pay.<br><br><b><i>Findings regarding the conduct of <br>Associate Justice Bienvenido L. Reyes.</i></b><br><br>As previously discussed, Justice Reyes appealed to Presiding Justice Vazquez in a letter dated July 22, 2008, reiterating his (Justice Reyes') request that the Presiding Justice render an opinion which Division of the Court of Appeals - the Eighth Division with him as chairman, or the Special Ninth Division chaired by Justice Sabio should resolve the Meralco case.  This was in conjunction with an Interpleader filed by Justice Roxas on the same issue with the Presiding Justice. Yet, despite the fact that the Presiding Justice informed Justices Reyes and Roxas that he would study the matter, Justices Reyes and Justice Roxas, together with Justice Bruselas, promulgated the decision in the Meralco case on July 23, 2008. Justice Reyes and Justice Roxas did not withdraw their request for a ruling nor did either of them advise the Presiding Justice beforehand of their intention to proceed with the resolution of the Meralco case. Thus, when the Presiding Justice issued his ruling on the chairmanship dispute on July 24, 2008, he was unaware of the promulgation of the Meralco decision on July 23, 2008,  under the aegis of Justice Reyes' Eighth Division. As found by the Panel, "Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. was completely taken aback when he learned about it on July 24, 2008, the same day that he issued his opinion on the chairmanship issue which by then had become <i>functus oficio. </i>He felt belittled and humiliated by the discourtesy of the two justices to him."<br><br>It bears repeating here that under Canon 5, Section 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, judges are mandated to show the appropriate consideration and respect for their colleagues in the Judiciary.<br><br>Thus, we adopt the finding of the Panel on this point and find Justice Reyes guilty of simple misconduct, which is mitigated by the fact that he repeatedly asked Presiding Justice Vasquez to act on his request to rule on the conflicting interpretation of the IRCA. However, Justice Reyes should be reprimanded for taking part in the decision of the subject case without awaiting the ruling of the Presiding Justice.<br><br><b><i>Findings regarding the conduct of Justice Myrna Dimaranan-Vidal</i></b><br><br> The Court finds well-taken and adopts the findings of the Panel of Investigators, to wit:<br><blockquote>Justice Dimaranan-Vidal deviated from the IRCA when she allowed herself to be rushed by Justice Roxas to sign the Meralco decision on July 8, 2008, without reading the parties' memoranda and without the deliberation among members of the Division required by the IRCA. She knew that the TRO would not expire until July 30, 2008 - some three (3) weeks away from July 8, 2008 - yet she allowed herself to believe Justice Roxas' misrepresentation that signing the decision was urgent. Her compliance with certain dissembling practices of other justices of the Court, in violation of the IRCA, showed weakness and lack of independence on her part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br></blockquote>The following sections of Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct are instructive in this regard:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. Judges shall exercise the judicial function independently on the basis of their assessment of the facts and in accordance with a conscientious understanding of the law, free of any extraneous influence, inducement, pressure, threat or interference, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.<br><br>SEC. 2. In performing judicial duties, judges shall be independent from judicial colleagues in respect of decisions which the judge is obliged to make independently.<br></blockquote>Allowing a fellow justice to induce her to deviate from established procedure constitutes conduct unbecoming a justice for which Justice Dimaranan-Vidal should be ADMONISHED to be more circumspect in the performance of her judicial duties.<br><br><b><i>Findings regarding the conduct of <br>Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez</i></b><br><br>It is the view of the Panel of Investigators that Presiding Justice Vasquez failed to provide the leadership expected of him as head of the Court of Appeals. The following quote from the Report summarizes the perceived lapses on the part of the Presiding Justice:<br><blockquote>Clearly, Presiding Justice Vasquez, Jr. had been <b>indecisive</b> in dealing with the turmoil arising from the Meralco case. He <b>vacillated</b> and <b>temporized</b> on resolving the impasse between Justice Sabio, Jr. and Justice B. L. Reyes over the chairmanship of the Division that should hear and decide the  Meralco case. He failed to take action on the reported bribe-offer by Meralco to J. Sabio, Jr. He <b>hesitated </b>to assert his leadership of the Court even when the parties repeatedly urged him to lay down the rule for them to follow. Was he hampered by the fact that he has relatives - two daughters - employed in the GSIS, and a sister who is a consultant thereof? He pleaded lack of authority. Was he not aware then, or did he discover too late,  that under Section 11, Rule VIII of the IRCA, he is in fact <b>authorized  to act "on any matter" </b>involving the Court and its members?  That Rule provides:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 11. x xx the Presiding Justice or any one acting in his place is authorized to act on any matter not covered by these Rules. Such  action shall, however, be reported to the Court <i>en  banc</i>.</b><br></blockquote>He should have convened the Court <i>en banc</i> as soon as the alleged bribery attempt on Justice Sabio, Jr. was reported to him, for it was an attempt to corrupt a member of the Court, calling for the "protection and preservation of the integrity of the judicial processes" of the Court, hence, an administrative matter cognizable by the Court <i>en banc</i>. Section 5 (c), Rule I of the IRCA, provides:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 5.

Upon the other hand, if the application for preliminary injunction is denied or remained unacted upon, the position of Justice Reyes could be sustained on the ground that the exception under Sec. 2 (d), Rule VI does not come into the picture and therefore the <i>ponente</i> of the case (Justice Roxas) <i>and the two (2) other members</i> present Eighth Division) (sic) to which Justice Roxas was transferred should now assume jurisdiction over the case. However, considering the pendency of the motion to lift TRO and the fact that Justice Sabio, Jr. as Acting Chairman of the Special Ninth Division, together with Justices Roxas and Vidal, had presided and heard the oral arguments of the parties on MERALCO's application for preliminary injunction, the more prudent course of action is to allow the Special Ninth Division to resolve the motion to lift TRO and other pending matters, as well as the application for issuance of writ of preliminary injunction.</span><br><span lang="EN-PH"></span><br><span lang="EN-PH">As a matter of procedure and orderly administration of justice in the CA, I think the case should be retained by the Special Ninth Division chaired by Justice Sabio, Jr. until the resolution of the incidents therein, <i>i.e., </i>motion to lift TRO and inhibition. The impracticality of transferring the case to the present division of the <i>ponente</i> (Eighth Division), instead of letting the case remain with those Justices of the Special Ninth Division which had issued a TRO and heard the application for preliminary injunction, is highlighted by the fact that there are pending motions still unresolved, voluminous pleadings and documents have been submitted by both parties which would take time to study and deliberated upon by the Justices, and the extreme urgency of MERALCO's petition necessitating swift resolution of the legal issues presented.</span><br><span lang="EN-PH"></span><br><span lang="EN-PH">And as I explained to Justice Bruselas, Jr., in the event that the Special Ninth Division chaired by Justice Sabio, Jr. <i>grants the application for preliminary injunction, </i>Justice Bruselas, Jr. and Justice Reyes would have no authority at all to participate in the case, in accordance with the mandate of Sec. 2 (d), Rule VI of the <i>2002 IRCA, </i>since the case shall then remain with Justice Roxas and Justices Sabio and Vidal of the former Special Ninth Division, the latter two (2) Justices having both <i>participated in the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction. </i>On the other hand, if such application for preliminary injunction is denied by the Special Ninth Division, then said provision would have no application.

According to the Presiding Justice, at one point, Justice Celia Leagogo commented "something like <i>pera-pera lang `yan." </i>She allegedly asked Justice Roxas why he could not answer the question of Justice Dimaranan-Vidal on where the decision she signed was (TSN August 12 [p.m.] 80-81).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127] </sup><i>Rollo </i>of A.M.

It reads in full as follows:<br><br>INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE AFFIDAVIT OF MR. FRANCIS ROA DE BORJA date July 31, 2008.<br><br>As initial reaction to the affidavit of Francis de Borja. I find it not only ridiculous but also incredible. He has absolutely twisted the facts to suit a wicked end.<br><br><b>I vehemently deny that he ever asked me what it takes to inhibit from the case; nor give any reply in the manner that he stated in the affidavit. I NEVER ASKED FOR MONEY.</b><br><br>On the contrary, he told me that he was sent by Manolo Lopez, who was with him in the car because it was a matter of life and death for them. And so they wanted the case to be "ensured." He mentioned about the abuses committed against the Lopezes during the Marcos time and now being done by the Arroyo administration. And so he pleaded for me to accept what he called a "win-win situation of ten million."<br><br>What they are doing now is obviously a SMEAR CAMPAIGN. Since they have the money and the resources, they will do all they can to discredit me.<br><br>This is only my initial statement. I will hold a press conference at about ten o'clock in the morning tomorrow at may office in the Court of Appeals and detail everything that transpired between me and Mr. Francis Roa de Borja.<br><br>31 July 2008<br><br>(Sgd.)
