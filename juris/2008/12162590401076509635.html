				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Under consideration is the Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated October 26, 2007 of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) which states:<br><blockquote>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) respectfully avers that in an Indorsement dated October 24, 2007, the Legal Service of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) has informed it of the Philippine Government's decision not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project (see attachment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>).&nbsp; That said, there is no more justiciable controversy for this Honorable Court to resolve.&nbsp; WHEREFORE, public respondents respectfully pray that the present petitions be DISMISSED.<br></blockquote>On November 13, 2007, the Court noted the OSG's manifestation and motion and required petitioners in G.R. Nos. 178830, 179317, and 179613 to comment.<br><br>On December 6, 2007, Rolex Suplico, petitioner in G.R. No. 178830, filed his Consolidated Reply and Opposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> opposing the aforequoted OSG Manifestation and Motion, arguing that:<br><blockquote><ol start="66"><li>Aside from the fact that the <i>Notes of the Meeting Between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao </i>held 2 October 2007 were not attached to the 26 October 2007 Manifestation and Motion - thus depriving petitioners of the opportunity to comment thereon - a mere verbally requested <i>1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement </i>is not sufficient basis for the conclusion that the ZTE-DOTC NBN deal has been permanently scrapped.<br><br></li><li>Suffice to state, said <i>1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement </i>is glaringly <b>self-serving</b>, especially without the <i>Notes of the Meeting Between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao</i> to support its allegations or other proof of the supposed decision to cancel the ZTE-DOTC NBN deal.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public respondents can certainly do better than that.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner Suplico further argues that:<br><blockquote><ol start="79"><li><i>Assuming arguendo </i>that some aspects of the present Petition have been rendered moot (which is vehemently denied), this Honorable Court, consistent with well-entrenched jurisprudence, may still take cognizance thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner Suplico cites this Court's rulings in <i>Gonzales v. Chavez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Rufino v. Endriga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and <i>Alunan </i><i>III</i><i> v. Mirasol</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that despite their mootness, the Court nevertheless took cognizance of these cases and ruled on the merits due to the Court's symbolic function of educating the bench and the bar by formulating guiding and controlling principles, precepts, doctrines, and rules.<br><br>On January 31, 2008, Amsterdam Holdings, Inc. (AHI) and Nathaniel Sauz, petitioners in G.R. No. 179317, also filed their comment expressing their sentiments, thus:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>First of all, the present administration has never been known for candor.&nbsp; The present administration has a very nasty habit of not keeping its word. It says one thing, but does another.<br><br></li><li>This being the case, herein petitioners are unable to bring themselves to feel even a bit reassured that the government, in the event that the above-captioned cases are dismissed, will not backtrack, re-transact, or even resurrect the now infamous NBN-ZTE transaction.&nbsp; This is especially relevant since what was attached to the OSG's Manifestation and Motion was a mere one (1) page written communication sent by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to the OSG, allegedly relaying that the Philippine Government has decided not to continue with the NBN project <b>"x x x due to several reasons and constraints."</b><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners AHI and Sauz further contend that because of the transcendental importance of the issues raised in the petition, which among others, included the President's use of the power to borrow, i.e., to enter into foreign loan agreements, this Court should take cognizance of this case despite its apparent mootness.<br><br>On January 15, 2008, the Court required the OSG to file respondents' reply to petitioners' comments on its manifestation and motion.<br><br>On April 18, 2008, the OSG filed respondents' reply, reiterating their position that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy - one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Respondents also insist that there is no perfected contract in this case that would prejudice the government or public interest.&nbsp; Explaining the nature of the NBN Project as an executive agreement, respondents stress that it remained in the negotiation stage.&nbsp; The conditions precedent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for the agreement to become effective have not yet been complied with.<br><br>Respondents further oppose petitioners' claim of the right to information, which they contend is not an absolute right.&nbsp; They contend that the matters raised concern executive policy, a political question which the judicial branch of government would generally hesitate to pass upon.<br><br>On July 2, 2008, the OSG filed a Supplemental Manifestation and Motion.&nbsp; Appended to it is the Highlights from the Notes of Meeting between President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Chinese President Hu Jintao, held in XI Jiao Guesthouse, Shanghai, China, on October 2, 2007.&nbsp; In the Notes of Meeting, the Philippine Government conveyed its decision not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project due to several constraints.&nbsp; The same Notes likewise contained President Hu Jintao's expression of understanding of the Philippine Government decision.<br><br>We resolve to grant the motion.<br><br><b>Firstly</b>, the Court notes the triple petitions to be for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and mandamus, with application for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary Injunction.&nbsp; The individual prayers in each of the three (3) consolidated petitions are:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>G.R.

No. 178830, enjoining the parties from "pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project" as prayed for.&nbsp; Pertinent parts of the said Order read:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, on 11 September 2007, adopted a resolution in the above-entitled case, to wit:<br><blockquote>"G.R. No. 178830 (<i>Rolex Suplico vs. National Economic and Development Authority</i>, represented by NEDA Secretary Romulo L. Neri, and the NEDA Investment Coordination Committee, Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), represented by DOTC Secretary Leandro Mendoza, including the Commission on Information and Communications Technology, headed by its Chairman, Ramon P. Sales, The Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), headed by DOTC Assistant Secretary Elmer A. Soneja as Chairman, and The Technical Working Group for ICT, and DOTC Assistant Secretary Lorenzo Formoso, and All Other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, and ZTE Corporation, Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and ARESCOM, Inc.--Acting on the instant petition with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction, the Court Resolved, without giving due course to the petition, to<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>(d) Issue a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, enjoining the (i) National Economic and Development Authority, (ii) NEDA-Investment Coordination Committee, (iii) Department of Transportation and Communications, Commission on Information and Communications Technology, (iv) Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), (v) Technical Working Group for ICT, and all other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, (vi) ZTE Corporation; (vii) Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and (viii) ARESCOM, Inc., and any and all persons acting on their behalf from `pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project' as prayed for."<br></blockquote></blockquote>NOW THEREFORE, effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this Court, You, Respondents (i) National Economic and Development Authority, (ii) NEDA-Investment Coordination Committee, (iii) Department of Transportation and Communications, Commission on Information and Communications Technology, (iv) Telecommunications Office, Bids and Awards for Information and Communications Technology Committee (ICT), (v) Technical Working Group for ICT, and all other Operating Units of the DOTC for Information and Communications Technology, (vi) ZTE Corporation; (vii) Amsterdam Holdings, Inc., and (viii) ARESCOM, Inc., and any and all persons acting on their behalf are hereby <b>ENJOINED</b> <b>from "pursuing, entering into indebtedness, disbursing funds, and implementing the ZTE-DOTC Broadband Deal and Project" as prayed for</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Petitioners in G.R. Nos. 178830 and 179613 pray that they be furnished certified true copies of the "contract or agreement covering the NBN project as agreed upon with ZTE Corporation."&nbsp; It appears that during one of the Senate hearings on the NBN project, copies of the supply contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> were readily made available to petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Evidently, the said prayer has been complied with and is, thus, <b>mooted</b>.<br><br>When President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, acting in her official capacity during the meeting held on October 2, 2007 in China, informed China's President Hu Jintao that the Philippine Government had decided not to continue with the ZTE-National Broadband Network (ZTE-NBN) Project due to several reasons and constraints, there is no doubt that <b>all the other principal prayers in the three petitions</b> (to annul, set aside, and enjoin the implementation of the ZTE-NBN Project) <b>had also become moot</b>.<br><br>Contrary to petitioners' contentions that these declarations made by officials belonging to the executive branch on the Philippine Government's decision not to continue with the ZTE-NBN Project are self-serving, hence, inadmissible, the Court has no alternative but to take judicial notice of this official act of the President of the Philippines.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Judicial Notice, <b>when mandatory</b>. - </i>A court shall take judicial notice, <b>without introduction of evidence</b>, of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the Philippines, <b>the official acts of the </b>legislative, <b>executive </b>and judicial <b>departments of the Philippines</b>, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the rules, it is <b>mandatory</b> and the Court has no alternative but to take judicial notice of the official acts of the President of the Philippines, who heads the executive branch of our government.&nbsp; It is further provided in the above-quoted rule that the court shall take judicial notice of the foregoing facts <b>without introduction of evidence</b>.&nbsp; Since we consider the act of cancellation by President Macapagal-Arroyo of the proposed ZTE-NBN Project during the meeting of October 2, 2007 with the Chinese President in China as an <b>official act of the executive department</b>, the Court must take judicial notice of such official act without need of evidence.<br><br>In <i>David v. Macapagal-Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> We took judicial notice of the announcement by the Office of the President banning all rallies and canceling all permits for public assemblies following the issuance of Presidential Proclamation No. 1017 and General Order No. 5.<br><br>In <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court also resorted to judicial notice in resolving the factual ingredient of the petition.<br><br>Moreover, under Section 2, paragraph (m) of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, the <b>official duty </b>of the executive officials<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of informing this Court of the government's decision not to continue with the ZTE-NBN Project is also presumed to <b>have been regularly performed</b>, absent proof to the contrary.&nbsp; Other than petitioner AHI's unsavory insinuation in its comment, the Court finds no factual or legal basis to disregard this disputable presumption in the present instance.<br><br>Concomitant to its fundamental task as the ultimate citadel of justice and legitimacy is the judiciary's role of strengthening political stability indispensable to progress and national development.&nbsp; Pontificating on issues which no longer legitimately constitute an actual case or controversy will do more harm than good to the nation as a whole. Wise exercise of judicial discretion militates against resolving the academic issues, as petitioners want this Court to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is especially true where, as will be further discussed, the legal issues raised cannot be resolved without previously establishing the factual basis or antecedents.<br><br>Judicial power presupposes actual controversies, the very antithesis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of mootness.&nbsp; In the absence of actual justiciable controversies or disputes, the Court generally opts to refrain from deciding moot issues.&nbsp; Where there is no more live subject of controversy, the Court ceases to have a reason to render any ruling or make any pronouncement.<br><br><b><i>Kapag wala nang buhay na kaso, wala nang dahilan para magdesisyon ang Husgado.</i></b><br><br>In <i>Republic Telecommunications Holdings, Inc. v. Santiago</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the lone issue tackled by the Court of Appeals (CA) was whether the Securities Investigation and Clearing Department (SICD) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <i>en banc</i> committed reversible error in issuing and upholding, respectively, the writ of preliminary injunction. The writ enjoined the execution of the questioned agreements between Qualcomm, Inc. and Republic Telecommunications Holdings, Inc. (RETELCOM).&nbsp; The implementation of the agreements was restrained through the assailed orders of the SICD and the SEC <i>en banc</i> which, however, were nullified by the CA decision.&nbsp; Thus, RETELCOM elevated the matter to this Court praying for the reinstatement of the writ of preliminary injunction of the SICD and the SEC <i>en banc</i>.&nbsp; However, before the matter was finally resolved, Qualcomm, Inc. withdrew from the negotiating table.&nbsp; Its withdrawal had thwarted the execution and enforcement of the contracts.&nbsp; Thus, the resolution of whether the implementation of said agreements should be enjoined became no longer necessary.<br><br>Equally applicable to the present case is the Court ruling in the above-cited <i>Republic Telecommunications</i>.&nbsp; There We held, thus:<br><blockquote>Indeed, the instant petition, insofar as it assails the Court of Appeals' Decision nullifying the orders of the SEC en banc and the SICD, has been rendered moot and academic.&nbsp; To rule, one way or the other, on the correctness of the questioned orders of the SEC en banc and the SICD will be indulging in a theoretical exercise that has no practical worth in view of the supervening event.<br><br>The rule is well-settled that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy - one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution; the case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.&nbsp; Where the issue has become moot and academic, there is no justiciable controversy, and an adjudication thereon would be of no practical use or value as courts do not sit to adjudicate mere academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest, however intellectually challenging.<br><br>In the ultimate analysis, petitioners are seeking the reinstatement of the writ of injunction to prevent the concerned parties from pushing through with transactions with Qualcomm, Inc.&nbsp; Given that Qualcomm, Inc. is no longer interested in pursuing the contracts, there is no actual substantial relief to which petitioners would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition.<br><br>The Court likewise finds it unnecessary to rule whether the assailed Court of Appeals' Decision had the effect of overruling the Court's Resolution dated 29 January 1999, which set aside the TRO issued by the appellate court.<br><br>A ruling on the matter practically partakes of a mere advisory opinion, which falls beyond the realm of judicial review.&nbsp; The exercise of the power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies. Courts have no authority to pass upon issues through advisory opinions or to resolve hypothetical or feigned problems.<br><br>While there were occasions when the Court passed upon issues although supervening events had rendered those petitions moot and academic, the instant case does not fall under the exceptional cases.&nbsp; In those cases, the Court was persuaded to resolve moot and academic issues to formulate guiding and controlling constitutional principles, precepts, doctrines or rules for future guidance of both bench and bar.<br><br>In the case at bar, the resolution of whether a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued to prevent the implementation of the assailed contracts calls for an appraisal of factual considerations which are peculiar only to the transactions and parties involved in this controversy.&nbsp; Except for the determination of whether petitioners are entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction which is now moot, the issues raised in this petition do not call for a clarification of any constitutional principle or the interpretation of any statutory provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Secondly</b>, even assuming that the Court will choose to disregard the foregoing considerations and brush aside mootness, the Court cannot completely rule on the merits of the case because <b>the resolution of the three petitions involves settling factual issues which definitely requires reception of evidence</b>. There is not an iota of doubt that <b>this may not be done by this Court in the first instance because</b>, as has been stated often enough, <b>this Court is not a trier of facts</b>.<br><br><b><i>Ang pagpapasiya sa tatlong petisyon ay nangangailangan ng paglilitis na hindi gawain ng Hukumang ito.</i></b><br><br>Respondent ZTE, in its Comment in G.R. No. 178830,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> correctly pointed out that since petitioner Suplico filed his petition directly with this Court, without prior factual findings made by any lower court, a determination of pertinent and relevant facts is needed.

Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>No money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>The power of the purse - or the power of Congress to authorize payment from funds in the National Treasury -&nbsp; is lodged <b>exclusively</b> in Congress.&nbsp; One of the fundamental checks and balances finely crafted in the Constitution is that Congress authorizes the amount to be spent, while the Executive spends the amount so authorized.&nbsp; The Executive cannot authorize its own spending, and neither can Congress spend what it has authorized.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale of this basic check and balance is to prevent abuse of discretion in the expenditure of public funds.<br><br>Thus, the Executive branch cannot spend a single centavo of government receipts, whether from taxes, sales, donations, dividends, profits, loans, or from any other source, unless there is an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure.&nbsp; Any government expenditure without the corresponding appropriation from Congress is unconstitutional.&nbsp; There is no exception to this constitutional prohibition that "no money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." This constitutional prohibition is self-executory.<br><br>To further insure compliance with Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution, the Administrative Code of 1987 <b>expressly prohibits</b> <b>the entering into contracts</b> involving the expenditure of public funds unless two prior requirements are satisfied. <b><i>First</i>, there must be an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure required in the contract</b>. <b><i>Second</i>, there must be attached to the contract a certification by the proper accounting official and auditor that funds have been appropriated by law and such funds are available</b>. Failure to comply with any of these two requirements renders the contract void.<br><br>Thus, Sections 46, 47 and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 provide:<br><blockquote>SECTION&nbsp; 46.&nbsp; Appropriation Before Entering into Contract. — (1) <b>No contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor</b>, the unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to cover the proposed expenditure; and<br><br>(2) Notwithstanding this provision, contracts for the procurement of supplies and materials to be carried in stock may be entered into under regulations of the Commission provided that when issued, the supplies and materials shall be charged to the proper appropriations account.<br><br>SECTION&nbsp; 47.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate Showing Appropriation to Meet Contract. — Except in the case of a contract for personal service, for supplies for current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the estimated consumption for three (3) months, or banking transactions of government-owned or controlled banks, <b>no contract involving the expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current calendar year is available for expenditure on account thereof</b>, subject to verification by the auditor concerned. The certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it, shall be attached to and become an integral part of the proposed contract, and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of the government agency concerned under the contract is fully extinguished.<br><br>SECTION&nbsp; 48.&nbsp;&nbsp; Void Contract and Liability of Officer. — <b>Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two (2) immediately preceding sections shall be void</b>, and the officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the Government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Sections 85, 86 and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> an earlier law, contain the same provisions.<br><br>The Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly mandate that "<b>[N]o contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor</b>."<b> </b> The law prohibits the <b>mere entering into a contract</b> without the corresponding appropriation from Congress.&nbsp; It does not matter whether the contract is subject to a condition as to its effectivity, such as a subsequent favorable legal opinion by the Department of Justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> because even a contract with such condition is still a contract under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly mandate that "<b>[N]o contract involving the expenditure of public funds&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; shall be entered into or authorized unless the proper accounting official x x x shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for expenditure.</b>"&nbsp; The law prohibits not only the entering into the contract, but also authorizing the entering into the contract without the certification from the proper accounting official. This means that the certificate of appropriation and fund availability must be issued <b>before</b> the signing of the contract.<br><br>In addition, the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code expressly require that the "<b>certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it,</b> <b>shall be attached</b> <b>to and become an integral part of the proposed contract</b>."&nbsp;&nbsp; The certificate of appropriation and fund availability must be <b>attached to the </b>"<b>proposed contract</b>," again clearly showing that the certificate must be issued <b>before </b>the signing of the contract.<br><br>In several cases, the Court had the occasion to apply these provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. In these cases, the Court clearly ruled that the two requirements&nbsp; - the existence of appropriation and the attachment of the certification - are "<b>conditions <i>sine qua non</i> for the execution of government contracts</b>."&nbsp; In <i>COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; the Court ruled:<br><blockquote><b>It is quite evident from the tenor of the language of the law that the existence of appropriations and the availability of funds are indispensable pre-requisites to or conditions <i>sine qua non</i> for the execution of government contracts. The obvious intent is to impose such conditions as <i>a priori</i> requisites to the validity of the proposed contract.</b>&nbsp; Using this as our premise, we cannot accede to PHOTOKINA's contention that there is already a perfected contract. x x x<br><br>x x x<br><br>Petitioners are justified in refusing to formalize the contract with PHOTOKINA. Prudence dictated them not to enter into a contract not backed up by sufficient appropriation and available funds. Definitely, to act otherwise would be a futile exercise for the contract would inevitably suffer the vice of nullity.&nbsp; In <i>Osmeña vs. Commission on Audit</i>, this Court held:<br><blockquote>The Auditing Code of the Philippines (P.D. 1445) further provides that no contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor and the proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for expenditure on account thereof. Any contract entered into contrary to the foregoing requirements shall be VOID.<br><br>Clearly then, the contract entered into by the former Mayor Duterte was void from the very beginning since the agreed cost for the project (P8,368,920.00) was way beyond the appropriated amount (P5,419,180.00) as certified by the City Treasurer. Hence, the contract was properly declared void and unenforceable in COA's 2nd Indorsement, dated September 4, 1986. The COA declared and we agree, that:<br><blockquote>The prohibition contained in Sec. 85 of PD 1445 (Government Auditing Code) is explicit and mandatory. <b>Fund availability is, as it has always been, an indispensable prerequisite to the execution of any government contract involving the expenditure of public funds by all government agencies at all levels.</b> Such contracts are not to be considered as final or binding unless such a certification as to fund availability is issued (Letter of Instruction No. 767, s. 1978). Antecedent of advance appropriation is thus essential to government liability on contracts (Zobel vs. City of Manila, 47 Phil. 169). This contract being violative of the legal requirements aforequoted, the same contravenes Sec. 85 of PD 1445 and is null and void by virtue of Sec. 87.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Verily, the contract, as expressly declared by law, is inexistent and void ab initio.&nbsp; This is to say that the proposed contract is without force and effect from the very beginning or from its incipiency, as if it had never been entered into, and hence, cannot be validated either by lapse of time or ratification.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The law expressly declares void a procurement contract that fails to comply with the two requirements, namely, an appropriation law funding the contract and a certification of appropriation and fund availability.&nbsp;&nbsp; The clear purpose of these requirements is to insure that government contracts are never signed unless supported by the corresponding appropriation law and fund availability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; <b>The ZTE Supply Contract does not comply with any of these two requirements.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the ZTE Supply Contract is void for violation of Sections 46, 47 and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, as well as Sections 85, 86 and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. These provisions of both Codes implement Section 29(2), Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br>Public respondent National Economic and Development Authority is fully aware that all proceeds of loans and grants secured by the Philippine Government cannot be disbursed without an appropriation from Congress.&nbsp; Public respondent National Economic and Development Authority and its officials know, or ought to know by heart, that this is a fundamental requirement of the Constitution and existing statutes.&nbsp; The National Economic and Development Authority has succinctly summarized this fundamental rule in Section 5.1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations for the Official Development Assistance (ODA) Act of 1996:<br><blockquote>Section 5.1. General Principles on Budget -&nbsp; All expenditures, inclusive of counterpart and <b>proceeds of loans</b> and loans and grant funds, must be included in the annual national expenditure program to be submitted to Congress for approval.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>There can be no dispute that the proceeds of foreign loans, whether concluded or not, cannot be obligated in a procurement contract without a prior appropriation from Congress.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing the public respondents, advances two arguments to justify the absence of appropriation for the ZTE Supply Contract.&nbsp; First, there is no need for an appropriation by law because the loan agreement has not been concluded.&nbsp; Second, the automatic appropriation for payment of foreign loans under Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 1177<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> provides the appropriation cover to fund the ZTE Supply Contract.&nbsp; Thus, the OSG asserts:<br><blockquote>At the outset, there is no need yet for a budget allocation as the loan agreement has yet to be concluded.&nbsp; Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that one has already been executed, the appropriation therefor is covered by the Executive branch's power of automatic appropriation for payment of foreign loans contracted.&nbsp; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The OSG's first argument is an admission that when the ZTE Supply Contract was signed, there was no loan agreement, no loan proceeds, and no appropriation from Congress for the contract.&nbsp; This only drives the last nail deeper into the coffin of the ZTE Supply Contract because the absence of an appropriation from Congress makes the signing of the ZTE Supply Contract an unconstitutional&nbsp; and unlawful act.<br><br>The OSG's second argument betrays a lack of understanding of appropriations for payment of goods and services as distinguished from appropriations for repayment of loans. When the Executive branch secures a loan to fund a procurement of goods or services, the loan proceeds enter the National Treasury as part of the general funds of the government. Congress must appropriate by law the loan proceeds to fund the procurement of goods or services, otherwise the loan proceeds cannot be spent by the Executive branch.&nbsp; When the loan falls due, Congress must make another appropriation law authorizing the repayment of the loan out of the general funds in the National Treasury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]&nbsp; </sup>This appropriation for the <i>repayment of the loan</i> is what is covered by the automatic appropriation in Section 31 of PD No. 1177.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; It is not the appropriation needed to fund a procurement contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OSG's arguments are clearly misplaced.<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Absence of Public Bidding</i><br><br>The Government Procurement Reform Act requires public bidding in <b>all procurement </b>of infrastructure, goods and services. Section 10, Article IV of the Government Procurement Reform Act provides:<br><blockquote>Section 10. Competitive Bidding - <b>All procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding</b>, except as provided for in Article XVI of this Act. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In addition, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act provides that the Act applies to government procurement "regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign."&nbsp; Hence, the requirement of public bidding applies to foreign-funded contracts like the ZTE Supply Contract.<br><br>Respondents admit that there was no public bidding for the ZTE Supply Contract. Respondents do not claim that the ZTE Supply Contract falls under any of the exceptions to public bidding in Article XVI of the Government Procurement Reform Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, private respondent ZTE Corporation claims that the ZTE Supply Contract, <b>being part of an executive agreement</b>, is exempt from public bidding under the last sentence of Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act.&nbsp; Thus, private respondent ZTE Corporation argues:<br><blockquote>x x x Section 4 of RA 9184 itself expressly provides that executive agreements that deal on subject matters covered by said law shall be observed. Hence, the requirement of competitive bidding under section 10 of the law is not applicable. Section 4 of RA 9184 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 4. Scope and Application. -&nbsp; This Act shall apply to the procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138.&nbsp; <b>Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed</b>.<br></blockquote>x x x<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There is no provision in the Executive Agreement that requires the conduct of competitive public bidding before the award of the NBN Project, or any project envisioned in the RP-China MNOU for that matter.&nbsp; The subsequent exchange of notes between </b><b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">China</b><b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> and the </b><b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Philippines</b><b style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> clearly shows that ZTE was chosen as the contractor for the NBN Project.

Thus, a treaty may amend or repeal a prior law and <i>vice-versa.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]&nbsp; </sup>Hence, a treaty may change state policy embodied in a prior law.<br><br>In sharp contrast, an executive agreement, being an exclusive act of the Executive branch, does not have the status of a municipal law.&nbsp; Acting alone, the Executive has no law-making power. While the Executive does possess rule-making power, such power must be exercised consistent with the law it seeks to implement.<br><br>Consequently, an executive agreement cannot amend or repeal a prior law. An executive agreement must comply with state policy embodied in existing municipal law.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court has declared:<br><blockquote>International agreements involving political issues or changes of national policy and those involving international arrangements of a permanent character usually take the form of treaties.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>But international agreements embodying adjustments of detail carrying out well-established national policies and traditions and those involving arrangements of a more or less temporary nature usually take the form of executive agreements</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Executive agreements are intended to carry out <b>well-established national policies</b>, and these are found in statutes.<br><br>In the United States, from where we adopted the concept of executive agreements, the prevailing view is that <b>executive agreements</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><b> cannot alter existing law but must conform with all statutory requirements</b>.&nbsp; The U.S. State Department has explained the distinction between treaties and executive agreements in this manner:<br><blockquote>x x x it may be desirable to point out here the well-recognized distinction between an executive agreement and a treaty.&nbsp; In brief, it is that <b>the former cannot alter the existing law and must conform to all statutory enactments</b>, whereas a treaty, if ratified by and with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate, as required by the Constitution, itself becomes the supreme law of the land and takes precedence over any prior statutory enactments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As Professor Erwin Chemerinsksy states, "So long as the (U.S.) president is not violating another constitutional provision or a federal statute, there seems little basis for challenging the constitutionality of an executive agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the United States, while an executive agreement cannot alter a federal law, an executive agreement prevails over state law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Likewise, Professor Laurence H. Tribe states that an executive agreement cannot override a prior act of Congress even as it prevails over state law. Thus:<br><blockquote>x x x Although it seems clear that an unratified&nbsp; executive agreement, unlike a treaty, cannot override a prior act of Congress, executive agreements, even without Senate ratification, have the same weight as formal treaties in their effect upon conflicting state laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Professor Tribe cited <i>United States v. Gary W.

The Government Procurement Reform Act has laid down a categorical state policy - "<b>All procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding</b>," subject only to narrowly defined exceptions that respondents do not invoke here.&nbsp; Consequently, the executive agreement between China and the Philippines cannot exempt the ZTE Supply Contract from the state policy of public bidding.<br><br>Private respondent ZTE Corporation further claims that the ZTE Supply Contract is part of the executive agreement between China and the Philippines. This is plain error.&nbsp;&nbsp; An executive agreement is an agreement <b>between governments</b>.&nbsp; The Executive branch has defined an "international agreement," which includes an executive agreement, to refer to a contract or an understanding "<b>entered</b> <b>into between the Philippines and another government</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>That the Chinese Government handpicked the ZTE Corporation to supply the goods and services to the Philippine Government does not make the ZTE Supply Contract an executive agreement.&nbsp; ZTE Corporation is not a government or even a government agency performing governmental or developmental functions like the Export-Import Bank of China or the Japan Bank for International Cooperation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> or a multilateral lending agency organized by governments like the World Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; ZTE Corporation is a business enterprise performing purely commercial functions.

Scope and Application - This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of the source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches of the government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or-controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138.&nbsp; <b style="font-weight: bold;">Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondents argue that the second sentence of Section 4 allows an executive agreement to override the mandatory public bidding in Section 10 of the Government Procurement Reform Act.<br><br>Respondents' argument is flawed.&nbsp; First, an executive agreement, being&nbsp; an exclusive act of the Executive branch, cannot amend or repeal a mandatory provision of law requiring public bidding in government procurement contracts.&nbsp; To construe otherwise the second sentence of Section 4 would constitute an undue delegation of legislative powers to the President, making such sentence unconstitutional. There are no standards prescribed in the Government Procurement Reform Act that would guide the President in exercising such alleged delegated legislative power. Thus, the second sentence of Section 4 cannot be construed to delegate to the President the legislative power to amend or repeal mandatory requirements in the Government Procurement Reform Act.<br><br>Second, under Section 10 of the Government Procurement Reform Act, the only exceptions to mandatory public bidding are those specified in Article XVI of the Act.&nbsp; These specified exceptions do not include purchases from foreign suppliers handpicked by foreign governments, or from suppliers owned or controlled by foreign governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act mandates that the "Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, <b>regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign</b> x x x."<br><br>Third, the second sentence of Section 4 should be read in conjunction with Section 4 of the Foreign Borrowings Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 4. In the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act, <b>the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any law granting preferences or imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding</b>, including among others, Act Numbered Four Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-Nine, Commonwealth Act Numbered One Hundred Thirty-Eight, the provisions of Commonwealth Act Numbered Five Hundred Forty-One, insofar as such provisions do not pertain to constructions primarily for national defense or security purposes, Republic Act Numbered Five Thousand One Hundred Eighty-Three: Provided, however, That as far as practicable, utilization of the services of qualified domestic firms in the prosecution of projects financed under this Act shall be encouraged: Provided, further, That in case where international competitive bidding shall be conducted preference of at least fifteen per centum shall be granted in favor of articles, materials, or supplies of the growth, production or manufacture of the Philippines: <b>Provided, finally, That the method and procedure in the comparison of bids shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Likewise, Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act should be read in conjunction with Section 11-A of the Official Development Assistance Act of 1996:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 11-A. In the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act or any law, <b>the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any provision of law granting preferences in connection with, or imposing restrictions on, the procurement of goods or services</b>: Provided, however, That as far as practicable, utilization of the services of qualified Filipino citizens or corporations or associations owned by such citizens in the prosecution of projects financed under this Act shall be prepared&nbsp; on the basis of the standards set for a particular project: Provided, further, That the matter of preference in favor of articles, materials, or supplies of the growth, production or manufacture of the Philippines, including <b>the method or procedure in the comparison of bids for purposes therefor, shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Consequently, as construed together, the executive agreements mentioned in the second sentence of Section 4 of the Government Procurement Reform Act should refer to executive agreements on <b>(1) the waiver or modification of preferences to local goods or domestic suppliers;</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><b> (2) the waiver or modification of restrictions on international competitive bidding; and (3)</b> <b>the method or procedure in the comparison of bids</b>.<br><br>The executive agreements cannot refer to the waiver of public bidding for two reasons.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, the law only allows the President to "waive or modify, the application of any law x x x imposing <b>restrictions</b> on international competitive bidding."&nbsp; The law does not authorize the President to waive entirely public bidding but only the restrictions on public bidding.&nbsp; Thus, the President may <b>restrict</b> the public bidding to suppliers domiciled in the country of the creditor.&nbsp; This is the usual modification on restrictions imposed by creditor countries. <i>Second</i>, when the law speaks of executive agreements on the method or procedure <b>in the comparison of bids</b>, the obvious assumption is there will be competitive bidding.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, there is no provision of law allowing waiver of public bidding outside of the well-defined exceptions in Article XVI of the Government Procurement Reform Act.<br><br>Respondents, while not raising this argument, cannot also rely on Section 1 of the Foreign Borrowings Act, which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. The President of the Philippines is hereby authorized, in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, to contract such loans, credits, including supplier's credit, deferred payment arrangements, or indebtedness <b>as may be necessary and upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon</b>, not inconsistent with this Act, with Governments of foreign countries with whom the Philippines has diplomatic or trade relations or which are members of the United Nations, their agencies, instrumentalities or financial institutions or with reputable international organizations or non-governmental national or international lending institutions or firms extending supplier's credit deferred payment arrangements x x x .&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A solitary Department of Justice opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> has ventured that the phrase "as may be necessary and upon terms and conditions as may be agreed upon" serves as statutory basis for the President to exempt foreign-funded government procurement contracts from public bidding.&nbsp; This is a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase means that the President has discretion to decide the <b>terms and conditions of the loan</b>, such as the rate of interest, the maturity period, amortization amounts, and similar matters. This phrase does not delegate to the President the legislative power to amend or repeal mandatory provisions of law like compulsory public bidding of government procurement contracts. Otherwise, this phrase would constitute undue delegation of legislative power since there are no standards that would guide the President in exercising this alleged delegated legislative power.<br><br>What governs the waiver or modification of restrictions on public bidding is Section 4-A of the Foreign Borrowings Act, which authorizes the President to, "when necessary, agree to modify the application of any law x x x imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding."&nbsp; Section 4 is the specific provision of the Foreign Borrowings Act that deals with the President's authority to waive or modify restrictions on public bidding.&nbsp; Section 1 of the Act does not deal with the requirement of public bidding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, if Section 1 is construed as granting the President full authority to waive or limit public bidding, Section 4 becomes a superfluous provision.<br><br>In any event, whatever doubt may have existed before has been erased by the enactment in 2003 of the Government Procurement Reform Act, which <b>reformed</b> the laws regulating government procurement.&nbsp; The following provisions of the Act clearly prescribe the rule that government procurement contracts shall be subject to mandatory public bidding:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Governing Principles on Government Procurement. - <b>All procurement </b>of the national government, its departments, bureaus, offices and agencies, including state universities and colleges, government-owned and/or controlled corporations, government financial institutions and local government units shall, in all cases, be governed by these principles:<br><br>(a)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>Transparency</b> in the procurement process x x x.<br><br>(b)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>Competitiveness</b> by extending equal opportunity to enable private contracting parties who are eligible and qualified to participate in <b>public bidding</b>.<br><br>x x x.<br><br>Section 4.
