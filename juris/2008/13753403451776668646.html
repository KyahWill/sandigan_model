In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.<br><br>There is "<b>labor-only</b>" contracting where the <u>person supplying workers</u> to an employer <b><u>does not have substantial capital</u> or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others,</b> AND <b>the workers recruited and placed by such person are <u>performing activities which are directly related to the principal business</u> of such employer</b>. In such cases, <b>the person or intermediary shall be considered <u>merely as an agent</u> of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him</b>. (Emphasis, capitalization and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Legitimate contracting and labor-only contracting are defined in Department Order (D.O.) No. 18-02, Series of 2002 (Rules Implementing Articles 106 to 109 of the Labor Code, as amended) as follows:<br><br>Section 3. <i>Trilateral relationship in contracting arrangements</i>. In <b>legitimate contracting</b>, there exists a trilateral relationship under which there is a contract for a specific job, work or service between the principal and the contractor or subcontractor, and a contract of employment between the contractor or subcontractor and its workers. Hence, there are three parties involved in these arrangements, <u>the principal</u> which decides to farm out a job or service to a contractor or subcontractor, <u>the contractor</u> or subcontractor which has the capacity to independently undertake the performance of the job, work or service, and <u>the contractual workers</u> engaged by the contractor or subcontractor to accomplish the job, work or service.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>Section 5.&nbsp; <i>Prohibition against labor-only contracting</i>. <b>Labor-only contracting</b> is hereby declared prohibited. For this purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, <u>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span> of the following elements are [<i>sic</i>] present</u>:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%">(i) </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">The contractor or subcontractor <b>does not have substantial capital or investment</b> which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are <b>directly related to the main business of the principal</b>; OR</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">(ii) </td> <td><div align="justify">The contractor <b>does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work</b> of the contractual employee. (Emphasis, underscoring and capitalization supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>“Substantial capital or investment” and the “right to control” are defined in the same Section 5 of the Department Order as follows:<br><br>"<b>Substantial capital</b> or investment" refers to capital stocks and subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, <u>tools, equipment, implements, machineries and work premises</u>, actually and directly used by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of the job, work or service contracted out.<br><br>The "<b>right to control</b>" shall refer to the right reserved to the person <u>for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end</u>.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>From the records of the case, it is gathered that the work performed by almost all of the respondents – loading and unloading of baggage and cargo of passengers – is directly related to the main business of petitioner.&nbsp; And the equipment used by respondents as station loaders, such as trailers and conveyors, are owned by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Petitioner asserts, however, that mere compliance with substantial capital requirement suffices for Synergy to be considered a legitimate contractor, citing <i>Neri v.

Neither had respondents shown that SYNERGY has such substantial capital</u>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>It was only after the appellate court rendered its challenged Decision of September 29, 2002 when petitioner, in its Motion for Reconsideration of the decision, sought to prove, for the first time, Synergy’s substantial capitalization by attaching photocopies of Synergy’s financial statements, <i>e.g.</i>, balance sheets, statements of income and retained earnings, marked as “Annexes ‘A’ – ‘A-4.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>More significantly, however, is that respondents worked alongside petitioner’s regular employees who were performing identical work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; As <i>San Miguel Corporation v.

Esteva, et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> teach, such is an indicium of labor-only contracting.<br><br>For labor-only contracting to exist, Section 5 of D.O. No. 18-02 which requires <i>any</i> of two elements to be present is, for convenience, re- quoted:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%">(i) </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">The contractor or subcontractor does not have <b>substantial capital or investment</b> which relates to the job, work or service to be performed <b><u>and</u></b> the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are <b>directly related to the main business of the principal, OR</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">(ii)</td> <td><div align="justify">The contractor does not exercise the <b>right to control</b> over the performance of the work of the contractual employee.
