Along the way, they met Marcos Gumangan (<i>Marcos</i>) and Angel Gatchalian (<i>Angel</i>) with whom they exchanged greetings; it was Danilo's first time to visit Goyoden after several years. They all walked towards the west with Marcos and Angel walking behind them.

He responded to the call of this person by approaching him but when he was near him, this person boxed him but he was not hit.

Camba and said investigation was in writing and signed by him (Exhibit D, D-1 and D-2), but he said that the document was not his statement although it bears his signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He was forced to sign the investigation because he was afraid of the investigator who bears the same family name as the victim but he does not know if they are related; x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, he declared that he did not plan to kill the victim and his killing was accidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He gave his affidavit in the Bolinao dialect in questions and answers (Exhibits D and series); that all the signatures bearing his name are his (Exhibit D-4, D-5, D-6); that this document has an English translation (Exhibit F); x x x that he admitted on direct examination that he stabbed Danilo Camba and he threw the knife into the sea when he rode on a motorboat and was confused; that he knew that the date when he stabbed Danilo Camba was August 20, 1989 and in the afternoon but he did no know the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On re-direct examination, the accused declared that the reason for his stabbing Danilo Camba was that when they met on the road and Camba was drunk, without any provocation on his part, Camba positioned to box him so he drew his knife and stabbed him; that he did not know the reason why Camba wanted to box him; that at that time, Camba was with one Fedelino Gatchalian; that he had no previous grudge with Camba because he did not know him; that he did not see the victim with any weapon and he did not know if he was armed or not; and that he is bigger than Camba.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> [<i>Footnotes referring to the pertinent parts of the record supplied</i>]<br></blockquote>The RTC convicted the appellant of the crime of murder in its decision of August 18, 1999 as follows:<br><blockquote>Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, the Court hereby renders judgment, finding the accused Clemente Casta y Carolino, of Barangay Goyoden, Bolinao, Pangasinan, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder for the death of Danilo Camba, of the same place, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P50,000.00 as compensation for the death of the victim, P100,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages and P13,000.00 as actual damages.<br><br>With costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>The records of this case were originally transmitted to this Court on appeal.

These actual findings and conclusions assume greater weight if they are affirmed by the CA. Despite the enhanced persuasive effect of the initial RTC factual ruling and the results of the CA's appellate factual review, we nevertheless fully scrutinized the records of this case as the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> that the lower courts imposed on the accused demands no less than this kind of scrutiny.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>A striking feature of this case is that the appellant <b>did not deny</b> that he stabbed Danilo.

However, when the accused admits the killing and, by way of justification, pleads self-defense, the burden of evidence shifts; he must then show by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in self-defense. For that purpose, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Article 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code spells out the elements that the accused must establish by clear and convincing evidence to successfully plead self-defense.  The Article provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 11. <i>Justifying Circumstances</i>. - The following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><br>1.   Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:<br><br><i>First</i>. Unlawful aggression;<br><br><i>Second.</i> Reasonable necessity of the means to prevent or repel it;<br><br><i>Third</i>. Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div></blockquote>There is unlawful aggression when the peril to one's life, limb or right is either actual or imminent.  There must be actual physical force or actual use of a weapon. It is a statutory and doctrinal requirement to establish self-defense that unlawful aggression must be present.  It is a condition <i>sine qua non</i>; t<b>here can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete, unless the victim commits unlawful aggression against the person defending himself</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>We find that the appellant miserably failed to prove that he had to defend himself against an unlawful aggression. Aside from his own claim (which we find under the circumstances to be self-serving), the appellant did not present any other evidence to corroborate his claim that the victim boxed him when they met on the road in Sitio Makber, <i>Barangay</i> Goyoden, Bolinao, Pangasinan. As against his bald claim, two eye-witnesses - Marlyn and Modesto - saw no unlawful aggression by the victim against the appellant.  Marlyn testified that at the time he was stabbed, Danilo was merely standing near the roadside fronting her (Marlyn's) house. Modesto, on the other hand, narrated that, he, Danilo and several others were simply walking slowly along the <i>Sitio</i> Makber, Goyoden road towards the west when the appellant suddenly approached from behind and stabbed Danilo.<br><br>We find no reason to disbelieve these straightforward narration of the events surrounding the stabbing that led to Danilo's death. Nor do we see anything on the record showing any improper motive that would lead the witnesses to testify as they did. In fact, the appellant never imputed any such motive on Marlyn and Modesto. The established rule, laid down in an already long line of cases, is that in the absence of evidence showing any reason or motive for the prosecution witnesses to falsely testify, their testimony can be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, no actual or imminent threat to the appellant's life or limb existed when he stabbed Danilo to death.<br><br><b><u>The Crime Committed</u></b><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code defines the crime of murder as follows:<br><blockquote>Article 248. <i>Murder</i>. - Any person who not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. With treachery x x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Treachery, the qualifying circumstance alleged against the appellant, exists when an offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms which tend directly or especially to ensure its execution, without risk to the offender, arising from the defense that the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  This definition sets out what must be shown by evidence to conclude that treachery existed, namely: (1) the employment of such means of execution as would give the person attacked no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation; and (2) the deliberate and conscious adoption of the means of execution. To reiterate, the essence of qualifying circumstance is the suddenness, surprise and the lack of expectation that the attack will take place, thus depriving the victim of any real opportunity for self-defense while ensuring the commission of the crime without risk to the aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The evidence in the case shows that Danilo was by the roadside when the appellant, wielding a deadly weapon - a double-bladed knife - suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed him.  The unsuspecting victim was hit at the back below the left armpit, puncturing his heart and lungs. As the witnesses testified, the attack was sudden and while the victim was in an unguarded position: from his rear so that the unsuspecting victim had practically no chance to defend himself.  The location of the thrust - at the left side, below the armpit - shows that the heart was the targeted organ to immediately incapacitate the victim and render him unable to defend against or respond to the attack. As the evidence shows, the victim simply fell immediately after being stabbed, in the way that a raging bull immediately crumbles to its knees, spent and harmless, upon being hit by the matador's sword thrust, delivered from above, between its shoulder blades, targeting the heart.  These mode, manner and execution of the attack, to our mind, bespeak of treachery.<br><br><b><u>Voluntary Surrender</u></b><br><br>Voluntary surrender, properly undertaken, is a mitigating circumstance that lowers the imposable penalty.  It is present when the following elements concur: a) the offender has not been actually arrested; b) the offender surrenders himself to a person in authority or to the latter's agent; and c) the surrender is voluntary. To be sufficient, the surrender must be spontaneous and made in a manner clearly indicating the intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally, either because he acknowledges his guilt or wishes to save the authorities the trouble and expense attendant to the efforts of searching for and capturing him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>We find all the requisites present in this case. The appellant testified that he had asked his uncle, Ediom Casta, to go to the police to signify his intention to surrender. At around 7:00 o'clock in the morning of August 21, 1989, SPO1 (then Patrolman) Camba came to his house to bring him back to the Bolinao Police Station for investigation. The appellant's testimony that he voluntarily surrendered was corroborated by the November 21, 1991 testimony of SPO1 Camba, which we quote:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

For voluntary surrender to mitigate an offense, it is not required that the accused surrender at the first opportunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  Here, the appellant went voluntarily went with SPO1 Camba to the police station within a day after the killing to own up to the killing.  Thus, the police did not devote time and effort to the investigation of the killing and to the search and capture of the assailant.<br><br>Based on these considerations, we hold that the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be appreciated in appellant's favor.<br><br><b><u>The Proper Penalty</u></b><br><br>The Information in this case indicates that the crime of murder was committed by the appellant on August 20, 1989 which was before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7659 on December 31, 1993 amending Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code on murder, raising the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Prior to its amendment the penalty for the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code was <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death.<br><br>In light of the greater penalty that attaches under the amendment, the previous penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death will have to be imposed in order not to run afoul of the constitutional prohibition against <i>ex post facto</i> laws.  Under <b>Section 22 of Article III of the 1987 Constitution</b>, no <i>ex post facto</i> law or bill of attainder shall be enacted.  An <i>ex post facto</i> law, among others, is one that changes the penalty and inflicts a  greater punishment than what the law annexed to the crime when committed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> - the situation that would obtain if the amendment under Republic Act No. 7659 would be applied.<br><br>Considering that the appellant has in his favor the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender with no aggravating circumstance to  offset it, the imposable penalty should be in the minimum period, i.e., <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the <b>maximum</b> sentence shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period (17 years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years) and the <b>minimum</b> shall be taken from the next lower penalty, which is <i>prision mayor</i> maximum to <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium (10 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months).<br><br><b><u>Civil Liability</u></b><br><br><b>    </b>The RTC awarded the amount of P13,000.00 to the victim's heirs as actual damages in light of established jurisprudence that allows only expenses duly supported by receipts as proof of actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  This RTC ruling has however been overtaken by our rulings in the landmark cases of <i>People v. Abrazaldo<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></b> </i>and <i>People v. Villanueva</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  In <i>Abrazaldo, </i>we ruled that where the amount of the actual damages cannot be determined because of the absence of supporting and duly presented receipts but evidence confirming the heirs' entitlement to actual damages, temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 may be awarded. This ruling was reiterated, with slight modification in <i>Villanueva</i>, where we held that when the actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, we can nevertheless award temperate damages of P25,000.00.  Thus, the heirs' entitlement is P25,000.00 of temperate damages.<br><br>We also modify the award of P100,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages which the RTC lumped together. Moral damages are mandatory in cases of murder and homicide without need of allegation and proof other than the death of the victim. We find the award of P50,000.00 as moral damages in order in accordance with established jurisprudence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The award of exemplary damages is justified by the duly proven qualifying circumstance of treachery; when a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance, either qualifying or generic, an award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is justified under Article 2230 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>We cannot award loss of earning capacity to the victim's heirs since  no documentary evidence was presented to substantiate this claim. As a rule, documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for damages for loss of earning capacity. While there are exceptions to the rule, these exceptions do not apply as the victim, Danilo, was an employee of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan when he died; he was not a worker earning less than the minimum wage under the prevailing labor laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>We affirm the P50,000.00 death indemnity awarded to the victim's heirs, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of all the foregoing, we hereby <b>AFFIRM </b>the March 10, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
