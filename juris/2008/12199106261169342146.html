				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sta. Lucia Realty Development, Inc. (petitioner), developer of "The Royale Tagaytay Estates" which is a subdivision project located in Alfonso, Cavite, offered lots for sale payable on installments, proffering that the development of the project would be completed by September 1999. The sales brochures of the project detailed the following improvements and amenities:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Church<br><br></li><li> Grand Clubhouse<br><br></li><li> Landscaped gardens and promenade<br><br></li><li> Basketball court<br><br></li><li> Adult pool<br><br></li><li> Kiddie swimming pool<br><br></li><li> Multipurpose hall<br><br></li><li> Function room system<br><br></li><li> Billiards<br><br></li><li> Grand Entrance (Ph.

Under the contracts to sell which were all dated May 21, 1999, each of the respondents would and did in fact pay a downpayment of P240,000, and the balance of P960,000 would be paid in 10 years at 21% interest per annum. Respondents paid their monthly amortizations until April 2001 when they suspended further payments, the promised delivery date of the project not having been met, and the improvements and amenities reflected in the sales brochures were yet to be introduced or completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondents thus sent petitioner a letter demanding the completion of the entire project and informing it that they were suspending the payment of monthly amortizations on account of "contractual breach."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Petitioner for its part also sent letters to respondents advising them of their default in the payment of their monthly amortizations covering the period March 2001 up to the third quarter of 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On August 22, 2002, respondents lodged a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against petitioner at the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) Regional Field Office No. IV, praying for the completion of the project within six months or, in the alternative, for the refund of their total payments to bear interest at 21% per annum reckoned from February 1999 until said payments are finally paid, and for the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>In an ocular inspection of the subdivision conducted on December 3, 2002, the HLURB Regional Office found that, indeed, the project remained unfinished.

The report went on to state, however, that works on the electrical distribution system and perimeter fence remained at 5% and 50%, respectively, as of September 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioner disclaimed having had any participation in the preparation of the advertising materials distributed by the marketing firm Asian Pacific Realty Brokerage, Inc., a separate and distinct entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>To further shore up its case, petitioner reiterated that it is not precluded from asking from the HLURB for extension of time to complete the project, citing License to Sell No. R4-98-12-0203<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which provides, among other things, that it could<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><ol start="2"><li> Apply for an extension of time to complete the development in case the project cannot be completed <u>within the prescribed period before its expiration;</u></li></ol>x x x x (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>HLURB, by letter dated November 5, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in fact granted petitioner an extension until September 2004 to complete Phase II-B of the project.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of June 23, 2003, the HLURB ruled in favor of respondents, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the complainants and against the respondent to read as follows:<br><ol type="1"><li> Ordering the <b style="text-decoration: underline;">rescission</b> of the Contracts to Sell between the complainants and respondent;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the respondent to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refund</span> complainant Romeo Uyecio the amount of P1,224,000.00 with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interest at 12% per annum</span> from the filing of the complaint until full payment;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the respondent to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refund</span> the complainant Reynaldo Uyecio the amount of P816,000.00 with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interest at 12 % per annum</span> from the filing of the complaint until full payment;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the respondent to refund complainants Amaris Uyecio and Manuel Uyecio the amount of P408,000.00 each with interest at 12 % per annum from the filing of the complaint until full payment;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the respondent to pay complainant(s) the amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees to be divided among the complainants in proportion to their respective claims;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the respondent to pay this Board P20,000.00 as administrative fine for violation of Sections 19 and 20 in relation to Section 38 of P.D. 957.</li></ol>SO ORDERED. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The HLURB Board of Commissioners (First Division) to which petitioner appealed the decision via petition for review denied its petition by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of December 5, 2003 and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of March 31, 2004.<br><br>The Office of the President (OP) affirmed the HLURB decision. The Court of Appeals in turn affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that of the HLURB.<br><br>Hence, the present petition for review, petitioner faulting the Court of Appeals in upholding the rescission of the contracts to sell, in granting respondents' prayer for refund with exorbitant interest, and in upholding the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the issues raised by petitioner bearing on findings of facts to be mere rehash of those already passed upon by the HLURB, the OP and the appellate court.<br><br>In the absence of substantial showing that the findings of facts of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise were arrived at from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are considered conclusive, and in the interest of stability of the governmental structure, are not to be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioner has not shown any ground to merit a disturbance of the findings of the HLURB which have been sustained by the OP and the appellate court.<br><br>It bears noting that petitioners' project accomplishment report and the HLURB letter dated November 5, 2003 granting petitioner's request for the completion of the subdivision until September 2004, which request does not even appear to have been made "within the prescribed period before its expiration," corroborate the findings in the HLURB ocular inspection report and respondents' claim that petitioner did not finish the project within the announced time frame. Petitioner's counterclaim that it was respondents who were in default is immaterial to the issue of its failure to finish its project on time.<br><br><i>En passant</i>, even assuming arguendo that respondents defaulted, albeit the evidence shows otherwise, that did not prevent petitioner from exercising its option to cancel the contracts to sell. It did not, however. It merely demanded in May 2002 the payment of overdue amortizations from respondents, after the lapse of 14 months of alleged default.<br><br>The, fact is that respondents suspended their payment of monthly amortizations pending compliance by petitioner with its contractual obligation, which is justified under Section 23 of Presidential Decree No. 957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioner's attempt at reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision thus fails.<br><br>A word on the application by the HLURB, the OP, and the appellate court of Article 1191<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Civil Code on rescission.<br><br>The case involves <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contracts to sell,</span> not a contract which absolutely conveys real property. Distinguishing the two contracts, the Court, in <i>Rillo</i><i> v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><i> </i>held:<br><blockquote>x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In a contract to sell real property on installments, the </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">full payment</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of the purchase price is a </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">positive suspensive condition</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, the failure of which is not considered a breach,</span> casual or serious, but simply an event which prevented the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring any obligatory force. The transfer of ownership and title would occur after full payment of the purchase price. We held in Luzon Brokerage Co., Inc. v. Maritime Building Co., Inc. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that there can be </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">no rescission</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of an obligation that is still non-existent, the </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">suspensive</b><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> condition not having happened</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Articles 1191 of the Civil Code does not thus apply to a contract to sell since there can be no rescission of an obligation that is still non-existent, the suspensive condition not having occurred. In other words, the breach contemplated in Article 1191 is the obligor's failure to comply with an obligation already extant, like a contract of sale, not a failure of a condition to render binding that obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Cancellation, not rescission, of the contract to sell is thus the correct remedy in the premises.<br><br>On the issue of damages, the Court sustains the award of moral and exemplary damages given the testimonial evidence of respondents thereon.<br><br>As for the award of P50,000 attorney's fees, the Court sustains it too, respondents having been compelled to litigate with petitioner and incur expenses to enforce and protect their interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the issue of interest, the imposition of 12% per annum interest on the amount of refund must be reduced to 6%, conformably with this Court's ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.
