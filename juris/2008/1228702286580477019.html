				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court is confronted with another case of rape.&nbsp; The victim, a 13-year-old girl.&nbsp; And although the Court may be moved by compassion and sympathy, the Court, as a court of law, is duty-bound to apply the law.

ERGUIZA guilty of RAPE under Article 266-a paragraph 1(a) in relation to Article 266-b of R.A. 8353 and R.A. 7659 and sentences (sic) to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the offended party, AAA P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, P50,000 as exemplary damages, to give support to AAA's offspring and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the CA aptly summarized the respective versions of the parties, based on the evidence presented before the trial court, thus:<br><blockquote><center><b>PROSECUTION'S VERSION:</b><br></center><br>On <b>January 5, 2000</b>, at around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, <b>AAA, a thirteen-year old first year high school student, together with her friends, siblings Joy and Ricky Agbuya</b>, went to the mango orchard located at the back of ZZZ Elementary School to gather fallen mangoes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <b>When they were bound for home at around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon</b>, <b>AAA's short pants got hooked on the fence. AAA asked Joy and Ricky to wait for her but they ran away and left her</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>While AAA was trying to unhook her short pants, Larry suddenly grabbed and pulled her. Poking a knife at her neck, Larry threatened to hurt her if she would make a noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant dragged AAA towards a place where a tamarind tree and other thorny plants grow. Then Larry removed his maong pants and forced AAA to lie down on the grassy ground. Thereafter, he removed her short pants and panty, mounted himself on top of her and inserted his penis into her private parts and made push and pull movements. He likewise raised AAA's "sando" and mashed her breast. AAA felt pain when accused-appellant entered her and she felt something sticky in her private part after Larry made the push and pull movements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Larry told AAA not to tell anybody about the incident otherwise he would kill her and all the members of her family and then he ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>AAA lingered for a while at the place and kept crying. Having spent her tears, she wore her panty and short pants and proceeded to the adjacent store of her Aunt Beth who was asleep. After staying for some time at the store, AAA decided to come (sic) home. Upon reaching home, she directly went to bed. Fearing Larry's threat, AAA kept mum on the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On April 7, 2000, BBB brought her daughter AAA to her grandmother (BBB's mother), a <i>hilot</i> residing in XXX, Tarlac, to consult her on the unusual palpitation on the mid-portion of AAA's throat and the absence of her monthly period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> After examining AAA, her grandmother told BBB that her daughter was pregnant.<br><br>BBB asked AAA who was the father of her unborn child but AAA refused to talk. After much prodding, and in the presence of her Uncle, Rudy Domingo, AAA finally revealed that she was raped by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On April 8, 2000, AAA, accompanied by her mother and uncle, went to the police headquarters in YYY, Pangasinan to report the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Then the police brought her to YYY District Hospital<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> where Dr. James Sison, Medical Officer III of said hospital conducted the examination on Michelle. Dr. Sison made the following findings:<br><br>"Q. x x x No extragenital injuries noted. Complete healed hymenal laceration 11:00 o'clock. x x x.&nbsp; In layman's term, Dr. Sison found no physical injury from the breast, the body except the genital area wherein he found a significant laceration complete (sic) healed over 11:00 o'clock."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Dr. Sison also testified that a single sexual intercourse could make a woman pregnant.<br><br>BBB testified that her daughter AAA stopped going to school after she was raped and that no amount of money could bring back the lost reputation of her daughter.<br><br>CCC (AAA's father), testified that on May 2, 2000, the family of accused-appellant went to their house and initially offered P50,000 and later P150,000; that in January 5, 2000, while they were repairing his house for the wedding reception<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>, Larry left at around 4:00 o'clock p.m.<br><center><br><b>DEFENSE'S VERSION</b><br></center><br>On January 5, 2000, Larry Erguiza helped in the repair of CCC's<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> house from 8:00 o'clock in the morning up to 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon. When he reached home at around 5:00 pm, his mother Albina Erguiza instructed him to fetch a "<i>hilot</i>" as his wife Josie was already experiencing labor pains. He proceeded to fetch the "<i>hilot</i>" Juanita Angeles and stayed in their house until his wife delivered a baby at around 3:00 o'clock in the morning of January 6, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>Juanita Angeles corroborated Larry's testimony that he indeed fetched her at around 5:10 pm on January 5, 2000 to attend to his wife who was experiencing labor pains and who delivered a baby at about 3:00 a.m. of January 6, 2000; and that Larry never left his wife's side until the latter gave birth.</b><br><br>Albina, mother of the accused-appellant, testified that AAA is the daughter of her "<i>balae</i><i>"</i> Spouses CCC and BBB; that her son Larry, her husband and two others left CCC and BBB's residence at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon on January 5, 2000; that she went to Spouses CCC and BBB to talk about the charge of rape against her son; that Spouses&nbsp; CCC and BBB were asking for P1,000,000.00 which was later reduced to P250,000.00 and that she made a counter-offer of P5,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b>Joy Agbuya testified that she and AAA were at the mango orchard of Juanito Macaraeg on </b><b>January 5, 2000</b><b>; that she never left AAA when her short pants got hooked; that they went together to the store of Auntie Beth where they parted</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Juanito Macaraeg, the mango orchard caretaker, testified that the house of Larry was a walking distance of about three minutes from the mango orchard; that if one runs fast, it would only take a minute to reach his house; and that he could not recall having seen Larry in the orchard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In its Decision dated November 18, 2005, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, but modified the amount of the award of exemplary damages and costs as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing circumstances, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of San Carlos (Pangasinan), Branch 57 dated November 27, 2000 in Criminal Case No. SCC-3282 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>. Accused-appellant Larry Erguiza is held <b>GUILTY</b> of Rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is ordered to pay the victim AAA P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages and to give support to AAA's offspring.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, herein appeal.<br><br>In his appeal Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> appellant raises the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol><li>THE COURT A QUO GRAVLEY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE, THUS UNBELIEVABLE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AAA.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECTUION EVIDENCE FAILED TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT APPRECIATING ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S DEFENSE OF ALIBI CORROBORATED BY THE WITNESSES PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The appeal is meritorious.&nbsp; The prosecution's evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty.<br><br>This Court has ruled that in the review of rape cases, the Court is guided by the following precepts: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility, but it is more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (b) the complainant's testimony must be scrutinized with extreme caution since, by the very nature of the crime, only two persons are normally involved; and (c) if the complainant's testimony is convincingly credible, the accused may be convicted of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the CA upheld the conclusion of the RTC in finding the complainant credible, to wit:<br><blockquote>The testimonies of victims who are young and of tender age, like AAA, deserve full credence and should not be dismissed as mere fabrication especially where they have absolutely no motive to testify against the accused-appellant as in this case. Larry even admitted that AAA had no ill motive for charging him with rape. The Supreme Court in several cases, ruled that full credence is accorded the testimony of a rape victim who has shown no ill motive to testify against the accused. This being so, the trial court did not err in giving full credence to AAA's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court does not agree with the CA.<br><br>The Court is not unmindful of the general rule that findings of the trial court regarding credibility of witnesses are accorded great respect and even finality on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; However, this principle does not preclude a reevaluation of the evidence to determine whether material facts or circumstances have been overlooked or misinterpreted by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; In the past, this Court has not hesitated to reverse a judgment of conviction, where there were strong indications pointing to the possibility that the rape charge was false.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Generally, when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.&nbsp; And so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility and unless the same is controverted by competent physical and testimonial evidence, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>After a judicious examination of the records of the case, the Court finds that there is testimonial evidence that contradicts the findings of the RTC and CA on the basis of which no conviction beyond reasonable doubt could arise.&nbsp; It is the <i>unrebutted</i><i> testimony of a credible defense witness. The testimony of Joy Agbuya (Joy) casts doubt as to the possibility of rape having taken place as narrated by complainant.&nbsp; In addition, the testimony of a disinterested defense witness, Juanita Angeles (Juanita) corroborated the alibi of appellant.</i><br><br>Before dwelling on the testimonies of Juanita and Joy, the Court shall first scrutinize the testimonial evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense.<br><br>Aside from the testimony of complainant, the prosecution presented the following witnesses: Dr. James Sison, BBB, and CCC.&nbsp; The pertinent portions of their testimonies may be summarized as follows:<br><br>Dr. James Sison testified that he conducted the medical examination of complainant. His diagnosis was that there was a significant laceration completely healed at the 11:00 o'clock position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, Dr. Sison testified that his findings were not conclusive, but were rather suggestive that complainant was raped.&nbsp; Furthermore, as to the question of paternity of the child of complainant, Dr. Sison suggested doing a DNA match.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>BBB testified the she brought AAA to her grandmother, a <i>hilot</i> residing in XXX, Tarlac, to consult her on the unusual palpitation on the mid-portion of complainant's throat and the absence of her monthly period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> After examining complainant, the <i>hilot</i> told BBB that her daughter was pregnant.&nbsp; AAA later revealed that she was raped by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> BBB further testified that she accompanied AAA to the police headquarters in YYY, Pangasinan to report the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Afterwards, the police brought complainant to YYY District Hospital<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where Dr. James Sison, Medical Officer III of said hospital, conducted the examination on complainant. On cross-examination, BBB testified that the family of appellant offered her money to settle the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>CCC, the father of AAA, was the lone rebuttal witness of the prosecution.&nbsp; In order to rebut the allegation made by appellant's family that the present case was filed because appellant's family did a poor job in preparing for the wedding of CCC's daughter DDD and apellant's brother Carlito, CCC testified that on the contrary, the wedding went smoothly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; CCC further claimed that the family of appellant knelt before him crying and offered money to settle the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, CCC testified that appellant left his house at 4:00 p.m. on January 5, 2000.<br><br>On the other hand, the defense presented four witnesses, namely: Juanito Macaraeg (Macaraeg), Albina Erguiza (Albina), Juanita and Joy.<br><br>Macaraeg, the caretaker of the mango orchard, testified that he did not see appellant on any occasion in the orchard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; More specifically, Macaraeg emphasized that he did not see appellant on January 5, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> However, on cross-examination, he testified that the house of appellant is only a three-minute walk from the mango orchard and probably a minute if one walks fast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Albina, the mother of appellant, testified that on January 5, 2000, she was with appellant at the house of CCC and BBB preparing for the wedding of CCC's daughter DDD and appellant's brother Carlito.&nbsp; She said that they left the house of CCC at around 5:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Albina narrated that when they arrived home, at around 5:02 or 5:03 p.m., she sent appellant to fetch a <i>hilot</i><i>,</i> as the wife of appellant was having some labor pains.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; She said that appellant and the <i>hilot</i><i> </i>arrived at around 5:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; According to Albina appellant never left their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the day of the wedding, Albina testified that she had an altercation with BBB regarding the bills and that they never resolved their quarrel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; She spoke to BBB and CCC because she learned that they were falsely accusing appellant of raping AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; After talking to BBB and CCC, she and her husband confronted appellant and asked if he had raped complainant, which appellant denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Albina claimed that CCC and BBB were demanding P1,000,000.00 and that they later reduced it to P250,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Albina said that she offered P5,000.00 to BBB and CCC only to preserve their relationship as in-laws and for peace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In sum, with the exception of the claim of AAA that she was raped by appellant, other evidence presented by the prosecution did not identify appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<br><br>Moreover, the testimonies of the witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense conflict on certain points, more notably the claim by BBB and CCC that the family of appellant offered to settle the case.&nbsp; This, however, was denied by Albina, who claimed that it was BBB and CCC who demanded P1,000,000.00.<br><br>The offer of compromise allegedly made by Albina is critical to the case at bar in light of law and jurisprudence that an offer of compromise in a criminal case may be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, the offer of compromise was first testified to by BBB on cross-examination, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Is it not a fact that there was an offer by you to the mother of the accused that they pay you 1 million and you have reduced it to P250,000.00?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> No, sir, it was they who were the ones offering for settlement, but we never offer them any settlement, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On rebuttal, CCC corroborated the testimony of BBB that the family of appellant offered to settle the case, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And according to Larry Erguiza as well as his witnesses they told the Honorable Court that you and your wife are demanding from Larry Erguiza and his parents the amount of one million pesos so that you will not file this case against the accused, what can you say about that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">There is no truth about that, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And what is the truth about it?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">It was they who went to my house, they even knelt before me crying and they were offering money, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>However, Albina, the mother of appellant, denied the foregoing allegations, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">What happened when you went to the house of BBB and CCC talking with them about their problem of the alleged rape on AAA, their daughter?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> They were asking for a settlement price for one million pesos but we have no money, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What did you do when they were asking one million pesos from you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">We told them that we do not have that money until they reduced the price to P250,000.00 but we have no money because we are poor, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Were you around when BBB testified to the witness stand?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I was here, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you hear what BBB said that you were the one offering money?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir, I was here and I heard that.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> What can you say to that allegation of BBB?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That is not true, sir.

The Court finds no cogent reason for Joy to lie and say that she had waited for complainant and that they both went home together.&nbsp; She had nothing to gain for lying under oath.&nbsp; Moreover, the records are bereft of any showing or claim that Joy was related to or was a close friend of appellant or his family.&nbsp; On the contrary, Joy considers herself the "best-friend" and playmate of complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>When Prosecutor Reintar questioned her as to her understanding of the oath she took, Joy answered, "That I will swear to God, sir.&nbsp;

and secondly, that Joy and AAA left the orchard, went home together and separated at their Aunt Beth's house, indicating that no untoward incident, much less rape, was committed by appellant at the time and place that complainant had testified on.<br><br>Necessarily, either Joy or AAA lied under oath.&nbsp; It was thus critical for the prosecution to show that Joy gave false statements.<br><br>Unfortunately for AAA, the prosecution miserably failed to rebut Joy's testimony.&nbsp; Neither complainant nor Ricky, BBB or any other witness was called to the witness stand to refute Joy's testimony.&nbsp; True, it is up to the prosecution to determine who to present as witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; However, considering that the testimony of Joy critically damaged the case of the prosecution, it behooved the prosecution to present evidence to rebut the defense evidence.&nbsp; Witnesses such as Ricky, AAA and BBB should have been presented by the prosecution to demolish Joy's testimony.&nbsp; The testimony of Ricky is particularly significant, especially since AAA claimed that he was with her and his sister Joy at the mango orchard on the day of the alleged rape incident.&nbsp; The failure on the part of the prosecution to present Ricky or AAA bolsters the defense evidence, that no rape happened on the date and time claimed by AAA.<br><br>The prosecution presented CCC, the father of complainant, as it's lone rebuttal witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; However, the testimony of CCC covered facts and issues not related to the testimony of Joy.&nbsp; The testimony of CCC merely rebutted the allegation made by appellant's family that the present case was filed because appellant's family did a poor job of preparing for the wedding of CCC's daughter DDD and apellant's brother Carlito.&nbsp; To this, CCC testified that on the contrary, the wedding went smoothly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, CCC claimed that the family of appellant knelt before him crying and offered money to settle the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; In addition, CCC testified that appellant left his house at 4:00 p.m. on January 5, 2000.&nbsp; Thus, the testimony of CCC did not in any way rebut the testimony of Joy.<br><br>Further, Joy testified that during the three times she went with AAA to the mango orchard, the time was 1:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp; However, AAA testified that she went to the mango orchard with Joy at 4:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>&nbsp; The variance in the testimonies of Joy and AAA as to the time they went to the mango orchard on the day of the alleged rape incident may be disregarded as they are <i>de</i> <i>minimis</i> in nature and do not relate to the commission of the crime.&nbsp; There is a common point uniting the testimonies of both Joy and AAA; that is, that both referred to the day when AAA's short got hooked to the fence.<br><br>Moreover, assuming<i> arguendo </i>that the variance between the testimonies of AAA and Joy as to the time they were together at the mango orchard is an <i>indicia</i> that AAA may have been raped by appellant on a different day, not on January 5, 2000, to still impute to appellant the crime of rape is not plausible.<br><br>The Court is not unmindful of the rule that the exact date of the commission of the crime of rape is extraneous to and is not an element of the offense, such that any inconsistency or discrepancy as to the same is irrelevant and is not to be taken as a ground for acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; Such, however, finds no application to the case at bar. AAA and Joy may differ in their testimonies as to the time they were at the mango orchard, but there could be no mistake as to the actual day when AAA was supposed to have been raped; it was the day when AAA's shorts got hooked to the fence at the mango orchard.<br><br>The RTC and CA unwittingly brushed aside the testimonies of Juanita and Joy and gave full credence to the testimony of AAA.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, their probative weight were not considered or evaluated in the text of the lower courts' decision.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, the prosecution could have rebutted the testimony of Joy, but for some reason or oversight, it chose not to do so.<br><br>Consequently, in view of the unrebutted testimony of Joy, appellant's defense of alibi and denial assumes considerable weight.&nbsp; It is at this point that the issue as to the time that the rape was committed plays a significant factor in determining the guilt or innocence of appellant.&nbsp; This Court must therefore address this issue for a thorough evaluation of the case.<br><br>The Court takes note that Macaraeg, the caretaker of the orchard, testified that appellant's house was only a minute away from the orchard if one would run.<br><br>As earlier mentioned, CCC testified that appellant left CCC's&nbsp; house at 4:00 p.m. on January 5, 2000, contrary to the testimony of Albina that she and appellant left at 5:00 p.m.&nbsp; AAA declared that the alleged rape took place after 5:00 p.m.<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">So at 4:00 o'clock you were at the house and you left and proceeded at the back of the school to pick mangoes?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">That was already around 5:00 o'clock?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.
