Thus, the trial court ordered a general default against the public except the government.<br><br>On 1 July 1997, respondents presented their evidence consisting of documentary exhibits and the testimonies of witnesses Esteibar, Pangyarihan, Dominga Fabio Lozano, Mariano Huerto, and Raymundo Pakay.<br><br>Esteibar, the duly appointed representative of the heirs of Juan Fabio, testified that her grandfather, Juan, died in 1959 when she was only 13 years old.  She attested that she was born on the Lot and knows that her grandfather owned, possessed and occupied the Lot until his death. Esteibar claimed that they and their predecessors-in-interest have possessed and occupied the Lot openly, publicly, continuously, peacefully, without interruption in the concept of an owner and adverse to the public since time immemorial up to the present or for more than 100 years.  They had paid real estate taxes; planted trees, vegetables, rice, and banana plants; and raised animals on the Lot. Further, she stated that the Lot is neither mortgaged nor encumbered and that no other person other than her and her co-heirs are in possession of the Lot.<br><br>The next witness, Pangyarihan of the Land Management Sector, DENR-Region IV, testified that he had been connected with DENR-Region IV since 1956.  He was formerly the Chief of the Survey Division of DENR-Region IV from 1991 until his designation as Special Assistant to the Regional Director in 1995.   Pangyarihan affirmed that the Lot is 1,096,866 square meters or 109.6 hectares and that he recommended the approval of the survey plan, SWO-042121-003369-D, which includes the Lot, on the basis of submission of certain requirements like tax declarations, report of investigation by the land investigator and survey returns prepared by the geodetic engineer. He verified that the survey plan and the technical descriptions matched with each other and stated that there is no overlap or encroachment on other surrounding claims on adjacent or adjoining lots. Further, he confirmed that there is a notation at the left hand footnote of the approved survey plan which reads "<b>this survey falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation and disposition hereof shall be subject to the final delimitation thereof as per Proc. No. 1582-A dated </b><b>September 6, 1976</b><b>.</b>"<br><br>Dominga Fabio Lozano, the only living and youngest child of Juan Fabio and who was then 63 years of age, testified that she was born in 1934 in Calumpang, Ternate, Cavite.  She alleged that she was born and has lived on the Lot, owned by her father Juan Fabio, who in turn inherited the land from his father Ignacio Fabio.  She narrated that her father was born in 1887 and died in 1959 at the age of 72 as evidenced by his death certificate.  She stated further that no one has ever questioned their ownership or disturbed their peaceful possession and occupation of the Lot. As a result, their possession of the Lot covers more than 100 years of continuous, uninterrupted, public, open and peaceful possession.<br><br>Mariano Huerto, a helper of the late Juan Fabio, testified that since 1935, when he was only 12 years old, he had helped cultivate the Lot until he left the place in 1955.  He stated that at the time he served as helper, Juan Fabio and his family were the ones who possessed and occupied the Lot.  He helped plant vegetables, banana plants, papaya trees and upland rice and was familiar with the boundaries of the Lot.<br><br>Raymundo Pakay, 70 years of age at the time and a resident of Ternate, Cavite, testified that he knew Juan Fabio as the owner of the Lot, which has an area of 200 hectares, more or less. He stated that Juan built a house there and could not recall of anyone else who claimed ownership of the Lot.<br><br>On 7 August 1997, the Assistant City Prosecutor of Tagaytay City filed his Manifestation and Comment dated 28 July 1997:<br><blockquote>COMES NOW the government, through the undersigned Assistant City Prosecutor of Tagaytay City, assisting the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of the Province of Cavite, by way of comment to petitioner's formal offer of evidence dated July 3, 1997 hereby manifest that the government interposes no objection to Exhibit `A' up to `PP' together with its sub markings, the same being material and relevant to the instant petition.<br><br>The government further manifests that considering the fact that it has no controverting evidence in its possession to refute the material allegations of the herein petitioner, the government is submitting the instant case for the immediate resolution of this Honorable Court on the basis of the evidence adduced by the petitioner and the cross examination propounded by the Trial Prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>On 29 September 1997, the trial court rendered a Decision ordering the registration of the Lot in the name of Juan Fabio.  The dispositive portion states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, finding the application for registration and grant of title under Act 496, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1529 to be meritorious and fully substantiated by evidence sufficient and requisite under the law, this Court, confirming its previous Order of general default  as against the general public, hereby decrees and adjudges and hereby orders the registration of the parcel of land as hereinabove described, identified, and bounded and now the subject matter of the present application for registration of title in the above-entitled case, in favor of, and in the name of JUAN FABIO, of Barangay Sapang, Municipality of Ternate, Province of Cavite.<br><br>FURTHER, upon the finality of this DECISION, the Administrator, Land Registration Authority, is hereby ordered to issue the corresponding decree of registration and the Original Certificate of Title in favor of, and in the name of JUAN FABIO, of Barangay Sapang, Municipality of Ternate, Province of Cavite, over the parcel of land described, identified and bounded as hereinabove-mentioned and subject matter of this Decision which decreed and adjudged the registration of its title in his name.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The Republic of the Philippines (petitioner), through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals.   Petitioner  claimed that the trial court erred in ruling that respondents have acquired a vested right over the Lot which falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation.  Petitioner asserted that the trial court disregarded the testimony of Pangyarihan who recommended the approval of the survey plan with the following notation:<br><blockquote>This survey falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation and disposition hereof shall be subject to the final delimitation thereof as per Proc. No. 1582-A dated September 6, 1976. x x x<br></blockquote>In essence, petitioner argued that the trial court's grant of registration is contrary to the provisions of Section 88 of Commonwealth Act No. 141<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and Proclamation No. 1582-A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u><br></center></b><br>On 29 August 2003, the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  The appellate court ruled that the mode of appeal filed by petitioner was wrong. Since the lone question involved was one of law, petitioner should have filed a petition for review with this Court under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure instead of filing an appeal under Rule 41.  Nevertheless, the appellate court looked into the merits of the case and sustained the findings of the trial court:<br><blockquote>On the merits of the case, it may be true that the General Order 56 of the United States War Department dated  25 March 1904 reserved the subject property as a military reservation, however, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation 307 on 20 November 1967 which provides   x x x.<br><br>In other words, Presidential Proclamation 307 provides for an exception - those properties subject to private rights or those on which private individuals can prove ownership by any mode acceptable under our laws and Torrens system.<br><br>Proclamation 1582-A issued by President Marcos on 6 September 1976 again provided the following x x x.<br><br>Without doubt, this complements and recognizes the rights acquired by private individuals under Proclamation 307, over the portion of the properties reserved under General Order 56 of the United States War Department dated 25 March 1904.<br><br>Considering that the annotation appearing in the survey plan merely provides that the controversial portion shall be subject to final delimitation as per Proclamation 1582-A, the same is consistent with the provisions of Proclamation 307.<br><br>For wrong remedy and for lack of merit, the Court holds and so rules that the trial court erred not in granting petitioners' application for registration of title.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DISMISSED and the challenged 29 September 1997 Decision of the court a quo is hereby AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>. No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></center><br>The issues for our resolution are (1) whether petitioner correctly appealed the ruling of the trial court to the Court of Appeals, and (2) whether the respondents have acquired a right over the Lot.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The petition has merit.<br><br><center><u><b>First Issue: Mode of Appeal</b></u><br></center><br>Petitioner contends that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the appeal is determined on the basis of the averments in the notice of appeal.  Since the appeal involves questions of fact and law, petitioner correctly appealed the ruling of the trial court to the Court of Appeals and not directly to this Court.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, maintain that  the remedy resorted to by petitioner before the Court of Appeals was not correct.  Respondents contend that the issues actually raised in the appellant's brief determine the appropriate mode of appeal, not the averments in the notice of appeal.  Since the appellate court found that petitioner only raised questions of law, the appeal is dismissible under the Rules.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended,<b> </b>which governs appeals from judgments and final orders of the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals, provides:<br><br>Section 2. <i>Modes of appeal.</i> --<br><blockquote>(a) <i>Ordinary appeal.</i> -- The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.<br><br>(b) <i>Petition for review.</i> -- The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall be by petition for review in accordance with Rule 42.<br><br><b>(c) <i>Appeal by certiorari.</i> -- In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari in accordance with Rule 45. </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.  For questions to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In its appellant's brief filed with the Court of Appeals, petitioner interposed a lone assignment of error:<br><blockquote>The trial court erred in ruling that appellees have acquired a vested right over the subject property despite the fact that it falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the issue stated by petitioner provides no confusion with regard to the truth or falsity of the given facts pertaining to the Lot and its location as established during the trial.  It had been duly established that the Lot falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation as shown in the survey conducted and attested to by the DENR. Here, the only issue involved is the interpretation of a relevant order and proclamations denominating the Lot as part of a military reservation subject to the limitation that private rights should be respected.  Undoubtedly, this is a pure question of law.<br><br>Thus, petitioner's appeal under Rule 41 having been improperly brought before the Court of Appeals, it should have been dismissed by the appellate court pursuant to Section 2, Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals</i>. An appeal <b>under Rule 41</b> taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by the said court. x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Nonetheless, the appellate court in resolving that petitioner's appeal constituted a wrong remedy, looked into the merits of the case and found that the laws involved recognize the rights of respondents.  As such, equity considerations require that we take a similar course of action in order to put a rest to this case.<br><br><center><u><b>Second Issue: Validity of Respondents' Title</b></u><br></center><br>Petitioner asserts that both the trial and appellate courts failed to recognize the import of the notation in the survey plan stating that the Lot falls within the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation.  At the time the application for registration of title was filed, the Lot was no longer open to private ownership as it had been classified as a military reservation for public service.   Thus, respondents are not entitled to have the Lot registered under the Torrens system.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, maintain that they have acquired a vested right over the Lot.  The Presidential Proclamations, which declared the Lot part of a naval reservation, provided for an exception that private rights shall be respected, taking the portion covered by private rights out of the reservation. Thus, respondents claim they are entitled to have the Lot registered under their names.<br><br>The three proclamations cited reserving the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation for the exclusive use of the military are the following: (1) U.S. War Department Order No. 56 issued on 25 March 1904, (2) Proclamation No. 307<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> issued on 20 November 1967, and (3) Proclamation No. 1582-A issued on 6 September 1976.  Such proclamations state:<br><blockquote><u><center><b>U.S. War Department General Order No. 56</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></center></u><br>U.S. War Department General Order No. 56<br>Washington, March 25, 1904.<br><br>For the knowledge and governance of all interested parties, the following is hereby announced:<br><br>The President of the United States, by the Order dated March 14, 1904, which provides that the reservations made by Executive Order of April 11, 1902 (General Order No. 38, Army Headquarters, Office of the Adjutant General, April 17, 1902), at the entrance of Manila Bay, Luzon, Philippine Islands, are arranged in such a way that will include only these lands as later described, whose lands were reserved by the Order of March 14, 1904 for military purposes, by virtue of Article 12 of the Act of Congress approved on July 1, 1902, entitled "Act providing for the Temporary Administration of Civil Affairs of the Government of the Philippine Islands and for Other Purposes" (32 Stat.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The proclamations established that as early as 1904 a certain parcel of land was placed under the exclusive use of the government for military purposes by the then colonial American government.  In 1904, the U.S. War Department segregated the area, including the Lot, for military purposes through General Order No. 56.  Subsequently, after the Philippines regained its independence in 1946, the American government transferred all control and sovereignty to the Philippine government, including all the lands appropriated for a public purpose. Twenty years later, two other presidential proclamations followed, both issued by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, restating that the same property is a naval reservation for the use of the Republic.<br><br>There is no question that the Lot is situated within a military reservation.  The only issue to be resolved is whether the respondents are entitled to have the Lot registered under the Torrens systems based on the limitation clause cited in the proclamations: (1) <i>"subject to private rights, if any there be"</i> in Proclamation No. 307,  and (2) <i>"the portion that remains after the segregation which are occupied shall be released to bona fide occupants pursuant to existing laws/policies regarding the disposition of lands of the public domain and the unoccupied portions shall be considered as alienable or disposable lands"</i> in Proclamation No. 1582-A.  This proviso means that persons claiming rights over the reserved land are not precluded from proving their claims.  In effect, the State gives respect and recognizes the rights of private persons who may have acquired any vested interest to the Lot before the issuance of the General Order or proclamations.<br><br>Commonwealth Act No. 141 (CA 141), also known as the Public Land Act, remains to this day the existing general law governing the classification and disposition of lands of the public domain, other than timber and mineral lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Under the Regalian doctrine embodied in our Constitution, land that has not been acquired from the government, either by purchase, grant or any other mode recognized by law, belongs to the State as part of the public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  No public land can be acquired by private persons through any other means, and it is indispensable that the person claiming title to public land should show that his title was acquired through purchase or grant from the State, or through any other mode of acquisition recognized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1073 (PD 1073),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 48.  The following described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such land or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land Registration Act, to wit:<br><br>x x x<br><br>(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition of ownership, since June 12, 1945, or earlier, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure</i>.  These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Similarly, Section 14 of PD 1529 or the Property Registration Decree, governing original registration through registration proceedings, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 14. <i>Who may apply</i>. - The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><blockquote>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a <i>bona fide </i>claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote></blockquote>To put it simply, Section 14(1) of PD 1529 states that there are three requisites for the filing of an application for registration of title: (1) that the property in question is alienable and disposable land of the public domain; (2) that the applicants by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation; and (3) that such possession is under a <i>bona fide </i>claim of ownership since 12 June 1945 or earlier.<br><br>To prove that the Lot is alienable and disposable land of the public domain, respondents presented in evidence a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated 22 April 1991 of Conlu, a Land Management Inspector of the DENR-Region IV. The relevant portion of the letter states:<br><blockquote>In examination [of] the above-noted subject, please be [informed] that I have examined the land x x x and the following findings [were] ascertained;<br><br>That the land covers a portion of 3 (three) barangays, namely: Calumpang, Cabangat and Zapang, all within the municipality of Ternate, Cavite;<br><br>That the land is <b>within alienable and disposable zone</b> under Project No. 22-B, L.C. Map No. 3091;<br><br>That the land was declared for taxation purposes since 1945, the latest of which is Tax Declaration No. 1543 with a market value of P1,250,000.00 in favor of Juan Fabio x x x   (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This letter-certification is insufficient. Conlu is merely a land investigator of the DENR.  It is not enough that he alone should certify that the Lot is within the alienable and disposable zone.  Under Section 6 of the Public Land Act, the prerogative of classifying or reclassifying lands of the public domain belongs to the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The President, through a presidential proclamation or executive order, can classify or reclassify a land to be included or excluded from the public domain.  The DENR Secretary is the only other public official empowered by law to approve a land classification and declare such land as alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>From the records, this letter was the only evidence presented by  respondents to prove that the Lot is alienable and disposable.  In fact, not even the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) certified as correct the investigation report of the Land Management Inspector.   The most that the CENRO officer did was to indorse the report to the Regional Technical Director of the DENR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>    In <i>Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> we ruled that it is not enough for the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) or CENRO to certify that a land is alienable and disposable.  The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO.  In addition, the applicant must present a copy of the original classification of the land into alienable and disposable, as declared by the DENR Secretary, or as proclaimed by the President.  Such copy of the DENR Secretary's declaration or the President's proclamation must be certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of such official record.  These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable.<br><br>Respondents have failed to present any of these documents. No document was presented to show that the DENR Secretary or the President has classified the Lot as alienable and disposable.  No CENRO or PENRO certification was presented that the Lot, per verification through survey, falls within the alienable and disposable zone. The 22 April 1991 letter of Land Management Inspector Conlu is not proof that the DENR Secretary or the President has classified the Lot as alienable and disposable, or that the Lot falls within the alienable and disposable zone. The mere issuance of the letter does not prove the facts stated in such letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Further, the burden is on respondents to prove that the Lot ceased to have the status of a military reservation or other inalienable land of the public domain.  No proof was ever submitted by respondents that the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation, or the Lot, ceased as a military reservation.  Even if its ownership and control had been transferred by the Americans to the Philippine government, the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation remained as an official military reservation.   Thus, being a military reservation at the time, the Calumpang Point Naval Reservation, to which the Lot is a part of, can not be subject to occupation, entry or settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  This is clear from Sections 83 and 88 of CA 141, which provide:<br><blockquote>SECTION 83. Upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, the President may designate by proclamation any tract or tracts of land of the public domain as reservations for the use of the Commonwealth of the Philippines or of any of its branches, or of the inhabitants thereof, in accordance with regulations prescribed for this purpose, or for quasi-public uses or purposes when the public interest requires it, including reservations for highways, rights of way for railroads, hydraulic power sites, irrigation systems, communal pastures or <i>leguas comunales</i>, public parks, public quarries, public fishponds, working-men's village and other improvements for the public benefit.<br><br>SECTION 88. The tract or tracts of land reserved under the provisions of section eighty-three shall be non-alienable and <b>shall not be subject to occupation, entry, sale, lease, or other disposition until again declared alienable under the provision of this Act or by proclamation of the President.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Well-entrenched is the rule that unless a land is reclassified and declared alienable and disposable, occupation in the concept of an owner, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership and be registered as a title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Consequently, respondents could not have occupied the Lot in the concept of an owner in 1947 and subsequent years when respondents declared the Lot for taxation purposes, or even earlier when respondents' predecessors-in-interest possessed the Lot, because the Lot was considered inalienable from the time  of its declaration as a military reservation in 1904.  Therefore, respondents failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Lot is alienable and disposable.<br><br>Public lands not shown to have been classified as alienable and disposable land remain part of the inalienable public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  In view of the lack of sufficient evidence showing that the Lot was already classified as alienable and disposable, the Lot applied for by respondents is inalienable land of the public domain, not subject to registration under Section 14(1) of PD 1529 and Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended by PD 1073.  Hence, there is no need to discuss the other requisites dealing with respondents' occupation and possession of the Lot in the concept of an owner.<br><br>While it is an acknowledged policy of the State to promote the distribution of alienable public lands to spur economic growth and in line with the ideal of social justice, the law imposes stringent safeguards upon the grant of such resources lest they fall into the wrong hands to the prejudice of the national patrimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We must not, therefore, relax the stringent safeguards relative to the registration of imperfect titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In <i>Republic v.

Here, respondents failed to do so, and are thus not entitled to have the Lot registered in their names.  Clearly, both the trial and appellate courts gravely erred in granting respondents' application for registration of title.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition.

If the lot of respondents can be shown to be excluded from the naval reservation under Procalamtion No. 1582-A, then it stengthens their claim of ownership and proves that the subject lot is alienable and disposable.  Particular attention is invited to the last paragraph of Proclamation No. 1582-A, thus:<br><blockquote>The portion that remains after the segregation which are occupied shall be released to <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> occupants  pursuant to existing laws/policies regarding the disposition of lands of the public domain and the <u>unoccupied portionss shall be considered as alienable or disposable lands</u>.  (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>On another point relating to the issue of whether the subject lot is within the alienable and disposable zone, I agree with the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> that the April 22, 1991 letter of Arnaldo Conlu, Land Management Inspector, DENR-Region IV, standing along will not suffice.  While there is an annotation in the Land Classification (L.C.) Map No. 3091 that the lot of petitioners (now respondents) is "within alienable and disposable zone under Project No. 22-B," they have to introduce as evidence a Forestry Adminitrative Order signed by the Secretary of Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) approving the L.C. Map No. 3091 which was previously prepared and approved by the Director of the Bureau of Forest Development.  The eveidence extant on record does not reveal any such Forestry Administrative Order isssued by the DENR Secretary.  The unavailability of such a vital piece of evidence is fatal to the land registration appplication of respondent.</div>
