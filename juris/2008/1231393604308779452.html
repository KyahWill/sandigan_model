				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> <b></b>These consolidated petitions provide a welcome avenue for the Court to dichotomize, once and for all, two popular remedies to prevent a candidate from running for an elective position which are indiscriminately interchanged by the Bench and the Bar, adding confusion to the already difficult state of our jurisprudence on election laws.<br><br>For the Court's resolution are two petitions for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court: (1) G.R. No. 179695, which assails the June 29, 2007 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) 2<sup>nd</sup> Division in SPA No. 07-372, and the September 20, 2007 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> affirming the said division resolution; and (2) G.R. No. 182369, which challenges the February 14, 2008 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  of the COMELEC 1<sup>st</sup> Division in SPR No. 45-2007, the March 13, 2008 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4] </sup>  of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration, and the March 26, 2008 Entry of Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  issued by the Electoral Contests and Adjudication Department (ECAD) of the Commission in the said case.<br><br>The relevant facts and proceedings follow.<br><br>After the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  the Regional Assembly of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), on November 22, 2006, passed Autonomy Act No. 205<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [7]</sup>  creating the Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan in Shariff Kabunsuan. This new municipality was constituted by separating <i> Barangays</i> Balong, Damatog, Gayonga, Guiawa, Indatuan, Kapinpilan, P. Labio, Libungan, Montay, Sabaken and Tumaguinting from the Municipality of Kabuntalan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Mike A. Fermin, the petitioner in both cases, was a registered voter of <i>Barangay</i> Payan, Kabuntalan. On December 13, 2006, claiming that he had been a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan for 1 year and 6 months, petitioner applied with the COMELEC for the transfer of his registration record to the said <i>barangay</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  In the meantime, the creation of North Kabuntalan was ratified in a plebiscite on December 30, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  formally making <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan a component of Northern Kabuntalan.<br><br>Thereafter, on January 8, 2007, the COMELEC approved petitioner's application for the transfer of his voting record and registration as a voter to Precinct 21A of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan, Northern Kabuntalan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  On March 29, 2007, Fermin filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for mayor of Northern Kabuntalan in the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On April 20, 2007, private respondent Umbra Ramil Bayam Dilangalen, another mayoralty candidate, filed a <i>Petition</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i> for Disqualification </i> [the Dilangalen petition] against Fermin, docketed as SPA (PES) No. A07-003 [re-docketed as SPA No. 07-372 before the COMELEC] with the Office of the Provincial Election Supervisor of Shariff Kabunsuan. The petition alleged that the petitioner did not possess the period of residency required for candidacy and that he perjured himself in his CoC and in his application for transfer of voting record. The pertinent portions of the petition follow:<br><blockquote><ol> <li>THE PETITIONER is of legal age, a registered voter, resident and incumbent Municipal Mayor of the Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan, holding office at Barangay Paulino Labio in the Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan where he may be served summons and other legal processes.<br><br></li><li>THE PETITIONER is a candidate for election as Mayor in the same Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan, being a resident of and domiciled in the Municipality since birth.  The Respondent is also a candidate for the same office, Mayor in the same Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan.  He is, however, not a resident of the Municipality.<br><br></li><li>THE RESPONDENT perjured himself when he swore to the truth of his statement in his Certificate of Candidacy of being a resident of the Municipality for the last 38 years, when in truth and in fact he simply transferred his registration from the Municipality of Kabuntalan on 13 December 2006, wherein he stated that he has relocated to that municipality a year and six months earlier, or no earlier than June 2005.<br><br></li><li>THE RESPONDENT perjured himself when he swore to the truth of his statement in his Certificate of Candidacy of being a resident of the Municipality for the last 38 years, when in truth and in fact he has stayed for at least 33 years in Barangay Payan, Municipality [of] Kabunt[a]lan.<br><br></li><li>THE RESPONDENT perjured himself when he swore to the truth of his statement in his Application for Transfer that he is a resident of Barangay Indatuan on 13 December 2006, wherein he stated that he has relocated to that municipality a year and six months earlier, or on or about June 2005, when in truth and in fact he has never resided much less domiciled himself in Indatuan or anywhere else in the Municipality of Northern Kabuntalan earlier than 14 May 2006.<br><br></li><li>THE RESPONDENT perjured himself when he swore to the truth of his statement in his Certificate of Candidacy of being a resident of the Municipality for the last 38 years, when in truth and in fact he has never resided in the Municipality, but was simply visiting the area whenever election is [f]ast approaching.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is most respectfully prayed that, [in consideration] of the Respondent not possessing the residence required for candidacy, and having perjured himself in a number of times, the Commission disqualify the Respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  </li></ol></blockquote>Elections were held without any decision being rendered by the COMELEC in the said case. After the counting and canvassing of votes, Dilangalen emerged as the victor with 1,849 votes over Fermin's 1,640.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The latter subsequently filed an election protest (Election Case No. 2007-022) with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 13 of Cotabato City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center> <b><u>G.R. No. 179695</u></b> </center><br>On June 29, 2007, the COMELEC 2<sup>nd</sup> Division, in SPA No. 07-372, disqualified Fermin for not being a resident of Northern Kabuntalan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It ruled that, based on his declaration that he is a resident of <i>Barangay </i> Payan as of April 27, 2006 in his oath of office before Datu Andal Ampatuan, Fermin could not have been a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan for at least one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The COMELEC <i>En Ban</i>c, on September 20, 2007, affirmed the Division's ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thus, petitioner instituted <b>G.R. No. 179695</b> before this Court raising the following issues:<br><blockquote><center> A. </center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITION TO DISQUALIFY PETITIONER FROM SEEKING THE MAYORALTY POST OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF NORTHERN KABUNTALAN SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR HAVING BEEN FILED OUT OF TIME.<br><br><center> B. </center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE ONE (1) YEAR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT AS PROVIDED BY ART. 56, PAR. NO. 3, RULE XIII, RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF THE AUTONOMOUS REGION IN MUSLIM MINDANAO IS APPLICABLE TO PETITIONER, WHO TRANSFERRED HIS VOTER'S REGISTRATION RECORD DUE TO CHANGE OF RESIDENCE FROM BARANGAY PAYAN TO BARANGAY INDATUAN IN THE SAME MUNICIPALITY OF KABUNTALAN.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner contends that the Dilangalen petition is a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup>  Following Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6646, the same must be filed within 5 days from the last day for the filing of CoC, which, in this case, is March 30, 2007, and considering that the said petition was filed by Dilangalen only on April 20, 2007, the same was filed out of time. The COMELEC should have then dismissed SPA No. 07-372 outright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argues that he has been a resident of <i> Barangay</i> Indatuan long before the creation of Northern Kabuntalan. This change of residence prompted him to apply for the transfer of his voter's registration record from <i>Barangay</i> Payan to <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan. Moreover, the one year residency requirement under the law is not applicable to candidates for elective office in a newly created municipality, because the length of residency of all its inhabitants is reckoned from the effective date of its creation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In his comment, private respondent counters that the petition it filed is one for disqualification under Section 68 of the OEC which may be filed at any time after the last day for filing of the CoC but not later than the candidate's proclamation should he win in the elections. As he filed the petition on April 20, 2007, long before the proclamation of the eventual winning candidate, the same was filed on time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Private respondent likewise posits that petitioner failed to comply with the one-year residency requirement for him to be able to run for an elective office in Northern Kabuntalan. Petitioner applied for the transfer of his voting record on December 13, 2006, and this was approved only on January 8, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>G.R.

No. 179695 with the Court, Dilangalen filed, on September 27, 2007, with the RTC of Cotabato a motion to dismiss Election Case No. 07-022 on the ground that Fermin had no legal standing to file the said protest, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> having already affirmed his disqualification as a candidate; and this Court, in the abovementioned case, did not issue an order restraining the implementation of the assailed COMELEC resolutions.<br><br>The RTC, however, denied this motion on September 28, 2007. On motion for reconsideration, the trial court remained steadfast in its stand that the election protest was separate and distinct from the COMELEC proceedings, and that, unless restrained by the proper authority, it would continue hearing the protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Assailing the RTC's denial of his motions, Dilangalen filed a <i>Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  docketed as SPR No. 45-2007 with the COMELEC. On February 14, 2008, the COMELEC 1<sup>st</sup> Division set aside the aforesaid orders of the trial court for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion, prohibited the said court from acting on and proceeding with the protest, and ordered it to dismiss the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  The COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, on March 13, 2008, denied petitioner's motion for the reconsideration of the division's ruling on account of Fermin's failure to pay the required fees.

In this petition, Fermin raises the following issues for our resolution:<br><blockquote> <center>A.</center><br>Whether or not public respondent has departed from the accepted and usual course of its rules of procedure, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision by the Honorable Court.<br><br><center>B. </center><br>Whether or not public respondent in taking cognizance of the <i> certiorari</i> and prohibition not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in (sic) excess [of jurisdiction].<br><br><center> C. </center><br>Whether or not public respondent, in ordering Judge Ibrahim to dismiss the election protest case, acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in (sic) excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><center>D.</center><br>Whether or not public respondent, in not uniformly observing its process in the service of its resolution and/or order, had denied to petitioner the equal protection of the law.<br><br><center> E.</center><br>Whether or not the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition is dismissible in view of the pendency of another action and whereby the result of the first action is determinative of the second action in any event and regardless of which party is successful.<br><br><center> F. </center><br>Whether or not there is forum shopping.<br><br><center>G.</center><br>Whether or not the public respondent, acting not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, has authority to issue TRO and/or Preliminary Injunction as ancillary remedy of the original action for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.<br><br><center>H. </center><br>Whether or not public respondent has jurisdiction to divest the Court of Judge Ibrahim of its jurisdiction on the election protest case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>The Court, on April 29, 2008, initially dismissed the said petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Fermin subsequently filed in succession his motions for reconsideration and for the consolidation of G.R. Nos. 179695 &amp; 182369. Considering that the two petitions were interrelated, the Court resolved to consolidate them. <p></p><b><u><center><u>The Issues</u></center></u></b><br>The primordial issues in these consolidated cases may be encapsulated, as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Whether or not the Dilangalen petition is one under  Section 68 or Section 78 of the OEC; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Whether or not it was filed on time; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Whether or not the COMELEC gravely abuse its discretion when it declared petitioner as not a resident of the locality for at least one year prior to the May 14, 2007 elections; and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Whether or not the COMELEC gravely abuse its discretion when it ordered the dismissal of Election Case No. 07-022 on the ground that Fermin had no legal standing to file the protest. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><center> <b><u>Our Ruling</u></b> </center><br><center> I. </center><br>Pivotal in the ascertainment of the timeliness of the Dilangalen petition is its proper characterization.<br><br>As aforesaid, petitioner, on the one hand, argues that the Dilangalen petition was filed pursuant to Section 78 of the OEC; while private respondent counters that the same is based on Section 68 of the Code.<br><br>After studying the said petition in detail, the Court finds that the same is in the nature of a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC under Section 78<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33] </sup>  of the OEC. The petition contains the essential allegations of a "Section 78" petition, namely: (1) the candidate made a representation in his certificate; (2) the representation pertains to a material matter which would affect the substantive rights of the candidate (the right to run for the election for which he filed his certificate); and (3) the candidate made the false representation with the intention to deceive the electorate as to his qualification for public office or deliberately attempted to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise render him ineligible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>   It likewise appropriately raises a question on a candidate's eligibility for public office, in this case, hi possession of the one-year residency requirement under the law.<br><br>Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is <i>not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is false, which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for</i>. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is <b>eligible</b> for the office he/she seeks. <b>Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <b> and statutory</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <b> provisions on <u>qualifications or eligibility</u> for public office</b>. <b>If the candidate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding under Section 253<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  with the distinction mainly in the fact that a "Section 78" petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> is filed after proclamation of the wining candidate.<br><br>At this point, we must stress that a "Section 78" petition ought not to be interchanged or confused with a "Section 68" petition. <b> They are different remedies, based on different grounds, and resulting in different eventualities</b>. Private respondent's insistence, therefore, that the petition it filed before the COMELEC in SPA No. 07-372 is in the nature of a disqualification case under Section 68, as it is in fact captioned a "Petition for Disqualification," does not persuade the Court.<br><br>The ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern Kabuntalan, <i>i.e.</i>, he had not established residence in the said locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office <i>is not a ground for the "disqualification" of a candidate </i>under Section 68. The provision only refers to <i>the commission of prohibited acts and the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country</i> as grounds for disqualification, thus:<br><blockquote> SEC. 68. <i>Disqualifications.—</i>Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having (a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b)  committed  acts of  terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (c) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, subparagraph 6, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as a permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws.<br></blockquote>Likewise, the other provisions of law referring to "disqualification" do not include the lack of the one-year residency qualification as a ground therefor, thus:<br><blockquote> <u>Sections 12 of the OEC </u><br><br>SEC. 12. <i>Disqualifications.</i><i>—</i>Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.<br><br>The disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service or sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified.<br><br><u>Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC)</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>SECTION 40. <i>Disqualifications</i><i>—</i>The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Those sentence by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td>  <div align="justify">Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td>  <div align="justify">Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td>  <div align="justify">Those with dual citizenship; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(e) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Fugitive from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(f) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(g) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The insane or feeble-minded. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Considering that the Dilangalen petition does not state any of these grounds for disqualification, it cannot be categorized as a "Section 68" petition.<br><br>To emphasize, a petition for disqualification, on the one hand, can be premised on Section 12 or 68 of the OEC, or Section 40 of the LGC. On the other hand, a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC can only be grounded on a statement of a material representation in the said certificate that is false. The petitions also have different effects. While a person who is disqualified under Section 68 is merely prohibited to continue as a candidate, the person whose certificate is cancelled or denied due course under Section 78 is not treated as a candidate at all, as if he/she never filed a CoC. Thus, in <i>Miranda v. Abaya</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  this Court made the distinction that a candidate who is disqualified under Section 68 can validly be substituted under Section 77 of the OEC because he/she remains a candidate until disqualified; but a person whose CoC has been denied due course or cancelled under Section 78 cannot be substituted because he/she is never considered a candidate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In support of his claim that he actually filed a "petition for disqualification" and not a "petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC," Dilangalen takes refuge in Rule 25 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  specifically Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> thereof, to the extent that it states, "[a]ny candidate who does not possess all the qualifications of a candidate as provided for by the Constitution or by existing law x x x may be disqualified from continuing as a candidate," and COMELEC Resolution No. 7800<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  (Rules Delegating to COMELEC Field Officials the Authority to Hear and Receive Evidence in Disqualification Cases Filed in Connection with the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections), which states in Section 5(C)(1) and (3)(a)(4) that:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5.

[Emphasis supplied.] </li></ol></blockquote>We disagree.  A COMELEC rule or resolution cannot supplant or vary the legislative enactments that distinguish the grounds for disqualification from those of ineligibility, and the appropriate proceedings to raise the said grounds. In other words, Rule 25 and COMELEC Resolution No. 7800 cannot supersede the dissimilar requirements of the law for the filing of a petition for disqualification under Section 68, and a petition for the denial of due course to or cancellation of CoC under Section 78 of the OEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  As aptly observed by the eminent constitutionalist, Supreme Court Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, in his separate opinion in <i>Romualdez-Marcos v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [47]</sup><br><blockquote>Apparently realizing the lack of an authorized proceeding for declaring the ineligibility of candidates, the COMELEC amended its rules on February 15, 1993 so as to provide in Rule 25, §1 the following:<br><blockquote>Grounds for disqualification. <i>—</i> Any candidate who does not possess all the qualifications of a candidate as provided for by the Constitution or by existing law or who commits any act declared by law to be grounds for disqualification may be disqualified from continuing as a candidate.<br></blockquote><b>The lack of provision for declaring the ineligibility of candidates, however, cannot be supplied by a mere rule. Such an act is equivalent to the creation of a cause of action which is a substantive matter which the COMELEC, in the exercise of its rule-making power under Art. IX, A, §6 of the Constitution, cannot do.</b> It is noteworthy that the Constitution withholds from the COMELEC even the power to decide cases involving the right to vote, which essentially involves an inquiry into qualifications based on age, residence and citizenship of voters. [Art. IX, C, §2(3)]<br><br><b>The assimilation in Rule 25 of the COMELEC rules of grounds for ineligibility into grounds for disqualification is contrary to the evident intention of the law. For not only in their grounds but also in their consequences are proceedings for "disqualification" different from those for a declaration of "ineligibility." "Disqualification" proceedings, as already stated, are based on grounds specified in §12 and §68 of the Omnibus Election Code and in §40 of the Local Government Code and are for the purpose of barring an individual from becoming a candidate or from continuing as a candidate for public office. In a word, their purpose is to eliminate a candidate from the race either from the start or during its progress. "Ineligibility," on the other hand, refers to the lack of the qualifications prescribed in the Constitution or the statutes for holding public office and the purpose of the proceedings for declaration of ineligibility is to remove the incumbent from office.  </b><p></p><b>Consequently, that an individual possesses the qualifications for a public office does not imply that he is not disqualified from becoming a candidate or continuing as a candidate for a public office and vice-versa.</b> We have this sort of dichotomy in our Naturalization Law. (C.A. No. 473) That an alien has the qualifications prescribed in §2 of the law does not imply that he does not suffer from any of [the] disqualifications provided in §4.<br><br>Indeed, provisions for disqualifications on the ground that the candidate is guilty of prohibited election practices or offenses, like other pre- proclamation remedies, are aimed at the detestable practice of " grabbing the proclamation and prolonging the election protest," through the use of "manufactured" election returns or resort to other trickery for the purpose of altering the results of the election. This rationale does not apply to cases for determining a candidate's qualifications for office before the election. To the contrary, it is the candidate against whom a proceeding for disqualification is brought who could be prejudiced because he could be prevented from assuming office even though in the end he prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the procedure laid down in the said Rule 25 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure cannot be used in "Section 78" proceedings, precisely because a different rule, Rule 23,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  specifically governs petitions to deny due course to or cancel CoCs.<br><br><center>II. </center><br>Having thus determined that the Dilangalen petition is one under Section 78 of the OEC, the Court now declares that the same has to comply with the 25-day statutory period for its filing. <i>Aznar v.

Construed in relation to reglementary periods and the principles of prescription, the dismissal of "Section 78" petitions filed beyond the 25-day period must come as a matter of course.<br><br>We find it necessary to point out that Sections 5 and 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6646,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> contrary to the erroneous arguments of both parties, did not in any way amend the period for filing "Section 78" petitions. While Section 7 of the said law makes reference to Section 5 on the procedure in the conduct of cases for the denial of due course to the CoCs of nuisance candidates<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  (retired Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., in his dissenting opinion in <i>Aquino v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  explains that "the `procedure hereinabove provided' mentioned in Section 7 cannot be construed to refer to Section 6 which does not provide for a procedure but for the effects of disqualification cases, [but] can only refer to the procedure provided in Section 5 of the said Act on nuisance candidates x x x."), the same cannot be taken to mean that the 25-day period for filing "Section 78" petitions under the OEC is changed to 5 days counted from the last day for the filing of CoCs. The clear language of Section 78 certainly cannot be amended or modified by the mere reference in a subsequent statute to the use of a procedure specifically intended for another type of action. Cardinal is the rule in statutory construction that repeals by implication are  disfavored and will not be so declared by the Court unless the intent of the legislators is manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  In addition, it is noteworthy that <i>Loong,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <i> </i>which<i> </i>upheld the 25-day period for filing "Section 78" petitions, was decided long after the enactment of R.A. 6646. In this regard, we therefore find as contrary to the unequivocal mandate of the law, Rule 23, Section 2 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure which states:<br><blockquote> Sec. 2. <i>Period to File Petition.</i>--The petition must be filed within five (5) days following the last day for the filing of certificates of candidacy.<br></blockquote>As the law stands, the petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC " <b>may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy</b>."<br><br>Accordingly, it is necessary to determine when Fermin filed his CoC in order to ascertain whether the Dilangalen petition filed on April 20, 2007 was well within the restrictive 25-day period. If it was not, then the COMELEC should have, as discussed above, dismissed the petition outright.<br><br>The record in these cases reveals that Fermin filed his CoC for mayor of Northern Kabuntalan for the May 14, 2007 National and Local Elections on <b>March 29, 2007</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  It is clear therefore that the petition to deny due course to or cancel Fermin's CoC was filed by Dilangalen well within the 25-day reglementary period. The COMELEC therefore did not abuse its discretion, much more gravely, when it did not dismiss the petition outright.<br><br><center>III. </center><br>However, the Court finds the COMELEC to have gravely abused its discretion when it precipitately declared that Fermin was not a resident of Northern Kabuntalan for at least one year prior to the said elections.<br><br>In its assailed June 29, 2007 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  the COMELEC ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>In the petitioner's memorandum, an authenticated copy of the respondent's oath of office subscribed and sworn to before Datu Andal Ampatuan, Governor Maguindanao Province, it was stated that respondent's residence is at Barangay Payan, Maguindanao (<i>sic</i>) as of April 27, 2006. Clearly the respondent is not a resident of Northern Kabuntalan earlier than 15 May 2006 as his very own oath of office would reveal that he is really a resident of Barangay Payan, Kabuntalan less than 365 days immediately preceding the May 14, 2007 elections. He is a resident of a barangay not a component of the local government unit in which he seeks to be elected as of May 15, 2006 and is therefore not qualified or eligible to seek election as mayor in the said municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  </blockquote>Obviously, the COMELEC relied on a single piece of evidence to support its finding that petitioner was not a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan, Northern Kabuntalan, i.e., the oath of office subscribed and sworn to before Governor Datu Andal Ampatuan, in which petitioner indicated that he was a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Payan, Kabuntalan <b>as of April 27, 2006</b>. However, this single piece of evidence does not necessarily support a finding that petitioner was not a resident of Northern Kabuntalan as of May 14, 2006, or one year prior to the May 14, 2007 elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  Petitioner merely admitted that he was a resident of another locality as of April 27, 2006, which was more than a year before the elections. It is not inconsistent with his subsequent claim that he complied with the residency requirement for the elective office, as petitioner could have transferred to <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan after April 27, 2006, on or before May 14, 2006.<br><br>Neither does this evidence support the allegation that petitioner failed to comply with the residency requirement for the transfer of his voting record from <i>Barangay</i> Payan to <i>Barangay</i> Indatuan. Given that a voter is required to reside in the place wherein he proposes to vote only for six months immediately preceding the election,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  petitioner's application for transfer on December 13, 2006 does not contradict his earlier admission that he was a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Payan as of April 27, 2006. Be that as it may, the issue involved in the Dilangalen petition is whether or not petitioner made a material representation that is false in his CoC, and not in his application for the transfer of his registration and voting record.<br><br>The foregoing considered, the Court finds that the Dilangalen petition does not make out a <i>prima facie</i> case. Its dismissal is therefore warranted. We emphasize that the mere filing of a petition and the convenient allegation therein that a candidate does not reside in the locality where he seeks to be elected is insufficient to effect the cancellation of his CoC. Convincing evidence must substantiate every allegation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  A litigating party is said to have a <i>prima facie</i> case when the evidence in his favor is sufficiently strong for his opponent to be called on to answer it. A <i>prima facie</i> case, then, is one which is established by sufficient evidence and can be overthrown only by rebutting evidence adduced on the other side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><center> IV. </center><br>In light of the foregoing disquisition, the COMELEC's order for the dismissal of Fermin's election protest is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, considering that the same is premised on Fermin's alleged lack of legal standing to file the protest, which, in turn, is based on Fermin's alleged lack of residency qualification. With our disposition herein that the Dilangalen petition should be dismissed, a disquisition that Fermin has no standing as a candidate would be reckless and improper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>premises considered, the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> are <b>GRANTED</b>.
