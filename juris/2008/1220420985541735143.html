The debt due is to be considered without the stipulation of the excessive interest.<br><br>While the terms of the Real Estate Mortgage remain effective, <u>the foreclosure proceedings</u> held on 31 October 1990 <u>cannot be given effect</u>.

Likewise, in the demand letter dated 12 December 1989, Zoilo Espiritu demanded from the Spouses Landrito the amount of P874,125.00 for the unpaid loan.&nbsp; Since the debt due is limited to the principal of P350,000.00 with 12% <i>per annum </i>as legal interest, the previous demand for payment of the amount of P874,125.00 cannot be considered as a valid demand for payment.&nbsp; For an obligation to become due, there must be a valid demand.&nbsp; <u>Nor can the foreclosure proceedings be considered valid</u> since the total amount of the indebtedness during the foreclosure proceedings was pegged at <u>P874,125.00 which included interest and which this Court now nullifies for being excessive, iniquitous, and exorbitant</u>. x x x&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is, in light of the foregoing disquisition, <b>DENIED. </b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Tinga, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Loan Agreement, Exhibit "1," Exhibits (Defendant).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Real Estate Mortgage, Exhibit "2," Exhibits (Defendant).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Transfer Certificate of Title, Exhibit "3," Exhibits (Defendant).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Restructuring Agreement, Exhibit "4," Exhibits (Defendant).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6] </sup>TSN, May 6, 1999, pp. 33-34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Statement of Account as of March 31, 1997, Exhibit "6," Exhibits (Defendants).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup><u><i>Vide</i></u> Exhibit "7," Exhibits (Defendants); TSN, May 6, 1999, pp. 35-38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, May 6, 1999, p. 38; Exhibit "8," Exhibits (Defendant).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Records, pp. 1-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup>Id. at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup>Id. at 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </sup>Id. at 113-114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 138.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15] </sup>Id. at 138-A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 138.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup>Id. at 141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Id. at 169-169-A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Id. at 368-375.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Id. at 381.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Arcangelita M.
