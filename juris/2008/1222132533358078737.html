				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  dated June 6, 2005 and the Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  dated December 8, 2005, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 77594.  The appellate court had affirmed with modification the Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  dated July 2, 2002 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 57, in Civil Case No. 98-1661.  The RTC ordered the petitioner Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) to execute a Deed of Partial Release from Mortgage of six Rig Haul Trucks, one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel, and shares of stock of the Baguio Country Club, Canlubang Golf and Country Club, Philippine Columbian Association, and Puerto Azul Beach and Country Club in favor of respondent Marcopper Mining Corporation (Marcopper).<br><br>The facts, culled from the records, are as follows:<br><br>To finance its acquisition of 12 Rig Haul Trucks and one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel, Marcopper obtained a loan from RCBC in the amount of US$13.7 Million.  As security for the loan, Marcopper executed in favor of RCBC a Deed of Chattel Mortgage <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  dated April 23, 1996 of the 12 Rig Haul Trucks and one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel and a Deed of Pledge <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  dated August 29, 1996 covering shares of stock of the Baguio Country Club, Canlubang Golf and Country Club, Philippine Columbian Association, and Puerto Azul Beach and Country Club. Later, Marcopper likewise delivered to RCBC an additional Deed of Pledge <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  dated September 9, 1997, covering one share of stock in the Philippine Columbian Association.<br><br>Sometime in 1996, a restructuring of the loan was agreed upon by RCBC and Marcopper.  In view of its inability to pay the loan, Marcopper, in a letter <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  dated July 1, 1997, proposed two options to RCBC:  (1) to initiate foreclosure of the mortgaged assets and treat the deficiency as an unsecured creditor's claim against Marcopper's remaining assets; or (2) to accept the assignment of a Forbes Park property owned by Marcopper comprising 2,437 square meters and covered by TCT No. 321269 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  (Forbes Park property) as partial payment of the loan and restructure the payment of the balance over a period of two years.  The letter stated:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Based on the foregoing, we foresee two (2) possible options for you, namely:<br>  <blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><p align="justify">Initiate a foreclosure on the mortgaged assets, thereby realizing maximum cash proceeds of about $11.6 Million.

Marcopper stated that RCBC was well aware that MR Holdings, Ltd. agreed to release its lien on the Forbes Park property upon Marcopper's assurance that RCBC will release from mortgage the six Rig Haul Trucks and one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel.  In said letter, Marcopper for the first time also stated that pledges over the club shares were to be released as well.  The properties to be released from mortgage and pledge were to be used as substitute security in favor of MR Holdings, Ltd. The letter reads:<br><br><blockquote>November 24, 1997<br><br>MR.

On December 17, 1997, RCBC sent a second letter <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  to Marcopper informing the latter that it has approved the release from mortgage of the six Rig Haul Trucks and one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel as well as the release from pledge of the club shares, also subject to the same condition.  Marcopper failed to settle the obligations which fell due on November 24, 1997, February 23, 1998 and May 25, 1998.  RCBC sent to Marcopper and its surety Mr. Teodoro G. Bernardino a letter dated July 1, 1998, declaring the whole obligation under the non-negotiable promissory notes due and payable and demanding that they pay the same.  Marcopper and its surety refused to pay.<br><br>Instead, on July 16, 1998, Marcopper filed a complaint <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  for Specific Performance with Damages and with Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction against RCBC before the RTC of Makati.  Marcopper alleged that it agreed to assign the Forbes Park property to RCBC to be credited to Marcopper's account in the amount of US$8,901,515 on the condition that RCBC will execute a Deed of Release from Mortgage of the six Rig Haul Trucks, one Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel and the club shares of the Baguio Country Club, Canlubang Golf and Country Club, Puerto Azul Beach and Country Club, and Philippine Columbian Association which it failed to do. Marcopper prayed that RCBC be ordered to execute a deed of partial release of mortgage and pledge, desist from declaring Marcopper's promissory notes as due and demandable, and pay damages.<br><br>In its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim, RCBC asserted that it did not have an obligation to release any mortgage or pledge because the parties did not have any agreement for RCBC to do so.  As its counterclaims, RCBC prayed that Marcopper be ordered to pay the principal amount of its promissory notes, the interest, penalties, and attorney's fees stipulated therein, and to compensate RCBC for the damages it suffered as a result of the filing of the case.<br><br>In a Decision dated July 2, 2002, the RTC ruled in favor of Marcopper:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby [rendered], as follows:<br><ol><li>Ordering defendant Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation to execute a Deed of Partial Release from Mortgage, in favor of the plaintiff, the following properties:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="justify">six (6) units Rig [Haul] trucks</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="justify">one (1) Demag Excavator shovel and for said defendant to release from pledge, in favor of the plaintiff, the following:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top" width="5%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td valign="top" width="71%"><div align="justify">one (1) share of Baguio Country Club under Certificate No. 3753;</div></td> <td width="19%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">one (1) share of Canlubang Golf and Country Club under Certificate No. 1759;</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">c)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">one (1) share of Philippine Columbian Club Association under Certificate No. 1461;</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">one (1) share of Philippine Columbian Club Association under Certificate No. 1486; and</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">e)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">one (1) share of Puerto Azul Beach and Country Club under Certificate No. 534.</div></td>  </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></li><li>Ordering defendant to cease and desist from enforcing and collecting on the non-negotiable Promissory Note Nos. 21-3699 and 21-37997 including the comprehensive surety agreements of Mr. Teodoro Bernardino, the same not being due and enforceable against the plaintiff and Teodoro Bernardino.<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendant to pay Marcopper the amount equivalent to 30% of the value as of 1997 of the six (6) units Rig trucks, Demag Excavator shovel and the club shares mentioned in [the] preceding par. 1 hereof, as compensatory damages; and [P500,000.00] as exemplary damages.<br></li></ol>The compulsory counterclaims of defendant are dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the trial court's ruling.

The only way RCBC would be bound to release the mortgage and pledge is if it had contracted to do so.  However, Marcopper failed to establish that RCBC agreed and legally bound itself to effect release of the subject mortgage and pledge.  RCBC stressed that Marcopper merely presented hearsay and/or irrelevant evidence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <br><br>On the other hand, Marcopper counters that there was an agreement between the parties for RCBC to release the mortgage as proven by the testimonies of its witnesses which were found to be credible.  Marcopper argues that such evidence constitutes findings of fact of the trial court and Court of Appeals and that when supported by substantial evidence, findings of fact of the trial court as affirmed by the Court of Appeals are conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>As a rule, only questions of law are entertained by this Court in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45.

Teodulo C. Gabor, Jr. and Mr. Teodoro G. Bernardino, a member of the Board of Directors of Marcopper.  True, findings by the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses are accorded the greatest respect, and even finality by the appellate courts, since the former is in a better position to observe their demeanor as well as their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <b> </b> However, in this case, not only was there inadequate evidence to prove Marcopper's assertions, the lower courts also overlooked certain significant facts which contradict the assertions of Marcopper's witnesses.<br><br>A review of the written exchanges between the parties shows no written agreement was ever executed by RCBC and Marcopper for RCBC to execute a partial release of mortgage and pledge upon assignment to it of the Forbes Park property.  The July 1, 1997 letter from Marcopper Treasurer Nicanor L. Escalante to RCBC merely listed two options of payment of Marcopper's loan to RCBC while the July 8, 1997 letter from Marcopper to RCBC modified the terms of payment as to the second option listed in the July 1, 1997 letter.  The next written communication between the parties was the July 31, 1997 where Marcopper forwarded the Deed of Release of Mortgage which it requested RCBC to sign.<br><br>Even the letter <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  dated November 24, 1997 from  Marcopper Chairperson of the Board Joost Pekelharing to RCBC makes no allusion to a written contract.  The letter merely stated MR Holdings agreed to release the Forbes Park property <b><u>upon Marcopper's assurance</u></b> that RCBC will release from mortgage six units Rig Haul Trucks and one unit Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel.<br><br>The existence of the alleged condition asserted by Marcopper was therefore to be gleaned primarily from the testimonies of its witnesses who asserted that Marcopper and RCBC had agreed on July 3, 1997 to the release of the mortgage and pledge as a condition to the assignment of the Forbes Park property and ultimately the payment of the promissory notes.  However, we note that the first time that Marcopper ever mentioned the release of the pledges of club shares was in its letter dated November 24, 1997.  Before that, Marcopper requested the release of the mortgage on the Rig Haul Trucks and one unit Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel only.  Marcopper's letter to RCBC dated July 8, 1997, which confirmed the agreements between the parties during their July 3, 1997 meeting, did not state that RCBC committed to release the mortgage and pledge, a condition which Marcopper alleged to be a material condition and which would ordinarily be included in the written confirmation had it been agreed upon.  Also, on September 9, 1997, Marcopper executed a deed of pledge of one additional share of stock of the Philippine Columbian Association.  If it were true, as asserted by Marcopper's witnesses, that RCBC had committed to release the mortgage and pledge during the July 3, 1997 meeting, Marcopper would not have delivered the additional pledge after the Forbes Park property had been assigned to RCBC.  That it did so proves that the assignment of the Forbes Park property was not made on the condition Marcopper claims.<br><br>Contracts are perfected by mere consent, and from that moment the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage, and law. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <br><br>In general, contracts undergo three distinct stages, to wit: negotiation; perfection or birth; and consummation.  Negotiation begins from the time the prospective contracting parties manifest their interest in the contract and ends at the moment of agreement of the parties.  Perfection or birth of the contract takes place when the parties agree upon the essential elements of the contract.  Consummation occurs when the parties fulfill or perform the terms agreed upon in the contract, culminating in the extinguishment thereof. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br>Based on the records, RCBC agreed to a partial release of the mortgaged properties only in its letters dated December 15, 1997 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  and December 17, 1997 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  but it was clearly on the condition that Marcopper first pay the first amortization which fell due on November 24, 1997.<br><br>Marcopper cannot renege on its obligation to pay the promissory notes under the pretext that there was a previous agreement between the parties for RCBC to effect a partial release of mortgage and pledge upon assignment to it of the Forbes Park property.<br><br>Marcopper has failed to establish a cause of action, defined as an act or omission by which a party violates a right of another. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <br><br>In <i>Jison v. Court of Appeals</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  this Court outlined the quantum of evidence required in order to sufficiently assert one's claim in civil cases, thus:<br><blockquote>The foregoing discussion, however, must be situated within the general rules on evidence, in light of the burden of proof in civil cases, i.e., preponderance of evidence, and the shifting of the burden of evidence in such cases.  Simply put, he who alleges the affirmative of the issue has the burden of proof, and upon the plaintiff in a civil case, the burden of proof never parts.  However, in the course of trial in a civil case, once plaintiff makes out a <i>prima facie</i> case in his favor, the duty or the burden of evidence shifts to defendant to controvert plaintiff's <i>prima facie</i> case, otherwise, a verdict must be returned in favor of plaintiff.  Moreover, in civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must produce a preponderance of evidence thereon, with plaintiff having to rely on the strength of his own evidence and not upon the weakness of the defendant's.  The concept of "preponderance of evidence" refers to evidence which is of greater weight, or more convincing, that which is offered in opposition to it; at bottom, it means probability of truth.<br></blockquote>In a civil case, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish his case through a preponderance of evidence.  If he claims a right granted or created by law, he must prove his claim by competent evidence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <br><br>Given the existence of facts clearly militating against Marcopper's claim and the absence of any written agreement between the parties, the testimonies of witnesses who happen to be officers of Marcopper and whose testimonies should naturally favor Marcopper are insufficient to establish its cause of action.  Marcopper's complaint should have been dismissed by the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
