				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before Us is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Petitioner Rebecca E. Badiola (Badiola) seeks to annul, reverse and set aside (1) the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 19 October 2005 in which the Court of Appeals refused to reconsider its earlier Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 22 December 2004, dismissing Badiola's petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 84623; and (2) the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 19 January 2004 in Administrative Case No. OMB-C-A-03-0186-F in which the Office of the Ombudsman suspended Badiola from office for three months without pay after finding her guilty of simple neglect of duty.<br><br>The factual and procedural antecedents of the case are as follows:<br><br>Badiola is the Human Resource Management Officer V of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and is designated as the Chief of the Personnel Division.&nbsp; She is likewise the Head Secretariat of the DA Promotion and Selection Board (DA-PSB) and the DA Search Committee.<br><br>Private respondent Lerma G. Abesamis (Abesamis), on the other hand, is a Project Development Officer of the Public Investment Program Division of the DA Planning Service.<br><br>On 30 May 2003, Abesamis filed a Complaint-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> before the Office of the Ombudsman, charging Badiola with violating Section 5(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees), Section 3(e) and (f)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Perjury<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>, and Dishonesty and/or Grave Misconduct.<br><br>In the Complaint-Affidavit, Abesamis related that on 17 July 2001, and again on 15 January 2003, she applied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for the vacant position of Director III (Assistant Director) of the Agricultural Training Institute, an attached Bureau of the DA.&nbsp; She submitted her letter of application to then DA Secretary Luis P. Lorenzo, Jr. (Lorenzo), together with recommendation letters from various politicians, which DA Secretary Lorenzo allegedly endorsed to the Office of the President (OP) for consideration.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 5 March 2003, then Chairman Bernardino R. Abes (Abes) of the OP Search Committee returned DA Secretary Lorenzo's letter of endorsement of Abesamis's application, and required instead the submission of (1) the names of at least three&nbsp; nominees for the position, with supporting documents; and (2) the rating/ranking of the nominees given by the DA-PSB.<br><br>Abesamis alleged that from the time of receipt by the DA of Chairman Abes's letter on 6 March 2003 until the filing of her Complaint-Affidavit, the requirements in said letter were yet to be complied with.&nbsp; This undue delay was blamed on Badiola, as she was the head of the DA-PSB Secretariat, and this was deliberately done in order to favor another unnamed applicant for the same position.<br><br>On 15 May 2003, Abesamis received a memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> signed by DA-PSB Vice Chairman and Administrative Service Director Julito M. Briola, requiring her to submit her Performance Appraisal Report for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> semesters of Calendar Year 2002.&nbsp; Abesamis complained that this requirement was applied only to her, allegedly upon the authorship of Badiola.&nbsp; Abesamis's immediate superior, purportedly in collusion with Badiola, gave Abesamis low marks so as to disqualify her from the promotion she was aspiring for.<br><br>Finally, Abesamis pointed to the alleged illegality of Badiola's appointment as Human Resource Management Officer V (Chief of Division) on 20 January 1999.&nbsp; A Master's Degree was required for the said position and Badiola obtained hers from the Pampanga Agricultural College only in March 1999, as certified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> by the school.&nbsp; Abesamis averred that Badiola wrongly stated this fact on her Personal Data Sheet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; According to Abesamis, Badiola even misrepresented in her Daily Time Record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that she was rendering overtime work in the DA Quezon City office during the Saturdays of November and December in 1998, when she was supposedly attending classes in Pampanga at the same time.<br><br>The administrative complaint was docketed at the Office of the Ombudsman Preliminary Investigation and Administrative Adjudication Bureau as OMB-C-A-03-0186-F, for Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service, while the criminal aspect of the complaint was docketed as OMB-C-C-03-0355-F, for violation of Section 3(e) and (f) of Republic Act No. 3019.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated 1 July 2003, the Office of the Ombudsman required Badiola to submit a Counter-Affidavit and other controverting evidence to the complaint.<br><br>On 8 July 2003, Badiola filed her Counter-Affidavit in which she denied the allegations that she caused the delay in the processing of Abesamis's papers and that she had any part in the decision of the DA-PSB to require the applicants to submit their performance evaluation reports.&nbsp; Badiola also asserted that the DA-PSB already forwarded its recommendations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of short listed applicants to DA Secretary Lorenzo as of 17 June 2003 in compliance with the letter of OP Search Committee Chairman Abes. Regarding the issue of her Master's Degree, Badiola declared that she belonged to the graduate class of October 1998 as reflected in the Official Transcript of Records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> issued by the Pampanga Agricultural College.&nbsp; However, the graduation rites were only held on 16 December 1999, which circumstance was already beyond her control. Thus, she allegedly committed no misrepresentation in her Daily Time Records when she declared that she rendered overtime services in the months of November and December in 1998.<br><br>On 17 July 2003, Abesamis filed a Reply-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> wherein she spelled out the mistakes committed by Badiola in the performance of her duties.&nbsp; She annexed thereto an unsigned letter by DA Secretary Lorenzo to OP Search Committee Chairman Abes, which was prepared by Badiola's office. The matrix of the short listed applicants and their qualifications presented in said letter bear the following irregularities: (1) the name of then Undersecretary Charito R. Eligir of the Presidential Management Staff (PMS) appeared as one of Abesamis's endorsers, when he was actually not; (2) the other personalities who actually recommended Abesamis for the promotion were not listed; (3) that Abesamis's Master's Degree in Business Administration was omitted from the information regarding her educational background; and (4) that the applicant ranked number 1 was made to appear to have a Master's Degree in Environment and Natural Resources Management, when he had yet to finish the same. Abesamis claimed that these mistakes were deliberately resorted to by Badiola to discriminate against Abesamis's application for promotion.<br><br>In a Rejoinder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> filed by Badiola, she explained that the erroneous entries were honest mistakes and that the same were already rectified.<br><br>Several more pleadings and documents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> were thereafter filed by the parties before the Ombudsman.<br><br>On 10 November 2003, the Ombudsman issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dismissing OMB-C-C-03-0355-F, the criminal complaint against Badiola, pertinent portions of which read:<br><blockquote>[W]ith respect to the charge of&nbsp; Violation of Section 3, paragraph (e) of R.A. 3019, the essential element of "discharging official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence" is not present in the instant case.&nbsp; In the same token, as regards the charge of Violation of Section 3, paragraph (f) of R.A. 3019, the essential element of giving undue advantage in favor of an interested party is lacking herein.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Accordingly, it can not be gainsaid that the [herein petitioner Badiola] acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence since the purported delay is beyond her control.&nbsp; Furthermore, a reading of the complaint failed to reveal that "undue injury" has been caused to the [herein private respondent Abesamis].&nbsp; In addition, the actuation of [Badiola] can not be considered as having given undue advantage to an interested party since the requirements imposed on the nominees to the position in question appears to apply to all of the said nominees.<br><br>In view of the lack of any sufficient ground to engender a well founded belief that the respondent committed a violation of Republic Act No. 3019, the only logical recourse is to dismiss the present case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is respectfully recommended that the above-entitled case be DISMISSED, as it is hereby DISMISSED.</blockquote>Subsequently, on 19 January 2004, the Office of the Ombudsman rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in OMB-C-A-03-0186-F, the administrative case against Badiola, in which it ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>After a careful review of the records of the case, we conclude, and so hold, that substantial evidence have been adduced to establish the liability of respondent [Badiola] for Neglect of Duty.&nbsp;<br><br>It is beyond question that the official functions of [Badiola] consist of, among others, the supervision of the concerned office staff and the submission of data/information of candidates for appointment/promotion.&nbsp; However, as the records of the case will reveal, [Badiola] appears to have been remiss in the performance of the said functions.&nbsp;<br><br>For one, it has been shown that the respondent [Badiola] failed to perform her task of supervising the personnel under her direction, particularly, Human Resource Management Officer I ROMELIA A. UFEMIA, resulting in the placing of the name of Undersecretary CHARITO ELEGIR of the Presidential Management Staff as one of the endorsers in the application for promotion of the complainant. x x x&nbsp;<br><br>From this, it is clear that the respondent [Badiola] has been remiss in the performance of her duty, i.e., in supervising the personnel under her charge.&nbsp; Although this mistake may be considered as innocuous, it apparently has a more far-reaching repercussion, in that a false endorsement from the Presidential Management Staff, contained in official records, will have a negative effect on the application of the complainant [Abesamis].&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, the respondent [Badiola] further failed to perform her supervisory function, by indicating in the same matrix of short listed applicants for the position of Assistant Director for the Agricultural Training Institute (pp. 0079, records), that FRANCISCO RAMOS III, one of the applicants for the ATI position, was a graduate of a masteral degree in environment and natural resources management, when in fact, record in the possession of the respondent [Badiola] will show that RAMOS is not yet a graduate.&nbsp; This again has far-reaching effects in that it appears to be favorable to the concerned applicant, to the prejudice of the other applicants for the position.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, in the same matrix of short listed applicants for the position of Assistant Director for the Agricultural Training Institute (pp. 0081, records), the fact that the complainant [Abesamis] is a holder of a Masters in Business Administration was omitted, when in fact, records in the official custody of the respondent [Badiola] will indicate such.&nbsp; This further shows that the respondent [Badiola] has apparently failed in the performance of her functions.&nbsp;<br><br>x x x x&nbsp;<br><br>As discussed above, the performance by the respondent [Badiola] of her function leaves much to be desired, and for which the appropriate penalty should be imposed. In view of the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, it is submitted that the medium penalty for the offense of Simple Neglect of Duty may be imposed against the respondent [Badiola].&nbsp;<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, judgment is hereby rendered finding [petitioner] REBECCA E. BADIOLA, Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty, for which the penalty of Suspension From Office for Three (3) Months Without Pay is hereby recommended, pursuant to Section 52 B(1), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.&nbsp;<br><br>The Honorable, the Secretary, (sic) Department of Agriculture is hereby furnished a copy of this Decision for its implementation in accordance with law, with the directive to inform this Office of the action taken hereon.</blockquote>Badiola filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the above Decision, which the Ombudsman denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated 11 May 2004.<br><br>Badiola sought recourse with the Court of Appeals by filing a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with a Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 84623.<br><br>In her petition, Badiola claimed that the Ombudsman erred in holding that she was remiss in the supervision of the personnel under her charge and that she was negligent in the performance of her official duties.&nbsp; According to Badiola, the official matrix that was signed by DA Secretary Lorenzo and submitted to the OP Search Committee showed the correct qualifications of the applicants, therefore proving that Badiola did indeed perform her job.&nbsp; Badiola likewise prayed for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) inasmuch as the implementation of the Ombudsman Decision dated 19 January 2004, which ordered Badiola's suspension, and the 11 May 2004 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which denied her Motion for Reconsideration of the said decision, will inflict irreparable injury upon her person.<br><br>Badiola subsequently filed a Supplemental Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> in view of the fact that her original petition was instituted without the services of a counsel and that certain aspects of her case were overlooked.&nbsp; In the Supplemental Petition, Badiola further contended that the Ombudsman erred in proceeding with the administrative case despite the prior dismissal of the criminal aspect that was based on the same set of facts, and reiterated her prayer for the issuance of a TRO.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 20 July 2004, the Court of Appeals dismissed Badiola's original petition in this wise:<br><blockquote>For petitioner's [Badiola's] failure to attach copies of pertinent pleadings filed before the Office of the Ombudsman and a certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Decision dated January 19, 2004 rendered by the Ombudsman in OMB-C-A-03-0186-F as required by Section 6, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court, this Court hereby resolves to DISMISS [the] instant petition.<br></blockquote>Thereafter, Badiola, who apparently had not yet received a copy of the foregoing Resolution dismissing her petition, filed an Urgent Motion (To Resolve Application for a Temporary Restraining Order).&nbsp; According to Badiola, on 26 July 2004, she received a copy of the letter-response<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of Overall Deputy Ombudsman Margarito P. Gervacio to DA Secretary Lorenzo's inquiry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> informing the latter that in accordance with Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> an Ombudsman administrative disciplinary case may be executed pending appeal before the Court of Appeals, in the absence of any restraining or status quo order or preliminary injunction from the appellate court.&nbsp; In view of the imminent danger of sustaining a grave and irreparable injury through the implementation of the order of suspension, Badiola again urged the Court of Appeals to immediately issue a TRO.<br><br>On 3 August 2004, Badiola filed with the Court of Appeals a Motion praying for (1) reconsideration of its Resolution dated 20 July 2004 dismissing her petition; and (2) resolution of her Urgent Motion (To Resolve Application for a Temporary Restraining Order).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the said Motion, Badiola enumerated the following documents that were attached to her original and supplemental Petitions for Review, namely: (1) Legible duplicate original of the Decision dated 19 January 2004 of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-A-03-0186-F, finding her guilty of simple neglect of duty and recommending her suspension for three (3) months without pay; (2) Certified true copy of the Order dated 11 May 2004 of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-A-03-0186-F, denying her Motion for Reconsideration of the 19 January 2004 Decision; (3) Certified true copy of the Resolution dated 10 November 2003 of the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C-03-0355-F, dismissing the criminal complaint against her; (4) Certified true copy of the letter dated 3 November 2003 of DA Secretary Lorenzo to OP Search Committee Chairman Abes, endorsing the appointment of Francisco Ramos III as Assistant Director of ATI and containing a corrected matrix of short listed applicants; and (5) Certified true copy of the letter dated 5 July 2004 of DA Secretary Lorenzo to Ombudsman Simeon V. Marcelo, asking for a clarification as to the implementation of the 19 January 2004 Decision.<br><br>Badiola insisted that the above-mentioned attachments were all certified true copies or legible duplicate originals as required by Section 6, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Having complied with all the requirements set forth by the Rules, Badiola argued that a reconsideration by the Court of Appeals of its 20 July 2004 Resolution dismissing her petition was in order and that her case should be decided on its merits.<br><br>On 12 August 2004, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> stating that:<br><blockquote>In view of the Resolution dated July 20, 2004 dismissing the Petition for Review, the Supplemental Petition for Review filed on July 12, 2004 and Urgent Motion (to Resolve Application for a Temporary Restraining Order) filed on July 27, 2004 are merely NOTED.</blockquote>On 2 September 2004, Badiola filed with the Court of Appeals an Urgent Reiterating Motion seeking (1) reconsideration of the Resolution dated 20 July 2004; and (2) resolution of her Urgent Motion (To Resolve the Application for a Temporary Restraining Order).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Badiola claimed that since her previous Motion for reconsideration and for resolution was filed only on 3 August 2004, a day after the Agendum for the 12 August 2004 deliberations was prepared, the same was not actually taken up.&nbsp; She likewise mentioned the fact that there was a newly appointed DA Secretary who might possibly implement the order of suspension against her.&nbsp; Badiola thus prayed for the immediate resolution of her Urgent Reiterating Motion for reconsideration and resolution.&nbsp;<br><br>After requiring Abesamis to submit a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> on the said Urgent Reiterating Motion for reconsideration and resolution, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated 22 December 2004, which states:<br><blockquote>On August 3, 2004, a motion for reconsideration of this Court's resolution dated July 20, 2004 and for resolution of the urgent motion to resolve the application for a Temporary Restraining Order was filed.&nbsp; Attached to the motion are only the certified true copies of the Orders of the Ombudsman dated May 11, 2004 and January 19, 2004.&nbsp; <b>The pertinent pleadings filed before the Ombudsman were however not included despite explicit [orders] to do so</b>.<br><br>In the instant case, this Court finds the necessity to look into the defenses petitioner [Badiola] raised in said pleadings if a complete determination of the issues of the case is to be achieved.&nbsp; No such compliance was made.<br><br>On account of failure to comply with the Order of this Court, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner Badiola is DENIED.

The lapse of such a long period of time is also more than enough reason to dismiss the petition.&nbsp; Badiola's filing of a second motion for reconsideration with the Court of Appeals, being a prohibited pleading, did not toll the running of the reglementary period for filing a petition for review with this Court.<br><br>Even if this Court were to give due course to Badiola's petition under Rule 65, it would still be dismissible for lack of merit. Badiola claims that the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it dismissed her case on purely technical grounds, namely, that she filed a prohibited second motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; This insipid argument, however, fails to convince this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations of grave abuse of discretion must be substantiated and proved.&nbsp; In this requirement, Badiola was utterly deficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; A decision is not deemed tainted with grave abuse of discretion simply because the party affected disagrees with it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that the Court of Appeals committed no error, whether of judgment or jurisdiction, in denying Badiola's motion for reconsideration of the Resolution dated 22 December 2004 filed on 28 January 2005.&nbsp; This motion partakes of the nature of a second motion for reconsideration inasmuch as it contains the same grounds and the same prayer as that of her motion for reconsideration earlier filed on 2 September 2004.&nbsp; In both these motions filed before the Court of Appeals, Badiola contended that she had a meritorious case for the overturning of the 19 January 2004 Decision of the Ombudsman in the administrative case against her, considering that she was already exonerated in the criminal case involving the same act.&nbsp; Badiola thus prayed in these motions for the Court of Appeals to reinstate her original and supplemental Petitions for Review in CA-G.R. SP No. 84623.<br><br>Hence, the Court of Appeals was correct in denying Badiola's second motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court explicitly declares that no second motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained.&nbsp; Such motion is a prohibited pleading, which shall not be allowed, except for ordinarily persuasive reasons and only after an express leave shall have first been obtained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; Badiola, however, did not seek any leave to file her second motion for reconsideration nor offer any explanation or reason whatsoever to exempt the same from the general prohibition on second motions for reconsideration.<br><br>The only ground upon which Badiola staunchly based her claims in her two motions for reconsideration was, allegedly, her highly meritorious case.&nbsp; According to Badiola, the Ombudsman erred in proceeding with the administrative case and finding her guilty of simple neglect of duty despite her exoneration from the criminal case.&nbsp; By all accounts, her complete innocence and lack of culpability in the criminal case foreclosed any administrative liability on her part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The Court finds this argument to be entirely incorrect.<br><br>Indeed, the well established rule is that the dismissal of the criminal case involving the same set of facts does not necessarily foreclose the continuation of the administrative action or carry with it relief from administrative liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; The case of <i>Tecson v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></i>provides elucidation on this very point, thus:<br><blockquote>[I]t is a basic principle of the law on public officers that a public official or employee is under a three-fold responsibility for violation of duty or for a wrongful act or omission.&nbsp; This simply means that a public officer may be held civilly, criminally, and administratively liable for a wrongful doing.&nbsp; Thus, if such violation or wrongful act results in damages to an individual, the public officer may be held civilly liable to reimburse the injured party.&nbsp; If the law violated attaches a penal sanction, the erring officer may be punished criminally.&nbsp; Finally, such violation may also lead to suspension, removal from office, or other administrative sanctions.&nbsp; This administrative liability is separate and distinct from the penal and civil liabilities.</blockquote>Furthermore, a finding of guilt in an administrative case may be sustained for as long as it is supported by substantial evidence that the respondent has committed the acts charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Substantial evidence is defined as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, criminal proceedings require a more stringent quantum of proof, which is proof beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; As defined under the law, proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding the possibility of error, produces absolute certainty.&nbsp; Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, when Badiola was absolved from criminal liability, it simply meant that her guilt on the offenses she was charged with was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. This fact does not and should not in any way bind the outcome of the administrative case, which requires only substantial evidence to prove her administrative culpability.<br><br>Finally, as aptly observed by the Ombudsman in its Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> before this Court, the criminal and administrative cases were not at all based on the same facts as averred by Badiola. The criminal charges against her were brought about by her alleged act of deliberately delaying the processing of Abesamis's application.&nbsp; On the other hand, her administrative liability was established on the basis of her negligence in the supervision of the employees under her charge and the performance of her duties as the Head of the DA-PSB Secretariat.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing, the instant Petition for Review under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp; The assailed Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 19 October 2005 in CA-G.R.
