He filed with the Regional Adjudicator<i> </i>a motion for reconsideration thereof on <b>13 September 1999</b>, which the<i> </i>Regional Adjudicator denied in his Order dated 11 October 1999.  Petitioner received the Regional Adjudicator's<i> </i>Order denying his motion on <b>19 October 1999</b>.  On the same day, 19 October 1999, petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> but the appeal fee of P500.00 in postal money order was postmarked <b>20 October 1999</b>.  Petitioner's Notice of Appeal was denied by the Regional Adjudicator in his Order dated 26 October 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  The Regional Adjudicator's<i> </i>latest Order reads:<br><blockquote><center>ORDER<br><br></center>Submitted before the Board through this Adjudicator is a "NOTICE OF APPEAL," dated October 19, 1999, of the DECISION in the above-entitled case dated August 16, 1999 with a POSTAL MONEY ORDER in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P500.00) ONLY (APPEAL FEE) POSTMARKED Makati Central Post Office, M.M., dated October 20, 1999 filed by [herein petitioner] through counsel.<br><br>It is noteworthy that both the aforesaid "NOTICE OF APPEAL" and "APPEAL FEE" were not filed and paid, respectively, within the REGLEMENTARY PERIOD as provided for by the DARAB NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE under Section 5, Rule XIII which states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5.  Requisites and perfection of the Appeal.<br><br>a) The Notice of Appeal shall be filed within the reglementary period as provided for in Section 1 of this Rule.  x x x<br><br>b) An appeal fee of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) shall be paid by the appellant within the reglementary period to the DAR Cashier where the Office of the Adjudicator is situated.  x x x.<br><br>Under the 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph of said SECTION 5, it further states:<br><br>Non-compliance with the above-mentioned requisites shall be a ground for the dismissal of the appeal."<br></blockquote>The records of this case show that the [petitioner] through counsel filed his "Motion for Reconsideration" of the Decision of this case on September 13, 1999 which was the 15<sup>th</sup> day of said Reglementary Period.  The 15<sup>th</sup> day was supposed to have been on September 11, 1999 counted from August 28, 1999, the following day after [petitioner] through counsel received a copy of the Decision on August 27, 1999 but because September 11, 1999 was a Saturday, the 15<sup>th</sup> day was September 13, 1999, the following working day.  Now, nowhere on the records of this case show that the required "Appeal Fee" was paid on or before the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the Reglementary Period.<br><br>The records of this case also show that this instant "NOTICE OF APPEAL" was filed on October 19, 1999, (Postmarked Makati Central P.O., M.M.) the day when [petitioner] through counsel received copy of the Denial of the said "MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION."  Since September 13, 1999 was the 15<sup>th</sup> day of said 15-day reglementary period, this instant `NOTICE OF APPEAL" is considered filed out of time.  Even the "Appeal Fee" of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) in POSTAL MONEY ORDER, it is postmarked October 20, 1999, MAKATI CENTRAL P.O. M.M. Since September 13, 1999 was the 15<sup>th</sup> day of said 15-day reglementary period, this "APPEAL FEE" is considered paid out of time.<br><br>Additionally, even granting without admitting that this instant "NOTICE OF APPEAL" and "APPEAL FEE" were filed and paid, respectively, within the required reglementary period, [petitioner] through counsel miserably failed to state any ground in the Notice of Appeal as provided for under SECTION 2, RULE XIII of the DARAB NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, and pursuant to the provisions of SECTION 5 and SECTION 2, Rule XIII of the DARAB NEW RULES OF PROCEDURE, this instant "NOTICE OF APPEAL" is hereby DENIED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration on 5 November 1999 but the same was denied by the Regional Adjudicator on 15 November 1999.<br><br>Respondents filed a Motion for Execution on 27 October 1999.  The Regional Adjudicator issued a Writ of Execution dated 17 November 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Petitioner thereafter filed an original action for <i>certiorari</i> before the DARAB to annul the Order dated 26 October 1999, Order dated 15 November 1999 and the Writ of Execution dated 17 November 1999, all issued by the Regional Adjudicator.  In a Resolution dated 5 May 2005, the DARAB denied petitioner's petition for <i>certiorari</i> for lack of merit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> holding that:<br><blockquote>While it is true that the filing of the Notice of Appeal dated October 19, 1999 was made within the reglementary period to perfect the same, however, the required appeal fee was not paid within the reglementary period because the last day to perfect an appeal is October 19, 1999, while the appeal fee in a form of postal money order is postmarked October 20, 1999.  Precisely, there is no payment of appeal fee within the 15-day reglementary period to perfect an appeal.  Therefore, the order of the [Regional Adjudicator] denying the notice of appeal of the petitioner is well within the ambit of the provisions of the above-quoted Rule, particularly the last paragraph thereof, hence the instant petition must necessarily fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the foregoing resolution was denied by the DARAB in another Resolution dated 17 January 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> a copy of which was received by petitioner on <b>2 February 2006</b>.<br><br>Refusing to concede, petitioner filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> under Rule 65 with the Court of Appeals on <b>17 March 2006</b>.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 5 April 2006, the Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition, reasoning as follows:<br><blockquote>Sections 1 and 4, Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provide that an appeal from the award, judgment, final order or resolution of the Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, among other quasi-judicial agencies, shall be taken by filing with the Court of Appeals a petition for review within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof, or of the denial of the motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency <i>a quo.</i><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Even if we consider the instant petition for certiorari as a petition for review, the same must still be dismissed for having been filed beyond the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy of the Resolution dated January 17, 2006. As pointed out in the above-cited case, appeals from all quasi-judicial bodies shall be made by way of petition for review with the Court of Appeals regardless of the nature of the question raised.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that certiorari is not available where the proper remedy is appeal in due course and such remedy was lost because of respondent's failure to take an appeal.  The special civil action of certiorari is not and can not be made a substitute for appeal or a lost appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the afore-quoted ruling was denied by the appellate court in a Resolution dated 4 July 2006.<br><br>Hence, the present Petition, raising the following issues:<br><blockquote>(a) Whether or not the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the Petition under Rule 65 filed by the Petitioner mainly on the ground that the proper remedy is a Petition under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>(b) Whether or not the Regional Adjudicator acted within his authority when he declared the subject parcels of land as "ancestral lands."<br><br>(c) Whether or not the Regional Adjudicator acted within his authority when he declared that the title<i>s</i> of the petitioner should be declared null and void.<br></blockquote>Preliminarily, petitioner is actually asking us to rule on the propriety of (1) the denial of his Notice of Appeal by the Regional Adjudicator, affirmed by the DARAB; and (2) the dismissal of his Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Regional Adjudicator denied petitioner's Notice of Appeal because the latter was delayed for one day in the payment of appeal fee.<br><br>The 2003 Rules of Procedure of the DARAB lays down the following procedure:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">RULE XIV<br></div><div style="text-align: center;">APPEALS<br></div><br>Section 1.  <b>Appeal to the Board.</b> An appeal may be taken to the Board from a resolution, decision or final order of the Adjudicator that completely disposes of the case by either or both of the parties within a period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of the resolution/decision/final order appealed from or of the denial of the movant's motion for reconsideration in accordance with Section 12, Rule IX, by:<br><br>1.1 filing a Notice of Appeal with the Adjudicator who rendered the decision or final order appealed from;<br><br>1.2 furnishing copies of said Notice of Appeal to all parties and the Board; and<br><br>1.3  paying an appeal fee of Seven Hundred Pesos (Php700.00) to the DAR Cashier where the Office of the Adjudicator is situated or through postal money order, payable to the DAR Cashier where the Office of the Adjudicator is situated, at the option of the appellant.<br><br>A pauper litigant shall be exempt from the payment of the appeal fee.<br><br>Proof of service of Notice of Appeal to the affected parties and to the Board and payment of appeal fee shall be filed, within the reglementary period, with the Adjudicator a quo and shall form part of the records of the case.<br><br>Non-compliance with the foregoing shall be a ground for dismissal of the appeal.<br><br>SECTION 4.  <b>Perfection of Appeal</b>.  An appeal is deemed perfected upon compliance with Section 1 of this Rule.<br><br>A pauper litigant's appeal is deemed perfected upon the filing of the Notice of Appeal in accordance with said Section 1 of this Rule.<br></blockquote>The general rule is that appeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal and paying the requisite docket fees and other lawful fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>However, all general rules admit of certain exceptions.  In <i>Mactan</i><i> Cebu International Airport Authority v. Mangubat</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> where the docket fees were paid six days late, we said that where the party showed willingness to abide by the rules by immediately paying the required fees and taking into consideration the importance of the issues raised in the case, the same calls for judicial leniency, thus:<br><blockquote>In all, what emerges from all of the above is that the rules of procedure in the matter of paying the docket fees must be followed.  However, there are exceptions to the stringent requirement as to call for a relaxation of the application of the rules, such as: (1) most persuasive and weighty reasons; (2) to relieve a litigant from an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed  procedure; (3) good faith of the defaulting party by immediately paying within a reasonable time from the time of the default; (4) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (5) the merits of the case; (6) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (7) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; (8) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby; (9) fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence without appellant's fault; (10) peculiar legal and equitable circumstances attendant to each case; (11) in the name of substantial justice and fair play; (12) importance of the issues involved; and (13) exercise of sound discretion by the judge guided by all the attendant circumstances.  Concomitant to a liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to adequately explain his failure to abide by the rules.  Anyone seeking exemption from the application of the Rule has the burden of proving that exceptionally meritorious instances exist which warrant such departure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>We have not been oblivious to or unmindful of the extraordinary situations that merit liberal application of the Rules, allowing us, depending on the circumstances, to set aside technical infirmities and give due course to the appeal. In cases where we dispense with the technicalities, we do not mean to undermine the force and effectivity of the periods set by law.  In those rare cases where we did not stringently apply the procedural rules, there always existed a clear need to prevent the commission of a grave injustice.  Our judicial system and the courts have always tried to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that every litigant be given the full opportunity for the just and proper disposition of his cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  If the Highest Court of the land itself relaxes its rules in the interest of substantive justice, then what more the administrative bodies which exercise quasi-judicial functions?  It must be emphasized that the goal of courts and quasi-judicial bodies, above else, must be to render substantial justice to the parties.<br><br>In this case, petitioner was only one day late in paying the appeal fee, and he already stands to lose his titles to the subject properties.  We find this too harsh a consequence for a day's delay.  Worthy to note is the fact that petitioner <b>actually paid</b> the appeal fee; only, he was a day late.  That petitioner immediately paid the requisite appeal fee a day after the deadline displays his willingness to comply with the requirement therefor.<br><br>When petitioner sought recourse to the Court of Appeals <i>via</i> a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, his Petition was dismissed.  The Court of Appeals held that the petitioner availed himself of the wrong remedy as an appeal from the order, award, judgment or final order of the DARAB shall be taken to the Court of Appeals by filing a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court and not a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<br><br>On this point, we agree with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Pertinent provisions of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court governing appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals, provide:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.  <i>Scope</i>. - This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions.  Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Where to appeal</i>. - An appeal under this Rule may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.<br><br>SEC. 4.  <i>Period of appeal. </i>- The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency <i>a quo.</i> Only one (1) motion for reconsideration shall be allowed.  Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.<br></blockquote>In <i>Nippon Paint Employees Union-Olalia v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we clarified:<br><blockquote>It is elementary in remedial law that the use of an erroneous mode of appeal is cause for dismissal of the petition for <i>certiorari </i>and it has been repeatedly stressed that a petition for <i>certiorari </i>is not a substitute for a lost appeal.  This is due to the nature of a Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari </i>which lies only where there is "no appeal," and "no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."  As previously ruled by this Court:<br><blockquote>x x x We have time and again reminded members of the bench and bar that a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 lies only when "there is no appeal nor plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."  Certiorari can not be allowed when a party to a case fails to appeal a judgment despite the availability of that remedy, certiorari not being a substitute for lost appeal.  The remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Petitioner clearly availed himself of the wrong mode of appeal in bringing his case before the Court of Appeals for review.<br><br>Petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court instead of a petition for review under Rule 43, not because it was the only plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to him under the law, but, obviously, to make up for the loss of his right to an ordinary appeal.  It is elementary that the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> is not and cannot be a substitute for an appeal, where the latter remedy is available, as it was in this case.  A special civil action under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court cannot cure a party's failure to timely file a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.  Rule 65 is an independent action that cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, including that under Rule 43, especially if such loss or lapse was occasioned by a party's neglect or error in the choice of remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>All things considered, however, we do not agree in the conclusion of the Court of Appeals dismissing petitioner's Petition based on a procedural <i>faux pax</i>.  While a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is dismissible for being the wrong remedy, there are exceptions to this rule, to wit:  (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sebastian v. Morales,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><i> </i>we ruled that rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only when, for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure, thus:<br><blockquote>[C]onsidering that the petitioner has presented a good cause for the proper and just determination of his case, the appellate court should have relaxed the stringent application of technical rules of procedure and yielded to consideration of substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has allowed some meritorious cases to proceed despite inherent procedural defects and lapses.  This is in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice and that strict and rigid application of rules which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must always be avoided.  It is a far better and more prudent cause of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case to attain the ends of justice, rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not a miscarriage of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>We find that petitioner's case fits more the exception rather than the general rule.  Taking into account the importance of the issues raised in the Petition, and what petitioner stands to lose, the Court of Appeals should have given due course to the said Petition and treated it as a petition for review.  By dismissing the Petition outright, the Court of Appeals absolutely foreclosed the resolution of the issues raised therein.  Indubitably, justice would have been better served if the Court of Appeals resolved the issues that were raised in the Petition.<br><br>Conspicuously, the period to appeal had lapsed so that even if the Court of Appeals considered the petition as one for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, still the petition was filed beyond the reglementary period.  But, there can be no blinking at the fact that under Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, "the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review."  By any reckoning, the Court of Appeals may even grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days within which to file the petition under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. In other words, the period to appeal from <i>quasi-judicial</i> agencies to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 is neither an impregnable nor an unyielding rule.<br><br>The issue involved in this case is no less than the jurisdiction of the Regional Arbitrator to render its Decision dated 16 August 1999 declaring the subject properties as ancestral lands.  As well, it is too flagrant to be ignored that these lands are covered by a Torrens title in the name of the petitioner.  The Court of Appeals should have looked past rules of technicality to resolve the case on its merits. <br><br>For DARAB to have jurisdiction over a case, there must exist a tenancy relationship between the parties.  A tenancy relationship cannot be presumed.  There must be evidence to prove the tenancy relations such that all its indispensable elements must be established, to wit: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) there is consent by the landowner; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation; and (6) there is sharing of the harvests.  All these requisites are necessary to create tenancy relationship, and the absence of one or more requisites will not make the alleged tenant a <i>de facto</i> tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In <i>Heirs of Rafael Magpily v. De Jesus, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  </i> tenants are defined as persons who - in themselves and with the aid available from within their immediate farm householders - they cultivate the lands belonging to or possessed by another with the latter's consent; for purposes of production, they share the produce with the landholder under the share tenancy system, or pay to the landholder a price certain or ascertainable in produce of money or both under the leasehold tenancy system.<br><br>In this case, respondents did not allege much less prove that they are tenants of the subject properties.  There is likewise no independent evidence to prove any of the requisites of a tenancy relationship between petitioner and respondents.  What they insist upon is that they are occupying their ancestral lands covered by the protection of the law.<br><br>In his Decision, the Regional Adjudicator himself found that there was no tenancy relationship between petitioner and respondents, to wit:<br><br>[Herein petitioner] pleaded for his defense to the claims of [herein respondents] right of redemption contending that the [respondents] have not proven any tenurial relationship with him.  <b>Indeed, the records show that herein [respondents] have not proven their tenurial relationship with [petitioner]</b>, hence Section 12 of Republic Act No. 3844, as amended, does not apply to the said claim of right of redemption.<br><br>As to the claim of [respondents], that is, for "disturbance compensation" under Section 36(1) of Republic Act No. 3844, said provision of law to the opinion of the Board through this Adjudicator, cannot apply in the said claim <b>since [respondents] have not also proven tenancy-relationship</b> which is a requirement to be entitled to "disturbance compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Under law and settled jurisprudence, and based on the records of this case, the Regional Adjudicator evidently has no jurisdiction to hear and resolve respondents' complaint.  In the absence of a tenancy relationship, the case falls outside the jurisdiction of the DARAB; it is cognizable by the Regular Courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Regional Adjudicator in his Decision dated 16 August 1999 found that:<br><blockquote>The third claim of herein Petitioners as prayed for is their right to "ancestral lands" under Section 9 of Republic Act No. 6657 which provides as follows:<br><br>SECTION 9.  ANCESTRAL LANDS. - For purposes of this act, ancestral lands of each indigenous cultural community shall include but not limited to lands in the actual, continuous and open possession and occupation of the community and its members: Provided, that the Torrens System shall be respected.<br><br>The rights of these communities of their ancestral land shall be protected to insure their economic, social and cultural well-being.

However, a special law, Republic Act No. 8371, otherwise known as the Indigenous People's Rights Act of 1997, specifically governs the rights of indigenous people to their ancestral domains and lands.<br><br>Section 3(a) and (b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of Republic Act No. 8371 provides a more thorough definition of ancestral domains and ancestral lands:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3.  <i>Definition of Terms</i>. - For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean:<br><br>a) <i>Ancestral Domains </i>- Subject to Section 56 hereof, refers to all areas generally belonging to ICCs/IPs comprising lands, inland waters, coastal areas, and natural resources therein, held under a claim of ownership, occupied or possessed by ICCs/IPs, by themselves or through their ancestors, communally or individually since time immemorial, continuously to the present except when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth or as a consequence of government projects or any other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals/corporations, and which are necessary to ensure their economic, social and cultural welfare.  It shall include ancestral lands, forests, pasture, residential, agricultural, and other lands individually owned whether alienable and disposable or otherwise, hunting grounds, burial grounds, worship areas, bodies of water, mineral and other natural resources, and lands which may no longer be exclusively occupied by ICCs/IPs but from which they traditionally had access to for their subsistence and traditional activities, particularly the home ranges of ICCs/IPs who are still nomadic and/or shifting cultivators;<br><br>b) <i>Ancestral Lands </i>- Subject to Section 56 hereof, refers to lands occupied, possessed and utilized by individuals, families and clans who are members of the ICCs/IPs since time immemorial, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, under claims of individual or traditional group ownership, continuously, to the present except when interrupted by war, force majeure or displacement by force, deceit, stealth, or as a consequence of government projects and other voluntary dealings entered into by government and private individuals/corporations, including, but not limited to, residential lots, rice terraces or paddies, private forests, swidden farms and tree lots.<br></blockquote>Republic Act No. 8371 creates the National Commission on Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous People (NCIP) which shall be the <b>primary government agency</b> responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the indigenous cultural communities/indigenous people (ICCs/IPs) and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Prior to Republic Act No. 8371, ancestral domains and lands were delineated under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and governed by DENR Administrative Order No. 2, series of 1993.
