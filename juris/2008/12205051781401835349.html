David, et al., however, claimed that the 600,000 LLDC stocks were issued in favor of the Lu Ym father and sons for less than their real values. Hence, the complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> filed on August 14, 2000, by David, Rosa Go (Rosa), Silvano Ludo (Silvano) and CL Corporation (CL Corp.) against the Lu Ym father and sons, namely: Paterno Sr., Paterno Jr., Victor Lu Ym (Victor), John, Kelly, and LLDC, for <i>Declaration of Nullity of Share Issue, Receivership and Dissolution</i>, before the RTC of Cebu City.&nbsp; The case was raffled to Branch 5 and was docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-25502.&nbsp;&nbsp; In said complaint, David, et al. asked that the issuance of said shares be nullified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; They further asserted that the Lu Ym father and sons gravely abused their powers as members of LLDC's Board of Directors by issuing such shares, to the prejudice of David, et al. They, therefore, asked for the dissolution of the corporation as their ultimate remedy to obtain redress for their grievances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; To protect the interest of the corporation during the pendency of the case, David et al. asked that a receiver for the corporation be appointed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On August 25, 2000, the Lu Ym father and sons moved to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the complaint for non-compliance with the Rules of Court on the required&nbsp; certificate of non-forum shopping, since only one of the four plaintiffs signed the same, without any showing that he was authorized to sign on behalf of the other parties.&nbsp; They, likewise, contended that the case was dismissible because they did not exert earnest efforts toward a compromise.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated December 4, 2000, the court denied the motion solely on the ground that the case was exempt from the observance of the <i>Katarungang Pambarangay Law</i>.&nbsp; In another Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 2, 2001, the court held that the signature of only one of the plaintiffs was a substantial compliance with the rules on the certificate of non-forum shopping.<br><br>On February 16, 2001, the court, on motion of David, et al., placed LLDC under receivership <i>pendente lite</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the court appointed Atty.

Ombudsman</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; As a consequence of the dismissal of the complaint, the appellate court likewise annulled the resolutions placing the corporation under receivership and appointing the receivers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On May 28, 2002, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> filed by David Lu, et al.&nbsp; Hence, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> before this Court filed by David Lu alone in <b>G.R. No. 153690</b>.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Lu Ym father and sons filed a Motion for Inhibition against the then RTC Judge Ireneo Gako, Jr., which was granted on October 1, 2002. Thus, the case was re-raffled to Branch 11, presided by Judge Isaias Dicdican, who directed the parties to amend their respective pleadings in order to conform with the requirements laid down in Sections 4(2) and 6(7), Rule 2 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8799.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; The case was re-docketed as SRC Case No. 021-CEB.<br><br>On October 8, 2002, the Lu Ym father and sons filed in SRC Case No. 021-CEB a Manifestation and Motion praying for the immediate lifting of the receivership order over LLDC which was immediately set for hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; However, the hearing did not proceed as scheduled due to the repeated motions of David to stop it.&nbsp; It turned out later that David instituted a special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with the CA, with Urgent Application for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction, on the sole issue of whether or not the RTC should proceed to hear the Lu Ym father and sons' motion to lift the receivership.&nbsp; The case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R.

No. 153690 </b>before this Court necessitated the deferment of any action on the lifting of receivership.<br><br>Aggrieved, the Lu Ym father and sons instituted the instant petition in <b>G.R.

After a series of letters sent to the OCA, the latter informed John that the matter of docket fees should be brought to the attention of the regular courts and not to the OCA which was not in the position to give an opinion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On March 1, 2004, the RTC rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> on the merits of the case, annulling the issuance of LLDC's 600,000 shares of stocks thereby divesting the Lu Ym father and sons of their shares and canceling their certificates of stocks. The court further ordered the dissolution of LLDC and the liquidation of its assets.&nbsp; Consequently, a management committee was created to take over LLDC, and the corporation's officers were stripped of their powers as such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The court further declared that the decision was "immediately executory."&nbsp; Aggrieved, the Lu Ym father and sons seasonably filed a Notice of Appeal.&nbsp; The case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. CV No. 81163</b>.<br><br>In view of the court's declaration of the executory nature of the assailed decision, the Lu Ym father and sons applied for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order (TRO),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which was opposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> by David.<br><br>On January 28, 2004, the appellate court issued a TRO valid for a period of sixty (60) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; However, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated September 6, 2004, the court denied the application for a writ of preliminary injunction.

No. 153690, David claims that the Lu Ym father and sons' petition (in CA-G.R. SP No. 64523) before the CA should not have been entertained because of the following fatal defects: 1) the petition questioning the approval of the receivership was prematurely filed because of the pendency of their motion for reconsideration before the RTC; 2) their motion and supplement were filed without asking leave of court to do so; 3) considering that the motion and supplement contained new allegations, there was a failure to attach a new certificate of non-forum shopping; and 4) the motion and supplement were filed out of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>At the outset, we find the procedural issues raised by David to be of no moment. Basic is the rule that a motion for the reconsideration of an assailed order may be filed by an aggrieved party within the reglementary period.&nbsp; No motion for leave to file such motion is required under the Rules or in any other circular of the Supreme Court.&nbsp; As long as the same is filed within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the assailed order, there is no reason for the courts not to entertain it.&nbsp; In fact, in some exceptional cases as when substantial justice so requires, a motion belatedly filed may still be taken cognizance of. As to the supplemental petition filed without leave of court, suffice it to state that the CA entertained the same, required David to comment thereon, and decided the case on the basis thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such actions of the appellate court adequately show that the supplemental petition was admitted.&nbsp; Lastly, as to the lack of certificate of non-forum shopping in the motion for reconsideration and supplement to the petition, we need only reiterate that the certificate is required only in cases of initiatory pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Now on the substantial issues.<br><br>In G.R. No. 153690, the assailed CA decision dismissed David et al.'s original complaint for their failure to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequent to the aforesaid decision, however, the RTC ordered David et al. to amend the complaint to conform to the interim rules of procedure for intra-corporate controversy.&nbsp; In compliance with the order, David, et al. amended the complaint and filed the same with leave of court.&nbsp; The RTC, thereafter, admitted the amended complaint, proceeded to hear the case, and decided the same on the merits.<br><br>While it is true that the Lu Ym father and sons questioned the admission of the aforesaid amended complaint before this Court, the same was done only through an Urgent Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Under the Rules of Court, the proper mode to challenge such an order, which undoubtedly is interlocutory, is through a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65.&nbsp; This procedural defect, therefore, bars the Court from ruling on the propriety of such admission.&nbsp; We cannot take cognizance of proceedings before the RTC unless they are brought before us through the proper mode of review.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure, the Urgent Motion cannot be a substitute for the remedy of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the amended complaint admitted by the RTC stands.<br><br>With the issue of admission of the amended complaint resolved, the question of whether or not the original complaint should have been dismissed was mooted. Section 8, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court specifically provides that <b><i>an amended pleading supersedes the pleading that it amends</i></b><i>.</i> In this case, the original complaint was deemed withdrawn from the records upon the admission of the amended complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53] </sup>This conclusion becomes even more pronounced in that the RTC already rendered a decision on the merits of the said amended complaint, not to mention the Lu Ym father and sons' concurrence in the mootness of the issue in the instant petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>It is settled that courts do not entertain a moot question.&nbsp; An issue becomes moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy, so that a declaration on the issue would be of no practical use or value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; This Court, therefore, abstains from expressing its opinion in a case where no legal relief is needed or called for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In G.R. No. 157381, the Lu Ym father and sons insist that the CA had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary injunction, more so, to make the same permanent, in view of the pendency of G.R. No. 153690.&nbsp; They argue that the application for a writ should have been filed before this Court and not through a separate special civil action before the CA. They further assert that the CA should not have issued a writ as there was no finding of grave abuse of discretion, to begin with.&nbsp; Lastly, they argue that the order of the trial court requiring the parties to amend their pleadings did not bar the RTC from acting on the provisional remedy of receivership.&nbsp; Since this Court did not issue a restraining order, the receivership proceedings could still proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It is noteworthy at this point to reiterate the factual circumstances surrounding the instant petition.&nbsp; G.R. No. 157381 has its origin in the Lu Ym father and sons' motion to lift the receivership over LLDC.&nbsp;&nbsp; David, for his part, went up to the CA and asked that the RTC be enjoined from hearing said motion pending resolution of his petition before this Court in G.R. No. 153690 and the amendment of his complaint as ordered by the RTC.&nbsp; David's petition was granted by the appellate court in the assailed decision.&nbsp; It ratiocinated that any matter, principal or collateral, should be held in abeyance pending the amendment of the original complaint.&nbsp; Besides, said the appellate court, the dismissal of the original complaint on which the Lu Ym father and sons based their motion to lift receivership was still the subject of an appeal before this Court.<br><br>Again, the propriety of such injunction is mooted by the amendment of the complaint, and the RTC decision in the case on the merits thereof.&nbsp; The appellate court ordered that the hearing on the motion to lift the receivership be held in abeyance primarily because the original complaint was yet to be amended.&nbsp; Upon the amendment of the complaint and the admission thereof by the RTC, the reason for such injunction ceased to exist.&nbsp; Thus, the CA could resolve, as it in fact resolved, the question of whether or not the receivership should be lifted.<br><br>The RTC decision on the merits of the case gives this Court more reasons to declare the mootness of the instant petition.&nbsp; It must be recalled that the motion to lift the receivership was filed before the RTC ancillary to the principal action, and what was sought to be enjoined was the hearing on that particular motion.&nbsp; With the decision on the merits rendered by the RTC, <i>albeit </i>still on appeal, there is nothing more to be enjoined.&nbsp; More importantly, the RTC ordered that the receivers cease from performing their functions and that a management committee be created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, these supervening events mooted the petition.&nbsp; Time and again, we have declared that a petition should be denied for the sole reason that the act sought to be enjoined is already <i>fait accompli</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, the trial court's decision on the merits rendered the issue on the propriety of the injunction moot and academic, notwithstanding the fact that said decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Courts are called upon to resolve actual cases and controversies, not to render advisory opinions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It is true that we have held in a number of cases that the moot and academic principle is not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the courts from resolving a case.&nbsp; Courts will still decide cases otherwise, moot and academic if:&nbsp; first, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; second, the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; third, when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and, fourth, the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; However, not one of the enumerated exceptions obtains in the instant case.&nbsp; Thus, a denial of the instant petition is warranted.<br><br>In G.R. No. 170889, John Lu Ym and LLDC explain that while it may be possible to raise the issue of docket fees in their appellants' brief as suggested by the CA, it would already be too late because the issue would be rendered moot and academic by the dissolution of the corporation.&nbsp; They further question the propriety of the creation of the management committee, arguing that there was non-observance of substantive and procedural rules.&nbsp; As to the issue of estoppel, they claim that they first raised the issue of docket fees only in their motion for reconsideration before the CA because they had yet to await the OCA's response to their inquiry on the correct docket fees. Lastly, they argue that David et al. are now precluded from paying the correct docket fees by the lapse of the prescriptive period.&nbsp; Neither can a lien be created on the judgment in lieu of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In short, John and LLDC seek the dismissal of the initial complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction occasioned by the insufficient payment of docket fees.<br><br>A court acquires jurisdiction over a case only upon the payment of the prescribed fees.&nbsp; The importance of filing fees cannot be gainsaid for these are intended to take care of court expenses in the handling of cases in terms of costs of supplies, use of equipment, salaries and fringe benefits of personnel, and others, computed as to man-hours used in the handling of each case.&nbsp; Hence, the non-payment or insufficient payment of docket fees can entail tremendous losses to the government in general and to the judiciary in particular.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, however, we cannot grant the dismissal prayed for&nbsp; because of the following reasons:&nbsp; <i>First</i>, the case instituted before the RTC is one incapable of pecuniary estimation.&nbsp; Hence, the correct docket fees were paid.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, John and LLDC are estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the trial court because of their active participation in the proceedings below, and because the issue of payment of insufficient docket fees had been belatedly raised before the Court of Appeals, <i>i.e</i>., only in their motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; <i>Lastly</i>, assuming that the docket fees paid were truly inadequate, the mistake was committed by the Clerk of Court who assessed the same and not imputable to David; and as to the deficiency, if any, the same may instead be considered a lien on the judgment that may thereafter be rendered.<br><br>The Court had, in the past, laid down the test in determining whether the subject matter of an action is incapable of pecuniary estimation by ascertaining the nature of the principal action or remedy sought. If the action is primarily for recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation. However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, the money claim being only incidental to or merely a consequence of, the principal relief sought, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In the current controversy, the main purpose of the complaint filed before the RTC was the annulment of the issuance of the 600,000 LLDC shares of stocks because they had been allegedly issued for less than their par value.&nbsp; Thus, David sought the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of receivers/management committee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; To be sure, the annulment of the shares, the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of receivers/management committee are actions which do not consist in the recovery of a sum of money.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in the end, a sum of money or real property would be recovered, it would simply be the consequence of such principal action. Therefore, the case before the RTC was <b><i>incapable of pecuniary estimation</i></b>.&nbsp; Accordingly, John's and LLDC's contention cannot be sustained.&nbsp; And since David paid the docket fees for an action the subject of which was incapable of pecuniary estimation, as computed by the Clerk of Court, the trial court validly acquired jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>Even assuming that the subject in the instant case is capable of pecuniary estimation, still, the case should not be dismissed because the insufficiency of the fees actually paid was belatedly raised; David relied on the assessment made by the Clerk of Court; and if there is a deficiency, it may instead be considered a lien on the judgment that may hereafter be rendered.<br><br>We note that the Lu Ym father and sons belatedly raised the issue of insufficient payment of docket fees in their motion for reconsideration before the CA. A perusal of the records reveals that the Lu Ym father and sons filed several pleadings before the RTC, specifically, a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Lift the Appointment of a Receiver, among others.&nbsp; They, likewise, filed several pleadings before the Court of Appeals and before this Court either as initiatory pleadings or in opposition to those filed by the adverse party.&nbsp; Considering their prompt action and reaction to ensure that their rights are protected, their belated objection to the payment of docket fees is, therefore, inexcusable. Well-established is the rule that after vigorously participating in all stages of the case before the trial court and even invoking the trial court's authority in order to ask for affirmative relief, John and LLDC are barred by estoppel from challenging the trial court's jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; If a party invokes the jurisdiction of a court, he cannot thereafter challenge the court's jurisdiction in the same case.&nbsp; To rule otherwise would amount to speculating on the fortune of litigation, which is against the policy of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, even if, indeed, the docket fees paid were inadequate, this allegation having been raised for the first time on appeal, should be disallowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>While it is true that this Court had previously dismissed complaints for non-payment of docket fees, as in the early case of <i>Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> these cases uniformly involved bad faith on the part of the plaintiff, such that the correct amount of damages claimed was not specifically stated.&nbsp; The Court, in such cases, concluded that there was bad faith on the part of the complainant and a clear intent to avoid payment of the required docket fee, thus, the dismissal of the cases was warranted.<br><br>It may be recalled that despite the payment of insufficient fees, this Court refrained from dismissing the complaint/petition in <i>Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC-13) v. Alonzo-Legasto,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> <i>Yambao v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and <i>Ayala Land, Inc. v.

Thus, when insufficient filing fees were initially paid by the respondent, and there was no intention to defraud the government, the <i>Manchester</i><i> </i>rule does not apply.&nbsp; In <i>Yambao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court concluded that petitioners cannot be faulted for their failure to pay the required docket fees for, given the prevailing circumstances, such failure was clearly not a dilatory tactic or intended to circumvent the Rules of Court.&nbsp; In <i>Ayala</i><i> </i><i>Land</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the Court held that despite the jurisdictional nature of the rule on payment of docket fees, the appellate court still has the discretion to relax the rule in meritorious cases.<br><br>In the instant case, David paid the docket fees as assessed by the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; Even if the amount was insufficient, as claimed by John and LLDC, fraud and bad faith cannot be attributed to David to warrant the dismissal of his complaint.&nbsp; Consistent with the principle of liberality in the interpretation of the Rules, in the interest of substantial justice, this Court had repeatedly refrained from dismissing the case on that ground alone.&nbsp; Instead, it considered the deficiency in the payment of the docket fees as a lien on the judgment which must be remitted to the Clerk of Court of the court <i>a quo</i> upon the execution of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Lastly, we now resolve the issue of whether or not the CA abused its discretion in denying the Lu Ym father and sons' application for a writ of preliminary injunction.&nbsp; Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court sets forth the requisites for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, thus:&nbsp;<blockquote><table ¬†="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In the instant case, John and LLDC failed to satisfy the above requisites.&nbsp; Except for their claim of nullity of the RTC decision because of insufficient payment of docket fees, no evidence was offered to establish the existence of a clear and unmistakable right on their part that must be protected, as well as the serious damage or irreparable loss that they would suffer if the writ is not granted.<br><br>It has been consistently held that there is no power, the exercise of which is more delicate, which requires greater caution, deliberation and sound discretion, or more dangerous in a doubtful case than the issuance of an injunction.&nbsp; It is the strong arm of equity that should never be extended unless to cases of great injury, where courts of law cannot afford an adequate or commensurate remedy in damages.&nbsp; Every court should remember that an injunction is a limitation upon the freedom of action of the defendant and should not be granted lightly or precipitately. It should be granted only when the court is fully satisfied that the law permits it and the emergency demands it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Clearly then, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the Court of Appeals in denying the Lu Ym father and sons' application for a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>One final note.&nbsp; We observe that these consolidated cases involve interlocutory orders of the RTC.&nbsp; The delay in the disposition of the main case, which is now pending appeal before the CA, was occasioned by the actions of all the contending parties in seeking affirmative relief before the Court of Appeals and before this Court.&nbsp; Our disposition of these three petitions should now pave the way for the final resolution of the corporate dispute which started as early as 2000.<br><br>In view of the above disquisitions, we deem it proper to lift the <i>status quo </i>order which this Court issued on January 23, 2006.
