The appellants, Quirino Adolfo (<i>Quirino</i>), Ricardo Abaya (<i>Ricardo</i>), Crisanta Ancheta (<i>Crisanta</i>), and John Baquilat (<i>Baquilat</i>) took the witness stand for the defense.<br><br><i>Evidence for the Prosecution</i><br><br><b>Engr. Ramos</b> testified that he was designated as acting municipal engineer of Castillejos, Zambales by Pantaleon in January 1998; and that he prepared three (3) programs of work upon the instructions of Vallejos. The first two (2) programs of work, dated January 5, 1998 and January 14, 1998, respectively, were for the upgrading of <i>barangay</i> roads; the third, also dated January 5, 1998, was for the construction of market stalls. He confirmed that the three (3) signatures affixed in these programs of work belonged to him, to Pantaleon, and to Vallejos, respectively; and declared that he never implemented any of these projects. He later discovered that these projects had already been implemented by the previous municipal engineer; hence, the programs of work and subsequent disbursements were not really needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, he stated that he was asked to prepare the programs of work in March 1998; that he submitted the programs upon completion to Vallejos who told him that he (Vallejos) would give them to Pantaleon for approval. He assumed the programs of work were disapproved because nobody coordinated with him regarding their implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On re-direct examination, Engr.

He declared that no market stall was constructed in the public market in 1998 and 1999, and no upgrading, excavation, and back filling of any <i>barangay </i>road likewise took place in 1998 in Castillejos. He added that no infrastructure project could have been made in January 1998 because it was an election period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Aurelio declared that he, together with other <i>Sanggunian</i> members, examined the disbursement vouchers and other documents related to the projects covered by the program of works after they learned that disbursements were made to La Paz Construction; that they (<i>Sanggunian</i> members) filed a case before the Provincial Prosecutor of Olongapo City after discovering that the purported transactions were anomalous. He stated that La Paz Construction never entered into a contract with the Municipality of Castillejos as confirmed by its proprietor, Ken Swan Lee Tiu.&nbsp; He added that the projects covered by the disbursement vouchers were not among those included in the approved development plan for the years 1996 to 1998; and that, surprisingly, the disbursement vouchers indicated that the funds used to cover these projects were charged from the 20% development fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>Nida</b>, the senior bookkeeper of Castillejos, testified that Pantaleon designated her as municipal accountant in 1993, and that she occupied the position until July 1998; as a municipal accountant, she reviewed documents for the preparation of vouchers.

He stated that he did not know if there were projects implemented in the various <i>barangays</i> of Castillejos because he was not yet the municipal engineer when these projects were planned. He likewise maintained that he never implemented these projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>Simeon</b>, the Municipal Planning Coordinator of Castillejos, testified that he prepared comprehensive plans and programs for the municipality, and that his tasks also included the formulation, integration and coordination of different municipal projects. He stated that he prepared the municipal development plans for the fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and these plans were approved by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i>. He clarified that the municipal engineer can implement projects that are not included in the municipal development plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b> Ken Swan Tiu </b>(also known as<b> Sonny Tiu, Tiu Ken Swan </b>and<b> Ken Swan Lee Tiu</b>), owner of the La Paz Construction, admitted that he executed an affidavit dated January 14, 1999 stating that he did not enter into any negotiated contract with the Municipality of Castillejos, and that his company never received any payment from the municipality. He stated that the signatures in the vouchers were not his, and reiterated that he did not have any transaction with the Municipality of Castillejos.

He confirmed that he is the last person to sign the voucher.<br><br>He clarified that after his office has prepared checks based on the forwarded vouchers, these vouchers are returned to the accounting office for the creation of an accounting entry and for the posting of the entry in the general and subsidiary ledgers.

He stated that the signature of the accountant did not appear in the three (3) vouchers because Nida simply refused to sign it. He also insisted that the budget officer's signature likewise did not appear in the vouchers because she was always out of her office. He explained that he paid the vouchers despite the absence of the accountant's signature because the projects were already completed and the sub-contractor was already demanding payment and was threatening to sue him if he would not pay.<br><br>He further recalled that the vouchers were suspended after they were submitted to the Commission on Audit (<i>COA</i>); he was given 90 days to complete the entries in the vouchers and produce the supporting papers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, he reiterated that he signed the vouchers because the municipal accountant and budget officer refused, without any valid or legal reason, to sign them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b>Quirino</b>, the <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Nagbayan, Castillejos, Zambales, testified that he supervised numerous projects in his <i>barangay</i> during the incumbency of Pantaleon; that from January to February of 1998, he supervised the back filling and leveling of the roads in his <i>barangay</i> together with a certain Eduardo Escobar and <i>Kagawads</i> Lorenzo and Corpuz. He admitted to signing an affidavit dated July 2, 1999 stating that there were projects done in his <i>barangay</i>; he merely signed the certification on December 10, 1998 (stating that there were no projects done by the administration of Pantaleon in his area) because <i>Kagawads</i> Enrique Clarin and Reynaldo Misa were his <i>compadres</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>Ricardo</b> declared on the witness stand that he was the <i>barangay</i> captain of Nagbayan from 1971 to 1986 and subsequently served as councilor for three (3) terms; that from 1996 to 1998, he saw that there were back filling, grading, compacting and widening of roads in his area; and that it was Pantaleon and Baquilat - as mayor and contractor, respectively - who caused the repair of these roads.<br><br>On cross-examination, he admitted that Pantaleon employed him as a casual employee in 1999 and, as such, had no authority to sign vouchers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>Pantaleon, </b>mayor of Castillejos, Zambales, testified that he had served as mayor for eight and a half years before he was preventively suspended. He explained that a voucher originates from the accounting office and then goes to the budget office; from there, it goes to him for his signature, and, finally, to the treasurer for signature; he signed the vouchers and allowed the treasurer to pay the amounts stated because the accountant and the budget officer were reluctant to sign; the signatures of the accountant and budget officer were not important. He added that he approved the release of the money because the treasurer told him that there was an appropriation in the approved annual budget. He also insisted that the owner of La Paz Construction entered into a contact with the municipality.<br><br>He maintained that he physically inspected the projects, and ordered the treasurer to pay because the project in Nagbayan road had been&nbsp; completed.&nbsp; He revealed that he received a notice from the Provincial Auditor stating that the disbursement of funds was irregular due to the lack of signatures of the accountant and budget officer, and that the vouchers were subsequently suspended.&nbsp; He then ordered the treasurer to rectify the deficiencies in the vouchers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, he admitted that the <i>Sanggunian</i> did not adopt a resolution authorizing him to enter into a negotiated contract with La Paz Construction in the municipality's behalf.&nbsp; He also stated that the treasurer told him that the municipal accountant and budget officer asked for a commission before signing the vouchers, but he did not confront them about the demanded commission because he did not want to embarrass them. He admitted that he signed the vouchers despite the absence of the signatures of the accountant and budget officer.<br><br>He also admitted that he entered into a contract with Baquilat without inquiring if Baquilat was authorized by the La Paz Construction to enter into a contract with the municipality. He explained that he gave more importance to the implementation of a project than to its documentation.&nbsp; Since the compacting and leveling of the road were finished, he believed the municipal accountant and budget officer would later sign the vouchers.<br><br>He confirmed that Baquilat had dealt with the municipality many times as the representative of La Paz Construction, and he does not know why La Paz Construction would now deny its link with Baquilat.

These projects included the upgrading of the roads in <i>Barangays </i>Looc, Casagatan, Nagbayan, and San Pablo, as well as the repair of market stalls in Castillejos. He stated that the authority given to him by Sonny Tiu, the owner of La Paz Construction, to receive the money in behalf of La Paz Constructionwas merely verbal; contractors, as a usual practice, rely on verbal authority. He added that his license as a contractor had been used many times by other contractors even without his knowledge, and revealed that he had borrowed the license of Sonny Tiu when he had a contract with the Municipality of Castillejos.&nbsp; He acted as a subcontractor for the La Paz Construction, but failed to fully perform his duty as subcontractor because he did not see Sonny Tiu again.

These irregularities were aptly summarized by the Sandiganbayan as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>All of the three disbursement vouchers were not signed by her;<br><br></li><li>As to the Disbursement Voucher No. 1019802-328, the box in which she did not sign as municipal accountant, now bears the signature of Martin Pagaduan without her authority, after the voucher was disallowed and returned by the Commission on Audit; Pagaduan was not yet the Municipal Accountant as he was appointed only on January 1, 1999;<br><br></li><li>Required documents - authority to enter into negotiated contract, plans and specifications, abstract of bids, notarized contracts - were not attached to the voucher;<br><br></li><li>Voucher number and accounting entries were written by accused Treasurer Vallejos, not the then municipal accountant (Nida Naman);<br><br></li><li>Also signed by Martin Pagaduan without her authority as municipal treasurer are the three purported Certificate of Canvass attached to the Disbursement Voucher No. 101-9803-328;<br><br></li><li>Official Receipt No. 000989 that appears to have been signed by John Baquilat to acknowledge receipt of the amount covered by check no. 108952 indicated in Disbursement Voucher No. 101-9803-349 is not filled up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Through the appellant's explicit admissions, the witnesses' testimonies, and the documentary evidence submitted, the prosecution duly established the fourth element of the crime of malversation. It is settled that a public officer is liable for malversation even if he does not use public property or funds under his custody for his personal benefit, <b>if he allows another to take the funds, or through abandonment or negligence, allow such taking.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The felony may be committed, not only through the misappropriation or the conversion of public funds or property to one's personal use, but also <b>by knowingly allowing others to make use of or misappropriate the funds.</b> The felony may thus be committed by <i>dolo or by culpa</i>. The crime is consummated and the appropriate penalty is imposed regardless of whether the mode of commission is with intent or due to negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><u><b>Falsification was a necessary means<br>to commit the crime of malversation</b></u><br><br>Article 171, paragraphs (2) and (5) of the Revised Penal Code, provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 171. <i>Falsification by public</i> <i>officer, employee or notary</i> or <i>ecclesiastic minister</i>. - The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><ol start="2"><li>Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;<br></li></ol>x x x<br><ol start="5"><li>Altering true dates;<br></li></ol>x x x<br></blockquote>Falsification under paragraph 2 is committed when (a) the offender causes it to appear in a document that a person or persons participated in an act or a proceeding; and (b) that such person or persons did not in fact so participate in the act or proceeding.&nbsp; In the present case, both testimonial and documentary evidence showed that Vallejos filled up the spaces for the voucher number and the accounting entry of Disbursement Voucher Nos. 101-9803-328, 101-9803-349 and 10-9804-415. These items were required to be filled up by Nida as the municipal accountant. Thus, Vallejos made it appear that the municipal accountant participated in signing the disbursement vouchers.<br><br>The appellants were likewise guilty of falsification under paragraph 5 of Article 171. Engr. Ramos testified that Pantaleon and Vallejos instructed him to place the dates January 5, 1998 on the first and third programs of work, and January 14, 1998 on the second program of work, although he prepared the programs only in March 1998. Thereafter, the appellants affixed their signatures on these programs of work. The projects covered by these programs of work served as basis for the issuance of the disbursement vouchers.<br><br><u><b>The presence of conspiracy</b></u><br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.&nbsp; Conspiracy does not need to be proven by direct evidence and may be inferred from the conduct - before, during, and after the commission of the crime - indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action and concurrence of sentiments.&nbsp; In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.&nbsp; Conspiracy is present when one concurs with the criminal design of another, as shown by an overt act leading to the crime committed. It may be deduced from the mode and manner of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The burden of proving the allegation of conspiracy rests on the prosecution, but settled jurisprudence holds that conspiracy may be proven other than by direct evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Pagalasan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court expounded on why <b>direct proof of prior agreement is not necessary</b>:<br><blockquote>After all, secrecy and concealment are essential features of a successful conspiracy. Conspiracies are clandestine in nature.&nbsp; It may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, showing that they had acted with a common purpose and design.&nbsp; Conspiracy may be implied if it is proved that two or more persons aimed their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent of each other, were in fact, connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment.&nbsp; To hold an accused guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity.&nbsp; There must be intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution's evidence glaringly shows how the appellants acted in concert to facilitate the illegal release of public funds. <i>First</i>, the appellants ordered the preparation of the programs of work, with specific instructions to antedate the submitted programs.&nbsp; <i>Second,</i> they affixed their signatures on the antedated programs of work. <i>Third,</i> the appellants signed the disbursement vouchers covering the simulated projects despite knowledge of the absence of the signatures of the local budget officer and the local accountant. Vallejos even filled up entries in the vouchers that were for the municipal treasurer to fill up. <i>Finally</i>, the appellants affixed their signatures in the following documents attached to the three (3) disbursement vouchers:<br><blockquote><i>Supporting documents attached to Disbursement Voucher Nos. 101-9803-328</i><br><ol type="a"><li>Purchase Request (<i>Exh. "A-3"</i>);<br></li><li>Three Certificates of Canvass (<i>Exh. "A-4 to A-6"</i>);<br></li><li>Purchase Order showing La Paz Construction as the winning bidder/contractor (<i>Exh. "A-7"</i>);<br></li><li>Certificate of Acceptance with regard to the services rendered by La Paz Construction (<i>Exh. "A-8"</i>); and<br></li><li>Request for Obligation Allotment with La Paz Construction as payee (<i>Exh. "A-9"</i>).<br></li></ol><i>Supporting documents attached to Disbursement Voucher Nos. 101-9803-349</i><br><ol type="a"><li>Purchase Request (<i>Exh. "B-6"</i>);<br>. Purchase Order showing La Paz Construction as the contractor (<i>Exh. "B-7"</i>);<br>. Request for Obligation Allotment with La Paz Construction as payee (<i>Exh. "B-9"</i>); and<br>. Certificate of Acceptance with regard to the services rendered by La Paz Construction (<i>Exh. "B-8"</i>).<br></li></ol><i>Supporting documents attached to Disbursement Voucher Nos. 101-9804-415</i><br><ol type="a"><li>Request for Obligation Allotment with La Paz Construction as payee (<i>Exh. "C-8"</i>);<br></li><li>Three Certificates of Canvass (<i>Exh. "C-4 to C-5"</i>);<br></li><li>Purchase Order showing La Paz Construction as the contractor (<i>Exh.

"C-7"</i>).<br></li></ol></blockquote>The appellants' combined acts therefore indubitably point to their joint purpose and design. Their concerted actions clearly showed that conspiracy existed in their illegal release of public funds.<br><br><u><b>The appellant's defenses</b></u><br><br>Vallejos' contention that the Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over him because he only occupies a Salary Grade (<i>SG</i>) 24 position cannot shield him from the Sandiganbayan's reach. The critical factor in determining the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction is the position of his co-accused, the municipal mayor, who occupies an SG 27 position.&nbsp; Under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 8249,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> if the position of one or more of the accused is classified as SG 27, the Sandiganbayan has original and exclusive jurisdiction over the offense.<br><br>Our ruling in <i>Esquivel v. Ombudsman<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></b></i> on this point is particularly instructive:<br><blockquote>In <i>Rodrigo, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, <i>Binay vs. Sandiganbayan, </i>and <i>Layus vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, we already held that municipal mayors fall under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Nor can <i>Barangay </i>Captain Mark Anthony Esquivel claim that since he is not a municipal mayor, he is outside the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction. R.A. 7975, as amended by R.A. No. 8249 provides that it is only in cases where "none of the accused are occupying positions corresponding to salary grade `27' or higher" that "exclusive original jurisdiction shall be vested in the proper regional trial court, metropolitan trial court, municipal trial court, and municipal circuit court, as the case may be, pursuant to their respective jurisdictions as provided in Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended." Note that under the 1991 Local Government Code, Mayor Esquivel has a salary grade of 27. Since <i>Barangay </i>Captain Esquivel is the co-accused in Criminal Case No. 24777 of Mayor Esquivel, whose position falls under salary grade 27, the Sandiganbayan committed no grave abuse of discretion in assuming jurisdiction over said criminal case, as well as over Criminal Case No. 24778, involving both of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> [<i>Underscoring and italics in the original</i>]<br></blockquote>Vallejos' claim that it was his ministerial function to sign the disbursement vouchers also lacks merit. Article 344 R.A. No. 7160 reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 344. <i>Certification and Approval of Vouchers</i>. - <b>No money shall be disbursed unless the local budget officer certifies to the existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the purpose, the local accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds for the purpose.</b>&nbsp; Vouchers and payrolls shall be certified to and approved by the head of the department or office who has administrative control of the fund concerned, as to validity, propriety, and legality of the claim involved.<i> </i> Except in cases of disbursements involving regularly recurring administrative expenses such as payrolls for regular or permanent employees, expenses for light, water, telephone and telegraph services, remittances to government creditor agencies such as GSIS, SSS, LDP, DBP, National Printing Office, Procurement Service of the DBM and others, approval of the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Thus, as a safeguard against unwarranted disbursements, certifications are required from: (a) the local budget officer as to the existence and validity of the appropriation; (b) the local accountant as to the legal obligation incurred by the appropriation; (c) the local treasurer as to the availability of funds; and (d) the local department head as to the validity, propriety and legality of the claim against the appropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Therefore, Vallejos, as municipal treasurer, could not authorize the release of the funds without the requisite signatures of the municipal budget officer and the municipal accountant.<br><br>Vallejos also harps on the fact that the Provincial Auditor of Zambales did not issue a notice to restitute the funds. We find this contention misleading. Pantaleon testified that the Provincial Auditor issued a notice stating that the disbursement of the public funds was irregular. Thereafter, the three (3) disbursement vouchers were suspended by the COA for deficiency in their supporting papers. Under Section 15.2 of the Manual on Certificate of Settlement and Balances, "a suspension which is not settled within 90 days from receipt of the Notice of Suspension, or within such extended period as may be authorized by the auditor concerned, shall become a disallowance."<br><br>According to Pantaleon, he instructed Vallejos to rectify the deficiencies in the vouchers and its supporting documents; however, he admitted not knowing whether Vallejos complied with this instruction. Vallejos, for his part, did not testify on whether or not he corrected and completed the supporting documents. No proof exists in the record showing that the deficiencies were ever rectified.<br><br>At any rate, demand under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code merely raises a<i> prima facie </i>presumption that missing funds have been put to personal use. The demand itself, however, is not an element of the crime of malversation. Even without a demand, malversation can still be committed when, as in the present case, sufficient facts exist proving the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><u><b>The Proper Penalty</b></u><br><br>Article 217, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code imposes the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when the amount malversed is greater than P22,000.00.This Article also imposes the penalty of perpetual special disqualification and a fine equal to the amount of the funds malversed or equal to the total value of the property embezzled.&nbsp; Falsification by a public officer or employee under Article 171, on the other hand, is punished by <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not to exceed P5,000.00.<br><br>Since appellant committed a complex crime, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed in its maximum period, pursuant to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; This provision states:<br><blockquote>ART. 48. <i>Penalty for complex crimes</i>. - When a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum period.<br></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan, therefore, correctly imposed on the appellants the penalties of <b><i>reclusion perpetua</i></b> and <b>perpetual special disqualification</b> for each count of malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents, and the <b>payment of fines</b> of P166,242.72, P154,634.27, and P90,464.21, respectively, representing the amounts malversed. The Indeterminate Sentence Law finds no application since <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is an indivisible penalty to which the Indeterminate Sentence Law does not apply.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing, we <b>AFFIRM</b> the February 4, 2003 Decision of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos. 25861-63, insofar as it found appellant Jaime F. Vallejos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of the complex crime of malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents, as defined and penalized under Article 217 in relation with Articles 48 and 171 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>We make no pronouncement with respect to appellant Teofilo Pantaleon, Jr. whose withdrawal of appeal has been previously granted by this Court.<br><br>Costs against appellant Vallejos.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio-Morales, Tinga,</i> and <i>Velasco, Jr.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Rodolfo G.
