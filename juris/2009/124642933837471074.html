				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated August 19, 2004 and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated April 26, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 26235, affirming the trial court's judgment finding Edgar Esqueda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide.<br><br>Edgar Esqueda and one John Doe were charged with two (2) counts of Frustrated Murder in two (2) separate Amended Informations, which read:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 14609<br><blockquote>That on or about 11:30 o'clock in the evening of March 3, 1999, at Nagbinlod, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused together with one John Doe, conspiring, confederating and helping one another, with intent to kill, evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one VENANCIA ALISER with the use of a knife with which the said accused were then armed and provided, thereby inflicting upon the said victim multiple injuries, thus performing all the acts of execution which would have produce (sic) the crime of Murder as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrators, that is, by the timely and able medical attendance rendered to said Venancia Aliser which prevented her death.<br><br>Contrary to Article 248, in relation to Articles 6 and 5, of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 14612<br><blockquote>That on or about 11:30 o'clock in the evening of March 3, 1999, at Nagbinlod, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused together with one John Doe, conspiring, confederating and helping one another, with intent to kill, evident premeditation and treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one GAUDENCIO QUINIQUITO with the use of a knife with which the said accused were then armed and provided, thereby inflicting upon the said victim multiple injuries, thus performing all the acts of execution which would have produce (sic) the crime of Murder as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrators, that is, by the timely and able medical attendance rendered to said GAUDENCIO QUINIQUITO which prevented his death.<br><br>Contrary to Article 248, in relation to Articles 6 and 5, of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused Edgar entered a plea of not guilty.  Accused John Doe remains at-large.<br><br>During the pre-trial, the parties admitted the identities of the accused and of the private offended parties, the jurisdiction of the court and that the accused and the private offended parties were all residents of Nagbinlod, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental. Since the evidence to be presented were common to both cases, the parties through their respective counsels agreed to a joint trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The prosecution presented the testimonies of Venancia Aliser, Gaudencio Quiniquito and Dr. Fidencio G. Aurelia, hospital chief of the Bayawan District Hospital. The evidence of the prosecution tends to establish the following course of events:<br><br>Venancia Aliser (Venancia) and Gaudencio Quiniquito (Gaudencio) are live-in partners, living at <i>Sitio</i> Nagbinlod, Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental, together with their children from their first marriages.  They were already in bed when, at around 11:30 o'clock in the evening of March 3, 1999, Gaudencio was awakened by a voice coming from the outside of their house calling his live-in partner and asking for a drink.  He immediately awakened his live-in partner. While inside the house, Venancia asked the person outside to identify himself.   In response, the voice replied that he and his companions are men of Sgt. Torres conducting a roving patrol. When Venancia asked how many they were, the person replied that they are many and with them is Toto Vibar, the son of their <i>Barangay </i>Captain. Venancia directed Gaudencio to light a lamp.  After lighting the lamp, Gaudencio proceeded to open the door and went out, while Venancia tailed him and stayed by the door.   Outside, at the porch, they found a person sitting on a bamboo bench whom they could not identify, while a person whom they identified as Edgar Esqueda (petitioner herein) was standing at the side of the door leading to the porch.   Suddenly, the unidentified man stood up and stabbed Gaudencio hitting him on the chest.  When Venancia saw the stabbing, she shouted <i>"watch out Dong!"</i> and she turned her back to run away but was stabbed by petitioner.   She then fell to the ground, but petitioner continued stabbing her on different parts of her body.  Gaudencio lost his consciousness.  Their children brought them to the crossing in Nagbinlod and they were brought to the Bayawan District Hospital by a <i>barangay </i>councilman.   Dr. Patrocinio Garupa was the attending physician who treated them. The medical certificate of Gaudencio showed that he sustained a perforating stab wound at the left anterior chest, stab wounds at the neck, left arm and left part of the axillary area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Venancia's certificate showed that she suffered from multiple stab and incised wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> SPO1 Jamandron conducted his initial investigation at the hospital by interrogating Venancia and Gaudencio.  The offended parties were referred to the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital, where they were confined for more than a week.<br><br>The defense, on the other hand, presented the testimonies of   Claudio Babor, Domingo Dimol,  SPO4 Hermenegildo Cadungog, SPO1 Winefredo Jamandron, Viviana Namoco and the accused Esqueda.   The evidence of the defense was intended to establish the following:<br><br>On March 3, 1999, from 8 o'clock in the evening to 2 o'clock in the morning of March 4, 1999, petitioner was trawl-fishing in the sea of Cawitan, Sta. Catalina.  Claudio Babor testified that he was also trawl- fishing at the same time.  He and petitioner, together with their respective companions, were on different boats, which were side by side.  Both were able to catch <i>Atay-atay</i> and <i>Tulakhang.</i><br><br>Domingo Dimol was at the beach of Cawitan, Sta. Catalina.  He stayed there from 8 o'clock in the evening of March 3, 1999 until 2 o'clock in the morning of the following day waiting for petitioner and Claudio to buy fish from them.   At 2 o'clock in the morning, petitioner came ashore and Domingo bought fish from him.<br><br>Viviana was at the seashore of Cawitan, Sta. Catalina from 8 o'clock in the evening of March 3, 1999 until 2 o'clock in the morning of March 4, 1999.   She, together with twenty other persons, helped the group of petitioner in pulling the rope of the fishing net.  Petitioner was manning the rudder.  She said that there were two fishing groups.  At 2 o'clock in the morning, they all went home and petitioner gave her fish for free.<br><br>SPO1 Jamandron conducted the initial investigation in the morning of March 4, 1999 at the Bayawan Emergency Hospital where Gaudencio and Venancia were confined.  His investigation revealed that Gaudencio and Venancia could not identify their assailants.  He also testified that Gaudencio and Venancia were both conscious, but were in pain during the investigation.  He recorded the result of his investigation in the police blotter.<br><br>Petitioner denied having committed the crime imputed against him.<br><br>On December 12, 2001, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dumaguete City, Branch 33,  rendered  a  Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> acquitting the petitioner in Criminal Case No. 14612 and convicting him in Criminal Case No. 14609. The dispositive portion of the Decision is as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, from the foregoing considerations, this Court finds accused, Edgar Esqueda, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide in Criminal Case No. 14609. Since there is (sic) no mitigating and aggravating circumstances to offset each other and after applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, accused Edgar Esqueda is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years, six (6) months and twenty (20) days of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years, four (4) months and ten (10) days of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as maximum. Since the complainant, Venancia Aliser, was not able to produce evidence as to how much she spent for her hospitalization nor presented evidence to prove other damages, this Court is constrained not to award her damages.<br><br>Since the element of conspiracy had not been sufficiently established by the prosecution and as had been admitted that it was the unknown person who stabbed Gaudencio Quiniquito, accused Edgar Esqueda is hereby acquitted in Criminal Case No. 14612.<br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the records of the case were transmitted to the CA.<br><br>The CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated August 19, 2004 dismissing the appeal and affirming the decision of the RTC.   The dispositive portion of the  decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us DISMISSING the appeal filed in this case and AFFIRMING the decision dated December 12, 2001 of the RTC of Dumaguete City in Criminal Case No. 14609.<br></blockquote>Hence, this petition assigning the following error:<br><blockquote>WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE PETITONER GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE AND IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING HIS DEFENSE.<br></blockquote>Petitioner's defense is anchored on alibi and denial.  His witnesses, Claudio, Domingo and Viviana, aver that during the time of the incident, petitioner was out at sea fishing.  Petitioner, when called to the witness stand, denied having committed the crime.<br><br>Further, in his petition, petitioner alleges that Venancia may have had a motive in falsely accusing him of crime.<br><br>Furthermore, the private offended parties failed to identify the perpetrators during the initial investigation.   Petitioner averred that the private offended parties should have informed the authorities of the identities of their assailant during the initial investigation.  He insisted that the trial court erred in totally disregarding his defense, which resulted in his conviction.<br><br>In its Comment to the Petition, respondent, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), averred that the issues raised by the petitioner are factual, hence, inappropriate in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> before this Court.<br><br>The petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br>We have unfailingly held that alibi and denial being inherently weak cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In the present case, petitioner was positively identified by Venancia and Gaudencio as the author of the crime.

We rule that the rivalry should be resolved in favor of the prosecution.<br><br>Between the categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses and the bare denial of the petitioner, the former must perforce prevail.  An affirmative testimony is far stronger than a negative testimony, especially when it comes from the mouth of a credible witness. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.

Physical impossibility refers to the distance between the place where the accused was when the crime transpired and the place where it was committed, as well as the facility of access between the two places.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Where there is least chance for the accused to be present at the crime scene, the defense of alibi must fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Aside from the testimonies of petitioner's witnesses that he was fishing at Cawitan, Sta.

Catalina, were merely more than 5 kilometers apart which would only take about 20 to 40 minutes' ride.  Thus, it was not physically impossible for the petitioner to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of the incident.<br><br>In addition, positive identification destroys the defense of alibi and renders it impotent, especially where such identification is credible and categorical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's allegation that Venancia may have had a motive in falsely accusing him of a crime is bereft of merit.<br><br>Although there is a possibility that Venancia and petitioner's mother were not in good terms due to a case of grave slander by deed that Venancia filed against petitioner's mother, We believe that such incident is not sufficient provocation for Venancia to give perjured evidence in order to impute a grave felony against the petitioner.<br><br>If petitioner had really nothing to do with the crime, it is against the natural order of events and human nature, and against the presumption of good faith, that a prosecution witness would falsely testify against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Further, assuming that Venancia may have had a grudge against petitioner's mother due to the foregoing case, still, the same would not affect the credibility of her testimony.<br><br>In <i>People v.

Oliano</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the existence of a grudge or an ill motive does not automatically render the testimony of a witness to be false and unreliable.   Petitioner's allegation of false motive in charging him with a crime cannot overcome the affirmative and categorical statements of the prosecution witnesses pointing to him as the malefactor.<br><br>Petitioner insisted that the offended parties failed to identify the perpetrators during the initial investigation by the police, thus, casting doubt on the identity of the perpetrator.<br><br>The argument is way off the mark.<br><br>Delay or vacillation in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily impair the credibility of witnesses if such delay is satisfactorily explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In her Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Venancia explained that she did not immediately disclose the identity of the accused because she was afraid that the perpetrators would kill her and her husband in the hospital.  Further, they feared that a certain Cardo Quiniquito, who was said to have tailed the perpetrators after the incident, was missing.  This prompted the private offended parties to seek police assistance to locate Cardo's whereabouts. When investigated, Cardo Quiniquito said that he did not follow the suspect, but he escaped because of fear. From the foregoing, it is clear that Venancia's failure to disclose the identity of the perpetrators was due to fear of reprisal.<br><br>In <i>People v. Ompad, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it was settled that delay in divulging the names of perpetrators of crimes, if sufficiently explained, does not impair the credibility of the witness and his testimony.  The initial reluctance of a witness due to fear of reprisal is common and does not impair his credibility.  What matters is that Venancia and Gaudencio testified, and the trial court found their testimonies credible.<br><br>In sum, we find that the evidence of petitioner's guilt was sufficiently established.  The trial court had the unique opportunity of observing the witnesses firsthand as they testified, and it was, therefore, in the best position to assess whether these witnesses were telling the truth or not.  The substance of the testimonies for the prosecution corresponded with the trial court's findings and intrinsically merited full faith and credence.  The defense's evidence, on the other hand, provided no facts and circumstances of weight and substance sufficient to cast doubt on the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>However, with regard to the proper crime committed, We are inclined to modify the trial court's ruling.<br><br>Petitioner was charged with frustrated murder in an Amended Information. After trial on the merits, the court found that petitioner committed the crime of frustrated homicide.  The trial court found that treachery, which would qualify the crime to frustrated murder, was wanting in the present case.<br><br>The trial court found that Venancia was already aware of what would happen to Gaudencio because she shouted <i>"watch out Dong"</i> before Gaudencio was stabbed.   Before Venancia was stabbed by petitioner, she too was aware of the fate that befell her, because she tried to retreat to the confines of her house when she herself was unfortunately stabbed.  The trial court postulated that Venancia must have already been alerted and forewarned of the impending attack; thus, there was no treachery.<br><br>We rule that the trial court's finding that there was no treachery is misplaced.<br><br>To begin with, an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review on any question including one not raised by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We find ample evidence to establish that treachery attended the commission of the crime.<br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and especially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might take.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>There is treachery when the following essential elements are present, <i>viz.</i>: (a) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (b) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods or forms of attack employed by him.  The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission without risk of himself<i>.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></b></i><br><br>In the present case, treachery in the commission of the crime was sufficiently proven by the prosecution.  When Gaudencio opened the door and went outside, Venancia tailed him.   There they found two persons at the porch, one sitting at the bench and the other standing.  Without warning, the unidentified man stood up and stabbed Gaudencio in the chest.  Upon seeing this, Venancia shouted <i>"Watch out, Dong!" </i>She then turned her back, but was stabbed by petitioner and fell on the ground.  While in this position, petitioner continued hitting her on different parts of her body.  Clearly, the hapless Venancia was stabbed immediately after the unidentified person stabbed her live-in partner, thus, giving her no opportunity to retaliate or defend herself.   It could not have taken Venancia more than a second or two to run after Gaudencio was stabbed.<br><br>The method of attack adopted by the petitioner placed Venancia in a situation where it would be impossible for her to resist the attack or defend her person.<br><br>The suddenness of the attack is shown by the fact that Venancia was immediately stabbed by petitioner right after she turned her back to run.  She was not able to safely distance herself due to the suddenness of the attack.  Further, before opening the door, she and her live-in partner had no inkling that they would be attacked, since petitioner did not reveal his true identity to the victims.  His partner in crime misrepresented that they were the men of Sgt. Torres and with them was Toto Vibar, the son of the <i>barangay </i>captain.   Petitioner misled the victims, so the latter lowered their guard and suspicion.  Thereafter, when the door was opened, the malefactors attacked them.  Indeed, all these circumstances indicate that the assault on the victims was treacherous.  Venancia, in her testimony, said:<br><blockquote>PRIVATE PROSECUTOR MARCELO FLORES<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you saw your husband hit on the chest, what did you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I shouted "watch out Dong," and when I turned my back I was stabbed by Edgar Esqueda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Treachery may also be appreciated even if the victim was warned of the danger to her life if she was defenseless and unable to flee at the time of the infliction of the <i>coup de grace</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Although Venancia witnessed the stabbing of Gaudencio and was able to warn Gaudencio of further assaults, she too, was immediately attacked while she was defenseless.

The offender has passed the subjective phase in the commission of the crime. Subjectively, the crime is complete.   Nothing interrupted the offender while passing through the subjective phase.  He did all that is necessary to consummate the crime.   However, the crime is not consummated by reason of the intervention of causes independent of the will of the offender.  In homicide cases, the offender is said to have performed all the acts of execution if the wound inflicted on the victim is mortal and could cause the death of the victim barring medical intervention or attendance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner commenced the performance of his unlawful act by stabbing Venancia at the back.

Further, after she was stabbed and fell to the ground, the petitioner continued hitting her on different parts of her body, thereby showing petitioner's intent to kill her.<br><br>Dr. Fidencio G.

The minimum of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the full range of <i>prision</i> <i>mayor</i> which is one degree lower than <i>reclusion temporal</i>.  Since there is no modifying circumstance in the commission of  frustrated murder, an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision</i> <i>mayor </i>medium, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal </i>medium, as maximum, is considered reasonable for the crime of frustrated murder under the facts of this case.<br><br>The trial court did not award damages to Venancia because the prosecution failed to present any evidence to substantiate her hospitalization expenses nor did it present evidence to prove other damages.<br><br>We rule that Venancia is entitled to damages.<br><br>Where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined because of the absence of supporting receipts but entitlement is shown by the facts of the case, temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 may be awarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In light of the fact that Venancia suffered injuries, was actually hospitalized and underwent medical treatment, it is prudent to award temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00, in lieu of actual damages.<br><br>Further, the award of exemplary damages is also in order, considering that the crime was attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery.

Although she did not testify on the moral damages she suffered, the medical certificate issued by the hospital indicated that she suffered multiple stab wounds and incised wounds inflicted by the petitioner.
