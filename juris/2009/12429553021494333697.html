SP No. 00922.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Respondents add that the appellate court, by Resolution of April 22, 2008, held the illegal dismissal case in abeyance until after this Court rules on the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also urges the Court to examine the cases of respondents Roque Pilapil (Pilapil) and Benedicto Auxtero (Auxtero) in light of the following information, <i>viz</i>:<i> </i> <b>Pilapil</b> entered petitioner's pool of regular employees on September 1, 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> but was later terminated for submitting falsified academic credentials.&nbsp; Pilapil's complaint for illegal dismissal was dismissed by the labor arbiter, whose decision was reinstated with modification by the appellate court by Decision of March 7, 2001 in CA-G.R. SP No. 50578.&nbsp; On Pilapil's appeal, this Court, by Resolution of September 19, 2001 in G.R. No. 147853, declared the case terminated when Pilapil failed to file his intended petition.<br><br>Given its information in the immediately foregoing paragraph,&nbsp; petitioner claims that it already complied with the judgment awarding separation pay representing financial assistance to Pilapil on September 23, 2003, during the pendency of the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents do not dispute petitioner's information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also informs the Court that <b>Auxtero</b> already secured a favorable judgment from this Court in G.R. No. 158710 which effectively affirmed the appellate court's Decision of February 26, 2003 in CA-G.R. SP No. 50480.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; It appears from the "Joint Declaration of Satisfaction of <br> Judgment"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with "Release and Quitclaim and Waiver,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> both dated November 29, 2007, that petitioner already satisfied the judgment rendered in said G.R. No. 158710 in favor of Auxtero in the amount of P1.3 Million, and that Auxtero had waived reinstatement.&nbsp; Respondents essentially corroborate this information of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In light of these recent manifestations-informations of the parties, the Court finds that a modification of the Decision is in order, the claims with respect to Pilapil and Auxtero having been deemed extinguished even before the promulgation of the Decision.&nbsp; That Pilapil was a regular employee yields to the final finding of a valid dismissal in the supervening case involving his own misconduct, while Auxtero's attempt at forum-shopping should not be countenanced.<br><br>IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS, the Court finds no sufficient reason to deviate from its Decision, but proceeds, nonetheless, to clarify a few points.<br><br>While this Court's Decision ruled on the regular status of respondents, it must be deemed to be <b>without prejudice to the resolution of the issue of illegal dismissal in the proper case</b>.&nbsp; The Decision thus expressly stated:<br><blockquote>Finally, it must be stressed that respondents, having been declared to be regular employees of petitioner, Synergy being a mere agent of the latter, had acquired security of tenure.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As such, they could only be dismissed by petitioner, the real employer, on the basis of just or authorized cause, and with observance of procedural due process</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Notably, subject of the Decision was respondents' complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">regularization and under-/non-payment of benefits.</span>&nbsp; The Court did not and could not take cognizance of the validity of the eventual dismissal of <br> respondents because the matter of just or authorized cause is beyond the issues of the case.&nbsp; That is why the Court did not order reinstatement for such relief presupposes a finding of illegal dismissal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in the proper case which, as the parties now manifest, pends before the appellate court.<br><br>Respecting petitioner's allegation of financial woes that led to the June 30, 1998 lay-off of respondents, as the Court held in its Decision, petitioner failed to establish such economic losses which rendered&nbsp; impossible the compliance with the order to accept respondent as regular employees.&nbsp; Thus the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>Other than its bare allegations, petitioner presented nothing to substantiate its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">impossibility of compliance.</span>&nbsp; In fact, petitioner waived this defense by failing to raise it in its Memorandum filed on June 14, 1999 before the Court of Appeals. x x&nbsp; x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner, for the first time, revealed the matter of termination and the allegation of financial woes in its Motion for Reconsideration of October 10, 2000 before the appellate court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <b>not by way of defense to a charge of illegal dismissal but to manifest that supervening events have rendered it impossible for petitioner to comply</b> with the order to accept respondents as regular employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the issue of economic losses as a ground for dismissing respondents is factual in nature, hence, it may be determined in the proper case.<br><br>All told, the pending illegal dismissal case in CA-G.R. SP No. 00922 may now take its course.&nbsp; The Court's finding that respondents are regular employees of petitioner neither frustrates nor preempts the appellate court's proceedings in resolving the issue of retrenchment as an authorized cause for termination.&nbsp; If an authorized cause for dismissal is later found to exist, petitioner would still have to pay respondents their corresponding benefits and salary differential up to June 30, 1998.&nbsp; Otherwise, if there is a finding of illegal dismissal, an order for reinstatement with full backwages does not conflict with the Court's declaration of the regular employee status of respondents.<br><br>As to the belated plea of respondents for attorney's fees, suffice it to state that parties who have not appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative reliefs other than those granted, if any, in the decision of the lower tribunal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Since respondents did not file a motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's decision, much less appeal therefrom, they can advance only such arguments as may be necessary to defeat petitioner's claims or to uphold the appealed decision, and cannot ask for a modification of the judgment in their favor in order to obtain other positive reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of February 29, 2008 is, in light of the foregoing discussions, <b>MODIFIED</b>.&nbsp; As MODIFIED, the dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals Decision of September 29, 2000 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.<br><br>Petitioner PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC., is <b>ordered </b>to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recognize</span> respondents ENRIQUE LIGAN, EMELITO SOCO, ALLAN PANQUE, JOLITO OLIVEROS, RICHARD GONCER, NONILON PILAPIL, AQUILINO YBANEZ, BERNABE SANDOVAL, RUEL GONCER, VIRGILIO P.
