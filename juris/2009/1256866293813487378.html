				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> </i>finding Leonard L. Bernardino (<i>accused-appellant</i>) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the illegal sale and illegal possession of <i>shabu, </i>penalized under Sections 15 and 16, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425 (<i>R.A. No. 6425</i>), as amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972).  The CA decision fully affirmed the judgments of conviction on the two charges rendered by the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 56, Angeles City. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 96-530, the accused-appellant was accused of illegal possession of <i>shabu </i>under Section 16, Article III of R.A. No. 6425 under an Information that states:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 29<sup>th</sup> day of September, 1996, in the City of Angeles, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and under his control SHABU (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride) weighing approximately 215 grams, which (sic) is a regulated drug, without any authority whatsoever.<br><br>ALL CONTRARY TO THE LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 96-533, the accused-appellant, together with one Nestor C. Nemis, was charged with the illegal sale of <i>shabu,</i> penalized under Section 15, Article III of R.A. No. 6425, as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 29<sup>th</sup> day of September, 1996, in the City of Angeles, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually aiding and abetting one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and/or deliver one transparent plastic sachet of <i>SHABU</i> (methamphetamine Hydrochloride weighing approximately 5 grams to poseur-buyer without any authority whatsoever.<br><br>ALL CONTRARY TO THE LAW.<br></blockquote>The accused-appellant alone stood trial as his co-accused Nestor C. Nemis, after entering a plea of not guilty, jumped bail. The accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The two criminal cases were subsequently consolidated and jointly tried.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>THE ANTECEDENTS</b><br></center><br>At the trial, the prosecution and the defense presented conflicting versions of the antecedent events. The prosecution's evidence, documentary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and testimonial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> showed that the accused-appellant was arrested in a buy-bust operation by the police. The defense's evidence, through documentary evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and the testimonies of the accused-appellant and Salvador Bernardino (<i>Salvador</i>), showed that the accused-appellant was the victim of a police frame-up.<br><br><u><b>The Prosecution's Version</b></u><br><br>SPO2 Daniel C. Cadiz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (<i>SPO2 Cadiz</i>), one of the prosecution witnesses,<i> </i>is an investigator and intelligence operative of the Regional Operations Group based at Camp Olivas, San Fernando, Pampanga (<i>Camp</i><i> Olivas</i>).  He testified that while he was at his office at around 3:00 p.m. of September 29, 1996, he received information from a female asset about a drug deal involving P3,000.00 worth of <i>shabu </i>(equivalent to five <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> grams)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that the asset arranged with a certain Onat.<br><br>SPO2 Cadiz immediately relayed the information to Chief Inspector Igmedio Cruz, Jr. who organized a buy-bust team. SPO2 Cadiz testified that the subject of the buy-bust operation would be a man riding a green Isuzu pick-up and that he (SPO2 Cadiz) was designated to act as the <i>poseur </i>buyer. After a briefing, he and the rest of the buy-bust team,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> together with two (2) civilian assets, proceeded to Don Bonifacio St., Don Bonifacio Subdivision, Angeles City on board three vehicles. They arrived at the designated place at 5:30 p.m. and strategically positioned their vehicles in front of House No. 43-25 Don Bonifacio St., the place where the sale of <i>shabu </i>was to take place. SPO2 Cadiz was with the female asset inside a vehicle they parked by the roadside; SPO2 Cadiz was at the backseat of the vehicle while the civilian asset was at the driver's seat. At about 9:00 p.m., a green Isuzu pick-up showed up and stopped alongside and very near the vehicle of SPO2 Cadiz and the female asset. SPO2 Cadiz hid himself at the vehicle's backseat area from where he heard the conversation between the female asset and the man in the pick-up. When SPO2 Cadiz heard the female asset say "<i>Sige</i>. Thank you" - the pre-arranged signal to signify that an exchange of money and drugs had already taken place - he got off the vehicle and arrested the driver of the pick-up who was then holding the P3,000.00 marked money. The driver identified himself. At that point, the rest of the buy-bust team converged on the pick-up; he saw that the accused-appellant was accompanied in the pick-up by another man later identified as Nestor Nemis. Like the accused-appellant, Nestor Nemis himself was arrested by the other members of the buy-bust team.  Both the accused-appellant and Nestor Nemis were subjected to a body search and the vehicle itself was searched.<br><br>In addition to the suspected <i>shabu </i>sold at the buy-bust and the P3,000.00 marked money recovered from the accused-appellant, SPO2 Cadiz' body search of the accused-appellant yielded the following items: (a)<i> </i>a white plastic bag containing other two plastic bag search containing a suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride known (<i>shabu</i>) weighing approximately 200 grams contained in a white big size plastic bag labeled Uniwide Sales; (b) three plastic bags each containing a quantity of suspected <i>shabu</i> with an approximate weight of fifteen grams; and (c) money in the amount of P2,400.00.<br><br>The search of the glove compartment of the pick-up yielded a partly burned aluminum foil with residue, a small quantity of suspected <i>shabu,</i> and three improvised tooters.<br><br>The arresting team forthwith took the accused-appellant and Nestor Nemis to Camp Olivas while SPO2 Cadiz personally took the confiscated items to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory for examination.<br><br>SPO2 Cadiz identified in court the marked money (marked with the initials "D.G.") and the confiscated <i>shabu </i>through the markings which he made in red ink (his own intitials "DCC") on the <b>Uniwide Sales plastic bag</b> (Exhibit "E" with submarkings).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Likewise, he identified the <b>tooter and aluminum foil</b> (Exhibit "F" with submarkings) as the items seized from the accused-appellant, which he marked in black ink with his initials, "DCC";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> he marked the plastic bag containing the tooter and aluminum foil with his signature and name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> SPO2 Cadiz also testified that he marked the <b>three (3) small transparent plastic sachets</b> (Exhibits "G" to "G-3") and the <b>plastic bag (Exhibit "H") taken from the accused-appellant</b> with his name written in red ink and initials in black ink.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He testified that he made these markings immediately after the buy-bust operation when he arrived at the Regional Special Operation Office at around 9:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He personally took the confiscated items to the crime laboratory the next day at around 10:00 a.m. SPO2 Cadiz explained that they bring the evidence to the crime laboratory office as soon as possible. The administration office of the crime laboratory received the items he turned over.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The recipient recorded the turnover, duly affixing her signature and the time of receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> SPO2 Cadiz was then told to return that same day to receive the initial examination report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i> </i><br><br>SPO4 Daniel M. Guillermo (<i>SPO4 Guillermo</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> is a member of the Regional Special Operation Group of Camp Olivas and heads the Pampanga Intelligence Team charged with the task of gathering information against criminal elements. He acted as team leader of the buy-bust operation conducted against the accused-appellant on September 29, 1996.  SPO4 Guillermo testified that he was given P3,000.00 as buy-bust money by his superiors; he marked these with "x" and his initials, and thereafter gave the sum to SPO2 Cadiz, the designated <i>poseur </i>buyer.<br><br>He further testified that at around 5:30 p.m. of September 29, 1996, he and the buy-bust team were on board three (3) vehicles on Don Bonifacio St., Don Bonifacio Subdivision, Angeles City. In the course of their operation, they retrieved <i>shabu</i> weighing around 215 grams<i> </i>and other drug paraphernalia from the accused-appellant. He instructed<i> </i>SPO2 Cadiz to secure all the evidence consisting of the three (3) pieces of marked money, the <i>shabu</i>, the improvised tooter with partly burned aluminum foil with residue, and three (3) plastic bags.<i> </i>After the arrest, they took the accused-appellant and Nestor Nemis to Camp Olivas while the confiscated items<i> </i>were turned over to the forensic chemist for examination.<br><br>Daisy Babor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (<i>Babor</i>) is a forensic chemist at the PNP Crime Laboratory, Camp Olivas, San Fernando, Pampanga. On September 30, 1996, she received specimens submitted by SPO2 Cadiz for examination. She testified that she received these specimens from the laboratory's receiving clerk, Sonia Samonte, who immediately endorsed these to her after receipt from SPO2 Cadiz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The specimens submitted for examination were: (a) one (1) white big size plastic bag labeled Uniwide Sales containing two (2) medium size transparent plastic bag each with white crystalline substance having a total weight of 198.324 grams; (b) a medium size transparent plastic bag containing one (1) small size heat sealed transparent plastic bag with white crystalline substance weighing 1.669 grams; (c) one (1) medium size transparent plastic bag containing three (3) small size heat-sealed transparent plastic packs each with white crystalline substance having a total weight of 11.237 grams; and (d) one transparent plastic bag containing suspected drug abused paraphernalia seeds, one (1) small piece of partly burned aluminum foil, and three (3) improvised tooters each with suspected <i>shabu </i>residue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Babor further testified that she immediately conducted an examination of the submitted specimens; the tests she conducted yielded positive results for <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The results of her examination are contained in the Initial Report dated September 30, 1996 (Exhibit "B") and Chemistry Report D-604-96 dated October 1, 1996 (Exhibit "C") which Babor herself prepared. After the tests, she kept the specimens in the laboratory's evidence room that only Babor and her chief had access to. She testified that she took out these specimens from the evidence room when she brought them to court for presentation on June 23, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>At her direct examination, Babor confirmed the specimens she examined and identified them as the same specimens SPO2 Cadiz turned over for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><u>The Version of the Defense</u><br><br>The accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> raised the <b>defenses of denial and frame-up</b>. He claimed that he and Nestor Nemis were used as sacrificial lambs in exchange for the freedom of one Aling Rosie who is reputed to be the queen of <i>shabu </i>in Angeles City, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He related that in the afternoon of September 29, 1996, he and Nestor Nemis were on their way to Angeles City, Pampanga on board an Isuzu pick-up owned by Salvador. The purpose of their trip was to pick up a split-type aircon unit that the accused-appellant bought from Aling Rosie. They arrived at Aling Rosie's house at around 7:30 p.m.; Aling Rosie was not there and they were told by the occupant of the house to wait. Aling Rosie arrived about an hour and a half later; she immediately told them that she had to change clothes before they could proceed to do business.  While waiting for Aling Rosie, they heard a commotion and about seven persons, who turned out to be police officers, entered the house and asked them to lie face down on the floor. Thereafter, the accused-appellant saw Aling Rosie crying while talking to the police officers. They were arrested right then and there and were taken to Camp Olivas. During the ride, the accused-appellant heard the policeman driving their vehicle say - <i>[p]are ayos nahuli rin natin ang Reyna ng Angeles. </i>Upon their arrival at Camp Olivas, the accused-appellant learned that he had been pointed to as the party who brought the <i>shabu</i>. The accused-appellant claimed that he was maltreated and forced to admit to the crime.<br><br>Because of his arrest and maltreatment, the accused-appellant filed an administrative complaint before the Ombudsman against the police officers who arrested him. The accused-appellant further claimed that unidentified persons approached him who offered to drop the criminal charges if he would drop his charges before the Ombudsman.<br><br>The defense also presented Salvador,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  the accused-appellant's uncle and owner of the Isuzu pick-up the police confiscated when the accused-appellant was arrested. Salvador testified that the accused-appellant borrowed the pick-up to get an air conditioning unit.<br><br>On August 18, 1999, the RTC convicted the accused-appellant of the crimes charged; his co-accused Nestor C. Nemis was acquitted for lack of evidence. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>In Crim. Case No. 96-530, the Court finds the accused Leonardo L. Bernardino @ Onat guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of Section 16, Article III of Republic Act 6425, as amended and said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of P 20,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>x  x  x<br><br></li><li>In Crim.

Mateo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we transferred the case, initially appealed to us, to the CA. On September 30, 2005, the CA affirmed the accused-appellant's conviction. The CA, however, modified the penalty in Criminal Case No. 96-530 and sentenced the accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for illegal possession of <i>shabu </i>and to pay a corresponding fine of P1 Million. The CA affirmed the RTC's ruling in Criminal Case No. 96-533.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b style="text-decoration: underline;">THE ISSUE</b><br></center><br>The sole issue raised in this appeal is one of credibility - whether the lower courts committed a reversible error in giving greater weight to the testimonies of the police officers whose acts, according to the accused-appellant, were unfairly presumed to be regular. The accused-appellant also contends that the lower courts erred in disbelieving his version of the events and in disregarding his complaint before the Ombudsman against the police officers for the frame-up they contrived.<br><br>For our consideration is the question: is the prosecution's evidence sufficient to sustain the accused-appellant's conviction for the crimes charged?<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></center><br>Although the only issue raised in this appeal relates to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, we are driven to reexamine and modify the decisions of the RTC and CA after going over the records of this case, the transcript of stenographic notes, and the exhibits before us. We undertake this in-depth review pursuant to our authority, in appeals of criminal cases, to open up the whole case for review. We find, after this review, that both courts failed to consider the crucial fact that the accused-appellant was charged with and was convicted of two (2) crimes that, although commonly relating to dangerous drugs, are nevertheless separate and distinct from one another, particularly in terms of their elements and requisites.<br><br><u>Credibility of the Prosecution Witnesses</u><br><br>The records show that in finding the accused-appellant liable for the crimes charged, both the RTC and CA believed the testimonies of SPO2 Cadiz, SPO4 Guillermo and forensic chemist Babor showing that the accused-appellant was arrested in a legitimate entrapment operation where he was caught in the act of selling P3,000.00 worth of <i>shabu </i>(about 5 grams), and where he was also found in the possession of 211.23 grams of <i>shabu </i>and drug paraphernalia.<br><br>In believing the prosecution's version of events, the RTC pointed to the lack of evidence showing any ulterior motive or ill-will on the part of these prosecution witnesses that would impel them to falsely testify against the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Likewise, the RTC found their testimonies credible, trustworthy and reliable under the presumption that these police officers have regularly performed their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On appeal, the CA disregarded the attacks on the prosecution witnesses' credibility and ruled that the inconsistencies and discrepancies the accused-appellant pointed out refer to trivial and inconsequential matters<i> </i>that <i>do not pertain to the act constitutive of the offense charge</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The CA also ruled that drug transaction conducted in the middle of the road is not unusual, and took note that the sale of prohibited drugs to complete strangers, openly and in public places, has become a common occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Our own independent assessment of the records gives us no reason to disturb the findings on the manner of, and grounds leading to, the accused-appellant's arrest.  We find the testimonies of SPO2 Cadiz and SPO4 Guillermo to be consistent with one another; they sufficiently and clearly show how the accused-appellant committed the crimes charged. We likewise find no sufficient evidence establishing any improper motive on their part to falsely impute the charges against the accused-appellant. On the contrary, the accusation by the accused-appellant that he and Nemis were used as sacrificial lambs to allow the real drug offender to escape is unsupported by any evidence other than his self-serving testimony. We also doubt the veracity of this claim considering that the prosecution witnesses and the accused-appellant did not know each other prior to the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> We do not find it likely that a person of sound disposition would willingly falsely testify against a stranger and suffer the inconvenience and the rigors of a criminal trial and the risk of exposing himself to possible criminal prosecution for giving false testimony.<br><br>Both SPO4 Guillermo and SPO2 Cadiz were fully aware of the serious consequences of the drug charges against the accused-appellant, yet they consistently identified the accused-appellant as the person they arrested for illegal sale and illegal possession of <i>shabu</i> in a buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> They stood firm in their testimonies notwithstanding the administrative complaint filed against them by the accused-appellant before the Ombudsman for maltreatment, illegal detention and frame-up. Incidentally, the records show that the Ombudsman dismissed the administrative complaint against them. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Aside from the lack of improper motive, the prosecution's version of events is corroborated by the prosecution's documentary and real evidence.<br><br><i>First</i>, the marked money that was given to the accused-appellant during the buy-bust sale was presented during the trial as evidence. This marked money -- consisting of three (3) pieces of P1,000.00 -- bore the mark "x" with the letters D.G." identified by SPO4 Guillermo as the markings he made in what was used as marked money in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> SPO4 Guillermo testified that the letters "D.G." stood for his initials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He testified, too, that this marked money was recovered from the accused-appellant immediately after the buy-bust took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> SPO2 Cadiz testified that after the buy-bust, he recovered the marked money from the accused-appellant who was holding it in his left hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, SPO2 Cadiz testified that their pre-operation briefing duly informed them that the subject of the buy-bust operation would be a <i>man riding the green Isuzu pick-up</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Both SPO2 Cadiz and SPO4 Guillermo testified that the accused-appellant arrived at the designated area driving a green Isuzu pick-up and from there sold <i>shabu </i>to their female asset. The accused-appellant duly admitted driving a vehicle of the same make, model and color at the time of his arrest on September 29, 1996 at the designated area of the buy-bust operation.<br><br><i>Lastly</i>, a <i>Confiscation Receipt,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> made part of the records, was signed by the accuse-appellant where he acknowledged that the following items were confiscated from him by the police at 9:00 p.m. of September 29, 1996, namely:<br><blockquote>(a) one (1) plastic bag labeled Uniwide Sales containing another two (2) transparent plastic bags with suspected <i>shabu</i> with the approximate weight of 201.04 grams;<br><br>(b) one (1) transparent plastic sachet containing suspected <i>shabu </i>weighing about 5 grams in weight;<br><br>(c) three (3) transparent plastic sachet with suspected <i>shabu</i> weighing about 15 grams;<br><br>(d) P3,000.00 marked money;<br><br>(e) P2,400.00;<br><br>(f) three (3) pieces of improvised tooter; and<br><br>(g) I[z]usu pick-up.<br></blockquote>We have consistently held, on the issue of credibility, that we give the highest respect to the trial court's evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses; the trial court is in a better position than this Court to assess the credibility of witnesses since it has direct access to and observes the demeanor of these witnesses and their manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, the appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court unless the latter has plainly overlooked facts of substance and value that, if considered, would affect the results of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We find no compelling reason to deviate from this general rule in passing upon<b> the prosecution's version of events.  </b>In fact, and as we indicated above, our own reading of the evidence on record shows that it amply supports the RTC and CA factual findings.<br><br><u>The Defenses of Denial and Frame-up</u><br><br>Against the hard pieces of the prosecution evidence pointing to the accused-appellant's guilt, the latter could only raise the defenses of denial and frame-up and cite the discrepancies and the incredibility of the testimonies of SPO2 Cadiz and SPO4 Guillermo. He claimed that these infirmities cast doubt on the testimonies' evidentiary value and, conversely, strengthen his own version of events.<br><br>The defenses of denial<i> </i>and frame-up are weak defenses that are viewed by the Court with disfavor because "they can easily be feigned and fabricated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><sup> </sup> In <i>People v. Uy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><i> </i>the Court explicitly expounded on this view, as follows:<br><blockquote>We are not unaware that in some instances law enforcers resort to the practice of planting evidence to extract information or even to harass civilians.  However, like alibi, frame-up is a defense that has been invariably viewed by the Court with disfavor as it can easily be concocted [and] hence commonly used as a standard line of defense in most prosecutions arising from violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.  We realize the disastrous consequences on the enforcement of law and order, not to mention the well being of society, if the courts x x x accept in every instance this form of defense which can be so easily fabricated. x x x<br></blockquote>The present case is no exception to what we have said above, as the accused-appellant failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence against the positive, consistent and categorical prosecution evidence pointing to his guilt of the crimes charged.<br><br>In this respect, the discrepancies the accused-appellant points out, namely: whether both witnesses spoke to the female asset prior to the buy-bust operation; whether the female asset knew the full name of the accused-appellant; and whether the police kept a dossier on the accused-appellant, all  refer to events which occurred <i>prior to the buy-bust operation</i>. They are extraneous matters with no direct bearing on the evidence establishing the elements of the crimes charged. The inconsistencies, if any, refer to minor matters that enhance, rather than destroy, the veracity of the witnesses' testimonies; they serve to remove any suspicion that these testimonies were contrived or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> More importantly, these discrepancies did not contest the categorical and consistent testimonies of SPO2 Cadiz and SPO4 Guillermo and the other prosecution evidence on the elements of the crimes charged.<br><br>Additionally, we reject the accused-appellant's argument that the lack of prior surveillance or test-buys affected the integrity of the buy-bust operation. Although test-buys for dangerous drugs provide assurance of the  reliability of an informer's tip, they are not conditions <i>sine qua non;</i> their absence does not affect the validity of a buy-bust operation and of the credibility of police officers participating on the basis of an informer's tip. SPO4 Guillermo and SPO2 Cadiz duly justified both the lack of prior surveillance and of an existing file on the accused-appellant, when they stood by the trustworthiness and reliability of their asset whom they tried and tested in previous operations;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> their familiarity with the female asset led the police to dispense with the need for a prior surveillance or for test-buys.<br><br>We also reject the accused-appellant's argument on the alleged impossibility of the sale of <i>shabu </i>in a busy street between two strangers who used two vehicles that were side by side each other. In the first place, the records show that the transaction happened inside a subdivision and not in a busy street.  Even granting that the place of the buy-bust was a busy street (which fact was not established), the sale took place at night (at 9:00 p.m.) and was a five-minute transaction that was too brief to attract the attention of passersby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The records also show that the position of the vehicles allowed other cars to pass and that the accused-appellant and the female asset were one-arm length away from each other and could easily make the exchange.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The records further show that the drug transaction was not conducted between two strangers. The accused-appellant did not dispute knowing the female asset and admitted that he had previously gone to the female asset's place.<br><br>At any rate, we agree with the CA's observation that there was nothing unusual in drug transactions between strangers. Previous cases relating to dangerous drug violations, in fact, support this observation. A case in point would be our ruling in <i>People v. Chua</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> where we said: <br> <blockquote>xxx the law does not prescribe as an element of the crime that the vendor and vendee be familiar with each other. What matters in a drug related case is not the existing familiarity between the seller and the buyer, but their agreement and the acts constituting the same and delivery of the prohibited drugs...<br><br>x  x  x<br><br>... [D]rug pushers do not confine their trade to known customers; complete strangers are accommodated provided they have the money to pay. Moreover, why a dealer would trust a buyer, which is to say the motive behind a drug deal, is not an essential element of drug-related offense.<br></blockquote><u>A Partial Modification of the Conclusion in the<br>RTC and CA decisions is justified under the<br>circumstances</u><br><br>We mentioned earlier that certain conclusions in convicting the accused-appellant were not supported by the lower courts' factual findings. We refer specifically to the lower courts' failure to consider that the accused-appellant was charged with and convicted of two district crimes that the prosecution had to prove separately in terms of their respective elements.<br><br><u>Criminal Case No. 96-533 for selling <i>shabu</i></u><br><br>In a successful prosecution for illegal sale of <i>shabu,</i> the concurrence of the following elements must be present: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> What is material is proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of <i>corpus delicti </i>or the very drugs the accused sold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Case law teaches that a common issue in drug cases involving buy-busts is the identity of the drugs allegedly sold: are these the very same drugs presented in court? Case law also teaches that this issue is commonly resolved by a scrutiny of the chain of custody of the recovered drugs.  In this case, while each and every link in the chain of custody of the <i>shabu </i>recovered from the accused-appellant was established through the testimonial evidence of SPO2 Cadiz and forensic chemist Babor showing the movements of the <i>shabu </i>from the time of seizure, its marking at the police station, and its submission for laboratory examination until its presentation in court, we find that the prosecution failed to specifically identify the <i>shabu </i>that was actually sold at the buy-bust as among the <i>shabu </i>that were presented in court.<br><br>As shown by the evidence, the prosecution theorized that the accused-appellant was arrested by virtue of a legitimate entrapment operation where he was caught red-handed selling P3,000.00 worth of <i>shabu </i>or about five  <br> (5) grams of <i>shabu</i>.

SPO2 Cadiz identified on the witness stand Exhibits E, F and G (with their corresponding submarkings) and Exhibit H as the items confiscated from the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> However, in contrast with the prosecution's declarations in the Formal Offer of Evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Exhibit H was <b>not categorically</b> identified by SPO2 Cadiz as the <i>shabu </i>bought and sold at the buy-bust. Unlike the <i>shabu </i>in Exhibits E and G that SPO2 Cadiz clearly identified as the <i>shabu</i> taken from the accused-appellant's possession, SPO2 Cadiz' testimony with respect to the <i>shabu </i>marked as Exhibit H merely identified it as the plastic bag that <i>was confiscated from the accused</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>This testimony should be read in relation with his earlier testimony that he only saw the accused-appellant holding the P3,000.00 marked money at the time of his arrest, not the <i>shabu </i>that was sold. Also, SPO2 Cadiz previously testified that he only arrested the accused-appellant after the pre-arranged signal was given by the confidential informant; he only heard and did not actually see the sale. He failed to state that he seized the actual <i>shabu</i> sold and to identify the person from whom the <i>shabu </i>sold was recovered. We cannot overlook this evidentiary gap as it involves the identification of the <i>shabu </i>allegedly sold, as distinguished from the <i>shabu </i>found in the accused-appellant's possession.<br><br>The lack of segregation between these pieces of evidence for the two different crimes charged is also very evident from an examination of the markings in the plastic sachets of <i>shabu </i>seized from the accused-appellant and the identification of the examined specimens in the Initial Laboratory Report and Chemistry Report No. D-604-96. Nowhere is the <i>shabu</i> sold specifically singled out as the specimen for the crime of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>.  Thus, while forensic chemist Babor duly identified and gave the results of the examinations she made, her testimony merely referred to the specimens submitted by SPO2 Cadiz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and could not have separately referred to the <i>shabu</i> illegally possessed and that illegally sold.  From this perspective, no clear specific link exists between the examined specimen and the <i>shabu</i> allegedly sold at the buy-bust except by inference - an exercise that cannot be done in the absence of specific testimony identifying the <i>shabu</i> sold.  This evidentiary situation effectively translates to the absence of proof of <i>corpus delicti, </i>and cannot but lead<i> </i>us to conclude that no valid conviction for the crime of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> can result.<br><br>Criminal Case No. 96-530 for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i><br><br>In a prosecution for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must be satisfactorily established: (a) the accused is found in possession of a regulated drug; (b) the person is not authorized by law or by duly constituted authorities; and (c) the accused has knowledge that the said drug is a regulated drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>  We find that all the elements of this crime were duly proven.<br><br>The records show that the accused-appellant was found in actual possession of 211.23 grams of <i>shabu</i> after a warrantless search in an arrest <i>in flagrante delicto. </i> As testified to by SPO2 Cadiz, the plastic sachets of <i>shabu </i>were found in the accused-appellant's possession in the following manner:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you subjected Onat to body search, what happened then? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">Witness</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I discovered a white plastic bag containing other two plastic bags each containing a suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride known as <i>shabu</i> weighing approximately 200 grams contained in a white big size plastic bag labelled Uniwide Sales from his camouflage pant[s] left lower portion pocket.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">x x x</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When you discovered another <i>shabu</i> on the body of Bernardino, what did you do then?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><p align="justify">I found another three plastic bags each containing a quantity of suspected <i>shabu</i> with an approximate weight of fifteen grams from his camouflage pant[s] left side pocket x x x</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What about your other companions, what were they doing there?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">SPO4 Guillermo after searching the person of Nestor Nemis, he opened the glo[v]e compartment and found a partly burned aluminum foil with residue, a small quantity of suspected <i>shabu</i> and three improvised tooter in the front compartment of the Isuzu Pick-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">x x x</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">You also identified this plastic bag which you said you confiscated from the accused, could you point to us if it is the same <i>shabu </i>you confiscated, will you point to us the marking?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">My marking SPO2 Cadiz, sir, with my initials above the name in red ink.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">PROS.
