CV No. 81657 which reversed the October 29, 2003 Decision and February 2, 2004 Resolution of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 89 finding petitioner Francisco N. Villanueva entitled to damages.  Also assailed is the October 16, 2007 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>On March 31, 1992, petitioner Francisco N. Villanueva, then Assistant Manager for Operations of Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation-Channel 13 (IBC-13) was dismissed from employment on the ground of loss of confidence for purportedly selling forged certificates of performance.  Contesting his termination, petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal before the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br>During the pendency of the labor case, news articles about irregularities in IBC-13 were published in the July 18, 1992 issue of the Manila Times and the Philippine Star, and in the July 19, 1992 issue of the Manila Bulletin.<br><br>In these news articles, respondent Virgilio P. Balaguer, then President of IBC-13, was quoted to have said that he uncovered various anomalies in IBC-13 during his tenure which led to the dismissal of an operations executive for selling forged certificates of performance.<br><br>In the Manila Times, on July 18, 1992:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><blockquote><center>Anomalies at IBC-13 uncovered</center><br>INSIDER pilferage, malversation, overpricing and other irregularities have cost government-owned Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) 13 more than P108 million in losses for the period 1986-1989.<br><br>Gil P.

Balaguer, IBC president, who took over the company in 1990.<br><br>He said the irregularities ranged from selling forged certificates of performance to non-remittance of sales collections, illegal and unauthorized airing of movie trailer advertisements, illegal leasing of electricity and machines to "friendly clients," millions worth of undocumented transactions to movie suppliers, exorbitant fees against in-house productions, and abused overtime charges by certain employees.<br><br>IBC has had four presidents since 1986, Balaguer being the fifth.<br><br>A special probe committee that helped Balaguer said <b>one dismissed executive sold forged certificates of performance</b>, a former supervisor pocketed IBC sales collections, and some station managers did not remit payments on radio advertisements.<br><br>The loose issuance of technical facilities orders practically leased the network's broadcast facilities to a "friendly client" for free.<br><br>Balaguer is credited with accelerating the network's rank from number five in 1988 to number two or three under current ratings, despite the efforts of some holdouts who tried to derail his administration.

It claimed that assuming press statements were issued during a press conference, the same was done solely by Balaguer without its authority or sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  IBC-13 also filed a counterclaim against petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and a cross-claim against Balaguer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1993, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> finding petitioner's dismissal as illegal, which was affirmed by the National Labor Relations Commission.  The Commission, however, declared respondents to be acting in good faith, hence, it deleted the award of moral and exemplary damages.  On December 6, 1994, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> with IBC-13 proposing a scheme of payment for petitioner's monetary claims, and with IBC-13 and petitioner waiving any and all claims against each other arising out of the labor case.<br><br>On October 29, 2003, the Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of Quezon City held that petitioner is entitled to an award of damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is rendered in favor of plaintiff Francisco N.

In varying language, our Rules of Court, in speaking of burden of proof in civil cases, states that each party must prove his own affirmative allegations and that the burden of proof lies on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  Thus, in civil cases, the burden of proof is generally on the plaintiff, with respect to his complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In proving his claim, petitioner relied on the July 20, 1992 letter, the newspaper articles, and the alleged admission of respondents.  Based on the above pieces of evidence, the Court finds that petitioner was unable to discharge his burden of proof.  As such, the Court of Appeals properly dismissed the complaint for damages.<br><br>The July 20, 1992 letter sent by petitioner to respondents reads as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><div style="margin-left: 360px;">20 July 1992<br></div><blockquote><br>Mr. Virgilio Balaguer<br>Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation<br>Broadcast City, Capitol Hills<br>Diliman, Quezon City<br><br>Dear Mr. Balaguer:<br><br>We write on behalf of our client, Mr. Francisco N. Villanueva.<br><br>You have caused to be published in the 18 July 1992 issue of The Philippine Star and 19 July 1992 issue of Manila Bulletin, a news item wherein you stated that you dismissed an Operations Executive because he "sold forged Certificate of Performance".  Our immediate impression is, you are referring to our client, Francisco N. Villanueva, because he is the only Operations Executive in IBC, Channel 13 you have illegally and despotically dismissed.<br><br>We urge you, therefore, to inform us, within forty-eight (48) hours from your receipt of this letter that the Operations Executive you referred to in your press statement is not our client, Francisco N. Villanueva.  We shall construe your failure/refusal to reply as your unequivocal admission that you are, in fact, actually referring to our client, Mr. Francisco N. Villanueva, as the operations executive who "sold forged Certificate of Performance".  Accordingly, we shall immediately proceed to take appropriate criminal and civil court actions against you without further notice.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 320px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>(signed)<br>REX G. RICO<br></div><br>cc: Mr. Francisco N. Villanueva<br>Board of Administrators, IBC-13</blockquote><br>Petitioner argues that by not responding to the above letter which expressly urged them to reply if the statements therein contained are untrue, respondents in effect admitted the matters stated therein, pursuant to the rule on admission by silence in Sec. 32, Rule 130,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and the disputable presumption that acquiescence resulted from a belief that the thing acquiesced in was conformable to the law or fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's argument lacks merit.  One cannot prove his claim by placing the burden of proof on the other party. Indeed, "(a) man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statements that he wishes to prove.  He does not make the letter evidence by sending it to the party against whom he wishes to prove the facts [stated therein].  He no more can impose a duty to answer a charge than he can impose a duty to pay by sending goods.  Therefore a failure to answer such adverse assertions in the absence of further circumstances making an answer requisite or natural has no effect as an admission."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the rule on admission by silence applies to adverse statements in writing if the party was carrying on a mutual correspondence with the declarant.  However, if there was no such mutual correspondence, the rule is relaxed on the theory that while the party would have immediately reacted by a denial if the statements were orally made in his presence, such prompt response can generally not be expected if the party still has to resort to a written reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, we also cannot assume an admission by silence on the part of Balaguer by virtue of his failure to protest or disclaim the attribution to him by the newspapers that he is the source of the articles.  As explained above, the rule on admission by silence is relaxed when the statement is not made orally in one's presence or when one still has to resort to a written reply, or when there is no mutual correspondence between the parties.<br><br>As for the publications themselves, newspaper articles purporting to state what the defendant said are inadmissible against him, since he cannot be held responsible for the writings of third persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, "while the subject news items indicated that Balaguer was the source of the columnists, proving that he truly made such statements is another matter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Petitioner failed to prove that Balaguer did make such statements.<br><br>Notably, petitioner did not implead the editorial staff and the publisher of the alleged defamatory articles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  Contrary to petitioner's assertion, he should have at least presented the authors of the news articles as witnesses to prove his case against respondents in the absence of an express admission by the latter that the subject news articles have been caused by them.<br><br>Petitioner also claims that respondents have admitted that they held a press conference and caused the publication of the news articles, based on the following testimony of Balaguer:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><blockquote>ATTY. JIMENEZ:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Okay, Let me ask another question.  Now Mr. Balaguer this publication referred to so called anomalies of 1986 to 1989 now how about the termination.<br></div><br>A: 1991.<br><br>ATTY. JIMENEZ:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes.<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I think the termination of Mr. Villanueva has nothing to do with that press statement release because the period that covers that report is from specific date 1986 to 1989.  (TSN, 07 November 2000, p. 19)</div></blockquote><br>Admissions, however, should be clear and unambiguous<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which can hardly be said of Balaguer's above testimony.  If Balaguer intended to admit the allegation that he conducted a press conference and caused the publication of the news articles, he could have done so. Instead, Balaguer specifically denied these allegations in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner next argues that IBC-13's Cross-Claim against Balaguer, in that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><blockquote>11. The acts complained of by the plaintiff were done solely by co-defendant Balaguer.<br><br>Balaguer resorted to these things in his attempt to stave off his impending removal from IBC.</blockquote><br>is an admission by IBC-13, which is admissible against Balaguer pursuant to Sec. 29, Rule 130<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> as an admission by a co-partner or an agent.<br><br>Petitioner is mistaken.  IBC-13's cross-claim against Balaguer effectively created an adverse interest between them.  Hence, the admission of one defendant is not admissible against his co-defendant. Besides, as already discussed, the alleged acts imputed to Balaguer were never proven to have been committed, much less maliciously, by Balaguer.  Malice or bad faith implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.  Such must be substantiated by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In sum, we find that petitioner failed to discharge his burden of proof.  No satisfactory evidence was presented to prove by preponderance of evidence that respondents committed the acts imputed against them.  As such, there is no more need to discuss whether the assailed statements are defamatory.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
