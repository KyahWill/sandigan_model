The Court of Appeals held that the Regional Trial Court of Nasugbu, Batangas, Branch 14, in Civil Case No. 674, did not act with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the Resolution dated 17 June 2002 ordering petitioner to make an additional payment of P425.00 per square meter for the subject properties of respondents Far East and the Bernasconis before the issuance of an Order to take possession of the subject properties, and a writ of possession.<br><br>On 23 November 2001, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for Eminent Domain before the Regional Trial Court of Nasugbu, Batangas against Far East Enterprises, Inc.

To enable the plaintiff to construct the Ternate-Nasugbu Tali Batangas Road, a public purpose authorized by law to be undertaken by plaintiff, it is both necessary and urgent for plaintiff to acquire portions of the above parcels of land consisting of a total area of 29, 786 sq. m., more or less, shown in the attached sketch plan marked as Annex "CC" and made and integral part hereof.<br><br>7.  The portion of above-described parcels of land sought to be expropriated have not been applied to nor expropriated for any public use and are selected by plaintiff as the site of the right-of-way in connection with the construction of the Ternate-Nasugbu Tali Batangas in a manner compatible with the greatest public good and the least public injury.<br><br>8.  Plaintiff has negotiated with defendants for the acquisition of portions of the properties for the public purpose as above-stated at a price prescribed by law, but failed to reach an agreement with them notwithstanding the negotiations.<br><br>9.

Lamberto Aguilar, Legal Office of Department of Public Works and Highway (DPWH, for brevity), suggested that answering defendant accept the said amount of compensation at P75.00 per square meter because he claims that the actual use of the real estate properties, although classified as residential by the Municipal Assessor of Nasugbu, is agricultural;<br><br>10.2.2  That in compliance with the suggestion of plaintiff to put into writing our counter-offer, answering defendant wrote the former informing it of its desired amount and requesting for a copy of the revised parcellary survey plan showing the area to be affected after reduction in width of the right of way from 30 meters to 20 meters intended by the DPWH.<br><br>10.2.3  That after learning of its rights as landowner under Administrative Order No. 50 and Republic Act (RA, for brevity) No. 8974, answering defendant in a letter dated July 16, 2001, retracted the previous amount offered to plaintiff in its letter dated April 6, 2001 and, instead offered the said properties on a negotiated sale at the amount of at least P600.00 per square meter.<br><br>x x x x.<br><br>10.2.4  That Plaintiff never replied to answering defendant's letter under date of April 6, 2001.  However, instead of commenting to the price we offered by way of negotiated sale on the July 16, 2001 letter, and acting in bad faith as well by not observing due process as evidenced by failure of the DPWH to provide the requested revised parcellary plan necessary for the defendant to make an informed final decision, plaintiff chose instead to endorse its complaint to the OSG for filing in court and, true to the statement made by Atty.

Far East and the Bernasconis disagreed with the price offered by petitioner.  In view thereof, petitioner was constrained to deposit with the trial court the total amount of P2,222,550.00 in three Land Bank checks in the names of the defendants, for its proper disposition.<br><br>In their respective comments on petitioner's compliance, both Far East and the Bernasconis claimed that petitioner intentionally and wantonly disregarded and misled the trial court by stating that their properties were classified as agricultural to justify the deposit it made.  The documents it submitted stated, however, that the properties sought to be expropriated were classified as residential with a zonal valuation of P600.00 per square meter.

It added that the motion for the issuance of an order and a writ of possession filed by petitioner shall be acted upon after the correct deposit was made.  It found that the amounts deposited as regards Far East and the Bernasconis were not sufficient because these were based on a zonal valuation of P75.00 per square meter.  It said that the deposit should be based on P500.00 per square meter, because the subject lands were residential lands.  As to Arsol, the trial court found the deposit of petitioner at P75.00 per square meter was correct and directed Arsol to claim the check for P1,123,875.00 from the Clerk of Court, under a proper receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  On the same day, Arsol received the check in the amount of P1,123,875.00 representing the initial payment of just compensation for its lands which were subject of the expropriation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Far East and the Bernasconis filed a Joint Motion to Release Deposits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The trial court granted the same per its Order dated 15 April 2002 ordering the release to Far East and the Bernasconis the amounts of P930,450.00 and P168,225.00, respectively, without prejudice to the final determination of just compensation for the affected properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  On 17 April 2002, Far East and the Bernasconis received the checks corresponding to said amounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed its Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 April 2002, arguing that the trial court erred in ordering it to correct the zonal valuation of Far East and the Bernasconis' properties at P500.00 per square meter instead of P75.00 per square meter.

The plaintiff has not shown any other definition of agricultural land, different from the above definition.  The fact, as claimed by the plaintiff, that the lands of the movants are idle, raw and undeveloped, with no houses thereon, does not unmake the same as residential because they were already classified as such long before this case was filed.  The fact that the subject properties may be suitable for agricultural uses does not make it agricultural because they were classified as residential per plaintiff's Annexes "A" to "G" of the Complaint.  The very tax declarations of the movants' properties (Annexes "A" to "G", Complaint) show that subject properties are indeed residential and not agricultural.<br><br>In this connection, tax declarations do not prove ownership of the property. It is only an evidence of possession. It is the titles of the properties that show their ownership (Annexes "O" to "T" of the Complaint).  The Court realizes its lack of discretion to substitute its judgment for the authority of the Municipality of Nasugbu, Batangas, on land reclassification, on the mere premise that the properties of the movants and of Arsol adjoin each other.<br><br>RA 8974 gives no discretion to the Court to determine the classification of the expropriated properties.<br><br>Plaintiff cannot question the very contents of its documents which are parts and parcels of its complaint.  It is a cardinal rule in adjective law that pleadings are binding on the pleader.<br><br>In fine, the Court is fully convinced to give weight to the contents of plaintiff's Exhs. "A" to "G" and "BB", Complaint.

The pertinent portions of the decision read:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner submitted to respondent court the Land Bank checks payable to private respondents, as well as to Arsol, and a certification as to availability of funds.  However, private respondents Far East and the Bernasconis disagreed with the amount of petitioner's deposit and prayed in their Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 26 April 2002 that petitioner be ordered to deposit the balance of Php425.00 per square meter in order to comply with the zonal value of Php500.00 per square meter, as contained in the Order dated 02 April 2002. They argued that their land is residential and that the zonal value of P500.00 per square meter should be paid to them, instead of the zonal value of P75.00 per square meter for agricultural lands.

Bernasconi showing that the properties sought to be expropriated are classified as "Residential."  Petitioner's very own attachments to its Complaint show that private respondents' properties are residential and not agricultural.<br><br>Thus, based on Section 4 of R.A. No. 8974 and Section 8 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 8974, petitioner should have paid immediately to private respondents the amount equivalent to the sum of 100% of the value of the property based on the BIR zonal valuation of private respondents' residential lots in Barangay Balaytigue, Nasugbu, Batangas in the amount of Php500.00 per square meter, and not Php75.00 per square meter which is the BIR current zonal valuation for agricultural lots in said barangay.  R.A. No. 8974 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations are clear as to the amount of payment which petitioner, through DPWH, the implementing agency, has to make, even as early as the filing of petitioner's Complaint. No amount of verbiage on petitioner's part can alter the plain and unequivocal provisions of the law and the implementing rules.  Thus, respondent court did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it relied upon private respondents' tax declarations (Complaint's Annexes "A" to "G"), and the BIR zonal valuation of real properties in Nasugbu, Batangas (Complaint's Annex "BB"); found the amount of Php75.00 per square meter insufficient as regards private respondents' subject residential properties, the zonal valuation of which is Php500.00 per square meter; and ordered petitioner to make the additional payment of Php425.00 per square meter before the order to take possession and writ of possession can be issued in petitioner's favor.  As held in <i>Republic v. Gingoyon</i> G.R. No. 166429, 19 December 2005, 478 SCRA 474, 520], R.A. No. 8974 provides, as the relevant standard for initial compensation, the market value of the property as stated in the tax declaration or the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, whichever is higher.<br><br>Rep. Act No. 8974 represents a significant change from previous expropriation laws such as Rule 67, or even Section 19 of the Local Government Code. In both cases, the private owner does not receive compensation prior to the deprivation of property.  On the other hand, Rep. Act No. 8974 mandates immediate payment of the initial just compensation prior to the issuance of the writ of possession in favor of the Government.  Rep. Act No. 8974 is plainly clear in imposing the requirement of immediate prepayment, and no amount of statutory deconstruction can evade such requisite.  It enshrines a new approach towards eminent domain that reconciles the inherent unease attending expropriation proceedings with a position of fundamental equity. While expropriation proceedings have always demanded just compensation in exchange for private property, the previous deposit requirement impeded immediate compensation to the private owner, especially in cases wherein the determinations of the final amount of compensation would prove highly disputed.  Under the new modality prescribed by Rep. Act No. 8974, the private owner sees immediate monetary recompense with the same degree of speed as the taking of his/her property.<br><br>While eminent domain lies as one of the inherent powers of the State, there is no requirement that it undertake a prolonged procedure, or that the payment of the private owner be protracted as far as practicable.  In fact, the expedited procedure of payment, as highlighted under Rep. Act No. 8974, is inherently more fair, especially to the layperson who would be hard-pressed to fully comprehend the social value of expropriation in the first place.  Immediate payment placates to some degree whatever ill-will that arises from expropriation, as well as satisfies the demand of basic fairness.<br><br>It is therefore erroneous for petitioner to contend that respondent court abdicated its authority in determining just compensation.  The compensations to private respondents based on the BIR zonal valuation of the properties sought to be expropriated at Php500.00 per square meter is merely the immediate payment of the initial just compensation prior to the issuance of the writ of possession in order to effectuate the transfer of possession in favor of petitioner.<br><br>The issuance of the writ of possession does not write <i>finis</i> to the expropriation proceedings. Expropriation is not completed until payment to the property owner of just compensation.  To effectuate transfer of ownership, it is necessary of the Government to pay the property owner the final just compensation.<br><br>Indeed, the determination of just compensation in expropriate proceedings is a judicial function.  Section 5 of R.A. No. 8974 enumerates certain relevant standards which respondent court may consider, in order to facilitate the determination of just compensation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, it is at this stage of the expropriation proceedings where the judicial function of determining just compensation is to be exercised by respondent court.  It is also at this point when petitioner's evidence regarding the use of the subject properties, value declared by the owners, current selling price, ocular findings, etc. will into play.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner filed its Motion for Reconsideration dated 4 December 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  On 5 February 2007, the Court of Appeals denied the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition for review.<br><br>Petitioner raises the following grounds in support of the petition:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br><br>IN RULING THAT PETITIONER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY PAY THE BIR ZONAL VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY BEFORE TAKING POSSESSION, THE COURT OF APPEALS FAILED TO RESOLVE THE <i>LIS MOTA</i> OF THE CASE, THAT IS, WHICH FACTORS SHOULD CONTROL IN DETERMINING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF PAYMENT OF THE BIR ZONAL VALUATION; COROLLARY THERETO, THE HONORABLE COURT'S RELIANCE IN <i>REPUBLIC VS.

On the other hand, respondents Far East and the Bernasconis assert that their properties are residential pursuant to Municipal Ordinance No. 3 enacted by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Nasugbu, Batangas on 3 May 1982, and that said reclassification was reflected in their corresponding tax declarations for the properties.<br><br>Petitioner argues that in cases where there is a dispute on the classification of the property, the trial court is under obligation to judicially determine the classification of the property prior to requiring the payment of the amount based on the BIR zonal value.  It should be allowed to present evidence of the proper classification of the properties.  Petitioner adds that nothing in Republic Act No. 8974 compels it or the Court to classify the property based on tax declarations, for the latter has judicial discretion to ascertain the classification and nature of the property based on the standards set under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 8974.  Petitioner states that the expropriation court is not bound by a property owner's statement in the tax declaration that his property is residential or by a municipal zoning ordinance that classifies the property as such, when there exists controverting evidence to the contrary. Thus, petitioner faults both the trial court and the appellate court for ruling that the lands involved are residential, notwithstanding petitioner's claim that the there is evidence to show that the same are agricultural.<br><br>It is clear from the foregoing that petitioner is questioning the classification of the lands involved.<br><br>We agree with petitioner that the courts have judicial discretion to determine the classification of lands, because such classification is one of the relevant standards for the assessment of the value of lands, subject of expropriation proceedings.

Technical matters such as zoning classifications and building certifications should be primarily resolved first by the administrative agency whose expertise relates therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>  The jurisprudential trend is for courts to refrain from resolving a controversy involving matters that demand the special competence of administrative agencies, "even if the question[s] involved [are] also judicial in character."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  In this manner, we give the respect due to these agencies (the municipal council and the Human Settlement Regulatory Commission [now HLURB]), which unquestionably have primary jurisdiction to rule on matters of classification of lands.<br><br>In <i>Solmayor v. Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> we declared:<br><br><blockquote>Well settled is the principle that by reason of the special knowledge and expertise of administrative agencies over matters falling under their jurisdiction, they are in a better position to pass judgment thereon; thus their findings of fact in that regard are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the courts.  Accordingly, since specialized government agencies tasked to determine the classification of parcels of land, such as the Bureau of Soils and the HLURB, among other agencies, have already certified that the subject land is residential/commercial, the Court must accord such conclusions great respect, if not finality, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>Under Section 3(m), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, there is a presumption that official duty has been regularly performed.  Thus, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that public officers performed their official duties regularly and legally and in compliance with applicable laws, in good faith, and in the exercise of sound judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  This presumption applies to this case.<br><br>If after going to the local government unit or government agencies that made the classification of the lands and the implementing agency fails to obtain the redress they seek (proper classification), despite evidence clearly showing erroneous classification, it is only then that it can go to the court to ask for intervention.<br><br>In the case at bar, the trial court and the Court of Appeals based their classification of the lands concerned, not only on the tax declarations, but more importantly on the certification issued by the Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator/Zoning Administrator of the Municipality of Nasugbu, Batangas that said lands had been (re)classified as residential pursuant to Municipal Zoning Ordinance No. 3 dated 3 May 1982 as approved under Resolution No. 123, series of 1983 dated 4 May 1983 by the Human Settlement Regulatory Commission (now HLURB).  The tax declarations adduced and the certification show that the lands concerned are classified as residential.  There is no discrepancy between the two as regards classification.  Even if there is any inconsistency, what prevails is the determination for zoning purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>There is no question that a local government unit can determine the suitability of a land for residential, commercial, industrial of for other purposes. It can do this through an ordinance passed by the <i>Sanggunian </i>for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>  Moreover, under Section 447 of Republic Act No. 7160, the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> or the Municipal Council, as the legislative body of the municipality, has the power to enact ordinances for the general welfare of the municipality and its inhabitants.  Among the functions of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> enumerated under Section 447 of Republic Act No. 7160 are:<br><br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="justify">Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the municipality as provided for under Section 18 of this Code with particular attention to agro-industrial development and countryside growth and progress, and relative thereto, shall:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(vii)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Adopt a comprehensive land use plan for the municipality: <i>Provided</i>, That the formulation, adoption, or modification of said plan shall be in coordination with the approved provincial comprehensive land use plan;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">(vii) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the municipality subject to the pertinent provision of this Code; x x x.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Under the facts obtaining, this Court agrees with both lower courts that the classification of the lands concerned is residential.  No other certification from the municipal council has been presented to show that a new zoning ordinance has been passed by it changing the present classification of the lands, subject of the expropriation case.  Even if we consider the allegations of petitioner that said lands are actually used for agriculture, and that the lands adjoining the same are all classified as agricultural, the same will not necessarily change said classification to agricultural.<br><br>Even assuming that the lands are still used for agricultural purposes, this will not cause the reversion of the classification of the lands to agricultural. In <i>Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </i>we ruled that the failure of the landowner to complete the housing project did not have the effect of reverting the property to its former classification.  In <i>De Guzman v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> we held that the continuous tillage of the land and the non-commencement of the construction of the market complex did not strip the land of its classification as commercial.  Furthermore, even assuming that all the adjoining lands are still classified as agricultural, this does not mean that lands involved cannot be classified differently, as in this case.  In the certification issued by the Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator/Zoning Administrator of the Municipality of Nasugbu, Batangas, the parcels of land reclassified, including those of Far East and the Bernasconis which petitioner seeks to expropriate, were individually listed.<br><br>We note that petitioner, in its Complaint, classified the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis as Residential/Agricultural, while the properties of Arsol were classified as Agricultural.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>  Petitioner uniformly pegged the zonal valuation of all the lands sought to be expropriated at P75.00 per square meter.  The classification it made for the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis was residential/agricultural, but the zonal valuation was for agricultural lands.  From the tax declarations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> it attached to the complaint, it is clear that the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis were classified as Residential.  Why not use then the zonal valuation for residential, which was P500.00 per square meter?  As to the lands of Arsol, they were classified as agricultural in the tax declarations, so petitioners used the zonal valuation for agricultural lands, which was P75.00 per square meter.  From the foregoing, it can be gathered that from the very inception of this case, petitioner, though knowing that the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis were classified as residential, still used the zonal valuation for agricultural lands (P75.00 per square meter). Petitioner knew that the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis were classified as residential, and this was why it indicated in its complaint the classification "Residential/Agricultural."  It cannot simply do away with the classification made in the tax declaration.  It also used the said classification ("Residential/Agricultural") to justify the zonal value it indicated in the complaint.  Thus, petitioner classified the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis in its own way, contrary to the documents it had.  What further militates against petitioner's claim that the lands of Far East and the Bernasconis are agricultural is the certification of the Office of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator/Zoning Administrator of the Municipality of Nasugbu, Batangas that the said lands have been classified as residential by Municipal Zoning Ordinance No. 3 dated 3 May 1982 as approved under Resolution No. 123, series of 1983 dated 4 May 1983 by the Human Settlement Regulatory Commission (now HLURB).<br><br>Inasmuch as what is involved in this case is the payment of the amount equivalent to 100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, we must distinguish the same from just compensation. In <i>Capitol Steel Corporation v. P</i><i>hividec</i><i> Industrial Authority</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> we ruled:<br><br><blockquote>To clarify, the payment of the provisional value as a prerequisite to the issuance of a writ of possession differs from the payment of just compensation for the expropriated property.  While the provisional value is based on the current relevant zonal valuation, just compensation is based on the prevailing fair market value of the property.  As the appellate court explained:<br><br><blockquote>The first refers to the preliminary or provisional determination of the value of the property.  It serves a double-purpose of pre-payment if the property is fully expropriated, and of an indemnity for damages if the proceedings are dismissed.  It is not a final determination of just compensation and may not necessarily be equivalent to the prevailing fair market value of the property. Of course, it may be a factor to be considered in the determination of just compensation.<br><br>Just compensation, on the other hand, is the final determination of the fair market value of the property.  It has been described as "the just and complete equivalent of the loss which the owner of the thing expropriated has to suffer by reason of the expropriation."  Market values, has also been described in a variety of ways as the "price fixed by the buyer and seller in the open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal trade and competition; the price and value of the article established as shown by sale, public or private, in the ordinary way of business; the fair value of the property between one who desires to purchase and one who desires to sell; the current price; the general or ordinary price for which property may be sold in that locality.<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>As the preliminary or provisional determination of the value of the property equivalent to 100% of the value of the property based on the current relevant zonal valuation of the BIR, said amount serves a double purpose of pre-payment if the property is fully expropriated, and of indemnity for damages if the proceedings are dismissed.  Said provisional value must be paid to the owner of the land before a writ of possession may be issued.  The issuance of a certificate of availability of funds will not suffice for the purpose of issuance of a writ of possession.<br><br>After payment of the provisional amount, the court may now proceed to determine the amount of just compensation.  Petitioner can now present its evidence relative to the properties' fair market value as provided in Section 5 of Republic Act No. 8974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 9 November 2006 in CA-G.R.
