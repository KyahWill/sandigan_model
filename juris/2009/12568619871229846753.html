The latter told them that the appellant was out gathering firewood. They were skeptical because it was not customary to gather firewood on Sundays, and thus waited for the appellant's arrival. They finally saw the appellant at around 1:00 p.m. and invited him to the Bacacay Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> They added that on October 31, 1994, Edgar went to the police station and identified the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On cross examination, SPO4 Bermundo stated that they talked to Fr.

Hipolito advised the appellant to wait for the arrival of the police authorities. Meanwhile, the appellant requested permission to gather firewood for his grandmother. Hipolito agreed because he knew the appellant would not flee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On cross examination, Hipolito maintained that the appellant was alone when he went to his hut. He admitted knowing Bercasio but did not see him with the appellant on October 30, 1994. The appellant proceeded to the "centro of Cabasan" when the police did not arrive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Maura, the appellant's grandmother, testified that the appellant slept in her house in Cabasan, Bacacay, Albay on October 30, 1994. At around 3:00 a.m. on October 30, 1994, she woke the appellant after two (2) stones were thrown at her house. The appellant stood up and got a bolo; she ordered the appellant not to go out because it was still dark. The appellant replied that he would just see who was throwing stones at the house. The appellant went out and returned in the morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> On his return, the appellant did not relate any unusual incident and instead told her that he would gather firewood.

According to her, she slept "very lightly" and would have noticed if the appellant went out of his room. At around 3:00 a.m. of October 30, 1994, she was awakened when stones were thrown at her house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The appellant went out and returned at 6:00 a.m.; the appellant then told her that he came from Visita, a <i>sitio</i> in Cabasan. The appellant told her that he would gather firewood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> According to Maura, she knew that the appellant was involved in the killing of Restituto because he was arrested by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The appellant testified that he did not intend to kill his victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He narrated that in the early morning of October 30, 1994, he was sleeping in his grandmother's house when his grandmother woke him up and asked him to verify the identity of the person throwing stones at the house. He stood up, got a "<i>guinuntin</i>g," and went out to frighten the person throwing stones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  Outside, he saw Restituto standing on their yard. Restituto struck him with a wooden pole, but he parried the blow. Restituto struck him again and this time hit him. The appellant fled, but Restituto chased him. When the appellant felt that Restituto was at the point of catching up with him, he faced him; they were then approaching the appellant's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Restituto swung the wooden pole at him; the appellant countered by swinging his bolo. The appellant hit Restituto who fell to the ground, but he did not know which part of Restituto's body he hit. At this point, the appellant left for home and was not sure whether Restituto was still alive. From his house, he proceeded to the house of the <i>barangay</i> captain to surrender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  However, he returned home when the <i>barangay</i> captain did not open his door. When daylight came, he went again to the <i>barangay</i> captain's house, but did not proceed anymore because many people were around, including Restituto's brother. The appellant returned to his grandmother's house and told her that he would gather firewood. He also told his grandmother of his intention to surrender to <i>barangay tanod</i> Polito Panong (<i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> Panong).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The appellant proceeded to the house of <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> Panong and saw him about to bathe. He told <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> Panong of his intention to surrender and was advised that it would be better to surrender to the police. The appellant requested permission from <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> Panong to gather firewood for his grandmother before surrendering to the police.  He returned to his grandmother's house after gathering firewood and saw three policemen - SPO4 Bermundo, Jimmy Barcelona and Polito Barcoma - there. These policemen handcuffed him and brought him to <i>kagawad</i> Belen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The appellant further stated that the bolo he used in gathering firewood was different from the one that he used in fighting Restituto. The police brought the bolo he used in cutting firewood to the police headquarters; he surrendered the bolo he used in fighting Restituto to the chief of police the day after his detention. He added that the knife recovered by the police was owned by Restituto; he grabbed it from him during their fight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>According to the appellant, he fell down during the fight and it was at this point that Restituto tried to stab him. He hit back causing Restituto to lose his grip on his knife. He reiterated that he had no intention of killing Restituto during the fight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> He also denied that he followed Restituto, Edgar and Fr. Gonzales on their way to the convent in the early morning of October 30, 1994, and claimed that he was sleeping in his house at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The appellant also stated that Fr. Gonzales suspected him of stealing his chicken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> He denied that he and Bercasio hacked Restituto to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On cross examination, the appellant maintained that he slept at around 8:00 p.m. on October 29, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and he did not go to the dance held that night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> He confirmed that his grandmother woke him up at 2:00 a.m. of October 30, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> According to him, he threw the bolo he used in killing Restituto in a grassy place near a banana trunk because he was confused and frightened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> He wanted to surrender to <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> Panong as he did not want to go near the <i>centro</i> because many people were there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>He recalled that when his grandmother woke him up to check on the identity of the person throwing stones, he went outside and saw Restituto standing on the yard and holding a wooden pole;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> he was not then within Restituto's striking stance. Restituto went near him and struck him. He raised his right arm holding a <i>guinunting</i> to parry the blow; Restituto's pole hit the edge of the roof and thus he was not hit. Restituto struck him again and hit him in the chest as he was moving backwards. Immediately after, he ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Eddie, testifying as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution, narrated that at around 9:00 p.m. of October 29, 1994, he, together with the appellant, Erwin, Jerry Batalla, Andy Panong and Sandy Belen went to a dance at Bonga, Bacacay.

The trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses is binding upon this Court, except when the lower court overlooked facts and circumstances of weight and influence that can alter the result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>We carefully scrutinized the records of this case, and found no reason to disbelieve Edgar's straightforward narration of the events surrounding Restituto's death. Nor did we see anything on record indicating any improper motive that would lead Edgar to testify as he did. In fact, in his testimony of December 8, 1995, he categorically stated that he knew the appellant prior to the hacking incident, as they were both residents of <i>Barangay</i> Cabasan. He also testified that that he was just 10 meters from the place where Restituto was first hacked; and that the moon was bright during the incident. Under these circumstances, we have no doubt regarding his positive identification of the appellant as the assailant.<br><br><u><b>The Appellant's Plea of Self-Defense</b></u><br><br>The appellant sought to exculpate himself by claiming that the hacking was an act of self-defense. He maintained that he did not intend to kill Restituto, and that he merely defended himself when the victim struck him with a wooden pole.<br><br>The appellant's arguments fail to convince us.<br><br>As a rule, the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. However, when the accused admits the killing and by way of justification pleads self-defense, the burden of evidence shifts; the accused must then show by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in self-defense.  For that purpose, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Article 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code spells out the elements that the accused must establish by clear and convincing evidence to successfully plead self-defense.  The Article provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 11. <i>Justifying Circumstances</i>. - The following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><ol><li>Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur:<br></li></ol><i>First</i>. Unlawful aggression;<br><br><i>Second.</i> Reasonable necessity of the means to prevent or repel it;<br><br><i>Third</i>. Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>There is unlawful aggression when the peril to one's life, limb or right is either actual or imminent. There must be actual physical force or actual use of a weapon. It is a statutory and doctrinal requirement that, for the justifying circumstance of self-defense, unlawful aggression as a condition <i>sine qua non</i> must be present. There can be no self-defense, complete or incomplete, unless the victim commits an unlawful aggression against the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In the present case, we find that the appellant failed to prove that he had to defend himself against an unlawful aggression. Aside from his own claim (which we find under the circumstances to be unreliable and self-serving), the appellant did not present any other evidence to corroborate his claim that there was an actual or imminent peril to his life or limb, <i>i.e.</i>, that Restituto struck him with a wooden pole when he (appellant) went outside his grandmother's house to check on the identity of the person throwing stones at their house. The appellant also failed to present any evidence to show that the victim hit him on the chest. On the other hand, the number of wounds the victim suffered, 26 in all (a number of which were located in vital parts of the body), belies the appellant's claim that he acted in self- defense.  The location and severity of these wounds also negate the claim of self-defense; these circumstances point to a determined effort to kill, and not simply to defend.<br><br>Even if we assume that the victim was indeed the unlawful aggressor, the appellant's plea of self-defense would still fail for <b>lack of rational equivalence between the means of attack and the means of defense that would characterize the defense as reasonable.</b> The fact that Restituto suffered 21 external wounds and 5 internal wounds on various parts of his body belies the appellant's claim that he was simply warding off the victim's attack by a wooden pole and used his "<i>guinunting</i>" as a means commensurate to the thrusts he avoided. We stress that among the injuries the victim suffered were: a <b>stab wound</b>, 8.5 x 4.5 cm., <b>penetrating the back</b>; <b>amputation</b>, middle third, third digit, right hand; <b>stab wound</b>, 4.5 cm. x 2 cm., <b>umbilical area, penetrating, 5 cm. above the umbilicus</b>; <b>stab wound</b>, 4.5 cm. <b>large intestine</b> with involvement of the mesentery and mesenteric levels; and <b>stab wound</b>, 4.5 cm. <b>head of pancreas</b>. The depth of these wounds shows the force the appellant exerted, while the locations indicate that the thrusts were all meant to kill, not merely to disable the victim.<br><br>In addition, the presence of these multiple <i>stab</i> and <i>hack</i> wounds shows that two weapons were used in assaulting the victim, belying another claim the appellant made - that he was alone (wielding only a <i>guinunting</i>) when he fought Restituto. The number and severity of these wounds in fact confirm Edgar's testimony that two persons - the appellant and Bercasio - attacked and assaulted Restituto, and likewise validate Dr. Beltran's statement that more than one person could have inflicted the wounds. In <i>People v. Carriaga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> we held that self-defense is negated where the nature of the victim's injuries undeniably shows that he was attacked by several assailants armed with weapons of various kinds that were not wielded by the accused alone.<br><br>Self-defense, like alibi, is an inherently weak defense for it is easy to fabricate. Self-defense must be proven by sufficient, satisfactory and convincing evidence that excludes any vestige of criminal aggression on the part of the person invoking it. This type and nature of evidence simply do not obtain in this particular case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Therefore, the appellant's plea of self-defense must fail.<br><br><u><b>The Crime Committed </b></u><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code defines the crime of murder as follows:<br><blockquote>Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>5. With evident premeditation; x x x<br></blockquote>In convicting the appellant of murder, the courts <i>a quo</i> appreciated treachery. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, method or forms which tend directly and especially to ensure its execution, without risk to the offender, arising from the defense that the offended party might make. This definition sets out what must be shown by evidence to conclude that treachery existed, namely: (1) the employment of such means of execution as would give the person attacked no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation; and (2) the deliberate and conscious adoption of the means of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> <b>The essence of this qualifying circumstance is the suddenness, surprise and the lack of expectation that the attack would take place, thus depriving the victim of any real opportunity for self-defense while ensuring the commission of the crime without risk to the aggressor</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The evidence in this case shows that the appellant and another person (later identified as Bercasio) followed Restituto, Edgar, and Fr. Gonzales as they were walking towards the convent situated in Cabasan. The victim himself in fact recognized the appellant, as the former uttered "<i>Renato Bracia</i>" when asked by Fr. Gonzales if he recognized the person following them. When they arrived at the convent, Edgar went inside the convent, while Restituto asked for permission to return home. While the unsuspecting Restituto was on his way home, the appellant and Bercasio attacked and assaulted him with a bolo and knife, respectively.  Restituto initially succeeded in running away, but the appellant and Bercasio caught up with him and continued to hack him until he fell down and died. The manner and mode of attack by the appellant and Bercasio, to our mind, bespeak of treachery; they deprived the victim of any real chance to defend himself, thereby ensuring the commission of the crime without risk to themselves.<br><br>In <i>People v. Vallespin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> we explained:<br><blockquote>The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by the aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself, thereby ensuring its commission without risk to the aggressor and without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim. It can exist even if the attack is frontal, if it is sudden and unexpected, giving the victim no opportunity to defend himself against such attack. <b>In essence, it means that the offended party was not given an opportunity to make a defense.</b><br></blockquote><u><b>Abuse of Superior Strength and Evident Premeditation </b></u><br><br>The Information alleges that the crime was attended by abuse of superior strength.<br><br>We agree.<br><br>Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor and selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime. To take advantage of superior strength means to use purposely excessive force that is out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the evidence shows that Restituto was <i>unarmed</i> when he was attacked by the appellant and Bercasio <i>who were both armed with deadly weapons</i>. The appellant and Bercasio took turns in hacking the victim; the victim was able to momentarily free himself from the assault and run, but his assailants eventually caught up with him. The appellant and Bercasio continued hacking him until he fell down and died. Clearly, Restituto was overwhelmed by the combined efforts of his two (2) assailants who did not only enjoy superiority in number, but also of weapons. Under these circumstances, we have no doubt that there was gross inequality of forces between the victim and his two assailants and that the victim was overwhelmed by forces he could not match.<br><br>While evident premeditation was also alleged in the Information, the courts <i>a quo</i> were correct in not appreciating this circumstance. For evident premeditation to be appreciated, the following elements must be established: (1) the time when the accused determined to commit the crime; (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between decision and execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of his act. Significantly, the prosecution did not even attempt to prove the presence of these elements.<br><br><u><b>The Proper Penalty</b></u><br><br>The crime of murder qualified by treachery is penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by Republic Act No. 7659) with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. The other qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength is deemed absorbed in treachery.<br><br>While evident premeditation and nocturnity were alleged in the Information, these circumstances were not adequately proven. Hence, in the absence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances in the commission of the felony, the court <i>a quo</i> correctly sentenced the appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, conformably with Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><u><b>Civil Liability</b></u><br><br>The grant of civil indemnity for the crime of murder requires no proof other than the fact of death as a result of the crime and proof of the appellant's responsibility therefor. While the RTC and the CA commonly awarded P50,000.00 as death indemnity to the murder victim's heirs, prevailing jurisprudence dictates an award of P75,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Hence, we modify the award of civil indemnity to this extent to be paid by the appellant to the victim's heirs.<br><br>The RTC awarded the amount of P42,300.00 to the victim's heirs as actual damages. It appears that out of the said amount, only P29,320.00 were duly supported by receipts. To be entitled to actual damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable to the injured party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The heirs of the victim are likewise entitled to exemplary damages, since the qualifying circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength were firmly established. When a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance, either qualifying or generic, an award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>We affirm the award of P1,020,000.00 as indemnity for loss of earning capacity to the victim's heirs. As a rule, documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate a claim for loss of earning capacity. By way of exception, damages may be awarded despite the absence of documentary evidence provided that there is testimony that the victim was either (1) self-employed earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws, and judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in the victim's line of work, no documentary evidence is available; or (2) employed as a daily wage worker earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Given Salvacion's testimony that her husband was a <b><i>farmer</i> </b>who earns P5,000.00 monthly for administering his parents' land,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> we hold that his heirs are entitled to an award representing the loss of the victim's earning capacity computed under the following formula:<br><blockquote>Net Earning Capacity = 2/3 <i>x</i> (80 less the age of the victim at the time of death) <i>x </i>(Gross Annual Income less the Reasonable and Necessary Living Expenses)<br></blockquote>The records show that the victim's annual gross income was P60,000.00 per annum computed from his monthly rate of P5,000.00. His reasonable and necessary living expenses are estimated at 50% of this gross income, leaving a balance of P30,000.00. His life expectancy, on the other hand, is assumed to be 2/3 of the age 80 less 29, his age at the time of death. Applying the formula yields the net earning capacity of P1,020,000.00.<br><br>We likewise affirm the award of P50,000.00 as moral damages pursuant to current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of all the foregoing, we hereby <b>AFFIRM</b> the May 30, 2006 Decision of the CA in CA-G.R.
