				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) and Edison (Bataan) Cogeneration Corporation (respondent) entered into a Power Supply and Purchase Agreement (PSPA or agreement) for a 10-year period effective October 25, 1997 whereby respondent undertook to construct, operate, and maintain a power plant which would sell, supply and deliver electricity to PEZA for resale to business locators in the Bataan Economic Processing Zone.<br><br>In the course of the discharge of its obligation, respondent requested from PEZA a tariff increase with a mechanism for adjustment of the cost of fuel and lubricating oil, which request it reiterated on March 5, 2004.<br><br>PEZA did not respond to both requests, however, drawing respondent to write PEZA on May 3, 2004.  Citing a tariff increase which PEZA granted to the East Asia Utilities Corporation (EAUC), another supplier of electricity in the Mactan Economic Zone, respondent informed PEZA of a violation of its obligation under Clause 4.9 of the PSPA not to give preferential treatment to other power suppliers.<br><br>After the lapse of 90 days, respondent terminated the PSPA, invoking its right thereunder, and demanded P708,691,543.00 as pre-termination fee. PEZA disputed respondent's right to terminate the agreement and refused to pay the pre-termination fee, prompting respondent to request PEZA to submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause of the PSPA.<br><br>Petitioner refused to submit to arbitration, however, prompting respondent to file a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against PEZA for specific performance before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay, alleging that, <i>inter alia</i>:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><ol start="4"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Under Clauses 14.1 and 14.2 of the Agreement, the dispute shall be resolved through arbitration before an Arbitration Committee</span> composed of one representative of each party and a third member who shall be mutually acceptable to the parties: x x x<br><br>x x x<br><br></li><li>Conformably with the Agreement, plaintiff notified defendant in a letter dated September 6, 2004 requesting that the parties submit their dispute to arbitration.

No. 876 "explicitly confines the court's authority only to the determination of whether or not there is an agreement in writing providing for arbitration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Given petitioner's admission of the material allegations of respondent's complaint including the existence of a written agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration, the assailed appellate court's affirmance of the trial court's grant of respondent's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is in order.<br><br>Petitioner argues that it tendered an issue in its Answer as it disputed the legality of the pre-termination fee clause of the PSPA.  Even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that the clause is illegal, it would not affect the agreement between petitioner and respondent to resolve their dispute by arbitration.<br><br><blockquote>The doctrine of separability, or severability as other writers call it, enunciates that an arbitration agreement is independent of the main contract.  The arbitration agreement is to be treated as a separate agreement and the arbitration agreement does not automatically terminate when the contract of which it is a part comes to an end.<br><br>The separability of the arbitration agreement is especially significant to the determination of whether the invalidity of the main contract also nullifies the arbitration clause.  Indeed, <u>the doctrine denotes that the invalidity of the main contract, also referred to as the "container" contract, does <b>not</b> affect the validity of the arbitration agreement</u>.  Irrespective of the fact that the main contract is invalid, the arbitration clause/agreement still remains valid and enforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner nevertheless contends that the legality of the pre-termination fee clause is not arbitrable, citing <i>Gonzales v. Climax Mining Ltd.</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which declared that the therein complaint  should be brought before the regular courts, and not before an arbitral tribunal, as it involved a judicial issue.  Held the Court:<br><br><blockquote>We agree that the case should not be brought under the ambit of the Arbitration Law xxx. The question of validity of the contract containing the agreement to submit to arbitration will affect the applicability of the arbitration clause itself.  A party cannot rely on the contract and claim rights or obligations under it and at the same time impugn its existence or validity.  Indeed, litigants are enjoined from taking inconsistent positions.  As previously discussed, the complaint should have been filed before the regular courts as it involved issues which are judicial in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The ruling in <i>Gonzales </i>was, on motion for reconsideration filed by the parties, modified, however, in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The adjudication of the petition in G.R. No. 167994 effectively modifies part of the Decision dated 28 February 2005 in <b>G.R. No. 161957</b>.  Hence, we now hold that <b><u>the validity of the contract </u></b><u>containing the agreement to submit to arbitration <b>does not affect the applicability of the arbitration clause itself</b></u>.  A contrary ruling would suggest that a party's mere repudiation of the main contract is sufficient to avoid arbitration.  That is exactly the situation that the separability doctrine, as well as jurisprudence applying it, seeks to avoid.  We add that when it was declared in <b>G.R. No. 161957 </b>that the case should not be brought for arbitration, it should <u>be clarified that the case referred to is the case actually filed by Gonzales before the DENR Panel of Arbitrators, which was for the <b>nullification of the main contract </b>on the ground of fraud, as it had already been determined that the case should have been brought before the regular courts involving as it did judicial issues.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>It bears noting that respondent does not seek to nullify the main contract.  It merely submits these issues for resolution by the arbitration committee, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li> Whether or not the interest of Claimant in the project or its economic return in its investment was materially reduced as a result of any laws or regulations of the Philippine Government or any agency or body under its control;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the parties failed to reach an agreement on the amendments to the Agreement within 90 days from notice to respondent on May 3, 2004 of the material reduction in claimant's economic return under the Agreement;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not as a result of (a) and (b) above, Claimant is entitled to terminate the Agreement;<br><br></li><li> Whether or not Respondent accorded preferential treatment to EAUC in violation of the Agreement;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not as a result of (d) above, Claimant is entitled to terminate the Agreement;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not Claimant is entitled to a termination fee equivalent to P708,691,543.00; and<br><br></li><li>Who between Claimant and Respondent shall bear the cost and expenses of the arbitration, including arbitrator's fees, administrative expenses and legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>In fine, the issues raised by respondent are subject to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause in the parties' agreement.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup></span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup>,&nbsp; JJ.,&nbsp;</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad, J.</span>, see concurring opinion. <br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 757 dated October 12, 2009.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 765 dated  October 21, 2009.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, pp. 3-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 17-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 52-66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 54-55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 223.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 251-252.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Vicente S.E.

Edison undertook to construct, operate, and maintain a power plant that would supply electricity to establishments operating at the PEZA zone in Bataan.<br><br>On October 22, 2004 Edison filed a complaint for specific performance against PEZA before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City in Civil Case 04-0736-CFM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The complaint alleged in substance that a dispute arose between Edison and PEZA rooted on their agreement that Edison was to supply power to PEZA at a rate that was in some way pegged to what National Power Corporation (NPC) charged its Luzon utility customers.<br><br>Edison further alleged that, because the NPC began in 1999 to yield to popular demand for lower rates than what it costs to generate power, it was compelled to sell the power it produced to PEZA at artificially low rates.  Still Edison managed to make a profit because of NPC's fuel support scheme.  When its side contract with NPC ended, however, Edison claimed that PEZA unjustifiably rejected its request for tariff rate increases to which it was entitled under their agreement.<br><br>Edison also claimed that PEZA granted tariff rate relief to a power supplier in Cebu but would not consider extending such relief to Edison, entitling the latter to terminate their agreement and recover a pre-termination fee of over P708 million.  Because PEZA refused Edison's demand for an end to their agreement and for PEZA to pay pre-termination fee arising from its violation of the agreement, Edison claimed a right to resort to arbitration as their agreement provided.  But PEZA, according to Edison, declined its demands, entitling it to come to court conformably with the terms of their agreement and seek an order for the constitution of a committee of arbitrators to hear their disputes.<br><br>In its answer to the complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  while PEZA admitted that Edison has claims against it for alleged refusal to grant tariff rate adjustments that it had given other power suppliers and that PEZA had refused to pay the pre-termination fee Edison asked, PEZA claimed that the supposed disputes were not proper for arbitration since the pre-termination fee in the agreement was "gravely onerous, unconscionable, greatly disadvantageous to the government, against public policy, and therefore, invalid and unenforceable."<br><br>PEZA further claimed a) that Edison's termination of the agreement was whimsical and baseless, in itself a breach of the agreement; b) that during the negotiations for the requested power rate increase, Edison declined to submit relevant data that PEZA needed to act on the request; c) that, in utter bad faith, Edison cut off power supply to PEZA on August 13, 2004; d) that Edison's motive was to maneuver PEZA into paying its demand for unconscionable and illegal pre-termination fee rather than to get its tariff rate adjusted; and e) that this ill motive was evidenced by the fact that Edison had been negotiating to sell its power engines to NPC even before it asked PEZA for tariff rate adjustment.<br><br>Edison filed a reply and a motion to render judgment on the pleadings, contending that since PEZA did not challenge the fact that there are disputes between the parties, Edison is entitled to a resolution of such disputes by a three-member arbitration committee to be constituted by the RTC.  Acting on this motion and on the belief that PEZA's answer did not tender a genuine issue, on April 5, 2005 the RTC issued an order constituting an Arbitration Committee with Chief Justice Andres Narvasa as chairman and retired Supreme Court Justices Hugo Gutierrez and Jose Y. Feria, as members with power to arbitrate the disputes between Edison and PEZA. The RTC denied PEZA's motion for reconsideration of the order.<br><br>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the latter court affirmed the RTC's order under a decision dated April 10, 2007, prompting PEZA to come to this Court on petition for review by <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>I fully agree with the <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Conchita Carpio Morales in holding that PEZA's answer to the complaint acknowledged the existence of the remedy of arbitration concerning any dispute that might arise between them involving their agreement, in this case, PEZA's alleged refusal to grant Edison tariff rate adjustments as their agreement provided.  PEZA's own answer alleged that it did not yet deny the requested tariff rate adjustments and that the delay in its action on such request had been brought about by Edison's refusal to submit the documents and data required of it.  Whether or not PEZA did deny such request itself actually presents a dispute between the parties.  Arbitration of the disputes between them respecting alleged violations of the agreement is, therefore, inevitable.<br><br>I would like to add, however, that in voting to grant the petition, it is clear to me that the Court does not resolve today the issue that PEZA raises: whether or not the pre-termination clause of its agreement with Edison is "gravely onerous, unconscionable, greatly disadvantageous to the government, against public policy, and therefore, invalid and unenforceable."  In fact, if the Arbitration Committee should uphold its defense that it had not arbitrarily denied Edison's claim for tariff rate adjustment, the issue concerning the invalidity of the pre-termination clause of their agreement may not even come to pass.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> A government-owned corporation created by P.D. 66 (1972).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Complaint, <i>rollo</i>, p. 121, in relation to the Request for Arbitration dated October 20, 2004, p. 260.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Answer, id. at 126.<br></div>
