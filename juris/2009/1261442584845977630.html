				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">"In our predisposition to discover the `original intent' of a statute, courts become the unfeeling pillars of the <i>status quo</i>. Little do we realize that statutes or even constitutions are bundles of compromises thrown our way by their framers. Unless we exercise vigilance, the statute may already be out of tune and irrelevant to our day."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is in this light that we should address the instant case.<br><br>Before the Court is a petition for prohibition and <i>certiorari</i>, with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction, assailing Section 4(a) of Resolution No. 8678 of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). In view of pressing contemporary events, the petition begs for immediate resolution.<br><br><center><b><i>The Antecedents</i></b><br></center><br>This controversy actually stems from the law authorizing the COMELEC to use an automated election system (AES).<br><br>On December 22, 1997, Congress enacted Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8436, entitled "AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS TO USE AN AUTOMATED ELECTION SYSTEM IN THE MAY 11, 1998 NATIONAL OR LOCAL ELECTIONS AND IN SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTORAL EXERCISES, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES." Section 11 thereof reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>Official Ballot</i>.--The Commission shall prescribe the size and form of the official ballot which shall contain the titles of the positions to be filled and/or the propositions to be voted upon in an initiative, referendum or plebiscite. Under each position, the names of candidates shall be arranged alphabetically by surname and uniformly printed using the same type size. A fixed space where the chairman of the Board of Election inspectors shall affix his/her signature to authenticate the official ballot shall be provided.<br><br>Both sides of the ballots may be used when necessary.<br><br><b>For this purpose, the deadline for the filing of certificate of candidacy/petition for registration/manifestation to participate in the election shall not be later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the elections:  <i>Provided,</i> That, any elective official, whether national or local, running for any office other than the one which he/she is holding in a permanent capacity, except for president and vice president, shall be deemed resigned only upon the start of the campaign period corresponding to the position for which he/she is running: <i>Provided, further</i>, That, unlawful acts or omissions applicable to a candidate shall take effect upon the start of the aforesaid campaign period</b>: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That, for purposes of the May 11, 1998 elections, the deadline for filing of the certificate of candidacy for the positions of President, Vice President, Senators and candidates under the Party-List System as well as petitions for registration and/or manifestation to participate in the Party-List System shall be on February 9, 1998 while the deadline for the filing of certificate of candidacy for other positions shall be on March 27, 1998.<br><br>The official ballots shall be printed by the National Printing Office and/or the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> at the price comparable with that of private printers under proper security measures which the Commission shall adopt. The Commission may contract the services of private printers upon certification by the National Printing Office/<i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> that it cannot meet the printing requirements. Accredited political parties and deputized citizens' arms of the Commission may assign watchers in the printing, storage and distribution of official ballots.<br><br>To prevent the use of fake ballots, the Commission through the Committee shall ensure that the serial number on the ballot stub shall be printed in magnetic ink that shall be easily detectable by inexpensive hardware and shall be impossible to reproduce on a photocopying machine and that identification marks, magnetic strips, bar codes and other technical and security markings, are provided on the ballot.<br><br>The official ballots shall be printed and distributed to each city/municipality at the rate of one (1) ballot for every registered voter with a provision of additional four (4) ballots per precinct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]<br><br></sup></blockquote>Almost a decade thereafter, Congress amended the law on January 23, 2007 by enacting R.A. No. 9369, entitled "AN ACT AMENDING REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8436, ENTITLED `AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS TO USE AN AUTOMATED ELECTION SYSTEM IN THE MAY 11, 1998 NATIONAL OR LOCAL ELECTIONS AND IN SUBSEQUENT NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTORAL EXERCISES, TO ENCOURAGE TRANSPARENCY, CREDIBILITY, FAIRNESS AND ACCURACY OF ELECTIONS, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE BATAS PAMPANSA BLG. 881, AS AMEMDED, REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7166 AND OTHER RELATED ELECTION LAWS, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.'" Section 13 of the amendatory law modified Section 11 of R.A. No. 8436, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 13. Section 11 of Republic Act No. 8436 is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br>"Section 15. <i>Official Ballot</i>.--The Commission shall prescribe the format of the electronic display and/or the size and form of the official ballot, which shall contain the titles of the position to be filled and/or the propositions to be voted upon in an initiative, referendum or plebiscite. Where practicable, electronic displays must be constructed to present the names of all candidates for the same position in the same page or screen, otherwise, the electronic displays must be constructed to present the entire ballot to the voter, in a series of sequential pages, and to ensure that the voter sees all of the ballot options on all pages before completing his or her vote and to allow the voter to review and change all ballot choices prior to completing and casting his or her ballot. Under each position to be filled, the names of candidates shall be arranged alphabetically by surname and uniformly indicated using the same type size. The maiden or married name shall be listed in the official ballot, as preferred by the female candidate. Under each proposition to be vote upon, the choices should be uniformly indicated using the same font and size.<br><br>"A fixed space where the chairman of the board of election inspectors shall affix his/her signature to authenticate the official ballot shall be provided.<br><br>"<b>For this purpose, the Commission shall set the deadline for the filing of certificate of candidacy/petition of registration/manifestation to participate in the election.

Accredited political parties and deputized citizens' arms of the Commission shall assign watchers in the printing, storage and distribution of official ballots.<br><br>"To prevent the use of fake ballots, the Commission through the Committee shall ensure that the necessary safeguards, such as, but not limited to, bar codes, holograms, color shifting ink, microprinting, are provided on the ballot.<br><br>"The official ballots shall be printed and distributed to each city/municipality at the rate of one ballot for every registered voter with a provision of additional three ballots per precinct."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]<br><br></sup></blockquote>Pursuant to its constitutional mandate to enforce and administer election laws, COMELEC issued Resolution No. 8678,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Guidelines on the Filing of Certificates of Candidacy (CoC) and Nomination of Official Candidates of Registered Political Parties in Connection with the May 10, 2010 National and Local Elections. Sections 4 and 5 of Resolution No. 8678 provide:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Effects of Filing Certificates of Candidacy</i>.--a) Any person holding a public appointive office or position including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and other officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>b) Any person holding an elective office or position shall not be considered resigned upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy for the same or any other elective office or position.<br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Period for filing Certificate of Candidacy.</i>--The certificate of candidacy shall be filed on regular days, from November 20 to 30, 2009, during office hours, except on the last day, which shall be until midnight.<br><br></blockquote>Alarmed that they will be deemed <i>ipso facto </i>resigned from their offices the moment they file their CoCs, petitioners Eleazar P. Quinto and Gerino A. Tolentino, Jr., who hold appointive positions in the government and who intend to run in the coming elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed the instant petition for prohibition and <i>certiorari,</i> seeking the declaration of the afore-quoted Section 4(a) of Resolution No. 8678 as null and void.<br><br><center><b><i>The Petitioners' Contention</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioners contend that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion when it issued the assailed Resolution. They aver that the advance filing of CoCs for the 2010 elections is intended merely for the purpose of early printing of the official ballots in order to cope with time limitations. Such advance filing does not automatically make the person who filed the CoC a candidate at the moment of filing. In fact, the law considers him a candidate only at the start of the campaign period. Petitioners then assert that this being so, they should not be deemed <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from their government offices when they file their CoCs, because at such time they are not yet treated by law as candidates. They should be considered resigned from their respective offices only at the start of the campaign period when they are, by law, already considered as candidates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also contend that Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369, the basis of the assailed COMELEC resolution, contains two conflicting provisions. These must be harmonized or reconciled to give effect to both and to arrive at a declaration that they are not <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from their positions upon the filing of their CoCs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further posit that the provision considering them as <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from office upon the filing of their CoCs is discriminatory and violates the equal protection clause in the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br></center><br>On the procedural aspect of the petition, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), representing respondent COMELEC, argues that petitioners have no legal standing to institute the suit.  Petitioners have not yet filed their CoCs, hence, they are not yet affected by the assailed provision in the COMELEC resolution. The OSG further claims that the petition is premature or unripe for judicial determination.  Petitioners have admitted that they are merely planning to file their CoCs for the coming 2010 elections. Their interest in the present controversy is thus merely speculative and contingent upon the filing of the same. The OSG likewise contends that petitioners availed of the wrong remedy. They are questioning an issuance of the COMELEC made in the exercise of the latter's rule-making power. <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is then an improper remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On the substantive aspect, the OSG maintains that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in phrasing Section 4(a) of Resolution No. 8678 for it merely copied what is in the law. The OSG, however, agrees with petitioners that there is a conflict in Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369 that should be resolved. According to the OSG, there seems to be no basis to consider appointive officials as <i>ipso facto</i> resigned and to require them to vacate their positions on the same day that they file their CoCs, because they are not yet considered as candidates at that time. Further, this "deemed resigned" provision existed in <i>Batas Pambansa Bilang </i>(B.P.<i> Blg</i>.) 881, and no longer finds a place in our present election laws with the innovations brought about by the automated system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br><center>I.<br></center><br>At first glance, the petition suffers from an incipient procedural defect. What petitioners assail in their petition is a resolution issued by the COMELEC in the exercise of its quasi-legislative power. <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64, cannot be availed of, because it is a remedy to question decisions, resolutions and issuances made in the exercise of a judicial or quasi-judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Prohibition is also an inappropriate remedy, because what petitioners actually seek from the Court is a determination of the proper construction of a statute and a declaration of their rights thereunder. Obviously, their petition is one for declaratory relief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> over which this Court does not exercise original jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>However, petitioners raise a challenge on the constitutionality of the questioned provisions of both the COMELEC resolution and the law. Given this scenario, the Court may step in and resolve the instant petition.<br><br>The transcendental nature and paramount importance of the issues raised and the compelling state interest involved in their early resolution--the period for the filing of CoCs for the 2010 elections has already started and hundreds of civil servants intending to run for elective offices are to lose their employment, thereby causing imminent and irreparable damage to their means of livelihood and, at the same time, crippling the government's manpower--further dictate that the Court must, for propriety, if only from a sense of obligation, entertain the petition so as to expedite the adjudication of all, especially the constitutional, issues.<br><br>In any event, the Court has ample authority to set aside errors of practice or technicalities of procedure and resolve the merits of a case. Repeatedly stressed in our prior decisions is the principle that the Rules were promulgated to provide guidelines for the orderly administration of justice, not to shackle the hand that dispenses it. Otherwise, the courts would be consigned to being mere slaves to technical rules, deprived of their judicial discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>To put things in their proper perspective, it is imperative that we trace the brief history of the assailed provision. Section 4(a) of COMELEC Resolution No. 8678 is a reproduction of the second proviso in the third paragraph of Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369, which for ready reference is quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>For this purpose, the Commission shall set the deadline for the filing of certificate of candidacy/petition for registration/manifestation to participate in the election. Any person who files his certificate of candidacy within this period shall only be considered as a candidate at the start of the campaign period for which he filed his certificate of candidacy: <i>Provided</i>, That, unlawful acts or omissions applicable to a candidate shall take effect only upon the start of the aforesaid campaign period:<b> <i>Provided, finally</i>, That any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the armed forces, and officers and employees in government-owned or -controlled corporations, shall be considered <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from his/her office and must vacate the same at the start of the day of the filing of his/her certificate of candidacy</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Notably, this proviso is not present in Section 11 of R.A. No. 8436, the law amended by R.A. No. 9369. The proviso was lifted from Section 66 of <i>B.P. Blg.</i> 881 or the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) of the Philippines, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 66. <i>Candidates holding appointive office or position</i>.--Any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br></blockquote><br>It may be recalled--in inverse chronology--that earlier, Presidential Decree No. 1296, or the 1978 Election Code, contained a similar provision, thus--<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 29. Candidates holding appointive office or position. -- Every person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall <i>ipso facto</i> cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy. Members of the Cabinet shall continue in the offices they presently hold notwithstanding the filing of certificate of candidacy, subject to the pleasure of the President of the Philippines.<br></blockquote><br>Much earlier, R.A. No. 6388, or the Election Code of 1971, likewise stated in its Section 23 the following:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 23. Candidates Holding Appointive Office or Position. -- Every person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and every officer or employee in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall <i>ipso facto</i> cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy: Provided, That the filing of a certificate of candidacy shall not affect whatever civil, criminal or administrative liabilities which he may have incurred.</blockquote><br>Going further back in history, R.A. No. 180, or the Revised Election Code approved on June 21, 1947, also provided that--<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 26. Automatic cessation of appointive officers and employees who are candidates. -- Every person holding a public appointive office or position shall <i>ipso facto</i> cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy.</blockquote><br>During the Commonwealth era, Commonwealth Act (C.A.) No. 725, entitled "AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE NEXT ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, SENATORS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND APPROPRIATING THE NECESSARY FUNDS THEREFOR," approved on January 5, 1946, contained, in the last paragraph of its Section 2, the following:<br><blockquote>A person occupying any civil office by appointment in the government or any of its political subdivisions or agencies or government-owned or controlled corporations, whether such office by appointive or elective, shall be considered to have resigned from such office from the moment of the filing of such certificate of candidacy.</blockquote><br>Significantly, however, C.A. No. 666, entitled "AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE FIRST ELECTION FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, SENATORS, AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND THE AMENDMENTS THEREOF," enacted without executive approval on June 22, 1941, the precursor of C.A. No. 725, only provided for automatic resignation of elective, but not appointive, officials.<br><br>Nevertheless, C.A. No. 357, or the Election Code approved on August 22, 1938, had, in its Section 22, the same verbatim provision as Section 26 of R.A. No. 180.<br><br>The earliest recorded Philippine law on the subject is Act No. 1582, or the Election Law enacted by the Philippine Commission in 1907, the last paragraph of Section 29 of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 29. <i>Penalties upon officers.</i>-- x x x.<br><br>No public officer shall offer himself as a candidate for election, nor shall he be eligible during the time that he holds said public office to election, at any municipal, provincial or Assembly election, except for reelection to the position which he may be holding, and no judge of the Court of First Instance, justice of the peace, provincial fiscal, or officer or employee of the Bureau of Constabulary or of the Bureau of Education shall aid any candidate or influence in any manner or take any part in any municipal, provincial, or Assembly election under penalty of being deprived of his office and being disqualified to hold any public office whatever for a term of five years: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the foregoing provisions shall not be construed to deprive any person otherwise qualified of the right to vote at any election.</blockquote><br>From this brief historical excursion, it may be gleaned that the second proviso in the third paragraph of Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369--<i>t</i><i>hat any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the armed forces, and officers, and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his/her office and must vacate the same at the start of the day of the filing of his/her certificate of candidacy</i>--traces its roots to the period of the American occupation.<br><br>In fact, during the deliberations of Senate Bill No. 2231, the bill later to be consolidated with House Bill No. 5352 and enacted as R.A. No. 9369, Senator Richard Gordon, the principal author of the bill, acknowledged that the said proviso in the proposed legislative measure is an old provision which was merely copied from earlier existing legislation, thus--<br><br><blockquote><i>Senator Osmeña</i>.  May I just opine here and perhaps obtain the opinion of the good Sponsor.  This reads like, "ANY PERSON HOLDING [<i>means currently</i>] A PUBLIC APPOINTIVE POSITION... SHALL BE CONSIDERED IPSO FACTO RESIGNED" [which means that the prohibition extends only to appointive officials] "INCLUDING ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES"... This is a prohibition, Mr. President.  This means if one is chairman of SSS or PDIC, he is deemed ipso facto resigned when he files his certificate of candidacy.  Is that the intention?<br><br><i>Senator Gordon</i>.  This is really an old provision, Mr. President.<br><br><i>Senator Osmeña</i>.  It is in bold letters, so I think it was a Committee amendment.<br><br><i>Senator Gordon</i>.  No, it has always been there.<br><br><i>Senator Osmeña</i>.  I see.<br><br><i>Senator Gordon</i>.  I guess the intention is not to give them undue advantage, especially certain people.<br><br><i>Senator Osmeña</i>.  All right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>In that Senate deliberation, however, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago expressed her concern over the inclusion of the said provision in the new law, given that the same would be disadvantageous and unfair to potential candidates holding appointive positions, while it grants a consequent preferential treatment to elective officials, thus--<br><br><blockquote><i>Senator Santiago</i>.  On page 15, line 31, I know that this is a losing cause, so I make this point more as a matter of record than of any feasible hope that it can possibly be either accepted or if we come to a division of the House, it will be upheld by the majority.<br><br>I am referring to page 15, line 21.  The proviso begins:  "<i>PROVIDED FINALLY, </i>THAT ANY PERSON HOLDING A PUBLIC APPOINTIVE OFFICE...SHALL BE CONSIDERED IPSO FACTO RESIGNED FROM HIS/HER OFFICE."<br><br>The point that I made during the appropriate debate in the past in this Hall is that there is, for me, no valid reason for exempting elective officials from this inhibition or disqualification imposed by the law.  If we are going to consider appointive officers of the government, including AFP members and officers of government-owned and controlled corporations, or any other member of the appointive sector of the civil service, why should it not apply to the elective sector for, after all, even senators and congressmen are members of the civil service as well?<br><br>Further, it is self-serving for the Senate, or for the Congress in general, to give an exception to itself which is not available to other similarly situated officials of government.  Of course, the answer is, the reason why we are special is that we are elected.  Since we are imposing a disqualification on all other government officials except ourselves, I think, it is the better part of <i>delicadeza </i>to inhibit ourselves as well, so that if we want to stay as senators, we wait until our term expires.  But  if we want to run for some other elective office during our term, then we have to be considered resigned just like everybody else.  That is my proposed amendment.  But if it is unacceptable to the distinguished Sponsor, because of sensitivity to the convictions of the rest of our colleagues, I will understand.<br><br><i>Senator Gordon</i>. Mr. President, I think the suggestion is well-thought of.  It is a good policy.  However, this is something that is already in the old law which was upheld by the Supreme court in a recent case that the rider was not upheld and that it was valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>The obvious inequality brought about by the provision on automatic resignation of appointive civil servants must have been the reason why Senator Recto proposed the inclusion of the following during the period of amendments: "ANY PERSON WHO FILES HIS CERTIFICATE OF CANDIDACY WITHIN THIS PERIOD SHALL ONLY BE CONSIDERED AS A CANDIDATE AT THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN PERIOD FOR WHICH HE FILED HIS COC."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The said proviso seems to mitigate the situation of disadvantage afflicting appointive officials by considering persons who filed their CoCs as candidates only at the start of the campaign period, thereby, conveying the tacit intent that persons holding appointive positions will only be considered as resigned at the start of the campaign period when they are already treated by law as candidates.<br><br>Parenthetically, it may be remembered that Section 67 of the OEC and Section 11 of R.A. No. 8436 contained a similar provision on automatic resignation of elective officials upon the filing of their CoCs for any office other than that which they hold in a permanent capacity or for President or Vice-President. However, with the enactment of R.A. No. 9006, or the Fair Election Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in 2001, this provision was repealed by Section 14<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the said act. There was, thus, created a situation of obvious discrimination against appointive officials who were deemed <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from their offices upon the filing of their CoCs, while elective officials were not.<br><br>This situation was incidentally addressed by the Court in <i>Fariñas v. The Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> when it ruled that--<br><br><blockquote><i>Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 9006</i><br><i>Is Not Violative of the Equal</i><br><i>Protection Clause of the Constitution</i><br><br>The petitioners' contention, that the repeal of Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code pertaining to elective officials gives undue benefit to such officials as against the appointive ones and violates the equal protection clause of the constitution, is tenuous.<br><br>The equal protection of the law clause in the Constitution is not absolute, but is subject to reasonable classification.  If the groupings are characterized by substantial distinctions that make real differences, one class may be treated and regulated differently from the other. The Court has explained the nature of the equal protection guarantee in this manner:<br><blockquote>The equal protection of the law clause is against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality.  It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate.  It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, <i>under like circumstances and conditions</i> both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.  The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable grounds exist for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.<br></blockquote>Substantial distinctions clearly exist between elective officials and appointive officials. The former occupy their office by virtue of the mandate of the electorate. They are elected to an office for a definite term and may be removed therefrom only upon stringent conditions. On the other hand, appointive officials hold their office by virtue of their designation thereto by an appointing authority.  Some appointive officials hold their office in a permanent capacity and are entitled to security of tenure while others serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority.<br><br>Another substantial distinction between the two sets of officials is that under Section 55, Chapter 8, Title I, Subsection A. Civil Service Commission, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292), appointive officials, as officers and employees in the civil service, are strictly prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote. Under the same provision, elective officials, or officers or employees holding political offices, are obviously expressly allowed to take part in political and electoral activities.<br><br>By repealing Section 67 but retaining Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, the legislators deemed it proper to treat these two classes of officials differently with respect to the effect on their tenure in the office of the filing of the certificates of candidacy for any position other than those occupied by them. Again, it is not within the power of the Court to pass upon or look into the wisdom of this classification.<br><br>Since the classification justifying Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 9006, <i>i.e.</i>, elected officials <i>vis-a-vis</i> appointive officials, is anchored upon material and significant distinctions and all the persons belonging under the same classification are similarly treated, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is, thus, not infringed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>However, it must be remembered that the Court, in <i>Fariñas</i>, was intently focused on the main issue of whether the repealing clause in the Fair Election Act was a constitutionally proscribed rider, in that it unwittingly failed to ascertain with stricter scrutiny the impact of the retention of the provision on automatic resignation of persons holding appointive positions (Section 66) in the OEC, vis-à-vis the equal protection clause.  Moreover, the Court's vision in <i>Fariñas</i> was shrouded by the fact that petitioners therein, Fariñas et al., never posed a direct challenge to the constitutionality of Section 66 of the OEC. Fariñas et al. rather merely questioned, on constitutional grounds, the repealing clause, or Section 14 of the Fair Election Act. The Court's afore-quoted declaration in <i>Fariñas</i> may then very well be considered as an <i>obiter dictum</i>.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The instant case presents a rare opportunity for the Court, in view of the constitutional challenge advanced by petitioners, once and for all, to settle the issue of whether the second proviso in the third paragraph of Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369, a reproduction of Section 66 of the OEC, which, as shown above, was based on provisions dating back to the American occupation, is violative of the equal protection clause.<br><br>But before delving into the constitutional issue, we shall first address the issues on legal standing and on the existence of an actual controversy.<br><br>Central to the determination of <i>locus standi</i> is the question of whether a party has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this case, petitioners allege that they will be directly affected by COMELEC Resolution No. 8678 for they intend, and they all have the qualifications, to run in the 2010 elections. The OSG, for its part, contends that since petitioners have not yet filed their CoCs, they are not yet candidates; hence, they are not yet directly affected by the assailed provision in the COMELEC resolution.<br><br>The Court, nevertheless, finds that, while petitioners are not yet candidates, they have the standing to raise the constitutional challenge, simply because they are qualified voters. A restriction on candidacy, such as the challenged measure herein, affects the rights of voters to choose their public officials. The rights of voters and the rights of candidates do not lend themselves to neat separation; laws that affect candidates always have at least some theoretical, correlative effect on voters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court believes that both candidates and voters may challenge, on grounds of equal protection,  the assailed measure because of its impact on voting rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In any event, in recent cases, this Court has relaxed the stringent direct injury test and has observed a liberal policy allowing ordinary citizens, members of Congress, and civil organizations to prosecute actions involving the constitutionality or validity of laws, regulations and rulings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>We have also stressed in our prior decisions that the exercise by this Court of judicial power is limited to the determination and resolution of actual cases and controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Court, in this case, finds that an actual case or controversy exists between the petitioners and the COMELEC, the body charged with the enforcement and administration of all election laws. Petitioners have alleged in a precise manner that they would engage in the very acts that would trigger the enforcement of the provision--they would file their CoCs and run in the 2010 elections. Given that the assailed provision provides for <i>ipso facto</i> resignation upon the filing of the CoC, it cannot be said that it presents only a speculative or hypothetical obstacle to petitioners' candidacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>Having hurdled what the OSG posed as obstacles to judicial review, the Court now delves into the constitutional challenge.<br><br>It is noteworthy to point out that the right to run for public office touches on two fundamental freedoms, those of expression and of association. This premise is best explained in <i>Mancuso v. Taft</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> viz.:<br><br><blockquote>Freedom of expression guarantees to the individual the opportunity to write a letter to the local newspaper, speak out in a public park, distribute handbills advocating radical reform, or picket an official building to seek redress of grievances. All of these activities are protected by the First Amendment if done in a manner consistent with a narrowly defined concept of public order and safety. The choice of means will likely depend on the amount of time and energy the individual wishes to expend and on his perception as to the most effective method of projecting his message to the public. But interest and commitment are evolving phenomena. What is an effective means for protest at one point in time may not seem so effective at a later date. The dilettante who participates in a picket line may decide to devote additional time and resources to his expressive activity. As his commitment increases, the means of effective expression changes, but the expressive quality remains constant. He may decide to lead the picket line, or to publish the newspaper. At one point in time he may decide that the most effective way to give expression to his views and to get the attention of an appropriate audience is to become a candidate for public office-means generally considered among the most appropriate for those desiring to effect change in our governmental systems. He may seek to become a candidate by filing in a general election as an independent or by seeking the nomination of a political party. And in the latter instance, the individual's expressive activity has two dimensions: besides urging that his views be the views of the elected public official, he is also attempting to become a spokesman for a political party whose substantive program extends beyond the particular office in question. But Cranston has said that a certain type of its citizenry, the public employee, may not become a candidate and may not engage in any campaign activity that promotes himself as a candidate for public office. Thus the city has stifled what may be the most important expression an individual can summon, namely that which he would be willing to effectuate, by means of concrete public action, were he to be selected by the voters.<br><br>It is impossible to ignore the additional fact that the right to run for office also affects the freedom to associate. In Williams v. Rhodes, <i>supra</i>, the Court used strict review to invalidate an Ohio election system that made it virtually impossible for third parties to secure a place on the ballot. The Court found that the First Amendment protected the freedom to associate by forming and promoting a political party and that that freedom was infringed when the state effectively denied a party access to its electoral machinery. The Cranston charter provision before us also affects associational rights, albeit in a slightly different way. An individual may decide to join or participate in an organization or political party that shares his beliefs. He may even form a new group to forward his ideas. And at some juncture his supporters and fellow party members may decide that he is the ideal person to carry the group's standard into the electoral fray. To thus restrict the options available to political organization as the Cranston charter provision has done is to limit the effectiveness of association; and the freedom to associate is intimately related with the concept of making expression effective. Party access to the ballot becomes less meaningful if some of those selected by party machinery to carry the party's programs to the people are precluded from doing so because those nominees are civil servants.<br><br>Whether the right to run for office is looked at from the point of view of individual expression or associational effectiveness, wide opportunities exist for the individual who seeks public office. The fact of candidacy alone may open previously closed doors of the media. The candidate may be invited to discuss his views on radio talk shows; he may be able to secure equal time on television to elaborate his campaign program; the newspapers may cover his candidacy; he may be invited to debate before various groups that had theretofore never heard of him or his views. In short, the fact of candidacy opens up a variety of communicative possibilities that are not available to even the most diligent of picketers or the most loyal of party followers. A view today, that running for public office is not an interest protected by the First Amendment, seems to us an outlook stemming from an earlier era when public office was the preserve of the professional and the wealthy. Consequently we hold that candidacy is both a protected First Amendment right and a fundamental interest. Hence any legislative classification that significantly burdens that interest must be subjected to strict equal protection review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, petitioners' interest in running for public office, an interest protected by Sections 4 and 8 of Article III of the Constitution, is breached by the proviso in Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369. It is now the opportune time for the Court to strike down the said proviso for being violative of the equal protection clause and for being overbroad.<br><br>In considering persons holding appointive positions as <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from their posts upon the filing of their CoCs, but not considering as resigned all other civil servants, specifically the elective ones, the law unduly discriminates against the first class. The fact alone that there is substantial distinction between those who hold appointive positions and those occupying elective posts, does not justify such differential treatment.<br><br>In order that there can be valid classification so that a discriminatory  governmental act may pass the constitutional norm of equal protection, it is necessary that the four (4) requisites of valid classification be complied with, namely:<br><blockquote>(1) It must be based upon substantial distinctions;<br>(2) It must be germane to the purposes of the law;<br>(3) It must not be limited to existing conditions only; and<br>(4) It must apply equally to all members of the class.<br></blockquote>The first requirement means that there must be real and substantial differences between the classes treated differently. As illustrated in the fairly recent <i>Mirasol v. Department of Public Works and Highways</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> a real and substantial distinction exists between a motorcycle and other motor vehicles sufficient to justify its classification among those prohibited from plying the toll ways. Not all motorized vehicles are created equal--a two-wheeled vehicle is less stable and more easily overturned than a four-wheel vehicle.<br><br>Nevertheless, the classification would still be invalid if it does not comply with the second requirement--if it is not germane to the purpose of the law. Justice Isagani A. Cruz (Ret.), in his treatise on constitutional law, explains,<br><br><blockquote>The classification, even if based on substantial distinctions, will still be invalid if it is not germane to the purpose of the law. To illustrate, the accepted difference in physical stamina between men and women will justify the prohibition of the latter from employment as miners or stevedores or in other heavy and strenuous work. On the basis of this same classification, however, the law cannot provide for a lower passing average for women in the bar examinations because physical strength is not the test for admission to the legal profession. Imported cars may be taxed at a higher rate than locally assembled automobiles for the protection of the national economy, but their difference in origin is no justification for treating them differently when it comes to punishing violations of traffic regulations. The source of the vehicle has no relation to the observance of these rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>The third requirement means that the classification must be enforced not only for the present but as long as the problem sought to be corrected continues to exist. And, under the last requirement, the classification would be regarded as invalid if all the members of the class are not treated similarly, both as to rights conferred and obligations imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Applying the four requisites to the instant case, the Court finds that the differential treatment of persons holding appointive offices as opposed to those holding elective ones is not germane to the purposes of the law.<br><br>The obvious reason for the challenged provision is to prevent the use of a governmental position to promote one's candidacy, or even to wield a dangerous or coercive influence on the electorate. The measure is further aimed at promoting the efficiency, integrity, and discipline of the public service by eliminating the danger that the discharge of official duty would be motivated by political considerations rather than the welfare of the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The restriction is also justified by the proposition that the entry of civil servants to the electoral arena, while still in office, could result in neglect or inefficiency in the performance of duty because they would be attending to their campaign rather than to their office work.<br><br>If we accept these as the underlying objectives of the law, then the assailed provision cannot be constitutionally rescued on the ground of valid classification. Glaringly absent is the requisite that the classification must be germane to the purposes of the law. Indeed, whether one holds an appointive office or an elective one, the evils sought to be prevented by the measure remain. For example, the Executive Secretary, or any Member of the Cabinet for that matter, could wield the same influence as the Vice-President who at the same time is appointed to a Cabinet post (in the recent past, elected Vice-Presidents were appointed to take charge of national housing, social welfare development, interior and local government, and foreign affairs). With the fact that they both head executive offices, there is no valid justification to treat them differently when both file their CoCs for the elections. Under the present state of our law, the Vice-President, in the example, running this time, let us say, for President, retains his position during the entire election period and can still use the resources of his office to support his campaign.<br><br>As to the danger of neglect, inefficiency or partisanship in the discharge of the functions of his appointive office, the inverse could be just as true and compelling.  The public officer who files his certificate of candidacy would be driven by a greater impetus for excellent performance to show his fitness for the position aspired for.<br><br><i>Mancuso v. Taft</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> cited above, explains that the measure on automatic resignation, which restricts the rights of civil servants to run for office--a right inextricably linked to their freedom of expression and association, is not reasonably necessary to the satisfaction of the state interest. Thus, in striking down a similar measure in the United States, <i>Mancuso </i>succinctly declares--<br><br><blockquote>In proceeding to the second stage of active equal protection review, however, we do see some contemporary relevance of the <i>Mitchell</i> decision. <i>National Ass'n of Letter Carriers, supra</i>. In order for the Cranston charter provision to withstand strict scrutiny, the city must show that the exclusion of all government employees from candidacy is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest. And, as stated in <i>Mitchell</i> and other cases dealing with similar statutes, <i>see Wisconsin State Employees, supra; Broadrick, supra</i>, government at all levels has a substantial interest in protecting the integrity of its civil service. It is obviously conceivable that the impartial character of the civil service would be seriously jeopardized if people in positions of authority used their discretion to forward their electoral ambitions rather than the public welfare. Similarly if a public employee pressured other fellow employees to engage in corrupt practices in return for promises of post-election reward, or if an employee invoked the power of the office he was seeking to extract special favors from his superiors, the civil service would be done irreparable injury. Conversely, members of the public, fellow-employees, or supervisors might themselves request favors from the candidate or might improperly adjust their own official behavior towards him. Even if none of these abuses actually materialize, the possibility of their occurrence might seriously erode the public's confidence in its public employees. For the reputation of impartiality is probably as crucial as the impartiality itself; the knowledge that a clerk in the assessor's office who is running for the local zoning board has access to confidential files which could provide "pressure" points for furthering his campaign is destructive regardless of whether the clerk actually takes advantage of his opportunities. For all of these reasons we find that the state indeed has a compelling interest in maintaining the honesty and impartiality of its public work force.<br><br>We do not, however, consider the exclusionary measure taken by Cranston-a flat prohibition on office-seeking of all kinds by all kinds of public employees-as even reasonably necessary to satisfaction of this state interest. As Justice Marshall pointed out in Dunn v. Blumstein, "[s]tatutes affecting constitutional rights must be drawn with `precision.'" For three sets of reasons we conclude that the Cranston charter provision pursues its objective in a far too heavy-handed manner and hence must fall under the equal protection clause. First, we think the nature of the regulation-a broad prophylactic rule-may be unnecessary to fulfillment of the city's objective. Second, even granting some sort of prophylactic rule may be required, the provision here prohibits candidacies for all types of public office, including many which would pose none of the problems at which the law is aimed. Third, the provision excludes the candidacies of all types of public employees, without any attempt to limit exclusion to those employees whose positions make them vulnerable to corruption and conflicts of interest.</blockquote><br>There is thus no valid justification to treat appointive officials differently from the elective ones.  The classification simply fails to meet the test that it should be germane to the purposes of the law.  The measure encapsulated in the second proviso of the third paragraph of Section 13 of R.A. No. 9369 and in Section 66 of the OEC violates the equal protection clause.<br><br><center>V.<br></center><br>The challenged provision also suffers from the infirmity of being overbroad.<br><br>First, the provision pertains to all civil servants holding appointive posts without distinction as to whether they occupy high positions in government or not. Certainly, a utility worker in the government will also be considered as <i>ipso facto</i> resigned once he files his CoC for the 2010 elections. This scenario is absurd for, indeed, it is unimaginable how he can use his position in the government to wield influence in the political world.<br><br>While it may be admitted that most appointive officials who seek public elective office are those who occupy relatively high positions in government, laws cannot be legislated for them alone, or with them alone in mind.  For the right to seek public elective office is universal, open and unrestrained, subject only to the qualification standards prescribed in the Constitution and in the laws.  These qualifications are, as we all know, general and basic so as to allow the widest participation of the citizenry and to give free rein for the pursuit of one's highest aspirations to public office.  Such is the essence of democracy.<br><br>Second, the provision is directed to the activity of seeking any and all public offices, whether they be partisan or nonpartisan in character, whether they be in the national, municipal or <i>barangay</i> level. Congress has not shown a compelling state interest to restrict the fundamental right involved on such a sweeping scale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Specific evils require specific treatments, not through overly broad measures that unduly restrict guaranteed freedoms of the citizenry. After all, sovereignty resides in the people, and all governmental power emanates from them.<br><br><i>Mancuso v. Taft</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> on this point, instructs--<br><br><blockquote>As to approaches less restrictive than a prophylactic rule, there exists the device of the leave of absence. Some system of leaves of absence would permit the public employee to take time off to pursue his candidacy while assuring him his old job should his candidacy be unsuccessful. Moreover, a leave of absence policy would eliminate many of the opportunities for engaging in the questionable practices that the statute is designed to prevent. While campaigning, the candidate would feel no conflict between his desire for election and his publicly entrusted discretion, nor any conflict between his efforts to persuade the public and his access to confidential documents. But instead of adopting a reasonable leave of absence policy, Cranston has chosen a provision that makes the public employee cast off the security of hard-won public employment should he desire to compete for elected office.<br><br>The city might also promote its interest in the integrity of the civil service by enforcing, through dismissal, discipline, or criminal prosecution, rules or statutes that treat conflict of interests, bribery, or other forms of official corruption. By thus attacking the problem directly, instead of using a broad prophylactic rule, the city could pursue its objective without unduly burdening the First Amendment rights of its employees and the voting rights of its citizens. Last term in Dunn v. Blumstein, the Supreme Court faced an analogous question when the State of Tennessee asserted that the interest of "ballot box purity" justified its imposition of one year and three month residency requirements before a citizen could vote. Justice Marshall stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that Tennessee had available a number of criminal statutes that could be used to punish voter fraud without unnecessary infringement on the newcomer's right to vote. Similarly, it appears from the record in this case that the Cranston charter contains some provisions that might be used against opportunistic public employees.<br><br>Even if some sort of prophylactic rule is necessary, we cannot say that Cranston has put much effort into tailoring a narrow provision that attempts to match the prohibition with the problem. The charter forbids a Cranston public employee from running for any office, anywhere. The prohibition is not limited to the local offices of Cranston, but rather extends to statewide offices and even to national offices. It is difficult for us to see that a public employee running for the United States Congress poses quite the same threat to the civil service as would the same employee if he were running for a local office where the contacts and information provided by his job related directly to the position he was seeking, and hence where the potential for various abuses was greater. Nor does the Cranston charter except the public employee who works in Cranston but aspires to office in another local jurisdiction, most probably his town of residence. Here again the charter precludes candidacies which can pose only a remote threat to the civil service. Finally, the charter does not limit its prohibition to partisan office-seeking, but sterilizes also those public employees who would seek nonpartisan elective office. The statute reviewed in <i>Mitchell</i> was limited to partisan political activity, and since that time other courts have found the partisan-nonpartisan distinction a material one. <i>See Kinnear, supra; Wisconsin State Employees, supra;</i> <i>Gray v. Toledo</i>, supra. While the line between nonpartisan and partisan can often be blurred by systems whose true characters are disguised by the names given them by their architects, it seems clear that the concerns of a truly partisan office and the temptations it fosters are sufficiently different from those involved in an office removed from regular party politics to warrant distinctive treatment in a charter of this sort.<br><br>The third and last area of excessive and overinclusive coverage of the Cranston charter relates not to the type of office sought, but to the type of employee seeking the office. As Justice Douglas pointed out in his dissent in <i>Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 120-126, 67 S.Ct. 556,</i> restrictions on administrative employees who either participate in decision-making or at least have some access to information concerning policy matters are much more justifiable than restrictions on industrial employees, who, but for the fact that the government owns the plant they work in, are, for purposes of access to official information, identically situated to all other industrial workers. Thus, a worker in the Philadelphia mint could be distinguished from a secretary in an office of the Department of Agriculture; so also could a janitor in the public schools of Cranston be distinguished from an assistant comptroller of the same city. A second line of distinction that focuses on the type of employee is illustrated by the cases of <i>Kinnear</i> and <i>Minielly, supra.</i> In both of these cases a civil service deputy decided to run for the elected office of sheriff. The courts in both cases felt that the no-candidacy laws in question were much too broad and indicated that perhaps the only situation sensitive enough to justify a flat rule was one in which an inferior in a public office electorally challenged his immediate superior. Given all these considerations, we think Cranston has not given adequate attention to the problem of narrowing the terms of its charter to deal with the specific kinds of conflict-of-interest problems it seeks to avoid.<br><br>We also do not find convincing the arguments that after-hours campaigning will drain the energy of the public employee to the extent that he is incapable of performing his job effectively and that inevitable on-the-job campaigning and discussion of his candidacy will disrupt the work of others. Although it is indisputable that the city has a compelling interest in the performance of official work, the exclusion is not well-tailored to effectuate that interest. Presumably the city could fire the individual if he clearly shirks his employment responsibilities or disrupts the work of others. Also, the efficiency rationale common to both arguments is significantly underinclusive. It applies equally well to a number of non-political, extracurricular activities that are not prohibited by the Cranston charter. Finally, the connection between after-hours campaigning and the state interest seems tenuous; in many cases a public employee would be able to campaign aggressively and still continue to do his job well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>Incidentally, <i>Clements v. Fashing</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> sustained as constitutional a provision on the automatic resignation of District Clerks, County Clerks, County Judges, County Treasurers, Criminal District Attorneys, County Surveyors, Inspectors of Hides and Animals, County Commissioners, Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Assessors and Collectors of Taxes, District Attorneys, County Attorneys, Public Weighers, and Constables if they announce their candidacy or if they become candidates in any general, special or primary election.<br><br>In <i>Clements</i>, it may be readily observed that a provision treating differently particular officials, as distinguished from all others, under a classification that is germane to the purposes of the law, merits the stamp of approval from American courts.  Not, however, a general and sweeping provision, and more so one violative of the second requisite for a valid classification, which is on its face unconstitutional.<br><br>On a final note, it may not be amiss to state that the Americans, from whom we copied the provision in question, had already stricken down a similar measure for being unconstitutional. It is high-time that we, too, should follow suit and, thus, uphold fundamental liberties over age-old, but barren, restrictions to such freedoms.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

Penalties upon officers. - x x x x<br><br>No public officer shall offer himself as a candidate, nor shall he be eligible during the time that he holds said public office to election, at any municipal, provincial or Assembly election, except for reelection to the position which he may be holding, and no judge of the Court of First Instance, justice of peace, provincial fiscal, or officer or employee of the Bureau of Constabulary or of the Bureau of Education shall aid any candidate or influence in any manner or take part in any municipal, provincial or Assembly election under penalty of being deprived of his office and being disqualified to hold any public office whatever for a term of five years: Provided, however, That the foregoing provision shall not be construed to deprive any person otherwise qualified of the right to vote at any election.<br><br></blockquote>Subsequently, the original rule on deemed resignations was bifurcated into two separate provisions of law - one for appointive officials, and another for elected officials - although the essence of the original rule was preserved for both groups.<br><br>For appointive officials, Section 22 of Commonwealth Act No. 357 provided that:<br><br><blockquote>Every person holding a public appointive office or position shall ipso facto cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy.<br><br></blockquote>As for elected officials, the last paragraph of Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666 stated:<br><br><blockquote>Any elective provincial, municipal, or city official running for an office, other than the one for which he has been lastly elected, shall be considered resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br><br></blockquote>These rules were substantially reiterated in Republic Act No. 180,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> or the Revised Election Code of 1947, which provides in relevant part:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 26. Automatic cessation of appointive officers and employees who are candidates. -- Every person holding a public appointive office or position shall ipso facto cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>SECTION 27. Candidate holding office. -- Any elective provincial, municipal, or city official running for an office, other than the one which he is actually holding, shall be considered resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy.</blockquote><br>However, as may be noticed, Section 27 of the Revised Election Code of 1947 introduced an amendment to the rule in respect of elected officials. While Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666 used the phrase "...office, other than the <b>one for which he has been lastly elected</b><i>,</i>" Section 27 spoke of "an office, other than the <b>one which he is actually holding</b>." To be sure, this change was not without purpose. As we explained in <b>Salaysay v. Castro, et al</b>.:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Before the enactment of section 27 of the Revised Election Code, the law in force covering the point or question in controversy was section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666. Its burden was to allow an elective provincial, municipal, or city official such as Mayor, running for the same office to continue in office until the expiration of his term. The legislative intention as we see it was to favor re-election of the incumbent by allowing him to continue in his office and use the prerogatives and influence thereof in his campaign for re-election and to avoid a break in or interruption of his incumbency during his current term and provide for continuity thereof with the next term of office if re-elected.<br><br>But section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 had reference only to provincial and municipal officials duly elected to their offices and who were occupying the same by reason of said election at the time that they filed their certificates of candidacy for the same position. <i>It did not include officials who hold or occupy elective provincial and municipal offices not by election but by appointment</i>. x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>However, this was exactly the situation facing the Legislature in the year 1947 after the late President Roxas had assumed office as President and before the elections coming up that year. The last national elections for provincial and municipal officials were held in 1940, those elected therein to serve up to December, 1943. Because of the war and the occupation by the Japanese, no elections for provincial and municipal officials could be held in 1943. Those elected in 1940 could not hold-over beyond 1943 after the expiration of their term of office because according to the views of the Executive department as later confirmed by this Court in the case of Topacio Nueno vs. Angeles, 76 Phil., 12, through Commonwealth Act No. 357, Congress had intended to suppress the doctrine or rule of hold-over. So, those provincial and municipal officials elected in 1940 ceased in 1943 and their offices became vacant, and this was the situation when after liberation, President Osmeña took over as Chief Executive. He filled these vacant positions by appointment. <i>When President Roxas was elected in 1946 and assumed office in 1947 he replaced many of these Osmeña appointees with his own men. Naturally, his Liberal Party followers wanted to extend to these appointees the same privilege of office retention thereto given by section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 to local elective officials. It could not be done because section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 had reference only to officials who had been elected. So, it was decided by President Roxas and his party to amend said section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 by substituting the phrase "which he is actually holding", for the phrase "for which he has been lastly elected" found in section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666.</i><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The purpose of the Legislature in making the amendment, in our opinion, was to give the benefit or privilege of retaining office not only to those who have been elected thereto but also to those who have been appointed; <i>stated differently, to extend the privilege and benefit to the regular incumbents having the right and title to the office either by election or by appointment</i>. There can be no doubt, in our opinion, about this intention. We have carefully examined the proceedings in both Houses of the Legislature. The minority Nacionalista members of Congress bitterly attacked this amendment, realizing that it was partisan legislation intended to favor those officials appointed by President Roxas; but despite their opposition the amendment was passed.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>We repeat that the purpose of the Legislature in enacting section 27 of the Revised Election Code was to allow an official to continue occupying an elective provincial, municipal or city office to which he had been appointed or elected, while campaigning for his election as long as he runs for the same office. He may keep said office continuously without any break, through the elections and up to the expiration of the term of the office. <i>By continuing in office, the office holder was allowed and expected to use the prerogatives, authority and influence of his office in his campaign for his election or re-election to the office he was holding. Another intention of the Legislature as we have hitherto adverted to was to provide for continuity of his incumbency so that there would be no interruption or break, which would happen if he were required to resign because of his filing his certificate of candidacy</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>In that case, the Court was faced with the issue of whether a Vice Mayor, merely acting as Mayor because of the temporary disability of the regular incumbent, comes under the provision and exception of Section 27 of the Revised Election Code of 1947. Ruling that a Vice Mayor acting as Mayor does not "actually hold the office" of Mayor within the meaning of Section 27, we denied the Petition for Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x A Vice Mayor acts as Mayor only in a temporary, provisional capacity. This tenure is indefinite, uncertain and precarious. He may act for a few days, for a week or a month or even longer. But surely there, ordinarily, is no assurance or expectation that he could continue acting as Mayor, long, indefinitely, through the elections and up to the end of the term of the office because the temporary disability of the regular, incumbent Mayor may end any time and he may resume his duties.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">VICE-MAYOR ACTING AS MAYOR, OUTSIDE<br>LEGAL CONTEMPLATION<br></div><br>The case of a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor could not have been within the contemplation and the intent of the Legislature because as we have already stated, that lawmaking body or at least the majority thereof intended to give the benefits and the privilege of section 27 to those officials holding their offices by their own right and by a valid title either by election or by appointment, permanently continuously and up to the end of the term of the office, not to an official neither elected nor appointed to that office but merely acting provisionally in said office because of the temporary disability of the regular incumbent. In drafting and enacting section 27, <i>how could the Legislature have possibly had in mind a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor, and include him in its scope, and accord him the benefits of retaining the office of Mayor and utilizing its authority and influence in his election campaign, when his tenure in the office of Mayor is so uncertain, indefinite and precarious that there may be no opportunity or occasion for him to enjoy said benefits, and how could Congress have contemplated his continuing in the office in which he is acting, when the very idea of continuity is necessarily in conflict and incompatible with the uncertainty, precariousness and temporary character of his tenure in the office of Mayor?</i><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">MEANING OF PHRASE "RESIGNED FROM HIS OFFICE"<br></div><br><i>Section 27 of Republic Act No. 180 in providing that a local elective official running for an office other than the one he is actually holding, is considered resigned from his office, must necessarily refer to an office which said official can resign, or from which he could be considered resigned, even against his will</i>. For instance, an incumbent Mayor running for the office of Provincial Governor must be considered as having resigned from his office of Mayor. He must resign voluntarily or be compelled to resign. It has to be an office which is subject to resignation by the one occupying it. Can we say this of a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor? Can he or could he resign from the office of Mayor or could he be made to resign therefrom No. As long as he holds the office of Vice-Mayor to which he has a right and legal title, he, cannot resign or be made to resign from the office of Mayor because the law itself requires that as Vice- Mayor he must act as Mayor during the temporary disability of the regular or incumbent Mayor. <i>If he cannot voluntarily resign the office of Mayor in which he is acting temporarily, or could not be made to resign therefrom, then the provision of section 27 of the Code about resignation, to him, would be useless, futile and a dead letter</i>. In interpreting a law, we should always avoid a construction that would have this result, for it would violate the fundamental rule that every legislative act should be interpreted in order to give force and effect to every provision thereof because the Legislature is not presumed to have done a useless act.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">ANOTHER EXAMPLE<br></div><br>The regular incumbent Mayor files his certificate of candidacy for the same office of Mayor. Then he goes on leave of absence or falls sick and the Vice-Mayor acts in his place, and while thus acting he also files his certificate of candidacy for the same office of Mayor. Then the Vice-Mayor also goes on leave or falls sick or is suspended, and because the regular Mayor is still unable to return to office, under section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code, the councilor who at the last general elections received the highest number of votes, acts as Mayor and while thus acting he also files his certificate of candidacy for the office of Mayor. The Vice-Mayor also campaigns for the same post of Mayor claiming like the herein petitioner that he did not lose his office of Vice-Mayor because he filed his certificate of candidacy while acting as Mayor and thus was actually holding the office of Mayor. Using the same argument, the councilor who had previously acted as Mayor also campaigns for his election to the same post of Mayor while keeping his position as councilor. Thus we would have this singular situation of three municipal officials occupying three separate and distinct offices, running for the same office of Mayor, yet keeping their different respective offices, and strangely enough two of those offices (Vice- Mayor and Councilor) are different from the office of Mayor they are running for. Could that situation have been contemplated by the Legislature in enacting section 27 of the Revised Election Code? We do not think so, and yet that would happen if the contention of the petitioner about the meaning of "actually holding office" is to prevail.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">TWO OFFICIALS "ACTUALLY HOLDING" THE SAME<br>ELECTIVE OFFICE<br></div><br>We have already said that a Mayor under temporary disability continues to be Mayor (Gamalinda vs. Yap * No. L-6121, May 30, 1953) and actually holds the office despite his temporary disability to discharge the duties of the office; he receives full salary corresponding to his office, which payment may not be legal if he were not actually holding the office, while the Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor does not receive said salary but is paid only a sum equivalent to it (section 2187, Revised Administrative Code). Now, if a Mayor under temporary disability actually holds the office of Mayor and the Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor, according to his claim is also actually holding the office of Mayor, then we would have the anomalous and embarrassing situation of two officials actually holding the very same local elective office. Considered from this view point, and to avoid the anomaly, it is to us clear that the Vice-Mayor should not be regarded as holding the office of Mayor but merely acting for the regular incumbent, a duty or right as an incident to his office of Vice-Mayor and not as an independent right or absolute title to the office by reason of election or appointment.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">EXCEPTION TO BE CONSTRUED STRICTLY<br></div><br>Section 26 of the Revised Election Code provides that every person holding an appointive office shall ipso facto cease in his office on the date he files his certificate of candidacy. Then we have section 27 of the same Code as well as section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666 which it amended, both providing that local elective officials running for office shall be considered resigned from their posts, except when they run for the same office they are occupying or holding. <i>It is evident that the general rule is that all Government officials running for office must resign. The authority or privilege to keep one's office when running for the same office is the exception. It is a settled rule of statutory construction that an exception or a proviso must be strictly construed specially when considered in an attempt to ascertain the legislative intent.</i><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Applying this rule, inasmuch as petitioner herein claimed the right to retain his office under the exception above referred to, said claim must have to be judged strictly, -- whether or not his mere acting in the office of Mayor may be legally interpreted as actually holding the same so as to come within the exception. As we have already observed, literally and generally speaking, since he is discharging the duties and exercising the powers of the office of Mayor he might be regarded as actually holding the office; but strictly speaking and considering the purpose and intention of the Legislature behind section 27 of the Revised Election Code, he may not and cannot legitimately be considered as actually holding the office of Mayor.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">RETENTION OF OFFICE<br></div><br>We have, heretofore[,] discussed the case as regards the resignation of an office holder from his office by reason of his running for an office different from it; and our conclusion is that it must be an office that he can or may resign or be considered resigned from; and that the office of Mayor is not such an office from the stand point of a Vice-Mayor. Let us now consider the case from the point of view of retaining his office because he is running for the same office, namely -- retention of his office. As we have already said, the Legislature intended to allow an office holder and incumbent to retain his office provided that he runs for the same. In other words, he is supposed to retain the office before and throughout the elections and up to the expiration of the term of the office, without interruption. Can a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor be allowed or expected to retain the office of Mayor? The incumbent Mayor running for the same office can and has a right to keep and retain said office up to the end of his term. But a Vice-Mayor merely acting as Mayor and running for said office of Mayor, may not and cannot be expected to keep the office up to the end of the term, even assuming that by acting as Mayor he is actually holding the office of Mayor, for the simple reason that his holding of the same is temporary, provisional and precarious and may end any time when the incumbent Mayor returns to duty. Naturally, his temporary holding of the office of Mayor cannot be the retention or right to keep the office intended by the Legislature in section 27 of Republic Act No. 180. So that, neither from the point of view of resignation from the office of Mayor nor the standpoint of retention of said office, may a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor, like herein petitioner, come within the provisions and meaning of section 27 of the Election Code, particularly the exception in it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (italics supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In contrast, <b>Castro v. Gatuslao</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dealt with the issue of whether a Vice Mayor who had filed a certificate of candidacy for reelection to the same post, and who on the next day became Mayor, due to vacancy in the mayoralty, comes within the sphere of action of Section 27 of Republic Act No. 180. We ruled in the negative, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The last words of said section, "shall be considered resigned from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy", indicates that <i>the moment of such filing is the point of time to be referred to for the operation and application of the statute, and for the determination of its essential prerequisite</i>, to wit, that the official involved shall file his candidacy for an office other than that which he is actually holding. The law nowhere mentions or refers to positions that the candidate might hold either before or after the filing of the certificate of candidacy.<br><br>What office was petitioner Castro actually holding on September 8, 1955, when he filed his certificate of candidacy? Vice-Mayor of Manapla. For what office did he run and file his certificate of candidacy? For Vice-Mayor of Manapla. Clearly, then, he was a candidate for a position that he was actually holding at the time he filed his certificate of candidacy, for "actually" necessarily refers to that particular moment; hence, he should not be considered resigned or deemed to have forfeited his post. Deprivation of office without fault of the holder is not to be lightly presumed nor extended by implication.<br><br><i>That the petitioner came later to hold another office by operation of law, does not alter the case. The wording of the law plainly indicates that only the date of filing of the certificate of candidacy should be taken into account. The law does not make the forfeiture dependent upon future contingencies, unforeseen and unforeseeable, since the vacating is expressly made effective as of the moment of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, and there is nothing to show that the forfeiture is to operate retroactively</i>. The statute does not decree that an elective municipal official must be considered resigned if he runs for an office other than the one held by him at or subsequently to the filing of his certificate of candidacy; neither does it declare that he must vacate if he runs for an office other than the one actually held by him at any time before the day of the election.<br><br>Since the law did not divest the petitioner Castro of his position of Vice-Mayor, he was entitled to the mayoralty of Manapla when that post became vacant the next day; and as his assumption of that office did not make herein petitioner hold a post different from that for which he became a candidate at the time his certificate of candidacy was filed, he did not forfeit the office of Mayor; therefore the respondent could not legally appoint another mayor for Municipality of Manapla. Petitioner's case becomes the more meritorious when it is considered that he was elevated from Vice-Mayor to Mayor by operation of law and not by his own will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>As to the nature of the forfeiture of office, Section 27 of the Revised Election Code is clear: it is automatic and permanently effective upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy for another office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Only the moment and act of filing are considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Once the certificate is filed, the seat is forfeited forever and nothing save a new election or appointment can restore the ousted official, even if the certificate itself be subsequently withdrawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Moving forward, Republic Act No. 6388,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> or the Election Code of 1971, imposed similar provisos on appointive and elective officials, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 23.

His failure to take his oath of office as herein provided shall be considered forfeiture of his right to the new office to which he has been elected unless said failure is for a cause or causes beyond his control.</blockquote><br>However, the Election Code of 1971 was subsequently repealed by Presidential Decree No. 1296,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or the 1978 Election Code. The latter law provided the same rule on deemed resignations of appointive officials, with the added exception that Cabinet members shall continue in their offices, subject to the pleasure of the President. Section 29 of the 1978 Election Code thus states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 29. Candidates holding appointive office or position. -- Every person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall ipso facto cease in his office or position on the date he files his certificate of candidacy. Members of the Cabinet shall continue in the offices they presently hold notwithstanding the filing of certificate of candidacy, subject to the pleasure of the President of the Philippines.<br></blockquote><br>With respect to elected officials, the 1978 Election Code initially provided a different rule. Instead of deeming them ipso facto resigned from office upon filing their certificates of candidacy, they were merely considered on forced leave of absence, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>SECTION 30. Candidates holding political office. -- Governors, mayors, members of the various sanggunians, or barangay officials, shall, upon filing of a certificate of candidacy, be considered on forced leave of absence from office.<br></blockquote><br>Almost two years later, however, President Marcos anticipated that applying "... Section 30 in the local elections on January 30, 1980, may give rise to chaos and confusion due to the difficulty of designating promptly and immediately the replacements of such officials to assure the continuity and stability of local governments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He accordingly issued Presidential Decree No. 1659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and Presidential Decree No. 1659-A,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which reverted to the former rule on deemed resignations. Consequently, elected provincial, city, municipal, or municipal district officers who ran for offices other than the ones which they were holding, were considered ipso facto resigned from their respective offices upon the filing of their certificates of candidacy, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 1. Candidate holding elective office. -- Any person occupying an elective provincial, city, municipal, or municipal district position who runs for an office other than the one which he is holding shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy: Provided, however, That during the pendency of the election, the President of the Philippines may appoint in an acting capacity said candidate to the office for which he filed a certificate of candidacy and which has been rendered vacant by virtue of the operation of the preceding provision of this section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br><u>BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 881:</u><br><br>On December 3, 1985, President Marcos approved Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, or the Omnibus Election Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The pertinent provisions provide in relevant part:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 66.

PALMARES: In the old Election Code, Your Honor, in the 1971 Election Code, the provision seems to be different -- I think this is in Section 24 of Article III.<br><br>Any elective provincial, sub-provincial, city, municipal or municipal district officer running for an office other than the one which he is holding in a permanent capacity shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>May I know, Your Honor, what is the reason of the Committee in departing or changing these provisions of Section 24 of the old Election Code and just adopting it en toto? Why do we have to change it? What could possibly be the reason behind it, or the rationale behind it?<br><br>MR. PEREZ (L.): I have already stated the rationale for this, Mr. Speaker, but I don't mind repeating it. <i>The purpose is that the people must be given the right to choose any official who belongs to, let us say, to the Batasan if he wants to run for another office. However, because of the practice in the past where members of the legislature ran for local offices, but did not assume the office, because of that spectacle the impression is that these officials were just trifling with the mandate of the people. They have already obtained a mandate to be a member of the legislature, and they want to run for mayor or for governor and yet when the people give them that mandate, they do not comply with that latter mandate, but still preferred (sic) to remain in the earlier mandate. So we believe, Mr. Speaker, that the people's latest mandate must be the one that will be given due course</i>. . . .<br></blockquote><br>Assemblyman Manuel M. Garcia, in answer to the query of Assemblyman Arturo Tolentino on the constitutionality of Cabinet Bill No. 2, said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>MR. GARCIA (M.M.): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>Mr. Speaker, on the part of the Committee, we made this proposal based on constitutional grounds. We did not propose this amendment mainly on the rationale as stated by the Gentlemen from Manila that the officials running for office other than the ones they are holding will be considered resigned <i>not because of abuse of facilities of power or the use of office facilities but primarily because under our Constitution, we have this new chapter on accountability of public officers</i>. Now, this was not in the 1935 Constitution. It states that <i>(sic)</i> Article XIII, Section 1 -- 'Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees shall serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and shall remain accountable to the people.'<br><br><i>Now, what is this significance of this new provision on accountability of public officers? This only means that all elective public officials should honor the mandate they have gotten from the people</i>. Thus, under our Constitution, it says that: 'Members of the Batasan shall serve for the term of 6 years, in the case of local officials and 6 years in the case of barangay officials.['] Now, Mr. Speaker, we have precisely included this as part of the Omnibus Election Code <i>because a Batasan Member who hold (sic) himself out with the people and seek (sic) their support and mandate should not be allowed to deviate or allow himself to run for any other position unless he relinquishes or abandons his office. Because his mandate to the people is to serve for 6 years. Now, if you allow a Batasan or a governor or a mayor who was mandated to serve for 6 years to file for an office other than the one he was elected to, then, that clearly shows that he has not (sic) intention to service the mandate of the people which was placed upon him and therefore he should be considered ipso facto resigned</i>. I think more than anything that is the accountability that the Constitution requires of elective public officials. It is not because of the use or abuse of powers or facilities of his office, but it is because of the Constitution itself which I said under the 1973 Constitution called and inserted this new chapter on accountability.<br><br>Now, argument was said that the mere filing is not the intention to run. Now, what is it for? <i>If a Batasan Member files the certificate of candidacy, that means that he does not want to serve, otherwise, why should he file for an office other than the one he was elected to? The mere fact therefore of filing a certificate should be considered the overt act of abandoning or relinquishing his mandate to the people and that he should therefore resign if he wants to seek another position which he feels he could be of better service.</i><br><br>As I said, Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the statements of the Gentleman from Manila because the basis of this Section 62 is the constitutional provision not only of the fact that Members of the Batasan and local officials should serve the entire 6-year term for which we were elected, but because of this new chapter on the accountability of public officers not only to the community which voted him to office, <i>but primarily because under this commentary on accountability of public officers, the elective public officers must serve their principal, the people, not their own personal ambition</i>. And that is the reason, Mr. Speaker, why we opted to propose Section 62 where candidates or elective public officers holding offices other than the one to which they were elected, should be considered ipso facto resigned from their office upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36] </sup>(emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Corollarily, <b>Dimaporo v. Mitra, et al.</b> involved Mohamad Ali Dimaporo, who was elected Representative for the Second Legislative District of Lanao del Sur during the 1987 congressional elections. He took his oath of office on January 9, 1987 and thereafter performed the duties and enjoyed the rights and privileges pertaining thereto. Three years later, he filed with the COMELEC a Certificate of Candidacy for the position of Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Upon being informed of this development, the Speaker and Secretary of the House of Representatives excluded Dimaporo's name from the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives pursuant to Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code. Having lost in the 1990 elections, petitioner expressed his intention to the Speaker of the House of Representatives "to resume performing my duties and functions as elected Member of Congress," but he failed in his bid to regain his seat.<br><br>We sustained Dimaporo's forfeiture of his congressional seat. Holding that the concept of voluntary renunciation of office under Section 7, Article VI of the Constitution is broad enough to include the situation envisioned in Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code, we ruled:<br><br><blockquote>That the act, contemplated in Section 67, Article IX of 8.P. Blg. 881, of filing a certificate of candidacy for another office constitutes an overt, concrete act of voluntary renunciation of the elective office presently being held is evident from this exchange between the Members of Parliament Arturo Tolentino and Jose Roño:<br><br><blockquote>"MR. ROÑO:<br>My reasonable ground is this: if you will make the person . . . my, shall we say, basis is that in one case the person is intending to run for an office which is different from his own, and therefore it should be considered, at least from the legal significance, an intention to relinquish his office.<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO:<br>Yes.<br><br>MR. ROÑO:<br>And in the other, because he is running for the same position, it is otherwise.<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO:<br>Yes, but what I cannot see is why are you going to compel a person to quit an office which he is only intending to leave? A relinquishment of office must be clear, must be definite.<br><br>MR. ROÑO:<br>Yes, sir. That's precisely, Mr. Speaker, what I am saying that while I do not disagree with the conclusion that the intention cannot be enough, but I am saying that the filing of the certificate of candidacy is an overt act of such intention. It's not just an intention: it's already there."<br></blockquote><br>In Monroy vs. Court of Appeals, a case involving Section 27 of R.A. No. 180 above-quoted, this Court categorically pronounced that "forfeiture (is) automatic and permanently effective upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy for another office. Only the moment and act of filing are considered. Once the certificate is filed, the seat is forever forfeited and nothing save a new election or appointment can restore the ousted official. Thus, as We had occasion to remark, through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in Castro vs. Gatuslao:<br><br><blockquote>". . . 'The wording of the law plainly indicates that only the date of filing of the certificate of candidacy should be taken into account. The law does not make the forfeiture dependent upon future contingencies, unforeseen and unforeseeable, since the vacating is expressly made as of the moment of the filing of the certificate of candidacy....'"<br></blockquote><br>As the mere act of filing the certificate of candidacy for another office produces automatically the permanent forfeiture of the elective position being presently held, it is not necessary, as petitioner opines, that the other position be actually held. The ground for forfeiture in Section 13, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution is different from the forfeiture decreed in Section  67, Article  IX of B.P. Blg. 881,  which  is actually a mode of voluntary renunciation of office under Section 7, par. 2 of Article VI of the Constitution.<br><br>The legal effects of filing a certificate of candidacy for another office having been spelled out in Section 67, Article IX, B.P. Blg. 881 itself, no statutory interpretation was indulged in by respondents Speaker and Secretary of the House of Representatives in excluding petitioner's name from the Roll of Members. The Speaker is the administrative head of the House of Representatives and he exercises administrative powers and functions attached to his office. As administrative officers, both the Speaker and House Secretary-General perform ministerial functions. It was their duty to remove petitioner's name from the Roll considering the unequivocal tenor of Section 67, Article IX, B.P. Blg. 881. When the Commission on Elections communicated to the House of Representatives that petitioner had filed his certificate of candidacy for regional governor of Muslim Mindanao, respondents had no choice but to abide by the clear and unmistakable legal effect of Section 67, Article IX of B.P. Blg. 881. It was their ministerial duty to do so. These officers cannot refuse to perform their duty on the ground of an alleged invalidity of the statute imposing the duty. The reason for this is obvious. It might seriously hinder the transaction of public business if these officers were to be permitted in all cases to question the constitutionality of statutes and ordinances imposing duties upon them and which have not judicially been declared unconstitutional. Officers of the government from the highest to the lowest are creatures of the law and are bound to obey it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b>Aguinaldo, et al. v.

In that case, petitioners sought to prevent the COMELEC from enforcing Section 67 on the ground that it was violative of the Constitution in that it effectively shortens the terms of office of elected officials. We, however, fully reiterated the applicability of the doctrine of voluntary renunciation announced in <b>Dimaporo v. Mitra, et al.</b><br><br>Further to the rule on appointive officials, <b>PNOC Energy Development Corporation, et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> held that an employee in a government-owned or   -controlled corporation without an original charter (and therefore not covered by Civil Service Law) still falls within the scope of Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code. We ruled:<br><br><blockquote>When the Congress of the Philippines reviewed the Omnibus Election Code of 1985, in connection with its deliberations on and subsequent enactment of related and repealing legislation -- i.e., Republic Acts Numbered 7166: "An Act Providing for Synchronized National and Local Elections and for Electoral Reforms, Authorizing Appropriations Therefor, and for Other Purposes" (effective November 26, 1991), 6646: "An Act Introducing Additional Reforms in the Electoral System and for Other Purposes" (effective January 5, 1988) and 6636: "An Act Resetting the Local Elections, etc." (effective November 6, 1987), it was no doubt aware that in light of Section 2(1), Article IX of the 1987 Constitution: (a) government-owned or controlled corporations were of two (2) categories -- those with original charters, and those organized under the general law -- and (b) employees of these corporations were of two (2) kinds -- those covered by the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations because employed in corporations having original charters, and those not subject to Civil Service Law but to the Labor Code because employed in said corporations organized under the general law, or the Corporation Code. Yet Congress made no effort to distinguish between these two classes of government-owned or controlled corporations or their employees in the Omnibus Election Code or subsequent related statutes, particularly as regards the rule that an any employee "in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy."<br><br><i>Be this as it may, it seems obvious to the Court that a government-owned or controlled corporation does not lose its character as such because not possessed of an original charter but organized under the general law</i>. If a corporation's capital stock is owned by the Government, or it is operated and managed by officers charged with the mission of fulfilling the public objectives for which it has been organized, it is a government-owned or controlled corporation even if organized under the Corporation Code and not under a special statute; and <i>employees thereof, even if not covered by the Civil Service but by the Labor Code, are nonetheless "employees in government-owned or controlled corporations," and come within the letter of Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, declaring them "ipso facto resigned from . . . office upon the filing of . . . (their) certificate of candidacy."</i><br><br>What all this imports is that Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code applies to officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, even those organized under the general laws on incorporation and therefore not having an original or legislative charter, and even if they do not fall under the Civil Service Law but under the Labor Code. In other words, Section 66 constitutes just cause for termination of employment in addition to those set forth in the Labor Code, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (italics supplied)<br><br></blockquote><u>REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8436:</u><br><br>RA 8436 was silent on the rule in respect of appointive officials. Therefore, the governing law on the matter is still the one provided under the Omnibus Election Code. Hence, any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>On the other hand, RA 8436 modified the rule in respect of the automatic resignation of elected officials running for any office other than the ones they were currently holding in a permanent capacity, except the presidency and the vice presidency. Whereas, under the Omnibus Election Code they were considered ipso facto resigned from office upon <b>filing their certificates of candidacy</b>, RA 8436 considered them resigned <b>only upon the start of the campaign period</b> corresponding to the positions for which they are running, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>SECTION 11.

Considering that automation requires a pre-printed ballot, the legislators deemed it necessary to move the deadline for the filing of certificates of candidacy to 120 days before election day. If the reckoning point of the automatic resignation was not moved to the start of the campaign period, then elected officials running for any office other than the ones they were holding in a permanent capacity (except the presidency and the vice presidency), were going to be considered resigned as early as 120 days before the election, leaving their constituents bereft of public officials for an extended period of time.<br><br>This was the evil sought to be avoided by the legislators when they transferred the reckoning period of deemed resignations from the time the certificate of candidacy is filed (under the pre-RA 8436 regime) to the start of the campaign period (under RA 8436). After all, RA 8436 did not alter the campaign periods provided under existing election laws. Consequently, the end result is that the particular point in time (vis-à-vis election day) at which an elected official is considered resigned under RA 8436, is not significantly different from the point in time at which an elected official was considered resigned prior to RA 8436.<br><br>The deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on this point are instructive:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><blockquote>THE CHAIRMAN (REP.

Further to the question of the Deputy Speaker, the comment of this representation concerning the filing of certificate of candidacy in 2001, I suggest should also be applied to 1998, in the sense that the mere filing of the certificate of candidacy at an earlier date should not result in the loss of the office by a person running for a position other than what he is holding, nor the restrictions that will apply to a candidate.

Therefore, the governing law is still the one provided under the Omnibus Election Code, <i>i.e.,</i> any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.<br><br>However, the Fair Election Act expressly repealed, among others, Section 67 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, or the Omnibus Election Code, and rendered ineffective the proviso in RA 8436 relating to the automatic resignations of elected officials, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 14. Repealing Clause. -- <i>Sections 67</i> and 85 of the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) and Sections 10 and 11 of Republic Act No. 6646 are hereby repealed. As a consequence, <i>the first proviso in the third paragraph of Section 11 of Republic Act No. 8436 is rendered ineffective.</i> All laws, presidential decrees, executive orders, rules and regulations, or any part thereof inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed or modified or amended accordingly. (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>It is worthy to note that the express repeal of Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code may be considered superfluous, as this has already been impliedly repealed (for inconsistency) by RA 8436. As previously mentioned, officials were considered ipso facto resigned from office upon <b>filing their certificates of candidacy</b> under the Omnibus Election Code, whereas RA 8436 considered them resigned <b>only upon the start of the campaign period</b> corresponding to the positions for which they are running. Section 67 may nevertheless have been expressly mentioned in the repealing clause to clarify legislative intent, because automated elections (the subject matter of RA 8436) have not yet come to pass. In any event, Republic Act No. 9006 rendered ineffective the proviso in RA 8436 relating to the automatic resignations of elected officials.<br><br>In effect, the repealing clause of the Fair Election Act allows elected officials to run for another office without forfeiting the office they currently hold. This conclusion is supported by the February 7, 2001 deliberations of the Senate, when the Conference Committee Report on the disagreeing provisions of House Bill No. 9000 and Senate Bill No. 1742 was considered, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Presiding officer [Sen.

The petitioners contended that Section 14 discriminated against appointive officials. By the repeal of Section 67, an elected official who runs for office other than the one which he is holding is no longer considered ipso facto resigned therefrom upon filing his certificate of candidacy. Elected officials continue in public office even as they campaign for reelection or election for another elective position. On the other hand, Section 66 has been retained; thus, the limitation on appointive officials remains -- they are still considered ipso facto resigned from their offices upon the filing of their certificates of candidacy.<br><br>We held that there was no violation of the equal protection clause because substantial distinctions exist between the two sets of officials. Elected officials cannot, therefore, be similarly treated as appointive officials. Equal protection simply requires that all persons or things similarly situated are treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed.<br><br><u>REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9369:</u><br><br>RA 9369 amended RA 8436.

Act No. 9006 Is Not Violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution </i><br><br>The petitioners' contention, that the repeal of Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code pertaining to elective officials gives undue benefit to such officials as against the appointive ones and violates the equal protection clause of the constitution, is tenuous.<br><br>The equal protection of the law clause in the Constitution is not absolute, but is subject to reasonable classification. If the groupings are characterized by substantial distinctions that make real differences, one class may be treated and regulated differently from the other. The Court has explained the nature of the equal protection guarantee in this manner:<br><blockquote>The equal protection of the law clause is against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality. It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate. It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced. The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable grounds exist for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.<br></blockquote>Substantial distinctions clearly exist between elective officials and appointive officials. The former occupy their office by virtue of the mandate of the electorate. They are elected to an office for a definite term and may be removed therefrom only upon stringent conditions. On the other hand, appointive officials hold their office by virtue of their designation thereto by an appointing authority. Some appointive officials hold their office in a permanent capacity and are entitled to security of tenure while others serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority.<br><br>Another substantial distinction between the two sets of officials is that under Section 55, Chapter 8, Title I, Subsection A. Civil Service Commission, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292), appointive officials, as officers and employees in the civil service, are strictly prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity or [taking] part in any election except to vote. Under the same provision, elective officials, or officers or employees holding political offices, are obviously expressly allowed to take part in political and electoral activities.<br><br>By repealing Section 67 but retaining Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, the legislators deemed it proper to treat these two classes of officials differently with respect to the effect on their tenure in the office of the filing of the certificates of candidacy for any position other than those occupied by them. Again, it is not within the power of the Court to pass upon or look into the wisdom of this classification.<br><br>Since the classification justifying Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 9006, i.e., elected officials vis-a-vis appointive officials, is anchored upon material and significant distinctions and all the persons belonging under the same classification are similarly treated, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is, thus, not infringed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote><br>That <b>Farinas</b><i> </i>likewise dealt with the issue of whether Section 14 of the Fair Election Act is a constitutionally proscribed rider, is wholly peripheral to the doctrinal value of our pronouncement on the equal protection challenge.

Taft</b>.<br><br>Briefly, that case involved Kenneth Mancuso, a full-time police officer and classified civil service employee of the City of Cranston, Rhode Island. He filed as a candidate for nomination as representative to the Rhode Island General Assembly on October 19, 1971, and subsequently initiated a suit challenging the constitutionality of §14.09(c) of the City Home Rule Charter which prohibits "continuing in the classified service of the city after becoming a candidate for nomination or election to any public office." The district court ruled in his favor, for which reason the city officials appealed. Applying strict equal protection review, the United States Court of Appeals held that the Cranston charter provision pursues its objective (of maintaining the honesty and impartiality of its public work force) in a far too heavy-handed manner and must therefore fall under the equal protection clause, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Whether the right to run for office is looked at from the point of view of individual expression or associational effectiveness, wide opportunities exist for the individual who seeks public office. x x x Consequently[,] we hold that candidacy is both a protected First Amendment right and a fundamental interest. Hence any legislative classification that significantly burdens that interest must be subjected to strict equal protection review.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>x x x It is obviously conceivable that the impartial character of the civil service would be seriously jeopardized if people in positions of authority used their discretion to forward their electoral ambitions rather than the public welfare. Similarly if a public employee pressured other fellow employees to engage in corrupt practices in return for promises of post-election reward, or if an employee invoked the power of the office he was seeking to extract special favors from his superiors, the civil service would be done irreparable injury. Conversely, members of the public, fellow-employees, or supervisors might themselves request favors from the candidate or might improperly adjust their own official behavior towards him. Even if none of these abuses actually materialize, the possibility of their occurrence might seriously erode the public's confidence in its public employees. For the reputation of impartiality is probably as crucial as the impartiality itself; the knowledge that a clerk in the assessor's office who is running for the local zoning board has access to confidential files which could provide "pressure" points for furthering his campaign is destructive regardless of whether the clerk actually takes ad-vantage of his opportunities. For all of these reasons we find that the state indeed has a compelling interest in maintaining the honesty and impartiality of its public work force.<br><br>We do not, however, consider the exclusionary measure taken by Cranston-a flat prohibition on office-seeking of all kinds by all kinds of public employees-as even reasonably necessary to satisfaction of this state interest. As Justice Marshall pointed out in Dunn v. Blumstein, "[s]tatutes affecting constitutional rights must be drawn with `precision'". For three sets of reasons we conclude that the Cranston charter provision pursues its objective in a far too heavy-handed manner and hence must fall under the equal protection clause. First, we think the nature of the regulation-a broad prophylactic rule-may be unnecessary to fulfillment of the city's objective. Second, even granting some sort of prophylactic rule may be required, the provision here prohibits candidacies for all types of public office, including many which would pose none of the problems at which the law is aimed. Third, the provision excludes the candidacies of all types of public employees, without any attempt to limit exclusion to those employees whose positions make them vulnerable to corruption and conflicts of interest.<br><br>As to approaches less restrictive than a prophylactic rule, there exists the device of the leave of absence. Some system of leaves of absence would permit the public employee to take time off to pursue his candidacy while assuring him his old job should his candidacy be unsuccessful. Moreover, a leave of absence policy would eliminate many of the opportunities for engaging in the questionable practices that the statute is designed to prevent. While campaigning, the candidate would feel no conflict between his desire for election and his publicly entrusted discretion, nor any conflict between his efforts to persuade the public and his access to confidential documents. But instead of adopting a reasonable leave of absence policy, Cranston has chosen a provision that makes the public employee cast off the security of hard-won public employment should he desire to compete for elected office.<br><br>The city might also promote its interest in the integrity of the civil service by enforcing, through dismissal, discipline, or criminal prosecution, rules or statutes that treat conflict of interests, bribery, or other forms of official corruption. By thus attacking the problem directly, instead of using a broad prophylactic rule, the city could pursue its objective without unduly burdening the First Amendment rights of its employees and the voting rights of its citizens. x x x (citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Three months after <b>Mancuso</b>, or on June 1973, the United States Supreme Court decided <b>United States Civil Service Commission, et al. v.

State of Oklahoma, et al.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br><b>Letter Carriers</b><i> </i>was a declaratory judgment action brought by the National Association of Letter Carriers, certain local Democratic and Republican political committees, and six individual federal employees, who asserted on behalf of themselves and all federal employees, that Section 9(a) of the Hatch Act, prohibiting federal employees from taking "an active part in political management or in political campaigns," was unconstitutional on its face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> <b>A divided three-judge court held the section unconstitutional, but this ruling was reversed by the United States Supreme Court in this wise:</b><br><br><blockquote>Until now, the judgment of Congress, the Executive, and the country appears to have been that partisan political activities by federal employees must be limited if the Government is to operate effectively and fairly, elections are to play their proper part in representative government, and employees themselves are to be sufficiently free from improper influences. The restrictions so far imposed on federal employees are not aimed at particular parties, groups, or points of view, but apply equally to all partisan activities of the type described. They discriminate against no racial, ethnic, or religious minorities. Nor do they seek to control political opinions or beliefs, or to interfere with or influence anyone's vote at the polls.<br><br><i>But, as the Court held in Pickering v. Board of Education,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><i> the government has an interest in regulating the conduct and `the speech of its employees that differ(s) significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the (employee), as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the (government), as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.' Although Congress is free to strike a different balance than it has, if it so chooses, we think the balance it has so far struck is sustainable by the obviously important interests sought to be served by the limitations on partisan political activities now contained in the Hatch Act.</i><br><br>It seems fundamental in the first place that employees in the Executive Branch of the Government, or those working for any of its agencies, should administer the law in accordance with the will of Congress, rather than in accordance with their own or the will of a political party. They are expected to enforce the law and execute the pro-grams of the Government without bias or favoritism for or against any political party or group or the members thereof. A major thesis of the Hatch Act is that to serve this great end of Government-the impartial execution of the laws-it is essential that federal employees, for example, not take formal positions in political parties, not undertake to play substantial roles in partisan political campaigns, and not run for office on partisan political tickets. Forbidding activities like these will reduce the hazards to fair and effective government.<br><br>There is another consideration in this judgment: it is not only important that the Government and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice, but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.<br><br>Another major concern of the restriction against partisan activities by federal employees was perhaps the immediate occasion for enactment of the Hatch Act in 1939. That was the conviction that the rapidly expanding Government work force should not be employed to build a powerful, invincible, and perhaps corrupt political machine. The experience of the 1936 and 1938 campaigns convinced Congress that these dangers were sufficiently real that substantial barriers should be raised against the party in power-or the party out of power, for that matter-using the thousands or hundreds of thousands of federal employees, paid for at public expense, to man its political structure and political campaigns.<br><br>A related concern, and this remains as important as any other, was to further serve the goal that employment and advancement in the Government service not depend on political performance, and at the same time to make sure that Government employees would be free from pres-sure and from express or tacit invitation to vote in a certain way or perform political chores in order to curry favor with their superiors rather than to act out their own beliefs. It may be urged that prohibitions against coercion are sufficient protection; but for many years the joint judgment of the Executive and Congress has been that to protect the rights of federal employees with respect to their jobs and their political acts and beliefs it is not enough merely to forbid one employee to attempt to influence or coerce another. For example, at the hearings in 1972 on proposed legislation for liberalizing the prohibition against political activity, the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission stated that `the prohibitions against active participation in partisan political management and partisan political campaigns constitute the most significant safeguards against coercion . . ..' Perhaps Congress at some time will come to a different view of the realities of political life and Government service; but that is its current view of the matter, and we are not now in any position to dispute it. Nor, in our view, does the Constitution forbid it.<br><br>Neither the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is absolute in any event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>As we see it, our task is not to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe it, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with constitutional limitations. (italics supplied)</blockquote><br><b>Broadrick</b>, on the other hand, was a class action brought by certain Oklahoma state employees seeking a declaration that a state statute regulating political activity by state employees was invalid. Section 818 of Oklahoma's Merit System of Personnel Administration Act restricts the political activities of the state's classified civil servants in much the same manner that the Hatch Act proscribes partisan political activities of federal employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> It states, among others, that "[n]o employee in the classified service shall be ... a candidate for nomination or election to any paid public office..." Violation of Section 18 results in dismissal from employment, possible criminal sanctions and limited state employment ineligibility. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 18 is constitutional, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Appellants do not question Oklahoma's right to place even-handed restrictions on the partisan political conduct of state employees. Appellants freely concede that such restrictions serve valid and important state interests, particularly with respect to attracting greater numbers of qualified people by insuring their job security, free from the vicissitudes of the elective process, and by protecting them from `political extortion. Rather, appellants maintain that however permissible, even commendable, the goals of s 818 may be, its language is unconstitutionally vague and its prohibitions too broad in their sweep, failing to distinguish between conduct that may be proscribed and conduct that must be permitted. For these and other reasons, appellants assert that the sixth and seventh paragraphs of s 818 are void in toto and cannot be enforced against them or anyone else.<br><br>We have held today that the Hatch Act is not impermissibly vague.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> We have little doubt that s 818 is similarly not so vague that `men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Whatever other problems there are with s 818, it is all but frivolous to suggest that the section fails to give adequate warning of what activities it proscribes or fails to set out `explicit standards' for those who must apply it. In the plainest language, it prohibits any state classified employee from being `an officer or member' of a `partisan political club' or a candidate for `any paid public office.' It forbids solicitation of contributions `for any political organization, candidacy or other political purpose' and taking part `in the management or affairs of any political party or in any political campaign.' Words inevitably contain germs of uncertainty and, as with the Hatch Act, there may be disputes over the meaning of such terms in s 818 as `partisan,' or `take part in,' or `affairs of' political parties. But what was said in <i>Letter Carriers</i>, is applicable here: `there are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any cost, they are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest.' x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>[Appellants] nevertheless maintain that the statute is overbroad and purports to reach protected, as well as unprotected conduct, and must therefore be struck down on its face and held to be incapable of any constitutional application. We do not believe that the overbreadth doctrine may appropriately be invoked in this manner here.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The consequence of our departure from traditional rules of standing in the First Amendment area is that any enforcement of a statute thus placed at issue is totally forbidden until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression. Application of the overbreadth doctrine in this manner is, manifestly, strong medicine. It has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort. x x x<br><br>x x x But the plain import of our cases is, at the very least, that facial over-breadth adjudication is an exception to our traditional rules of practice and that <i>its function, a limited one at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotected behavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from `pure speech' toward conduct</i> and that conduct-even if expressive-falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct. <i>Although such laws, if too broadly worded, may deter protected speech to some unknown extent, there comes a point where that effect-at best a prediction-cannot, with confidence, justify invalidating a statute on its face and so prohibiting a State from enforcing the statute against conduct that is admittedly within its power to proscribe</i>. <i>To put the matter another way, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.</i> It is our view that s 818 is not substantially overbroad and that whatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.<br><br><i>Unlike ordinary breach-of-the peace statutes or other broad regulatory acts, s 818 is directed, by its terms, at political expression which if engaged in by private persons would plainly be protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. But at the same time, s 818 is not a censorial statute, directed at particular groups or viewpoints. The statute, rather, seeks to regulate political activity in an even-handed and neutral manner. As indicted, such statutes have in the past been subject to a less exacting overbreadth scrutiny. Moreover, the fact remains that s 818 regulates a substantial spectrum of conduct that is as manifestly subject to state regulation as the public peace or criminal trespass.</i> This much was established in <i>United Public Workers v. Mitchell</i>, and has been unhesitatingly reaffirmed today in <i>Letter Carriers</i>. Under the decision in <i>Letter Carriers</i>, there is no question that s 818 is valid at least insofar as it forbids classified employees from: soliciting contributions for partisan candidates, political parties, or other partisan political purposes; becoming members of national, state, or local committees of political parties, or officers or committee members in partisan political clubs, or candidates for any paid public office; taking part in the management or affairs of any political party's partisan political campaign; serving as delegates or alternates to caucuses or conventions of political parties; addressing or taking an active part in partisan political rallies or meetings; soliciting votes or assisting voters at the polls or helping in a partisan effort to get voters to the polls; participating in the distribution of partisan campaign literature; initiating or circulating partisan nominating petitions; or riding in caravans for any political party or partisan political candidate.<br><br>x x x <i>It may be that such restrictions are impermissible and that s 818 may be susceptible of some other improper applications. But, as presently construed, we do not believe that s 818 must be discarded in toto because some persons' arguably protected conduct may or may not be caught or chilled by the statute. Section 818 is not substantially overbroad and it not, therefore, unconstitutional on its face</i>. (italics supplied)</blockquote><br><b>Broadrick</b>, likewise, held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause by singling out classified service employees for restrictions on political expression, while leaving unclassified personnel free from such. The court reasoned that the state legislature must have some leeway in determining which of its employment positions required these restrictions.<br><br>Accordingly, <b>Letter Carriers</b> and <b>Broadrick</b> teach us that: (i) the state has interests as employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in regulating the speech of the citizenry in general; (ii) the courts must therefore balance the legitimate interest of employee free expression against the interests of the employer in promoting efficiency of public services; (iii) if the employees' expression interferes with maintenance of efficient and regularly functioning services, the limitation on speech is not unconstitutional; and (iv) the Legislature is to be given some flexibility or latitude in ascertaining which positions are to be covered by any statutory restrictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>It is against this factual backdrop that <b>Magill v. Lynch</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><i> </i>a 1977 decision of the First Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, gains prominence. Noteworthy, this case concerned a similar law, and was decided by the <b>same court</b> that decided <b>Mancuso</b><i>.</i><br><br><b>Magill</b><i> </i>involved Pawtucket, Rhode Island firemen who ran for city office in 1975. Pawtucket's "Little Hatch Act" prohibits city employees from engaging in a broad range of political activities.

The firemen brought an action against the city officials on the ground that that the provision of the city charter was unconstitutional. <b>However, the court, fully cognizant of <i>Letter Carriers </i>and <i>Broadrick,</i></b> <b>took the position that <i>Mancuso</i> had since lost considerable vitality. It observed that the view that political candidacy was a fundamental interest which could be infringed upon only if less restrictive alternatives were not available, was a position which was no longer viable, since the Supreme Court (finding that the government's interest in regulating both the conduct and speech of its employees differed significantly from its interest in regulating those of the citizenry in general) had given little weight to the argument that prohibitions against the coercion of government employees were a less drastic means to the same end, deferring to the judgment of Congress, and applying a "balancing" test to determine whether limits on political activity by public employees substantially served government interests which were "important" enough to outweigh the employees' First Amendment rights.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> <br><br>It must be noted that the Court of Appeals ruled in this wise even though the election in <b>Magill</b><i> </i>was characterized as <b>nonpartisan</b>, as it was reasonable for the city to fear, under the circumstances of that case, that politically active bureaucrats might use their official power to help political friends and hurt political foes. Ruled the court:<br><br><blockquote>The question before us is whether Pawtucket's charter provision, which bars a city employee's candidacy in even a nonpartisan city election, is constitutional. The issue compels us to extrapolate two recent Supreme Court decisions, <i>Civil Service Comm'n v. Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers</i> and <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma</i>. Both dealt with laws barring civil servants from partisan political activity. <i>Letter Carriers</i> reaffirmed <i>United Public Workers v. Mitchell</i>, upholding the constitutionality of the Hatch Act as to federal employees. Broadrick sustained Oklahoma's "Little Hatch Act" against constitutional attack, limiting its holding to Oklaho-ma's construction that the Act barred only activity in partisan politics. <i>In Mancuso v. Taft, we assumed that proscriptions of candidacy in nonpartisan elections would not be constitutional. Letter Carriers and Broadrick compel new analysis.</i><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>What we are obligated to do in this case, as the district court recognized, is to <i>apply the Court's interest balancing approach to the kind of nonpartisan election</i> revealed in this record. <i>We believe that the district court found more residual vigor in our opinion in Mancuso v. Taft than remains after Letter Carriers. We have particular reference to our view that political candidacy was a fundamental interest which could be trenched upon only if less restrictive alternatives were not available. While this approach may still be viable for citizens who are not government employees, the Court in Letter Carriers recognized that the government's interest in regulating both the conduct and speech of its employees differs significantly from its interest in regulating those of the citizenry in general</i>. Not only was United Public Workers v. Mitchell "unhesitatingly" reaffirmed, but the Court gave little weight to the argument that prohibitions against the coercion of government employees were a less drastic means to the same end, deferring to the judgment of the Congress. We cannot be more precise than the Third Circuit in characterizing the Court's approach as "some sort of 'balancing' process".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> It appears that the government may place limits on campaigning by public employees if the limits substantially serve government interests that are "important" enough to outweigh the employees' First Amendment rights. x x x (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>Upholding the constitutionality of the law in question, the <b>Magill </b>court detailed the major governmental interests discussed in <b>Letter Carriers</b><i> </i>and applied them to the Pawtucket provision as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Letter Carriers</i>[,] the first interest identified by the Court was that of an efficient government, faithful to the Congress rather than to party. The district court discounted this interest, reasoning  that candidates in a local election would not likely be committed to a state or national platform. This observation undoubtedly has substance insofar as allegiance to broad policy positions is concerned. But a different kind of possible political intrusion into efficient administration could be thought to threaten municipal government: not into broad policy decisions, but into the particulars of administration favoritism in minute decisions affecting welfare, tax assessments, municipal contracts and purchasing, hiring, zoning, licensing, and inspections. Just as the Court in <i>Letter Carriers</i> identified a second governmental interest in the avoidance of the appearance of "political justice" as to policy, so there is an equivalent interest in avoiding the appearance of political preferment in privileges, concessions, and benefits. The appearance (or reality) of favoritism that the charter's authors evidently feared is not exorcised by the nonpartisan character of the formal election process. Where, as here, party support is a key to successful campaigning, and party rivalry is the norm, the city might reasonably fear that politically active bureaucrats would use their official power to help political friends and hurt political foes. This is not to say that the city's interest in visibly fair and effective administration necessarily justifies a blanket prohibition of all employee campaigning; if parties are not heavily involved in a campaign, the danger of favoritism is less, for neither friend nor foe is as easily identified.<br><br>A second major governmental interest identified in <i>Letter Carriers</i> was avoiding the danger of a powerful political machine. The Court had in mind the large and growing federal bureaucracy and its partisan potential. The district court felt this was only a minor threat since parties had no control over nominations. But in fact candidates sought party endorsements, and party endorsements proved to be highly effective both in determining who would emerge from the primary election and who would be elected in the final election. Under the prevailing customs, known party affiliation and support were highly significant factors in Pawtucket elections. The charter's authors might reasonably have feared that a politically active public work force would give the incumbent party, and the incumbent workers, an unbreakable grasp on the reins of power. In municipal elections especially, the small size of the electorate and the limited powers of local government may inhibit the growth of interest groups powerful enough to outbalance the weight of a partisan work force. Even when nonpartisan issues and candidacies are at stake, isolated government employees may seek to influence voters or their co-workers improperly; but a more real danger is that a central party structure will mass the scattered powers of government workers behind a single party platform or slate. Occasional misuse of the public trust to pursue private political ends is tolerable, especially be-cause the political views of individual employees may balance each other out. But party discipline eliminates this diversity and tends to make abuse systematic. Instead of a handful of employees pressured into advancing their immediate superior's political ambitions, the entire government work force may be expected to turn out for many candidates in every election. In Pawtucket, where parties are a continuing presence in political campaigns, a carefully orchestrated use of city employees in support of the incumbent party's candidates is possible. The danger is scarcely lessened by the openness of Pawtucket's nominating procedure or the lack of party labels on its ballots.<br><br>The third area of proper governmental interest in <i>Letter Carriers</i> was ensuring that employees achieve advancement on their merits and that they be free from both coercion and the prospect of favor from political activity. The district court did not address this factor, but looked only to the possibility of a civil servant using his position to influence voters, and held this to be no more of a threat than in the most nonpartisan of elections. But we think that the possibility of coercion of employees by superiors remains as strong a factor in municipal elections as it was in <i>Letter Carriers</i>. Once again, it is the systematic and coordinated exploitation of public servants for political ends that a legislature is most likely to see as the primary threat of employees' rights. Political oppression of public employees will be rare in an entirely nonpartisan system. Some superiors may be inclined to ride herd on the politics of their employees even in a nonpartisan context, but without party officials looking over their shoulders most supervisors will prefer to let employees go their own ways.<br><br>In short, the government may constitutionally restrict its employees' participation in nominally nonpartisan elections if political parties play a large role in the campaigns. In the absence of substantial party involvement, on the other hand, the interests identified by the <i>Letter Carriers</i> Court lose much of their force. While the employees' First Amendment rights would normally outbalance these diminished interests, we do not suggest that they would always do so. Even when parties are absent, many employee campaigns might be thought to endanger at least one strong public interest, an interest that looms larger in the context of municipal elections than it does in the national elections considered in <i>Letter Carriers</i>. The city could reasonably fear the prospect of a subordinate running directly against his superior or running for a position that confers great power over his superior. An employee of a federal agency who seeks a Congressional seat poses less of a direct challenge to the command and discipline of his agency than a fireman or policeman who runs for mayor or city council. The possibilities of internal discussion, cliques, and political bargaining, should an employee gather substantial political support, are considerable. (citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The court, however, remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings in respect of the petitioners' overbreadth charge. Noting that invalidating a statute for being overbroad is "not to be taken lightly, much less to be taken in the dark," the court held:<br><br><blockquote>The governing case is <i>Broadrick</i>, which introduced the doctrine of "substantial" overbreadth in a closely analogous case. Under <i>Broadrick</i>, when one who challenges a law has engaged in constitutionally unprotected conduct (rather than unprotected speech) and when the challenged law is aimed at unprotected conduct, "the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." Two major uncertainties attend the doctrine: how to distinguish speech from conduct, and how to define "substantial" overbreadth. We are spared the first inquiry by <i>Broadrick</i> itself. The plaintiffs in that case had solicited support for a candidate, and they were subject to discipline under a law proscribing a wide range of activities, including soliciting contributions for political candidates and becoming a candidate. The Court found that this combination required a substantial overbreadth approach. The facts of this case are so similar that we may reach the same result without worrying unduly about the sometimes opaque distinction between speech and conduct.<br><br>The second difficulty is not so easily disposed of. <i>Broadrick</i> found no substantial over-breadth in a statute restricting partisan campaigning. Pawtucket has gone further, banning participation in nonpartisan campaigns as well. <i>Measuring the substantiality of a statute's overbreadth apparently requires, inter alia, a rough balancing of the number of valid applications compared to the number of potentially invalid applications. Some sensitivity to reality is needed; an invalid application that is far-fetched does not deserve as much weight as one that is probable. The question is a matter of degree; it will never be possible to say that a ratio of one invalid to nine valid applications makes a law substantially over-broad. Still, an overbreadth challenger has a duty to provide the court with some idea of the number of potentially invalid applications the statute permits</i>. Often, simply reading the statute in the light of common experience or litigated cases will suggest a number of probable invalid applications. But this case is different. Whether the statute is overbroad depends in large part on the number of elections that are insulated from party rivalry yet closed to Pawtucket employees. For all the record shows, every one of the city, state, or federal elections in Pawtucket is actively contested by political parties. Certainly the record suggests that parties play a major role even in campaigns that often are entirely nonpartisan in other cities. School committee candidates, for example, are endorsed by the local Democratic committee.<br><br><i>The state of the record does not permit us to find overbreadth; indeed such a step is not to be taken lightly, much less to be taken in the dark</i>. On the other hand, the entire focus below, in the short period before the election was held, was on the constitutionality of the statute as applied. Plaintiffs may very well feel that further efforts are not justified, <i>but they should be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the charter forecloses access to a significant number of offices, the candidacy for which by municipal employees would not pose the possible threats to government efficiency and integrity which Letter Carriers, as we have interpreted it, deems significant</i>. Accordingly, we remand for consideration of plaintiffs' overbreadth claim.

For example, they help prevent the abuse of judicial office by candidates and former candidates and they safeguard the appearances of propriety. <i>Finally, as the Morial court noted, the less-restrictive alternative of a forced leave of absence would not be sufficient to guard the state's interests, because the danger of corruption, real or perceived, would persist with regard to defeated candidates on their return to the bench</i>.

The measure is further aimed at promoting the efficiency, integrity, and discipline of the public service by eliminating the danger that the discharge of official duty would be motivated by political considerations rather than the welfare of the public. The restriction is also justified by the proposition that the entry of civil servants to the electoral arena, while still in office, could result in the neglect or inefficiency in the performance of duty because they would be attending to their campaign rather than to their office work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Nevertheless, the <i>ponencia </i>faults  Section 13 of Republic Act No. 9369 and Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code because "whether one holds an appointive office or an elective one, the evils sought to be prevented by the measure remain." The <i>ponencia </i>explains:<br><br><blockquote>...

With the fact that they both head executive offices, there is no valid justification to treat them differently when both file their [Certificates of Candidacy] for the elections.

Puno in his dissent.<br><br>The law is plain, clear and unequivocal that <b>appointive public officials</b>are deemed automatically resigned from office upon filing their certificates of candidacy. Paragraph 3, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 8436, as amended by Republic Act No. 9369, provides:<br><br><blockquote>For this purpose, the Commission shall set the deadline for the filing of certificate of candidacy/petition of registration/manifestation to participate in the election. Any person who files his certificate of candidacy within this period shall only be considered as a candidate at the start of the campaign period for which he filed his certificate of candidacy: Provided, That, unlawful acts or omissions applicable to a candidate shall effect only upon that start of the aforesaid campaign period: <b>Provided, finally, That any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the armed forces, and officers, and employees in government-owned or-controlled corporations, shall be considered ipso facto resigned from his/her office and must vacate the same at the start of the day of the filing of his/her certificate of candidacy</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The final proviso in paragraph 3, Section 11 of RA No. 8436, as amended, is a mere reiteration of Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 66.  <i>Candidates holding appointive office or positions</i>. --  Any person holding a public appointive office or position, including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered <i>ipso facto</i>resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.</blockquote><br>Congress inserted the final proviso to clarify that Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code still applies despite the second sentence in the paragraph 3 of Section 11, which states that a person who files a certificate of candidacy is considered a candidate only upon the start of the campaign period.<br><br>The final proviso in paragraph 3, Section 11 of RA No. 8436, as amended, and Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code are constitutional.<br><br>First. <b>Appointive public officials arecivil service officers or employees</b>. Section 2(1), Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>The civil service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.</blockquote><br>The Constitution expressly prohibits civil service officers and employees from engaging in <b>any electioneering or partisan political activity</b>. Section 2(4), Article IX-B of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>No officer or employee in the civil service shall engage, directly or indirectly, in <b>any electioneering or partisan political activity</b>.  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Since the Constitution also provides that suffrage "may be exercised by <b>all</b> citizens,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Section 2(4) of Article IX-B does not prohibit civil service officers and employees from voting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Thus, civil service officers and employees cannot engage in any electioneering or partisan political activity <b>except to vote</b>. This is clear from the second paragraph of Section 3(3), Article XVI of the 1987 Constitution, which provides:<br><br>No member of the military shall engage directly or indirectly in any partisan political activity, <b>except to vote</b>.  (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>The Civil Service laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> implement this constitutional ban by stating that civil service officers and employees cannot engage in any partisan political activity <b>except to vote</b>.  Section 55, Chapter 7, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 55.  <i>Political Activity</i>. -- No officer or employee in the Civil Service including members of the Armed Forces, shall engage directly or indirectly in any partisan political activity or take part in any election<b> except to vote</b>nor shall he use his official authority or influence to coerce the political activity of any other person or body. xxx. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Likewise, the Omnibus Election Code penalizes civil service officers and employees who engage in any partisan political activity <b>except to vote</b>.  Section 261 (i) of the Omnibus Election Code states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 261.  <i>Prohibited Acts</i>. -- The following shall be guilty of an election offense:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxxx<br></div><br>(i)   <i>Intervention of public officers and employees</i>. -- Any officer or employee in the civil service, except those holding political offices; any officer, employee, or member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, or any police force, special forces, home defense forces, barangay self-defense units and all other para-military units that now exist or which may hereafter be organized who, directly or indirectly, intervenes in any election campaign or engages in any partisan political activity<b>, except to vote</b>or to preserve public order, if he is a peace officer. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><b>Filing a certificate of candidacy is in itself a partisan political activity</b>. It is a public announcement that one is running for elective public office.  It is a necessary act for election to public office, and promotes one's candidacy to public office.  Running for public office, or exercising the right to be voted for, is different from, and not part of, the right to vote.  The only partisan political activity allowed to civil service officers and employees is to vote. Filing a certificate of candidacy is a partisan political activity not allowed to civil service officers and employees. <b>An appointive public official who files a certificate of candidacy violates the express constitutional ban on civil service officers from engaging in any partisan political activity except to vote</b>.<br><br>Thus, the law may validly provide that an appointive public official is automatically deemed resigned upon filing a certificate of candidacy. This merely implements the constitutional ban on civil service officers and employees from engaging in any partisan political activity except to vote.<br><br>Second. There is a substantial distinction between an appointive public official and an elective public official for purposes of considering only appointive public officials as deemed resigned upon the filing of certificate of candidacy.  Appointive public officials are chosen by the appointing power and not elected by the people. They do not have to renew their mandate periodically unlike elective public officials.  They also do not have term limits unlike elective public officials.<br><br><b>Most important of all</b>, the constitutional ban on civil service officers and employees from engaging in any partisan political activity applies to appointive public officials but not to elective public officials.  <b>By the very nature of their office, elective public officials engage in partisan political activities almost all year round, even outside of the campaign period. </b>, because of all these substantial distinctions, there is no violation of the equal protection clause when the law mandates that only appointive public officials, and not elective public officials, are deemed automatically resigned upon the filing of certificate of candidacy.<br><br>Third. The <b>final proviso</b>on the automatic resignation of appointive public officials in paragraph 3, Section 11 of RA No. 8436, as amended by RA No. 9369, qualifies the <b>second sentence</b>in paragraph 3 that, "Any person who files his certificate of candidacy within this period shall only be considered as a candidate at the start of the campaign period for which he filed his certificate of candidacy; xxx."  In short, the final proviso clearly excludes appointive public officials from the operation of the second sentence.  This is the plain, clear and unequivocal language of the law.<br><br>Fourth. The automatic resignation of appointive public officials upon the filing of certificate of candidacy has been in the statute books <b>for more than 100 years</b>. The earliest law on the matter is Act No. 1582 or the first Election Law enacted by the Philippine Commission in 1907. Section 29 of Act No. 1582<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 29. Penalties upon officers. --- xxx.<br><br>No public officer shall offer himself as a candidate for election, nor shall he be eligible during the time that he holds said public office to election, at any municipal, provincial or Assembly election, <b>except for reelection to the position which he may be holding,</b>and no judge of the Court of First Instance xxx.  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Even this law allowed elective public officers who sought "reelection" to hold on to their office, distinguishing them from appointive public officials who were not allowed to hold on to their office if they sought election.<br><br>Fifth. One can just imagine the anomaly, conflict and tension that will arise if the Provincial Director of the Philippine National Police, or the Philippine Army Commander whose troops are stationed within the province, will file a certificate of candidacy for governor of the province on 1 December 2009 for the 10 May 2010 elections.  If the PNP Provincial Director or Army Commander is not considered automatically resigned from office, he has until the start of the campaign period on 26 March 2010 to remain in his post, in command of hundreds, if not thousands, of fully-armed personnel.  This is a disaster waiting to happen.<br><br>In sum, appointive public officials can validly be deemed automatically resigned upon the filing of certificate of candidacy, as provided in the final proviso of paragraph 3, Section 11 of RA No. 8436, as amended by RA No. 9369, as well as in Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code. These provisions merely implement the constitutional ban in Section 2(4) of Article IX-B, and Section 3(3) of Article XVI, of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b>the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 1, Article V of the 1987 Constitution provides: "Section 1.

Thus, Section 2, Article XII of the 1935 Constitution provides: "Section 2. Officers and employees in the Civil Service, including members of the armed forces, shall not engage directly or indirectly in partisan political activities or take part in any election except to vote."  Section 5, Article XII-B of the 1973 Constitution provides: "Section 5.

(underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>As presented by the <i>ponencia, </i>a parallel provision on persons holding <i>elective</i> office or position existed in Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code (December 3, 1985) until it was repealed by Republic Act No. 9006 (February 12, 2001) or the <i>Fair Election Act</i>.  Prior to the repeal, the provision was amplified by the first proviso of the third paragraph of Section 11 of Republic Act No. 8436 (December 22, 1997) otherwise known as the <i>Election Automation Law </i>until said proviso was rendered ineffective in 2001 by the <i>Fair Election Act </i>and was totally abandoned in 2007 by the amendatory law of Republic Act No. 9369.<br><br>In granting the petition, the <i>ponencia </i>eliminates the <i>ipso facto</i> resignation from public office by an appointive public official upon the filing of the certificate of candidacy, thereby removing the distinction between one holding an appointive position and one holding an elective position.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>revisits <i>Fariñas v. The Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> notwithstanding its submission that the discussion therein on the equal protection clause was <i>obiter dictum</i>, albeit the issue was squarely raised therein.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>adds that <i>Fariñas</i> focused on the validity of the repeal of Section 67 (on elective positions) of the <i>Omnibus Election Code </i>and never posed a direct challenge to the constitutionality of retaining Section 66 (on appointive positions) thereof.  <i>En passant</i>, I observe that neither is the constitutionality of Section 13 of Republic Act No. 9369 and Section 66 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 challenged by petitioners in the present case.  What petitioners assail is, it bears repeating, Section 4(a) of Comelec Resolution No. 8678.<br><br>In <i>Fariñas</i>, the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>The petitioners' contention, that the repeal of Section 67 of the Omnibus Election Code pertaining to elective officials gives undue benefit to such officials as against the appointive ones and violates the equal protection clause of the constitution, is tenuous.<br><br>The equal protection of the law clause in the Constitution is not absolute, but is subject to reasonable classification.  If the groupings are characterized by substantial distinctions that make real differences, one class may be treated and regulated differently from the other. The Court has explained the nature of the equal protection guarantee in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>The equal protection of the law clause is against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality.  It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate.  It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, <i>under like circumstances and conditions</i> both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.  The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable grounds exist for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.<br></blockquote><br>Substantial distinctions clearly exist between elective officials and appointive officials.  The former occupy their office by virtue of the mandate of the electorate.  They are elected to an office for a definite term and may be removed therefrom only upon stringent conditions. On the other hand, appointive officials hold their office by virtue of their designation thereto by an appointing authority.  Some appointive officials hold their office in a permanent capacity and are entitled to security of tenure while others serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority.<br><br>Another substantial distinction between the two sets of officials is that under Section 55, Chapter 8, Title I, Subsection A. Civil Service Commission, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292), <u>appointive officials, as officers and employees in the civil service, are strictly prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote.  Under the same provision, elective officials, or officers or employees holding political offices, are obviously expressly allowed to take part in political and electoral activities</u>.<br><br>By repealing Section 67 but r<u>etaining Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code</u>, the legislators deemed it proper to treat these two classes of officials differently with respect to the effect on their tenure in the office of the filing of the certificates of candidacy for any position other than those occupied by them.  Again, it is not within the power of the Court to pass upon or look into the wisdom of this classification.<br><br>Since the classification justifying Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 9006, <i>i.e.</i>, elected officials <i>vis-a-vis</i> appointive officials, is anchored upon material and significant distinctions and all the persons belonging under the same classification are similarly treated, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is, thus, not infringed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (italics in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Fariñas</i> pointed out at least three material and substantial distinctions that set apart elective officials from appointive officials (<i>i.e.</i>, mandate of the electorate, removal from office only upon stringent conditions, no prohibition against partisan political activity).  The <i>ponencia <u></u></i><u>does <b>not </b>dispute the presence of this set of distinctions as one of the grounds for a classification to be valid and non-violative of the equal protection clause.</u><br><br>The <i>ponencia </i><u>does <b>not </b>correlate the impact of the prohibition against partisan political activity on the provisions on <i>ipso facto</i> resignation</u>.  Section 55, Chapter 8, Title I, Subsection A, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 55. Political Activity. - <u>No officer or employee in the Civil Service including members of the Armed Forces, shall engage, directly or indirectly, in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote nor shall he use his official authority or influence to coerce the political activity of any other person or body</u>.  Nothing herein provided shall be understood to prevent any officer or employee from expressing his views on current political problems or issues, or from mentioning the names of his candidates for public office whom he supports: Provided, T<u>hat public officers and employees holding political offices may take part in political and electoral activities but it shall be unlawful for them to solicit contributions from their subordinates or subject them to any of the acts involving subordinates prohibited in the Election Code</u>. (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>To allow appointive officials to hang on to their respective posts <i>after </i>filing their certificate of candidacy will open the floodgates to countless charges of violation of the prohibition on partisan political activity.  The filing of the certificate of candidacy is already <b><u>deemed as a partisan political activity</u></b>, which also explains why the appointive official is considered <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from public office upon the date of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, and not the date of the start of the campaign period.  <i>Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> teaches:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, <u>the act of filing a Certificate of Candidacy while one is employed in the civil service constitutes <b>a just cause for termination </b>of employment for appointive officials. Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, in considering an appointive official <i>ipso facto</i> resigned, merely provides for the <b>immediate implementation of the penalty for the prohibited act of engaging in partisan political activity</b></u><b>.  </b>This provision was not intended, and should not be used, as a defense against an administrative case for acts committed during government service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court cannot look into the wisdom of the classification, as it runs the risk of either unduly magnifying the minutiae or viewing the whole picture with a myopic lens.  <b>The Court cannot strike down as unconstitutional the above-mentioned provisions without crossing the path of said Section 55 of the Administrative Code, among other things,<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></b> on political activity or without rebutting the apolitical nature of an appointive office.</b>  Section 55, however, is, as earlier stated, neither challenged in the present case, nor are Section 13 of Republic Act No. 9369 and Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code.<br><br>While the <i>ponencia </i>admits that there are substantial distinctions, it avers that the requisite that the classification be germane to the purposes of the law is absent.<br><br>In discussing the underlying objectives of the law, the majority opinion identifies the evils sought to be prevented by the law and opines that these evils are present in both elective and appointive public offices.  <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>the <i>ponencia </i>kills the law and spares the evils.</b>  It raises arguments that lend support more to a <u>parity of applicatio</u>n of the <i>ipso facto</i> resignation than a <u>parity of non-application</u> of the <i>ipso facto</i> resignation.<br><br>In explaining Section 2 (4) of Article IX-B of the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> an eminent constitutionalist elucidated that the general rule is "intended to keep the Civil Service free of the deleterious effects of political partisanship."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  Political partisanship, meanwhile, is the inevitable essence of a political office, elective positions included.<br><br>Unfortunately, the <i>ponencia </i><u>does <b>not </b>refute the apolitical nature of an appointive office</u>.  To the issues surrounding the policy of reserving political activities to political officers, the remedy is legislation.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>proceeds to discuss the right to run for public office in relation to the freedom of expression and of association.  It cites <i>Mancuso v. Taft</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit, involving a city home rule charter in Rhode Island, to buttress its conclusion and to persuade<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> that this jurisdiction too should follow suit.<br><br>In U.S. jurisdiction, however, the Hatch Act of 1939<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which imposes limitations on the political activities of federal government employees is still considered good law.  It prohibits government employees from running for or holding public office or participating in the campaign management for another.  On two occasions, the Hatch Act has been brought to the US Supreme Court, both times based on First Amendment arguments that the prohibitions were unduly restrictive on the private constitutional liberties of government employees.  The statute was upheld in both cases, <i>United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and <i>United States</i><i> Civil Service Commission v National Association of Letter Carriers</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The Hatch Act has since been applied or copied in most states with respect to state or local government employees.  While the spirit of the ruling in <i>Mitchell</i> has been questioned or overturned by inferior courts in cases assailing similar state laws or city charters (such as <i>Mancuso</i>), <i><u>Mitchell</u></i><u> has not, however, been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court</u>.  An inferior court can never erode a Supreme Court decision.<br><br>Finally, a public employee holding appointive office or position, by accepting a non-political government appointment, binds himself to the terms and conditions of employment fixed by law.  In one case, it was held that in government employment, "it is the legislature and, where properly given delegated power, the administrative heads of government which fix the terms and conditions of employment.  And this is effected through the statutes or administrative circulars, rules, and regulations[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> part of which is the setting of standards for allowable limitations in the exercise of the rights of free expression and of assembly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS </b>the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Entitled "Guidelines on the Filing of Certificates of Candidacy (CoC) and Nomination of Official Candidates of Registered Political Parties in connection with the May 10, 2010 National and Local Elections."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 463 Phil. 179 (2003).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 205-208.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> EXECUTIVE ORDER No. 292 (July 25, 1987).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> G.R.
