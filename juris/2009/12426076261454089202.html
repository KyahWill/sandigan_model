				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking the annulment of (a) the June 28, 2007 Resolution No. 8212<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or the Omnibus Resolution on Pending Cases issued by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) <i>en banc</i> (Resolution No. 8212) and (b) the October 18, 2007 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the COMELEC Second Division (assailed Order).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>The Facts</i></b><br></div><br>In the May 14, 2007 national and local elections, petitioner Elpidio B. Valino (petitioner), together with respondents Alvin P. Vergara (Vergara), Tomas N. Joson III (Joson) and Raul P. Mendoza (Mendoza) (respondents), vied for the local position of mayor in Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija (the City).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; During the campaign period, petitioner complained about the illegal display and installation of campaign posters, streamers and other materials in all polling places, streets and highways of the City by local and national candidates. On May 8, 2007, petitioner wrote respondent Atty. Harold Ramos (Atty. Ramos), Election Officer of the COMELEC-Cabanatuan, about these violations and reminded the latter of his duty to remove illegal campaign materials and to impose sanctions on the erring candidates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Petitioner also wrote Police Superintendent Eliseo D.C. Cruz (P/Supt. Cruz), City Chief of Police, on May 11, 2007, reiterating his complaint and demanding that the clean-up drive against illegal campaign materials be continuously implemented up to May 14, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On May 13 and 14, 2007, petitioner took pictures of several polling places showing the violations committed by respondents and other candidates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> No action was taken by anyone to remove the illegal campaign materials.<br><br>After the elections, Vergara won and was proclaimed City Mayor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On May 25, 2007, petitioner filed with the COMELEC a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for Violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9006, otherwise known as the Fair Election Act, against respondents, docketed as Special Case (SPC) No. 07-152 (SPC 07-152). The petition sought the cancellation of the proclamation of respondent Vergara and the other elected city officials, and enjoined them from exercising their respective duties as elected city officials, for having intentionally caused the installation of illegal campaign materials outside the authorized common poster areas in violation of the law. The case was raffled to the COMELEC Second Division.<br><br>On June 28, 2007, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> issued Resolution No. 8212 pursuant to Section 16 of R.A. No. 7166,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and SPC No. 07-152 was not included in the list of pre-proclamation cases that shall remain active after June 30, 2007. Petitioner alleged that he came to know of Resolution No. 8212 from the newspaper, Manila Bulletin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> published on July 9, 2007, with its headline "Hundreds of Poll Cases Dismissed" by the COMELEC. Petitioner also alleged that he personally received a photocopy of the Resolution on July 16, 2007, and was advised that SPC 07-152 was already dismissed by the COMELEC Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner, on July 18, 2007, without the assistance of counsel, filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> praying that SPC 07-152 be included in the list of active cases, and the proceedings therein continue beyond June 30, 2007. Petitioner asseverated that he filed the Motion with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> through its Second Division, claiming that only the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, which issued Resolution No. 8212, had the jurisdiction to resolve his Motion. Petitioner, however, received no reply from the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. Subsequently, on August 21, 2007 and October 4, 2007, petitioner filed a Manifestation and Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and an Urgent Omnibus Motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> respectively, reiterating his Motion for Reconsideration, but no immediate reply came from the COMELEC.<br><br>On October 18, 2007, the COMELEC Second Division issued the assailed Order, forwarding to the Clerk of the COMELEC the original case folder of SPC 07-152, being a pre-proclamation case considered not to have survived pursuant to Resolution No. 8212.&nbsp; Petitioner averred that he received a copy of the assailed Order on November 13, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Hence, on November 28, 2007, petitioner filed the instant petition before this Court, assigning the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Violation of the due process clause of the Constitution;<br><br></li><li>Failure of the COMELEC to follow the prescribed laws regarding cases of disqualification and hearing thereof;<br><br></li><li>The complaint filed by the Petitioner is not among those considered pre-proclamation cases dismissed by the COMELEC; and<br><br></li><li>The COMELEC as the leading Constitutional Body tasked to implement Election Laws but which [was] not followed by its authorized representatives in Cabanatuan City, Province of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioner argues that he was denied due process because no initial hearing or preliminary investigation was conducted on his petition to determine the guilt of respondents for violation of election laws. Petitioner adds that Resolution No. 8212 was issued only to accommodate and meet the deadline for the proclamation of duly elected officials at the expense of due process; and of honest, fair and credible elections. Moreover, petitioner alleges that Atty. Ramos and respondents conspired to circumvent the law in favor of Vergara by being silent about the complaint of petitioner. Lastly, petitioner manifests that Atty. Ramos, in dereliction of duty and with gross negligence, succumbed to the pressures, whims and caprices of respondents; and failed to conduct a summary hearing to resolve the complaint, without giving a formal notice to any of respondents and ordering the removal of their respective illegal campaign materials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Only respondents Vergara and the COMELEC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed their comments and, subsequently, their respective memoranda.&nbsp; In our Resolution of February 24, 2009, we dispensed with the other respondents' memoranda.<br><br>Vergara claims that he was not charged with an election offense; that Atty. Ramos and P/Supt. Cruz did not send any notice to him requiring him to remove the alleged offending campaign materials; and that he was not aware at all of their existence. Vergara submits that the instant petition is insufficient in form and substance; hence, it ought to be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The COMELEC, through the OSG, reiterates the rule that a decision, order or resolution issued by a division of the COMELEC must be elevated first to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> via a motion for reconsideration, and it is the final decision of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> that can be brought to the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari</i> pursuant to Section 7,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution; that petitioner does not dispute his failure to elevate the assailed Order of the COMELEC Second Division to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>; and that this Court has no power to review via <i>certiorari</i> an interlocutory order or even a final resolution of a division of the COMELEC. The OSG postulates that a motion for reconsideration is the plain and adequate remedy under the law and, thus, the failure of petitioner to comply with this mandatory procedural requirement constitutes a ground for the dismissal of the instant petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The instant petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>We acknowledge that Resolution No. 8212 is an issuance in the exercise of the COMELEC's adjudicatory or quasi-judicial function pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 16<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of R.A. No. 7166. The determination by the COMELEC of the merits of a pre-proclamation case definitely involves the exercise of adjudicatory powers, wherein the COMELEC examines and weighs the parties' pieces of evidence vis-à-vis their respective arguments, and considers whether, on the basis of the evidence thus far presented, the case appears to have merit. Where a power rests in judgment or discretion, so that the exercise thereof is of judicial nature or character, but does not involve the exercise of functions of a judge, or is conferred upon an officer other than a judicial officer, it is deemed quasi-judicial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's pre-proclamation case was not in the list annexed to Resolution No. 8212. Simply put, the COMELEC <i>en banc,</i> in Resolution No. 8212, found petitioner's case unmeritorious and, thus, excluded it from the list of cases that would remain active beyond June 30, 2007. Accordingly, petitioner could no longer expect any favorable ruling from the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. The appropriate recourse of petitioner should have been a petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed before this Court within thirty (30) days from notice of Resolution No. 8212, pursuant to Sections 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Rule 64 in connection with Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. However, petitioner failed to do so and, instead, filed a motion for reconsideration addressed to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> through its Second Division. The failure of the petitioner to seasonably undertake the proper recourse before this Court is fatal to his cause.<br><br>The filing of his Motion for Reconsideration is of no moment. Section 1(d), Rule 13 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure categorically prohibits a motion to reconsider a resolution of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> except in cases involving election offenses. As held in <i>Bautista v. COMELEC</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><blockquote>We hold that petitioner acted correctly in filing the present petition because the resolution of the COMELEC in question is not subject to reconsideration and, therefore, any party who disagreed with it only had one recourse, and that was to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 13, §1 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides:<br><br><i>What Pleadings are Not Allowed</i>. -- The following pleadings are not allowed:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>d) motion for reconsideration of an en banc ruling, resolution, order or decision except in election offense cases;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As the case before the COMELEC did not involve an election offense, reconsideration of the COMELEC resolution was not possible and petitioner had no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. For him to wait until the COMELEC denied his motion would be to allow the reglementary period for filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with this Court to run and expire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Time and again, we held that rules of procedure exist for a noble purpose, and to disregard such rules, in the guise of liberal construction, would be to defeat such purpose. Procedural rules are not to be disdained as mere technicalities. They may not be ignored to suit the convenience of a party. Adjective law ensures the effective enforcement of substantive rights through the orderly and speedy administration of justice. Rules are not intended to hamper litigants or complicate litigation; they help provide a vital system of justice where suitors may be heard following judicial procedure and in the correct forum. Public order and our system of justice are well served by a conscientious observance by the parties of the procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> We see no cogent reason why we should exempt petitioner's case from this doctrine.<br><br>Based on the foregoing disquisitions, Resolution No. 8212, with respect to petitioner, had already become final and executory and, therefore, beyond the purview of this Court to act upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Ostensibly, petitioner's case before the COMELEC-Cabanatuan was a complaint against the respondents for installing illegal campaign materials outside the common poster areas and near the polling places, which is technically an election offense. When Atty. Ramos of the COMELEC-Cabanatuan and P/Supt. Cruz allegedly failed to act on the matter, petitioner went to the COMELEC. We observe, however, that petitioner, from the start, failed to avail himself of the proper procedure. Rule 34<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure clearly lays down the legal steps in the prosecution of election offenses. In <i>Laurel</i><i> v. Presiding Judge, RTC-Manila, Br. 10</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we applied the aforementioned rule. For purposes of clarity, we enumerate the lapses of petitioner, who, perhaps due to the lack of assistance of a lawyer, failed to follow the rules.<br><br><i>First</i>, when petitioner reported to Atty. Ramos and to P/Supt. Cruz the alleged illegally posted campaign materials, his respective letter-complaints to them were unverified and the same appeared not to have been supported by affidavits and other evidence as required by the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><i>Second</i>, when the complaint was not acted upon by Atty. Ramos and P/Supt. Cruz, petitioner did not file a verified complaint with the COMELEC Law Department.<br><br><i>Third</i>, in his petition filed with the COMELEC, petitioner sought the annulment of the proclamation of all respondents instead of asking for a preliminary investigation and the eventual prosecution of said election offense. It is obvious that because of the relief sought, the COMELEC treated petitioner's case as a pre-proclamation controversy when, as to law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the grounds relied upon were not at all proper grounds thereof.<br><br>Thus, since his petition was in the nature of a pre-proclamation contest not anchored on the exclusive issues that may be raised in a pre-proclamation contest under Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code, the COMELEC&nbsp;&nbsp; properly dismissed the same by not including it in the list of cases that would remain active beyond June 30, 2007.<br><br>Well-entrenched in this jurisdiction is the principle that the office of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is not the correction of simple errors of judgment but capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction, or arbitrary and despotic exercise of power because of passion or personal hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In this regard, the COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in treating petitioner's case as a pre-proclamation controversy and in excluding the same, due to lack of merit, from the list annexed to Resolution No. 8212.&nbsp; This is consistent with the policy that pre-proclamation controversies should be summarily decided, consonant with the law's desire that the canvass and proclamation be delayed as little as possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In the present case, the petition does not, in fact, ascribe grave abuse of discretion nor does it sufficiently show that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in excluding his case from the list of those that shall continue. Apart from petitioner's bare allegations, the record is bereft of any evidence to prove that petitioner's pre-proclamation case appears meritorious and warrants the annulment of the proclamation of Vergara as elected mayor of the city and of other respondents who were likewise elected and proclaimed but were not impleaded herein with particularity.<br><br>However, as a Court of justice and equity, we cannot simply brush aside Atty. Ramos' failure to exercise his duty under Section 4(c), Rule 34 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure.&nbsp; Atty. Ramos apparently failed to furnish the Director of the COMELEC Law Department a copy of petitioner's complaint, as required in Section 4(b), Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. He should be made to explain why he ignored the complaint and breached the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. As to the petitioner, considering that election offenses prescribe in four (4) years, he may still file or revive his complaint, following COMELEC rules.<br><br>On the assailed Order, dated October 18, 2007, of the COMELEC Second Division, it is well to note that it did not dismiss petitioner's case.&nbsp; It merely forwarded the original case folder to the Clerk of the COMELEC. As already mentioned, what actually dismissed petitioner's case was Resolution No. 8212 issued by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. Inasmuch as one of the duties of the Clerk of the COMELEC is to keep and secure all records, papers, files, exhibits, the office seal and other public property committed to his charge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed to the COMELEC Second Division when it issued the assailed Order because the same merely directed that the original case folder of petitioner's case be forwarded to the Clerk of the COMELEC -- an act administrative in nature which does not involve an exercise of discretion.<br><br>In light of the foregoing discussion, the instant petition has no leg to stand on.<br><br>Admittedly, the advent of COMELEC Resolution No. 8212 caused a measure of confusion among party litigants and even among lawyers. This is the reason why, in<i> Patalinghug v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we took the opportunity, for the guidance of the members of the bench and bar, to set the following guidelines:<br><blockquote><i> First</i>, <b>if a pre-proclamation case is excluded from the list of those</b> (annexed to the <i>Omnibus Resolution on Pending Cases</i>) <b>that shall continue after the beginning of the term of the office involved</b>, the remedy of the aggrieved party is to timely file a <i>certiorari</i> petition assailing the Omnibus Resolution before the Court under Rules 64 and 65, regardless of whether a COMELEC division is yet to issue a definitive ruling in the main case or the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> is yet to act on a motion for reconsideration filed if there is any.<br><br>It follows that if the resolution on the motion for reconsideration by the <i>banc</i> precedes the exclusion of the said case from the list, what should be brought before the Court on <i>certiorari</i> is the decision resolving the motion.<br><br><i> Second</i>, <b>if a pre-proclamation case is dismissed by a COMELEC division and, <i>on the same date of dismissal or within the period to file a motion for reconsideration</i>, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> excluded the said case from the list annexed to the Omnibus Resolution</b>, the remedy of the aggrieved party is also to timely file a <i>certiorari</i> petition assailing the Omnibus Resolution before the Court under Rules 64 and 65. The aggrieved party need no longer file a motion for reconsideration of the division ruling.<br><br>The rationale for this is that the exclusion by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> of a pre-proclamation case from the list of those that shall continue is already deemed a final dismissal of that case not only by the division but also by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. As already explained earlier, the aggrieved party can no longer expect any favorable ruling from the COMELEC.<br><br>And <i>third</i>, <b>if a pre-proclamation case is dismissed by a COMELEC division but, <i>on the same date of dismissal or within the period to file a motion for reconsideration, the COMELEC en banc included the case in the list annexed to the Omnibus Resolution</i></b>, the remedy of the aggrieved party is to timely file a motion for reconsideration with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. The reason for this is that the challenge to the ruling of the COMELEC division will have to be resolved definitively by the entire body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>These guidelines - and Section 16, R.A. No. 7166 - notwithstanding, we are constrained to express the view that the COMELEC should rule on pre-proclamation cases individually, even if the ruling is simply couched in a minute resolution.&nbsp; This will dispel qualms about lack of adequate notice to party litigants, and obviate the confusion that generally results from the issuance of omnibus resolutions.&nbsp; In all, such a practice would be consistent with the constitutional principle of transparency, and lend itself to greater public confidence in our electoral system.<br><br>In the case at bar, the petitioner may have been equally confused on the remedies available to him vis-à-vis Resolution No. 8212. We do not fault him for this, but we nonetheless dismiss his petition because we find no grave abuse of discretion in the assailed COMELEC Resolution and Order.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>. No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Quisumbing, Acting C.J., Ynares-Santiago,&nbsp; Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio Morales, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Brion,</i> and <i>Peralta, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><i>Puno, C.J., </i>on official leave<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Petitioner failed to properly and particularly implead all the respondents in this case.
