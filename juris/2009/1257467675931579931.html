Apart from questioning the inclusion in the auction sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of some of the properties which it had attached, respondent questioned the failure to duly notify it of the sale at least 10 days before the sale, citing Section 14 of Act No. 1508 or the <i>Chattel Mortgage Law</i> which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 14.

This however is not at issue in this case.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is being contested is the </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>right</i></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of Royal Cargo to be </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">timely informed </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the foreclosure sale</span> as it too had interests over the mortgagee Terrymanila, Inc.'s assets.

No. </span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">[1]</sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15662</span>.  RCBC, by arguing about its preferential right as mortgagee in the instant appeal merely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reiterates what had </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">already been considered and ruled upon </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in earlier proceedings.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 14</span> of the Chattel Mortgage Law pertaining to the procedure in the foreclosure of chattel mortgages provides, to wit:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>The above-quoted provision clearly requires <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that the mortgagee should </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">notify in writing </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the mortgagor or </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">person holding under him </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the time and place of the sale</span> by personal delivery of the notice.  Thus, RCBC's failure to comply with this requirement warranted a ruling against it by the RTC.  (Italics in the original; emphasis partly in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> petitioner lodged the present petition for review which raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A TEN(10)-DAY PRIOR NOTICE</span> OF THE JUNE 16, 1992 FORECLOSURE SALE<br><br><center>II<br></center><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN DECLARING PETITIONER GUILTY OF CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD</span> IN FAILING TO PROVIDE RESPONDENT A TEN (10)-DAY PRIOR NOTICE OF THE FORECLOSURE SALE.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITIONER WAS CORRECTLY HELD LIABLE TO PAY RESPONDENT P296,662.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration: underline;">[16]</sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> PLUS INTEREST</span> THEREON, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">EXEMPLARY DAMAGES</span> AND <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ATTORNEY'S FEES</span>.<br><br><center>IV</center><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner faults the appellate court in applying <i>res judicata </i>by holding that respondent's entitlement to notice of the auction sale had already been settled in its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 31125</span> and in this Court's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision in G.R. No. 115662</span>.  For, so it contends, the decisions in these cases dealt on <i>interlocutory</i> issues, <i>viz</i>:  the issue of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether respondent's petition for annulment of the sale stated a cause of action</span>, and the issue of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether petitioner's motion to dismiss was properly denied</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Arguing against respondent's position that it was entitled to notice of the auction sale, petitioner cites the <i>Chattel Mortgage Law</i> which enumerates who are entitled to be notified under Section 14 thereof.  It posits that "[h]ad the law intended to include in said Section an attaching creditor or a judgment creditor [like herein respondent], it could have so specifically stated therein, since in the preceding section, Section 13, it already mentioned that a subsequent attaching creditor may redeem."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner goes on to fault the appellate court in echoing its ruling in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CA-G.R. SP No. 31125</span> that Sections 13<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and 14 of the <i>Chattel Mortgage Law</i> should be read in tandem since the right given to the attaching creditor under Section 13 "would not serve its purpose if we were to exclude the subsequent attaching creditor from those who under Section 14 need to be notified of the foreclosure sale ten days before it is held."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner likewise posits that Section 13 permits a subsequent attaching creditor to "redeem" the mortgage only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the holding of the auction sale, drawing attention to <i>Paray v.

SP No. 31125</span>, resolved only the <i>interlocutory </i>issue of whether the trial court's Order of April 12, 1993 denying petitioner's motion to dismiss respondent's petition for annulment was attended by grave abuse of discretion.  The appellate court did not rule on the <i>merits </i>of the petition as to establish a controlling legal rule which has to be subsequently followed by the parties in the same case.  It merely held that respondent's petition in the trial court stated a sufficient cause of action.  Its determination of respondent's entitlement to notice of the public auction sale was at best<i> prima facie</i>.  Thus, the appellate court held:<br><br><blockquote>In view of the above, We are of the considered view that the private respondent's petition in the court <u>a quo <b>prima facie</b></u> <b>states a sufficient cause of action</b> and that the public respondent in denying the petitioner's motion to dismiss, had acted advisedly and well within its powers and authority.  <b>We, therefore, find <u>no cause to annul the challenged <i>order</i></u> issued by the respondent court in Civil Case No. 92-62106.  </b>(Underscoring in the original; emphasis and italics supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>An order denying a motion to dismiss is merely <i>interlocutory </i>and cannot give rise to <i>res judicata</i>, hence, it is subject to amendments until the rendition of the final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On respondent's contention that petitioner, as mortgagee, had the duty to notify it of the public auction sale, the Court finds the same immaterial to the case.<br><br>Section 13 of the <i>Chattel Mortgage Law</i> allows the would-be redemptioner thereunder to redeem the mortgaged property only <b><i>before</i></b> its sale.  Consider the following pronouncement in <i>Paray</i>:<i> </i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br><blockquote><u>[T]here is no law in our statute books which vests the <b>right </b>of redemption over <i>personal </i>property.  Act No. 1508, or the Chattel Mortgage Law, ostensibly could have served as the vehicle for any legislative intent to bestow a <b>right </b>of redemption over personal property, since that law governs the extrajudicial sale of mortgaged <b>personal </b>property, but the statute is definitely silent on the point.  And Section 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, extensively relied upon by the Court of Appeals, starkly utters that the right of redemption applies to <b><i>real </i></b>properties, not personal properties, sold on execution</u>.  (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Unmistakably, the redemption cited in Section 13 partakes of an <b><i>equity</i> </b>of redemption, which is the right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after his default</span> in the performance of the conditions of the mortgage but <i style="text-decoration: underline;">before</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the sale of the property</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to clear it from the encumbrance of the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It is not the same as <b><i>right </i></b>of redemption which is the right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property after registration of the foreclosure sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">after </i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">confirmation of the sale</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>While respondent had attached some of Terrymanila's assets to secure the satisfaction of a P296,662.16 judgment rendered in another case, what it effectively attached was Terrymanila's <i>equity </i>of redemption.  That respondent's claim is much lower than the P1.5 million actual bid of petitioner at the auction sale does not defeat respondent's <i>equity </i>of redemption.  <i>Top Rate International Services, Inc. v. IAC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> </i>enlightens:<br><br><blockquote><b>It is, therefore, error on the part of the petitioner to say that since private respondents' lien is only a total of P343,227.40, they cannot be entitled to the equity of redemption because the exercise of such right would require the payment of an amount which cannot be less than P40,000,000.00. </b><br><br>When herein private respondents prayed for the attachment of the properties to secure their respective claims against Consolidated Mines, Inc., the properties had already been mortgaged to the consortium of twelve banks to secure an obligation of US$62,062,720.66.  Thus, like subsequent mortgagees, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondents' liens on such properties became inferior to that of banks, which claims in the event of foreclosure proceedings, must first be satisfied</span>.  <b>The appellate court, therefore, was correct in holding that in reality, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what was attached by the respondents was merely </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">Consolidated Mines' . . .</i><i style="text-decoration: underline;"> equity of redemption</i></b>.  x x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>We, therefore, hold that the appellate court did not commit any error in ruling that there was no over-levy on the disputed properties.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What was </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">actually attached </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by respondents was Consolidated Mines' </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">right or equity of redemption, </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">an incorporeal and intangible right, the value of which can neither be quantified nor equated with the actual value of the properties upon which it may be exercised</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Having thus attached Terrymanila's <i>equity </i>of redemption, respondent had to be informed of the date of sale of the mortgaged assets for it to exercise such equity of redemption over some of those foreclosed properties, as provided for in Section 13.<br><br>Recall, however, that respondent filed a motion to reconsider the February 3, 1992 Order of the RTC Bataan-insolvency court which granted leave to petitioner to foreclose the chattel mortgage, which motion was denied.  Notably, respondent failed to allege this incident in his annulment of sale case before the RTC of Manila.<br><br>Thus, even prior to receiving, through counsel, a mailed notice of the auction sale on the date of the auction sale itself on June 16, 1992, respondent was already put on notice of the impending foreclosure sale of the mortgaged chattels.  It could thus have expediently exercised its equity of redemption, at the earliest when it received the insolvency court's Order of March 20, 1992 denying its Motion for Reconsideration of the February 3, 1992 Order.<br><br>Despite its window of opportunity to exercise its equity of redemption, however, respondent chose to be technically shrewd about its chances, preferring instead to seek annulment of the auction sale, which was the result of the foreclosure of the mortgage, permission to conduct which it had early on opposed before the insolvency court.  Its negligence or omission to exercise its equity of redemption within a reasonable time, or even on the day of the auction sale, warrants a presumption that it had either abandoned it or opted not to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  Equitable considerations thus sway against it.<br><br>It is also not lost on the Court that as early as April 12, 1991, Terrymanila had been judicially declared insolvent.  Respondent's recourse was thus to demand the satisfaction of its judgment award before the insolvency court as its judgment award is a preferred credit under Article 2244<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the Civil Code.  To now allow respondent have its way in annulling the auction sale and at the same time let it proceed with its claims before the insolvency court would neither rhyme with reason nor with justice.<br><br>Parenthetically, respondent has not shown that it was prejudiced by the auction sale since the insolvency court already determined that even if the mortgaged properties were foreclosed, there were still sufficient, unencumbered assets of Terrymanila to cover the obligations owing to other creditors, including that of respondent's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In any event, even if respondent would have participated in the auction sale and matched petitioner's bid, the superiority of petitioner's lien over the mortgaged assets would preclude respondent from recovering the chattels.<br><br><blockquote>It has long been settled by this Court that "<b>the right of those who acquire said properties <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not and can not be superior to that of the creditor who has in his favor an instrument of mortgage</span> executed with the formalities of the law, in good faith, and without the least indication of fraud</b>. x x x.  In purchasing it, with full knowledge that such circumstances existed, it should be presumed that he did so, very much willing to respect the lien existing thereon, since he should not have expected that with the purchase, he would acquire a better right than that which the vendor then had. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It bears noting that the chattel mortgage in favor of petitioner was registered more than two years before the issuance of a writ of attachment over some of Terrymanila's chattels in favor of respondent. This is significant in determining who between petitioner and respondent should be given preference over the subject properties.  Since the registration of a chattel mortgage is an effective and binding notice to other creditors of its existence and creates a real right or lien that follows the property wherever it may be,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the right of respondent, as an attaching creditor or as purchaser, had it purchased the mortgaged chattel at the auction sale, is subordinate to the lien of the mortgagee who has in his favor a valid chattel mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Contrary then to the appellate court's ruling, petitioner is not liable for constructive fraud for proceeding with the auction sale.  Nor for subsequently selling the chattel. For foreclosure suits may be initiated even during insolvency proceedings, as long as leave must first be obtained from the insolvency court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> as what petitioner did.<br><br>The appellate court's award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees for respondent, given petitioner's good faith, is thus not warranted.<br><br>As for petitioner's prayer for attorney's fees in its Compulsory Counterclaim, the same is in order, the dismissal of respondent's Complaint nowithstanding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <i>Perkin Elmer Singapore v.

In this case, the Court held that "it is clear that, with the declaration of insolvency, courts in insolvency obtain full and complete jurisdiction over all property of the insolvent and of all claims by and against him, with full authority to suspend, on the application of the debtor, a creditor, or the assignee, any action or proceeding then pending in any court, to await the determination of the court of insolvency on the question of the bankrupt's discharge.  The assignee in the case at bar asked that the action be dismissed on the ground that the court in insolvency having complete jurisdiction over the affairs of an insolvent debtor, and particularly the distribution of his estate for the payment of his debts, an action begun in another court which tends in any material way to interfere with the exercise of that jurisdiction is prohibited either expressly or impliedly by the Insolvency Law and cannot, therefore, be maintained when appropriate objection by the proper parties is interposed. It is evident that if the various courts of the Islands may by action or other proceeding intervene in the affairs of an insolvent debtor and with the administration of the court in insolvency, great confusion would result and the termination of the insolvency proceeding might be delayed unduly. We believe it to be the policy of the Insolvency Law to place the insolvent debtor and all his assets and liabilities completely within the jurisdiction and control of the court in insolvency and not to permit the intervention of any other court in the bankrupt's concerns or in the administration of his estate."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <i>Cabral v.
