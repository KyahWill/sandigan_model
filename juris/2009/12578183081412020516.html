The audit team immediately informed him that the practice of not remitting the Court's collection on time is strictly prohibited. [Respondent] started explaining the reason why he was safe keeping it instead of depositing it to the depositary bank. According to him, he was traumatized by an incident which happened when he allegedly lost an amount approximately more than <b>Sixty Thousand [P]esos (P60,000.00). </b>He showed to the audit team his affidavit stating therein that, allegedly, on the day of August 19, 2005, he was victimized by a pickpocket when he failed to catch up with the last banking hours of Land Bank and proceeded instead to a drugstore to buy medicine for he was not feeling well that day and to buy as well some basic needs for his family; that upon arriving at his house, to his surprise, the envelope containing the cash bond placed in his pocket was allegedly missing. The incident, according to him, was reported to the police and entered in the police blotter logbook. The said P60,000.00 pertains to cash bond posted for Criminal Case No. 10094 under OR No. 17871671 collected on August 19, 2005 which was deposited and restituted by [respondent] only last January 24, 2006.<br><br>[Respondent] was directed thru a letter prepared by the audit team leader to deposit immediately the supposed cash on hand consisting of unremitted collections amounting to <b>Eighty-Three Thousand One Hundred Ten [P]esos (P83,110.00) </b>in their respective bank accounts on the following banking day; and EX[P]LAIN in a form of Affidavit the reason why he incurred such accountability....<br><br>On September 24, 2007, Monday, three o'clock in the afternoon, after the team leader and [respondent] had a reconciliation of the balances to be deposited to LBP, the former asked the latter the deposit slips of the said amount, [respondent] replied that he failed to go to the bank because, according to him, he was completing the Monthly Report of Cases. [Respondent] just made a promise to deposit it on the following day.<br><br>On September 25, 2007, while [respondent] was not yet around, the team leader had a talk with Presiding Judge Ma.

Since former Officer-In-Charge Narciso P. Tolentino, Court Interpreter, is the one next-in-rank to the position of Clerk of Court II, he was designated as new accountable officer replacing [respondent]. [Respondent] came late in the afternoon and only by that time he was informed that his function as Accountable Officer was suspended. But before the audit team had the opportunity of telling him about the suspension of his financial duties, he hurriedly informed the team that<u> <i>he has not yet deposited the amount to the LBP</i></u>.

Directives issued by this Court are not to be treated lightly, certainly not on the pretext that one has forgotten said directives. Effective and efficient administration of justice demands nothing less than faithful adherence to the rules and orders laid down by the Court and in this regard, the respondent failed to show such adherence. Instead, he demonstrated his defiance of the Court's clear order which he should have obeyed without delay.<br><br>Further, respondent Manasan still failed to comply with the Court's directive to submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division of OCA's Court Management Office a copy of the validated deposit slip evidencing deposit of the P2,000.00 to the Fiduciary Account of the MCTC, Orani-Samal, Bataan. Rather than submit a copy of the said deposit slip to the FMO, CMO, respondent Manasan merely relied on the Monthly Report submitted by Mr. Narciso P.

We find such attitude indicative of his arrogance.<br><br>Indifference to or defiance of the Court's orders or resolutions may be punished with dismissal, suspension, or fine as warranted by the circumstances.<br><br>In the case at bar, we deem it sufficient that a fine be imposed on respondent Manasan considering that this is his first administrative offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, the OCA recommended that<br><br><blockquote>...for his disobedience to and defiance of the Court's Resolution, respondent Alfredo P.
