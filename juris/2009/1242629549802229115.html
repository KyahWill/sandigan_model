Leoncio thereafter sold the parcels of lands to the Puyat Corporation.<br><br>On July 8, 1991, Hernando, together with Francisco, filed with the PARO a complaint for the Annulment of Deed of Donation <i>Inter Vivos</i> and Deed of Absolute Sale and to declare as null and void <i>ab initio</i> the waiver of tenancy rights executed by him.&nbsp; Hernando claims that the land in dispute was covered by an OLT pursuant to P.D.

Moreover, the DARAB held that the waiver of tenancy rights by Aguido was valid and enforceable and binding on the petitioners, who were also signatories to the document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Likewise, the DARAB upheld that validity of the waiver of tenancy rights of Hernando which was also signed by his father Francisco.<br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was, however, denied by the DARAB on January 21, 2002. Petitioners then appealed the DARAB Decision to the CA.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></div><br>On September 27, 2004, the CA rendered a decision denying<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the petition, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED due course, and the Resolution of DARAB issued on June 20, 2000, as well as its Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration of petitioners dated January 21, 2002 are both AFFIRMED in all respect.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Pursuant to the Court's ruling in <i>Ernesto v.

No. 27 entitled, "Decreeing the emancipation of tenants from the bondage of the soil transferring to them the ownership of the land[s] they till and providing the instruments and mechanism therefore." The pertinent portions of the Decree are as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>This shall apply to tenant-farmers of private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice and corn under a system of share-crop or lease-tenancy, whether classified as landed estate or not;<br><br><b>The tenant farmer, whether in land classified as landed estate or not, shall be deemed owner of a portion constituting a family-size farm of five (5) hectares if not irrigated and three (3) hectares if irrigated.&nbsp; </b>(Emphasis Supplied)<br></blockquote>P.D. No. 27 should be read in conjunction with Letter of Instruction No. 474 (LOI No. 474) and the DAR Memorandum on the "Interim Guidelines on Retention by Small Landowners" dated July 10, 1975 (DAR Memorandum).<br><br>The pertinent portion of LOI No. 474 is as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>You shall undertake to place the Land Transfer Program of the government pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27, <b>all tenanted rice/corn lands with areas of seven hectares or less belonging to landowners who own other agricultural lands of more than seven hectares in aggregate areas or lands used for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban purposes from which they derive adequate income to support themselves and their families</b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The pertinent portion of the DAR Memorandum is as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><ol start="5"><li><b>Tenanted rice and/or corn lands seven (7) hectares or less shall not be covered by Operation Land Transfer. </b> The relation of the land owner and tenant-farmers in these areas shall be leasehold x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the lands in dispute do not fall under the coverage of P.D. No. 27.&nbsp; The DAR Memorandum is categorical that lands with seven hectares or less shall not be covered by OLT. In DARAB Case No. 3361, the land in dispute only had an area of 4.3488 hectares.&nbsp; In DARAB Case No. 3362, the land in dispute only has an area of 4.2406 hectares.<br><br>Furthermore, LOI No. 474 contains a provision that lands less than seven hectares or less may still fall under the coverage of P.D. No. 27, if the landowner owns other properties.&nbsp; On this point, this Court agrees with the finding of the DARAB, when it observed that there was no record of any circumstance found by DAR field personnel that the landowner owned other agricultural lands in excess of seven hectares or urban land area, from which he derived adequate income for his support and that of his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; It was incumbent on petitioners to show that respondents owned other properties in excess of seven hectares, since he who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, as found by the DARAB, there is nothing of record to show that CLTs have in fact been issued to petitioners or their predecessors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br>Based on the DAR Memorandum, the relationship of petitioners and respondents shall be one of leasehold. This Court finds that respondents have complied with Section 28 of Republic Act No. 3844:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><blockquote>Section 28<b>.</b> <i>Termination of Leasehold by Agricultural Lessee During Agricultural Year</i> -<br><br>The agricultural lessee may terminate the leasehold during the agricultural year for any of the following causes:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>(5) Voluntary surrender due to circumstances more advantageous to him and his family.&nbsp; </b>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Based on the evidence on record, respondents paid Aguido P2,000,000.00 and Hernando P2,417,142.00 as disturbance compensation.&nbsp; A reading of the<i> Pinanumpaang Salaysay </i>executed by petitioners show that they gave up their leasehold rights "<i>dahil sa aming kagustuhang umiba ng hanap buhay ng higit ang pagkikitaan kaysa panakahan.</i>" The money given by respondents as disturbance compensation was indeed advantageous to the families of petitioners, as it would have allowed them to pursue other sources of livelihood.<br><br>Petitioners did not refute in their pleadings the authenticity of the documents purporting to be their waiver of tenancy rights.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, they themselves attached the said documents to their complaints and argued that said waivers were obtained through fraud and misrepresentation, since they were unaware that CLTs were issued in their names.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, such argument deserves scant consideration, since it has been established that no such CLTs were issued to petitioners; and more importantly, the lands in dispute do not fall under the coverage of P.D. No. 27.&nbsp; In addition, said waivers of tenancy rights were notarized and therefore the same have the presumption of regularity in their favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> There is nothing on record to convince this Court to hold otherwise.<br><br>The documents presented by petitioners to prove that CLTs were in fact issued in their names have no probative value.&nbsp; An examination of the documents shows that they are two photocopied pages of what purports to be a "Masterlist of Tenants issued CLTs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Page 6801, where the name of Aguido is listed, appears to be a certified xerox copy sourced from the Bureau of Land Acquisition and Distribution.&nbsp; Page 5695, where the names of Hernando and Francisco are listed, is not so authenticated; thus, its source is highly suspect. These two documents are not sufficiently useful in proving the fact that the CLTs, which would be the best evidence of petitioners' claim over the subject properties, were actually issued.&nbsp; At best, they only serve to prove the probability that CLTs <b>may have been</b> issued in the name of the petitioners. These documents do not and cannot override the PARO and DARAB findings that no CLTs were issued to petitioners.<br><br>Moreover, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that CLTs were actually issued to petitioners, a CLT does not vest in the farmer/grantee ownership of the land described therein.&nbsp; At most, the CLT merely evidences the government's recognition of the grantee as partly qualified to await the statutory mechanism for the acquisition of ownership of the land titled by him as provided in P.D. No. 27.&nbsp; Neither is this recognition permanent or irrevocable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Herein petitioners cannot escape the fact that the lands in dispute do not fall under the coverage of P.D. No. 27; and thus, any supposed or alleged CLTs issued in their names are without bases.<br><br>Because petitioners have received millions of pesos as disturbance compensation and the lands in dispute do not fall under the coverage of P.D. No. 27, this Court cannot allow them to renege on their agreement with respondents. It must be remembered that the protective mantle of social justice was never meant to disregard the rights of landowners. Consequently, the conveyances made to respondents Puyat Corporation are valid.<br><br>Because of the foregoing, it would be unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised by petitioners.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br>The September 27, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
