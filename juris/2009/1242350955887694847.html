				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeks to reverse and set aside the July 13, 2005 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and February 9, 2006 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 65208 and CA-G.R. SP No. 65425.<br><br>Due to the adverse effects of the Asian economic crisis on the construction industry beginning 1997, petitioner Jackbilt Industries, Inc. decided to temporarily stop its business of producing concrete hollow blocks, compelling most of its employees to go on leave for six months. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Respondent Jackbilt Employees Workers Union-NAFLU-KMU immediately protested the temporary shutdown. Because its collective bargaining agreement with petitioner was expiring during the period of the shutdown, respondent claimed that petitioner halted production to avoid its duty to bargain collectively. The shutdown was allegedly motivated by anti-union sentiments.<br><br>Accordingly, on March 9, 1998, respondent went on strike. Its officers and members picketed petitioner's main gates and deliberately prevented persons and vehicles from going into and out of the compound.<br><br>On March 19, 1998, petitioner filed a petition for injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) in the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). It sought to enjoin respondent from obstructing free entry to and exit from its production facility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 1998, the NLRC issued a TRO directing the respondents to refrain from preventing access to petitioner's property.<br><br>The reports of both the implementing officer and the investigating labor arbiter revealed, however, that respondent union violated the April 14, 1998 order. Union members, on various occasions, stopped and inspected private vehicles entering and exiting petitioner's production facility.&nbsp; Thus, in a decision dated July 17, 1998, the NLRC ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, petitioner sent individual memoranda to the officers and members of respondent who participated in the strike<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> ordering them to explain why they should not be dismissed for committing illegal acts in the course of a strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, respondent repeatedly ignored petitioner's memoranda despite the extensions granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thus, on May 30, 1998, petitioner dismissed the concerned officers and members and barred them from entering its premises effective June 1, 1998.<br><br>Aggrieved, respondent filed complaints for illegal lockout, runaway shop and damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal and attorney's fees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and refusal to bargain<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on behalf of its officers and members<i> </i>against petitioner and its corporate officers. It argued that there was no basis for the temporary partial shutdown as it was undertaken by petitioner to avoid its duty to bargain collectively.<br><br>Petitioner, on the other hand, asserted that because respondent conducted a strike without observing the procedural requirements provided in Article 263 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the March 9, 1998 strike was illegal.&nbsp; Furthermore, in view of the July 17, 1998 decision of the NLRC (which found that respondent obstructed the free ingress to and egress from petitioner's premises), petitioner validly dismissed respondent's officers and employees for committing illegal acts in the course of a strike.<br><br>In a decision dated October 15, 1999, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the labor arbiter dismissed the complaints for illegal lockout and unfair labor practice for lack of merit. However, because petitioner did not file a petition to declare the strike illegal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> before terminating respondent's officers and employees, it was found guilty of illegal dismissal. The dispositive portion of the decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>judgment is hereby rendered finding [petitioner and its corporate officers] liable for the illegal dismissal of the 61 union officer and members of [respondent] and concomitantly, [petitioner and its corporate officers] are hereby jointly and severally ordered to pay [respondents' officers and members] limited backwages from June 1, 1998 to October 4, 1998.<br><br>[Petitioner and its corporate officers] are further ordered to pay [respondents' officers and members] separation pay based on ½ salary for every year of credited service, a fraction of at least 6 months to be considered as one whole year in lieu of reinstatement.<br><br>The complaint for unfair labor practice, moral and exemplary damages and runaway shop are hereby disallowed for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>On December 28, 2000, the NLRC, on appeal, modified the decision of the labor arbiter. It held that only petitioner should be liable for monetary awards granted to respondent's officers and members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Both petitioner and respondent moved for reconsideration but they were denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner assailed the December 28, 2000 decision of the NLRC via a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in the CA. It asserted that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in disregarding its July 17, 1998 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> wherein respondent's officers and employees were found to have committed illegal acts in the course of the March 9, 1998 strike. In view thereof and pursuant to Article 264(a)(3)&nbsp; of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> petitioner validly terminated respondent's officers and employees.<br><br>The CA dismissed the petition but modified the December 28, 2000 decision of the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Because most of affected employees were union members, the CA held that the temporary shutdown was moved by anti-union sentiments. Petitioner was therefore guilty of unfair labor practice and, consequently, was ordered to pay respondent's officers and employees backwages from March 9, 1998 (instead of June 1, 1998) to October 4, 1998 and separation pay of one month salary for every year of credited service.<br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but it was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, this recourse.<br><br>The primordial issue in this petition is whether or not the filing of a petition with the labor arbiter to declare a strike illegal is a condition <i>sine qua non </i>for the valid termination of employees who commit an illegal act in the course of such strike.<br><br>Petitioner asserts that the filing of a petition to declare the strike illegal was unnecessary since the NLRC, in its July 17, 1998 decision, had already found that respondent committed illegal acts in the course of the strike.<br><br>We grant the petition.<br><br>The principle of conclusiveness of judgment, embodied in Section 47(c), Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; holds that the parties to a case are bound by the findings in a previous judgment with respect to matters actually raised and adjudged therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Article 264(e) of the Labor Code prohibits any person engaged in picketing from obstructing the free ingress to and egress from the employer's premises. Since respondent was found in the July 17, 1998 decision of the NLRC to have prevented the free entry into and exit of vehicles from petitioner's compound, respondent's officers and employees clearly committed illegal acts in the course of the March 9, 1998 strike.<br><br>The use of unlawful means in the course of a strike renders such strike illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Therefore, pursuant to the principle of conclusiveness of judgment, the March 9, 1998 strike was <i>ipso facto </i>illegal<i>. </i>The filing of a petition to declare the strike illegal was thus unnecessary.<br><br>Consequently, we uphold the legality of the dismissal of respondent's officers and employees. Article 264 of the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> further provides that an employer may terminate employees found to have committed illegal acts in the course of a strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Petitioner clearly had the legal right to terminate respondent's officers and employees<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby granted. The July 13, 2005 decision and February 9, 2006 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 65208 and CA-G.R.
