Trial on the merits followed.<br><br><i>During trial, the prosecution presented four witnesses: </i>Forensic Chemist Police Inspector (P/Insp.) Richard Allan Mangalip, whose testimony was the subject of stipulation during the initial trial of the case; Makati City Anti Drug Abuse Council (MADAC) operative Ruben Potencion, the designated poseur-buyer; MADAC operative Richard Prior, back-up operative; and Police Officer 3 (PO3) Jay Lagasca, the team leader.<br><br>The prosecution's version is as follows:<br><br>Sometime in September 2003, an informant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> reported to the MADAC office in <i>Barangay</i> San Isidro that accused-appellant Wilfredo Encila alias "Freddie" was rampantly selling illegal drugs.  On the basis of this information, a buy-bust operation against the latter was planned by the MADAC operatives, headed by PO3 Jay Lagasca.  The buy-bust operation was coordinated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). It was agreed upon by the team conducting the buy-bust operation that MADAC operative Ruben Potencion was to act as poseur-buyer.  He was provided with one piece of marked five hundred peso bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 18 September 2003, at about 3:30 in the afternoon, the buy-bust team, composed of ten people on board two vehicles, proceeded to E. Ramos Street, <i>Barangay</i> Pio del Pilar, Makati City.  After a fifteen-minute wait, appellant was spotted by the team standing near a <i>sari-sari</i> store along E. Ramos Street. The informant and MADAC operative Ruben Potencion approached appellant.  The informant introduced Ruben Potencion to appellant as a potential buyer of <i>shabu</i>.  Accused-appellant asked Ruben Potencion how much <i>shabu</i> was needed.  The latter replied that he needed P500.00 worth of <i>shabu</i>.  Appellant received the marked money from Ruben Potencion and took out one plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> from his left pocket.  Ruben Potencion examined the sachet and, upon being satisfied that the sachet contained <i>shabu</i>, gave the pre-arranged signal by throwing his lighted cigarette.<br><br>PO3 Jay Lagasca, with the assistance of back-up MADAC operative Richard Prior, rushed in and frisked appellant.  Upon orders to empty his pockets, accused-appellant was found in possession of one piece of P500.00 bill, which was the marked buy-bust money, and six plastic sachets with suspected <i>shabu</i>.  PO3 Lagasca placed appellant under arrest, informing him of the crime he committed and of his constitutional rights.  Accused-appellant was asked his full name, and he answered.  Ruben Potencion marked the plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> with the initials of accused-appellant, "WSE," for the illegal sale; and the other plastic sachets recovered from the latter after his arrest, "WSE-1 to "WSE-6."<br><br>Accused-appellant was brought to the Makati City Police Station, Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Force; then to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, to which all seven sachets were sent for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  The examination yielded the following results:<br><br>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>Seven (7) small heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet each containing white crystalline substance having the following markings and recorded net weights:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">A (WSE) = 0.22 gram<br><br>B (WSE-1) = 1.30 grams<br><br>C (WSE-2) = 0.53 gram<br><br>D (WSE-3) = 0.41 gram<br><br>E (WSE-4) = 0.01 gram<br><br>F (WSE-5) = 0.25 gram<br><br>G (WSE-6) = 0.13 gram<br></div><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above stated specimen gave POSITIVE result to the tests for the presence of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous [drug].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The contents of the seven plastic sachets were found positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), a dangerous drug, as evidenced by Physical Science Report No. D-1160-03S issued by Forensic Chemist Richard Allan B.

The defense presented him and his alleged daughter, and they gave their own version.</i><br><br>Accused-appellant testified that he was 43 years old and worked as a contractual painter, having finished Grade III only.<br><br>Wilfredo Encila<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and daughter Jocelyn Encila<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> testified that there was no buy-bust operation on 18 September 2003.  On direct examination, accused-appellant asserted that at around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of 18 September 2003, he was arrested by the MADAC Police operatives at the house of a certain Danny, located at E. Ramos St., <i>Barangay</i> Pio del Pilar in Makati City. He was at said place because he brought his TV set to Danny for repair.  The house of Danny was just a block away from his house. Danny, whose surname the accused-appellant did not know, was engaged in repairing of TV sets and other house appliances at his residence.  He was not aware of any violation he committed.<br><br>On cross examination, however, accused-appellant mentioned that he was with his daughter at the house of Danny when four armed men in civilian clothes barged into the house and introduced themselves as police officers.  He and Danny were frisked, but the police officers did not recover anything from the two of them. Despite their strong protests, accused-appellant and Danny were handcuffed.  They asked the policemen why they were being apprehended, but they were simply ignored and forced to board a vehicle. Jocelyn Encila ran away in fear and reported the incident to their relatives.  The two men were thereafter brought to the Makati City police station for further investigation, and Wilfredo Encila was turned over to the Crime Investigation Division.  Danny was later released. It was only during the inquest proceedings in court that accused-appellant learned of the charges filed against him. Danny was not charged.<br><br>Accused-appellant also testified that, of the three prosecution witnesses who testified in court, only PO3 Jay Lagasca was among the four men who held him in the house of Danny.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On 21 February 2006, after the prosecution and the defense rested their respective cases, Makati RTC Branch 64 convicted accused-appellant after determining that the prosecution had proven his guilt beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Cases No. 03-3693 for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> and No. 03-3694 for illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>.  In its joint Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the trial court disposed of the cases as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is rendered as    follows:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 03-3693, the accused WILFREDO ENCILA y SUNGA is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 5, Article II, Republic Act No. 9165 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of the (sic) life imprisonment and to pay the fine of P500,000.00; and<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 03-3694, the accused WILFREDO ENCILA y SUNGA is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 11, Art.

The Office of the Solicitor General filed the People's brief on 19 March 2006.<br><br>In a Decision dated 11 October 2007, the Court of Appeals affirmed the challenged RTC decision, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Appeal is hereby DENIED and the questioned Decision dated February 21, 2006 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 64, Makati City in Criminal Case Nos. 03-3693 &amp; 03-3694 is AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant then filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals on 30 October 2007 to appeal its decision before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  In the meantime, accused-appellant remained committed at the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Presented before this Court, <i>via </i>Notice of Appeal, is accused-appellant's lone assignment of error:<br><blockquote>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br></blockquote>The core issue for resolution is whether or not error attended the trial court's findings, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>In praying for his acquittal, accused-appellant denies the charges and claims that the prosecution's evidence failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  According to the defense, the trial court relied heavily on the deficiency or weakness of the defense evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> instead of looking at the weight of the evidence presented by the prosecution.  The defense argued that the trial court erred in finding fault in every minor and inconsequential discrepancy in the testimony of the defense witnesses -- such as discrepancies in Jocelyn Encila's age, the residence of accused-appellant, the number of policemen who apprehended the accused-appellant, the tools and fixtures found at the shop of Danny -- instead of focusing on the prosecution's evidence, which failed to discharge its burden of proving accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The trial court belabored these non-issues, instead of ascertaining whether the accused was arrested in a legitimate entrapment operation, or <i>in flagrante delicto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

that while the witness may have expertly recognized the <i>shabu</i> just by looking at it, however, what is also apparent is his confusion as to whether the six sachets of <i>shabu</i> were found in the possession of the accused, further stating that accused-appellant was not even called upon to offer evidence on his behalf.<br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), argues otherwise, maintaining that the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>We sustain accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br>The presumption of innocence accorded the accused was overturned by the evidence presented by the prosecution.<br><br>First of all, we reiterate the fundamental rule that findings of the trial courts, which are factual in nature and which involve the credibility of witnesses, are accorded respect when no glaring errors, gross misapprehension of facts or speculative, arbitrary and unsupported conclusions can be gathered from such findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  This rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals as in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Prosecutions involving illegal drugs largely depend on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  In the process of converting into written form the statements of living human beings, not only fine nuances but a world of meaning apparent to the judge present, watching and listening, may escape the reader of the translated words. Considering that this Court has access only to the cold and impersonal records of the proceedings, it generally relies upon the assessment of the trial court, which had the distinct advantage of observing the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  Hence, factual findings of the trial courts are accorded respect, absent any showing that certain facts of weight and substance bearing on the elements of the crime have been overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied.  We have no reason to deviate from this rule.<br><br>Considering, however, that what is at stake is no less than the liberty of accused-appellant, this Court conducted a painstaking review of the entire records of the case.  Contrary to accused-appellant's allegation, we find that the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>When what is involved is a prosecution for illegal sale of regulated or prohibited drugs, conviction can be had if the following elements are present:  (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.  What is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti </i>of the crime.  The delivery of the contraband to the poseur-buyer and the receipt of the marked money consummate the buy-bust transaction between the entrapment officers and the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  The crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs is committed as soon as the sale transaction is consummated.<br><br>All of the foregoing elements were present in Criminal Case No. 03-3693.<br><br>The prosecution clearly showed that the sale of <i>shabu </i>actually took place.  Accused-appellant was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, selling <i>shabu</i> through a buy-bust operation, which is a form of entrapment employed by peace officers as an effective way of apprehending a criminal in the act of the commission of an offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>MADAC operative and "poseur-buyer" Ruben Potencion categorically identified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> accused-appellant Wilfredo Encila y Sunga alias "Freddie" as the "seller" who sold to him one plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and who received the P500.00 marked bill as payment for it on 18 September 2004 along E.

</tbody></table></blockquote>Accused-appellant raised as his defense the seemingly confusing statements made by MADAC operative Richard Prior in open court as to the retrieval of the six additional plastic sachets of <i>shabu</i> found in his possession. The alleged confusion and incredibility are more imaginary than real.  Taken as a whole, the testimony of MADAC operative Richard Prior clearly showed that when accused-appellant was searched and directed to empty his pockets, they found six more plastic sachets of <i>shabu</i> in his possession.<br><br>On another point, the rigid testimonies of the witnesses for the defense leave this Court with no other alternative but to discredit the evidence for being incredible. Accused-appellant's defense was anchored on his assertions of denial and alibi.  The defense claims that at the time the alleged buy-bust operation took place, accused-appellant was with his 17-year-old daughter Jocelyn at the repair shop of a certain Danny.  This defense seemed more like an afterthought considering that, on his direct examination, this corroborating detail that his daughter was with him at that time was not even mentioned by accused-appellant. It was only on cross-examination that this detail was revealed.  He also testified that four armed men entered the house of Danny.  Jocelyn, on the other hand, said there were three armed persons.  Accused-appellant and Jocelyn could not give the surname of Danny despite the fact that the accused had known him for more than a year.  The defense also provided no explanation as to why this certain Danny was not presented as defense witness, considering what would have been the weight of his corroborating testimony.<br><br>Accused-appellant's defense of denial and alibi deserves scant consideration when presented <i>vis-a-vis</i> the positive identification by poseur-buyer Ruben Potencion and back-up Richard Prior, who enjoy in their favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.  The defense of denial, like alibi, are viewed by the Court with disfavor, for it can just as easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act. Bare denials cannot prevail over the direct and positive testimony of the witness pointing to accused as the perpetrator of the offense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and cannot overcome the presumption that the police officers performed their duties regularly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Much weight is to be given to the testimony of the police operatives, who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner.  Accused-appellant has not imputed any improper motive on the part of the arresting officers nor filed a case against them in court.  He also admitted that he had never met or encountered any of the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation prior to his arrest.  He had no prior altercation or misunderstanding with the arresting officers as to doubt the reasons for his arrest.<br><br>The defense did not adduce any evidence that could have shown that the policemen deviated from the regular performance of their duty and that could have overcome this presumption.  Neither did the defense interpose any evidence to show that said police officers were not performing their duty properly when the buy-bust operation was conducted. When the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation have no motive to falsely testify against the accused, the courts shall uphold the presumption that they have performed their duties regularly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  <i>And unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary suggesting ill motive on the part of the police officers or deviation from the regular performance of their duties, their testimonies with respect to the operation deserve full faith and credit.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></b></i> The presumption in favor of the prosecution witnesses, who are all police officers, taken together with the overwhelming evidence presented by the prosecution against the accused, should therefore stand.<br><br>Drug-pushing, as a crime, has been condemned as "an especially vicious crime,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which is "one of the most pernicious evils that has ever crept into our society."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  We find that:<br><br>Indeed nothing is more depraved than for anyone to be a merchant of death by selling prohibited drugs, an act which, as this Court said in one case, "often breeds other crimes. It is not what we might call a `contained' crime whose consequences are limited to that crime alone, like swindling and bigamy. Court and police records show that a significant number of murders, rapes, and similar offenses have been committed by persons under the influence of dangerous drugs, or while they are `high.' While spreading such drugs, the drug-pusher is also abetting, through his greed and irresponsibility, the commission of other crimes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>With respect to the penalties imposed in Criminal Case No. 03-3693 for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, was correct in imposing the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.  Under Republic Act No. 9165, the <i>unauthorized sale of shabu</i> carries with it the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00).  Pursuant to the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled, "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines," only life imprisonment and fine, instead of death, shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any or all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<br><br>On the penalty imposed in Criminal Case no. 03-3694 for violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, the penalty of imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years and a fine ranging from P300,000.00 to P400,000.00 are to be imposed, if the quantities of dangerous drugs are less than five (5) grams of <i>shabu</i>.  Following the provisions of Republic Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the "Indeterminate Sentence Law," the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and one (1) day as maximum and a fine of P300,000.00 imposed by the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Court of Appeals Decision dated 11 October 2007 in CA-G.R.
