				<BR><BR><div align="justify">We review in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the decision dated March 7, 2008 of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in C.A-G.R. <i>AMPARO</i> No. 00009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  This CA decision confirmed the enforced disappearance of Engineer Morced N. Tagitis (<i>Tagitis</i>) and granted the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> at the petition of his wife, Mary Jean B. Tagitis (<i>respondent</i>).  The dispositive portion of the CA decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.  The Court hereby <b>FINDS</b> that this is an <b>"enforced disappearance"</b> within the meaning of the United Nations instruments, as used in the Amparo Rules.  The <b><u>privileges</u></b> of the writ of <i>amparo</i> are hereby extended to Engr. Morced Tagitis.<br><br>Consequently: (1) respondent <b>GEN. EDGARDO M. DOROMAL</b>, Chief, Criminal Investigation and Detention Group (CIDG) who should order <b>COL. JOSE VOLPANE PANTE</b>, CIDG-9 Chief, Zamboanga City, to aid him; (2) respondent <b>GEN. AVELINO I. RAZON</b>, Chief, PNP, who should order his men, namely: (a) respondent <b>GEN. JOEL GOLTIAO</b>, Regional Director of ARMM PNP, (b) <b>COL. AHIRON AJIRIM</b>, both head of TASK FORCE TAGITIS, and (c) respondent <b>SR. SUPERINTENDENT LEONARDO A. ESPINA</b>, Chief, Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response, to aid him as their superior- are hereby <b>DIRECTED</b> to exert <b><u>extraordinary diligence and efforts</u></b>, not only to protect the life, liberty and security of Engr. Morced Tagitis, but also to extend the <b><u>privileges</u></b> of the writ of <i>amparo t</i>o Engr. Morced Tagitis and his family, and to submit a monthly report of their actions to this Court, as a way of <b>PERIODIC REVIEW</b> to enable this Court to monitor the action of respondents.<br><br>This <i>amparo</i> case is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> as to respondent <b>LT. GEN. ALEXANDER YANO</b>, Commanding General, Philippine Army, and as to respondent <b>GEN. RUBEN RAFAEL</b>, Chief Anti-Terror Task Force Comet, Zamboanga City, both being with the military, which is a separate and distinct organization from the police and the CIDG, in terms of operations, chain of command and budget.</blockquote><br>This Decision reflects the nature of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> - a protective remedy against violations or threats of violation against the rights to life, liberty and security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  <i>It embodies, as a remedy, the court's directive to police agencies to undertake specified courses of action to address the disappearance of an individual, in this case, Engr. Morced N.  Tagitis.</i> It does not determine guilt nor pinpoint criminal culpability for the disappearance; rather, it determines <b><i>responsibility</i></b><i>,</i> or at least <b><i>accountability</i></b>, for the enforced disappearance for purposes of imposing the appropriate remedies to address the disappearance.  <b>Responsibility </b>refers to the extent the actors have been established by substantial evidence to have participated in whatever way, by action or omission, in an enforced disappearance, as a measure of the remedies this Court shall craft, among them, the directive to file the appropriate criminal and civil cases against the responsible parties in the proper courts.  <b>Accountability</b>, on the other hand, refers to the measure of remedies that should be addressed to those who exhibited involvement in the enforced disappearance without bringing the level of their complicity to the level of responsibility defined above; or who are imputed with knowledge relating to the enforced disappearance and who carry the burden of disclosure; or those who carry, but have failed to discharge, the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance.  In all these cases, the issuance of the Writ of <i>Amparo </i>is justified by our primary goal of addressing the disappearance, so that the life of the victim is preserved and his liberty and security are restored.<br><br>We highlight this nature of a Writ of <i>Amparo</i> case at the outset to stress that the unique situations that call for the issuance of the writ, as well as the considerations and measures necessary to address these situations, may not at all be the same as the standard measures and procedures in ordinary court actions and proceedings.  In this sense, the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<i>Amparo Rule</i>) issued by this Court is unique.  The <i>Amparo</i> Rule should be read, too, as a work in progress, as its directions and finer points remain to evolve through time and jurisprudence and through the substantive laws that Congress may promulgate.<br><br><b><u><center>THE FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS<br></center></u></b><br>The background facts, based on the petition and the records of the case, are summarized below.<br><br>The established facts show that Tagitis, a consultant for the World Bank and the Senior Honorary Counselor for the Islamic Development Bank (<i>IDB</i>) Scholarship Programme, was last seen in Jolo, Sulu.  Together with Arsimin Kunnong (<i>Kunnong</i>), an IDB scholar, Tagitis arrived in Jolo by boat in the early morning of October 31, 2007 from a seminar in Zamboanga City. They immediately checked-in at ASY Pension House.  Tagitis asked Kunnong to buy him a boat ticket for his return trip the following day to Zamboanga.  When Kunnong returned from this errand, Tagitis was no longer around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The receptionist related that Tagitis went out to buy food at around 12:30 in the afternoon and even left his room key with the desk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Kunnong looked for Tagitis and even sent a text message to the latter's Manila-based secretary who did not know of Tagitis' whereabouts and activities either; she advised Kunnong to simply wait.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On November 4, 2007, Kunnong and Muhammad Abdulnazeir N.  Matli, a UP professor of Muslim studies and Tagitis' fellow student counselor at the IDB, reported Tagitis' disappearance to the Jolo Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  On November 7, 2007, Kunnong executed a sworn affidavit attesting to what he knew of the circumstances surrounding Tagitis' disappearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>More than a month later (on December 28, 2007), the respondent filed a Petition for the Writ of <i>Amparo</i> (<i>petition</i>) with the CA through her Attorney-in-Fact, Atty. Felipe P. Arcilla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The petition was directed against Lt. Gen. Alexander Yano, Commanding General, Philippine Army; Gen. Avelino I. Razon, Chief, Philippine National Police (<i>PNP</i>); Gen. Edgardo M. Doromal, Chief, Criminal Investigation and Detention Group (<i>CIDG</i>); Sr. Supt. Leonardo A. Espina, Chief, Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response; Gen. Joel Goltiao, Regional Director, ARMM-PNP; and Gen. Ruben Rafael, Chief, Anti-Terror Task Force Comet [collectively referred to as <i>petitioners</i>]. After reciting Tagitis' personal circumstances and the facts outlined above, the petition went on to state:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>7.   Soon after the student left the room, Engr. Tagitis went out of the pension house to take his early lunch but while out on the street, <b>a couple of burly men believed to be police intelligence operatives, forcibly took him and boarded the latter on a motor vehicle then sped away</b> without the knowledge of his student, Arsimin Kunnong;<br><br>8.   As instructed, in the late afternoon of the same day, Kunnong returned to the pension house, and was surprised to find out that subject Engr. Tagitis cannot [<i>sic</i>] be contacted by phone and was not also around and his room was closed and locked;<br><br>9.   Kunnong requested for the key from the desk of the pension house who [<i>sic</i>] assisted him to open the room of Engr. Tagitis, where they discovered that the personal belongings of Engr. Tagitis, including cell phones, documents and other personal belongings were all intact inside the room;<br><br>10.   When Kunnong could not locate Engr. Tagitis, the former sought the help of another IDB scholar and reported the matter to the local police agency;<br><br>11.   Arsimin Kunnong including his friends and companions in Jolo, exerted efforts in trying to locate the whereabouts of Engr. Tagitis and when he reported the matter to the police authorities in Jolo, he was immediately given a ready answer that Engr. Tagitis could have been abducted by the Abu Sayyaf group and other groups known to be fighting against the government;<br><br>12.   Being scared with [sic] these suggestions and insinuations of the police officers, Kunnong reported the matter to the [respondent, wife of Engr. Tagitis] by phone and other responsible officers and coordinators of the IDB Scholarship Programme in the Philippines, who alerted the office of the Governor of ARMM who was then preparing to attend the OIC meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia;<br><br>13.   [Respondent], on the other hand, approached some of her co-employees with the Land Bank in Digos branch, Digos City, Davao del Sur who likewise sought help from some of their friends in the military who could help them find/locate the whereabouts of her husband;<br><br>14.   All of these efforts of the [respondent] did not produce any positive results except the information from persons in the military who do not want to be identified that Engr. Tagitis is in the hands of the uniformed men;<br><br>15. According to reliable information received by the [respondent], <b>subject Engr. Tagitis is in the custody of police intelligence operatives, specifically with the CIDG, PNP Zamboanga City,</b> <b>being held against his will in an earnest attempt of the police to involve and connect Engr. Tagitis with the different terrorist groups</b>;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>17.   [Respondent] filed her complaint with the PNP Police Station in the ARMM in Cotobato and in Jolo, as suggested by her friends, seeking their help to find her husband, but [respondent's] request and pleadings failed to produce any positive results;<br><br>18.   Instead of helping the [respondent], she [<i>sic</i>] was told of an intriguing tale by the police that her husband, subject of the petition, was not missing but was with another woman having good time somewhere, which is a clear indication of the [petitioners'] refusal to help and provide police assistance in locating her missing husband;<br><br>19.   The continued failure and refusal of the [petitioners] to release and/or turn-over subject Engr. Tagitis to his family or even to provide truthful information to [the respondent]  of the subject's whereabouts, and/or allow [the respondent] to visit her husband Engr. Morced Tagitis, caused so much sleepless nights and serious anxieties;<br><br>20.   Lately, [the respondent] was again advised by one of the [petitioners] to go to the ARMM Police Headquarters again in Cotobato City and also to the different Police Headquarters including [those] in Davao City, in Zamboanga City, in Jolo, and in Camp Crame, Quezon City, and all these places have been visited by the [respondent] in search for her husband, which entailed expenses for her trips to these places thereby resorting her to borrowings and beggings [<i>sic</i>] for financial help from friends and relatives only to try complying [<i>sic</i>] to the different suggestions of these police officers, despite of which, her efforts produced no positive results up to the present time;<br><br>21.   In fact at times, some police officers, who [sympathized with]  the sufferings undergone by the [respondent],  informed her that they are not the proper persons that she should approach, but assured her not to worry because her husband is [<i>sic</i>]<i> </i>in good hands;<br><br>22.   The unexplained uncooperative behavior of the [petitioners] to the [respondent's] request for help and failure and refusal of the [petitioners] to extend the needed help, support and assistance in locating the whereabouts of Engr. Tagitis who had been declared missing since October 30, 2007 which is almost two (2) months now, clearly indicates that the [petitioners] are actually in physical possession and custody of [respondent's] husband, Engr. Tagitis;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>25.   [The respondent] has exhausted all administrative avenues and remedies but to no avail, and under the circumstances, [the respondent] has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy to protect and get the release of subject Engr. Morced Tagitis from the illegal clutches of the [petitioners], their intelligence operatives and the like which are in total violation of the subject's human and constitutional rights, except the issuance of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WRIT OF </span><i><u>AMPARO</u></i>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>On the same day the petition was filed, the CA immediately issued the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, set the case for hearing on January 7, 2008, and directed the petitioners to file their verified return within seventy-two (72) hours from service of the writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In their verified Return filed during the hearing of January 27, 2008, the petitioners denied any involvement in or knowledge of Tagitis' alleged abduction. They argued that the allegations of the petition were incomplete and did not constitute a cause of action against them; were baseless, or at best speculative; and were merely based on hearsay evidence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The affidavit of  PNP Chief Gen. Avelino I. Razon, attached to the Return, stated that: he did not have any personal knowledge of, or any participation in, the alleged disappearance; that he had been designated by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as the head of a special body called TASK FORCE USIG, to address concerns about extralegal killings and enforced disappearances; the Task Force, <i>inter alia</i>, coordinated with the investigators and local police, held case conferences, rendered legal advice in connection to these cases; and gave the following summary:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>4. a) On November 5, 2007, the Regional Director, Police Regional Office ARMM submitted a report on the alleged disappearance of one Engr. Morced Tagitis.  According to the said report, the victim checked-in at ASY Pension House on October 30, 2007 at about 6:00 in the morning and then roamed around Jolo, Sulu with an unidentified companion.  It was only after a few days when the said victim did not return that the matter was reported to Jolo MPS.  Afterwards, elements of Sulu PPO conducted a thorough investigation to trace and locate the whereabouts of the said missing person, but to no avail.  The said PPO is still conducting investigation that will lead to the immediate findings of the whereabouts of the person.<br><br>b) Likewise, the Regional Chief, 9RCIDU submitted a Progress Report to the Director, CIDG.  The said report stated among others that: subject person attended an Education Development Seminar set on October 28, 2007 conducted at Ateneo de Zamboanga, Zamboanga City together with a Prof. Matli.  On October 30, 2007, at around 5:00 o'clock in the morning, Engr. Tagitis reportedly arrived at Jolo Sulu wharf aboard M/V <i>Bounty Cruise</i>, he was then billeted at ASY Pension House. At about 6:15 o'clock in the morning of the same date, he instructed his student to purchase a fast craft ticket bound for Zamboanga City and will depart from Jolo, Sulu on October 31, 2007. That on or about 10:00 o'clock in the morning, Engr. Tagitis left the premises of ASY Pension House as stated by the cashier of the said pension house.  Later in the afternoon, the student instructed to purchase the ticket arrived at the pension house and waited for Engr. Tagitis, but the latter did not return.  On its part, the elements of 9RCIDU is now conducting a continuous case build up and information gathering to locate the whereabouts of Engr. Tagitis.<br><br>c) That the Director, CIDG directed the conduct of the search in all divisions of the CIDG to find Engr. Tagitis who was allegedly abducted or illegally detained by covert CIDG-PNP Intelligence Operatives since October 30, 2007, but after diligent and thorough search, records show that no such person is being detained in CIDG or any of its department or divisions.<br><br>5.   On this particular case, the Philippine National Police exhausted all possible efforts, steps and actions available under the circumstances and continuously search and investigate [<i>sic</i>] the instant case.  This immense mandate, however, necessitates the indispensable role of the citizenry, as the PNP cannot stand alone without the cooperation of the victims and witnesses to identify the perpetrators to bring them before the bar of justice and secure their conviction in court.<br></blockquote><br>The petitioner PNP-CIDG Chief, Gen. Edgardo M. Doromal, submitted as well his affidavit, also attached to the Return of the Writ, attesting that upon receipt of the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, he caused the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>That immediately upon receipt on December 29, 2007 of the Resolution of the Honorable Special Fourth Division of the Court of Appeals, I immediately directed the Investigation Division of this Group [CIDG] to conduct urgent investigation on the alleged enforced disappearance of Engineer Morced Tagitis.<br><br>That based on record, Engr. Morced N. Tagitis attended an Education Development Seminar on October 28, 2007 at Ateneo de Zamboanga at Zamboanga City together with Prof. Abdulnasser Matli. On October 30, 2007, at around six o'clock in the morning he arrived at Jolo, Sulu.  He was assisted by his student identified as Arsimin Kunnong of the Islamic Development Bank who was also one of the participants of the said seminar.  He checked in at ASY pension house located [<i>sic</i>] Kakuyagan, Patikul, Sulu on October 30, 2007 with [<i>sic</i>] unidentified companion.  At around six o'clock in the morning of even date, Engr. Tagitis instructed his student to purchase a fast craft ticket for Zamboanga City.  In the afternoon of the same date, Kunnong arrived at the pension house carrying the ticket he purchased for Engr. Tagitis, but the latter was nowhere to be found anymore.  Kunnong immediately informed Prof. Abdulnasser Matli who reported the incident to the police.  The CIDG is not involved in the disappearance of Engr. Morced Tagitis to make out a case of an enforced disappearance which presupposes a direct or indirect involvement of the government.<br><br>That herein [petitioner] searched all divisions and departments for a person named Engr. Morced N. Tagitis, who was allegedly abducted or illegally detained by covert CIDG-PNP Intelligence Operatives since October 30, 2007 and after a diligent and thorough research records show that no such person is being detained in CIDG or any of its department or divisions.<br><br>That nevertheless, in order to determine the circumstances surrounding Engr. Morced Tagitis [<i>sic</i>] alleged enforced disappearance, the undersigned had undertaken immediate investigation and will pursue investigations up to its full completion in order to aid in the prosecution of the person or persons responsible therefore.<br></blockquote><br>Likewise attached to the Return of the Writ was PNP-PACER<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Chief PS Supt. Leonardo A. Espina's affidavit which alleged that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>That, I and our men and women in PACER vehemently deny any participation in the alleged abduction or illegally [<i>sic</i>] detention of ENGR. MORCED N. TAGITS on October 30, 2007.  As a matter of fact, nowhere in the writ was mentioned that the <b><i>alleged</i></b> abduction was perpetrated by elements of PACER nor was there any indication that the alleged abduction or illegal detention of ENGR. TAGITIS was undertaken jointly by our men and by the <b><i>alleged</i></b> covert CIDG-PNP intelligence operatives <b><i>alleged </i></b>to have abducted or illegally detained ENGR. TAGITIS.<br><br>That I was shocked when I learned that I was implicated in the alleged disappearance of ENGR. MORCED in my capacity as the chief PACER [<i>sic</i>] considering that our office, the Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response (PACER), a special task force created for the purpose of neutralizing or eradicating kidnap-for-ransom groups which until now continue to be one of the menace of our society is a respondent in kidnapping or illegal detention case. Simply put, our task is to go after kidnappers and charge them in court and to abduct or illegally detain or kidnap anyone is anathema to our mission.<br><br>That right after I learned of the receipt of the WRIT OF AMPARO, I directed the Chief of PACER Mindanao Oriental (PACER-MOR) to conduct pro-active measures to investigate, locate/search the subject, identify and apprehend the persons responsible, to recover and preserve evidence related to the disappearance of ENGR. MORCED TAGITIS, which may aid in the prosecution of the person or persons responsible, to identify witnesses and obtain statements from them concerning the disappearance and to determine the cause, manner, location and time of disappearance as well as any pattern or practice that may have brought about the disappearance.<br><br>That I further directed the chief of PACER-MOR, Police Superintendent JOSE ARNALDO BRIONES JR., to submit  a written report regarding the disappearance of ENGR. MORCED.<br><br>That in compliance with my directive, the chief of PACER-MOR sent through fax his written report.<br><br>That the investigation and measures being undertaken to locate/search the subject in coordination with Police Regional Office, Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (PRO-ARMM) and Jolo Police Provincial Office (PPO) and other AFP and PNP units/agencies in the area are ongoing with the instruction not to leave any stone unturned so to speak in the investigation until the perpetrators in the instant case are brought to the bar of justice.<br><br>That I have exercised EXTRAORDINARY DILIGENCE in dealing with the WRIT OF AMPARO just issued.<br></blockquote><br>Finally, the PNP PRO ARMM Regional Director PC Supt. Joel R. Goltiao (<i>Gen. Goltiao</i>), also submitted his affidavit detailing the actions that he had taken upon receipt of the report on Tagitis' disappearance, <i>viz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>3) For the record:<br><br>1. I am the Regional Director of Police Regional Office ARMM now and during  the time of the incident;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>4.    It is my duty to look into and take appropriate measures on any cases of reported enforced disappearances and when they are being alluded to my office;<br><br>5.   On November 5, 2007, the Provincial Director of Sulu Police Provincial Office reported to me through Radio Message Cite No. SPNP3-1105-07-2007 that on November 4, 2007 at around 3:30 p.m., a certain Abdulnasser Matli, an employee of Islamic Development Bank, appeared before the Office of the Chief of Police, Jolo Police Station, and reported the disappearance of Engr. Morced Tagitis, scholarship coordinator of Islamic Development Bank, Manila;<br><br>6.   There was no report that Engr. Tagibis was last seen in the company of or taken by any member of the Philippine National Police but rather he just disappeared from ASY Pension House situated at Kakuyagan Village, Village, Patikul, Sulu, on October 30, 2007, without any trace of forcible abduction or arrest;<br><br>7. The last known instance of communication with him was when Arsimin Kunnong, a student scholar, was requested by him to purchase a vessel ticket at the Office of Weezam Express, however, when the student returned back to ASY Pension House, he no longer found Engr. Tagitis there and when he immediately inquired at the information counter regarding his whereabouts [<i>sic</i>], the person in charge in the counter informed him that Engr. Tagitis had left the premises on October 30, 2007 around 1 o'clock p.m. and never returned back to his room;<br><br>8.   Immediately after learning the incident, I called and directed the Provincial Director of Sulu Police Provincial Office and other units through phone call and text messages to conduct investigation [<i>sic</i>] to determine the whereabouts of the aggrieved party and the person or persons responsible for the threat, act or omission, to recover and preserve evidence related to the disappearance of Engr. Tagitis, to identify witnesses and obtain statements from them concerning his disappearance, to determine the cause and manner of his disappearance, to identify and apprehend the person or persons involved in the disappearance so that they shall be brought before a competent court;<br><br>9. Thereafter, through my Chief of the Regional Investigation and Detection Management Division, I have caused the following directives:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Radio Message Cite No. RIDMD-1122-07-358 dated November 22, 2007 directing PD Sulu PPO to conduct joint investigation with CIDG and CIDU ARMM on the matter;<br><br>b) Radio Message Cite No. RIDMD-1128-07-361 dated November 28, 2007 directing PD Sulu PPO to expedite compliance to my previous directive;<br><br>c) Memorandum dated December 14, 2007 addressed to PD Sulu PPO reiterating our series of directives for investigation and directing him to undertake exhaustive coordination efforts with the owner of ASY Pension House and student scholars of IDB in order to secure corroborative statements regarding the disappearance and whereabouts of said personality;<br><br>d) Memorandum dated December 24, 2007 addressed to PD Sulu PPO directing him to maximize efforts to establish clues on the whereabouts of Engr.

This incident was properly reported to the PNP Higher Headquarters as shown in the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Memorandum dated November 6, 2007 addressed to the Chief, PNP informing him of the facts of the disappearance and the action being taken by our office;<br><br>b) Memorandum dated November 6, 2007 addressed to the Director, Directorate for Investigation and Detection Management, NHQ PNP;<br><br>c) Memorandum dated December 30, 2007 addressed to the Director, DIDM;<br></div><br>4)   In spite of our exhaustive efforts, the whereabouts of Engr. Tagitis cannot be determined but our office is continuously intensifying the conduct of information gathering, monitoring and coordination for the immediate solution of the case.</blockquote><br>Since the disappearance of Tagistis was practically admitted and taking note of favorable actions so far taken on the disappearance, the CA directed Gen.

Since this Court was made to understand that it was P/Supt KASIM who was the petitioner's unofficial source of the military intelligence information that Engr. Morced Tagitis was abducted by bad elements of the CIDG (par. 15 of the Petition), the close contact between P/Supt KASIM and Col.

The conclusion that the CIDG was involved was based on the respondent's testimony, corroborated by her companion, Mrs. Talbin. The CA noted that the information that the CIDG, as the police intelligence arm, was involved in Tagitis' abduction came from no less than the military - an independent agency of government.  The CA thus greatly relied on the "raw report" from Col. Kasim's asset, pointing to the CIDG's involvement in Tagitis' abduction.  The CA held that "raw reports" from an "asset" carried "great weight" in the intelligence world.  It also labeled as "suspect" Col. Kasim's subsequent and belated retraction of his statement that the military, the police, or the CIDG was involved in the abduction of Tagitis.<br><br>The CA characterized as "too farfetched and unbelievable" and "a bedlam of speculation" police theories painting the disappearance as "intentional" on the part of Tagitis.  He had no previous brushes with the law or any record of overstepping the bounds of any trust regarding money entrusted to him; no student of the IDB scholarship program ever came forward to complain that he or she did not get his or her stipend.  The CA also found no basis for the police theory that Tagitis was "trying to escape from the clutches of his second wife," on the basis of the respondent's testimony that Tagitis was a Muslim who could have many wives under the Muslim faith, and that there was "no issue" at all when the latter divorced his first wife in order to marry the second. Finally, the CA also ruled out kidnapping for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf or by the ARMM paramilitary as the cause for Tagitis' disappearance, since the respondent, the police and the military noted that there was no acknowledgement of Tagitis' abduction or demand for payment of ransom - the usual <i>modus operandi</i> of these terrorist groups.<br><br>Based on these considerations, the CA thus extended the privilege of the writ to Tagitis and his family, and directed the CIDG Chief, Col. Jose Volpane Pante, PNP Chief Avelino I. Razon, Task Force Tagitis heads Gen. Joel Goltiao and Col. Ahiron Ajirim, and PACER Chief Sr. Supt. Leonardo A. Espina to exert extraordinary diligence and efforts to protect the life, liberty and security of Tagitis, with the obligation to provide monthly reports of their actions to the CA.  At the same time, the CA dismissed the petition against the then respondents from the military, Lt. Gen Alexander Yano and Gen.

The petition should likewise be read in its totality, rather than in terms of its isolated component parts, to determine if the required elements - namely, of the disappearance, the State or private action, and the actual or threatened violations of the rights to life, liberty or security - are present.<br><br>In the present case, the petition amply recites in its paragraphs 4 to 11 the circumstances under which Tagitis suddenly dropped out of sight after engaging in normal activities, and thereafter was nowhere to be found despite efforts to locate him.

It also clearly alleged how Tagitis' rights to life, liberty and security were violated when he was "forcibly taken and boarded on a motor vehicle by a couple of burly men believed to be police intelligence operatives," and then taken "into custody by the respondents' police intelligence operatives since October 30, 2007, specifically by the CIDG, PNP Zamboanga City, x x x held against his will in an earnest attempt of the police to involve and connect [him] with different terrorist groups."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>These allegations, in our view, properly pleaded ultimate facts within the pleader's knowledge about Tagitis' disappearance, the participation by agents of the State in this disappearance, the failure of the State to release Tagitis or to provide sufficient information about his whereabouts, as well as the actual violation of his right to liberty.  Thus, the petition cannot be faulted for any failure in its statement of a cause of action.<br><br>If a defect can at all be attributed to the petition, this defect is its lack of supporting affidavit, as required by Section 5(c) of the <i>Amparo</i> Rule.  Owing to the summary nature of the proceedings for the writ and to facilitate the resolution of the petition, the <i>Amparo </i>Rule incorporated the requirement for supporting affidavits, with the annotation that these can be used as the affiant's direct testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>  This requirement, however, should not be read as an absolute one that necessarily leads to the dismissal of the petition if not strictly followed.  Where, as in this case, the petitioner has substantially complied with the requirement by submitting a <i>verified</i> petition sufficiently detailing the facts relied upon, the strict need for the sworn statement that an affidavit represents is essentially fulfilled.  We note that the failure to attach the required affidavits was fully cured when the respondent and her witness (Mrs. Talbin) personally testified in the CA hearings held on January 7 and 17 and February 18, 2008 to swear to and flesh out the allegations of the petition.  Thus, even on this point, the petition cannot be faulted.<br><br>Section 5(d) of the <i>Amparo </i>Rule requires that prior investigation of an alleged disappearance must have been made, specifying the manner and results of the investigation.  Effectively, this requirement seeks to establish at the earliest opportunity the level of diligence the public authorities undertook in relation with the reported disappearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>We reject the petitioners' argument that the respondent's petition did not comply with the Section 5(d) requirements of the <i>Amparo</i> Rule, as the petition specifies in its paragraph 11 that Kunnong and his companions immediately reported Tagitis' disappearance to the police authorities in Jolo, Sulu <i>as soon as they were relatively certain that he indeed had disappeared</i>. The police, however, gave them the "ready answer" that Tagitis could have been abducted by the Abu Sayyaf group or other anti-government groups.  The respondent also alleged in paragraphs 17 and 18 of her petition that she filed a "complaint" with the PNP Police Station in Cotobato and in Jolo, but she was told of "an intriguing tale" by the police that her husband was having "a good time with another woman." The disappearance was alleged to have been reported, too, to no less than the Governor of the ARMM, followed by the respondent's personal inquiries that yielded the factual bases for her petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>These allegations, to our mind, sufficiently specify that reports have been made to the police authorities, and that <i>investigations should have followed</i>.  That the petition did not state the manner and results of the investigation that the <i>Amparo</i> Rule requires, but rather generally stated the inaction of the police, their failure to perform their duty to investigate, or at the very least, their reported failed efforts, should not be a reflection on the completeness of the petition. To require the respondent to elaborately specify the names, personal circumstances, and addresses of the investigating authority, as well the manner and conduct of the investigation is an overly strict interpretation of Section 5(d), given the respondent's frustrations in securing an investigation with meaningful results. Under these circumstances, we are more than satisfied that the allegations of the petition on the investigations undertaken are sufficiently complete for purposes of bringing the petition forward.<br><br>Section 5(e) is in the <i>Amparo </i>Rule to prevent the use of a petition - that otherwise is not supported by sufficient allegations to constitute a proper cause of action - as a means to "fish" for evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The petitioners contend that the respondent's petition did not specify what "legally available efforts were taken by the respondent," and that there was an "undue haste" in the filing of the petition when, instead of cooperating with authorities, the respondent immediately invoked the Court's intervention.<br><br>We do not see the respondent's petition as the petitioners view it.<br><br>Section 5(e) merely requires that the <i>Amparo</i> petitioner (the respondent in the present case) allege "the actions and recourses taken to determine the fate or whereabouts of the aggrieved party and the identity of the person responsible for the threat, act or omission." The following allegations of the respondent's petition duly outlined the actions she had taken and the frustrations she encountered, thus compelling her to file her petition.<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>7.

For a deeper appreciation of the application of this Rule to an enforced disappearance situation, a brief look at the historical context of the writ and enforced disappearances would be very helpful.<br><br>The phenomenon of enforced disappearance arising from State action first attracted notice in Adolf Hitler's <i>Nact und Nebel Erlass</i> or Night and Fog Decree of December 7, 1941.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  The Third Reich's Night and Fog Program, a State policy, was directed at persons in occupied territories "endangering German security"; they were transported secretly to Germany where they disappeared without a trace. In order to maximize the desired intimidating effect, the policy prohibited government officials from providing information about the fate of these targeted persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In the mid-1970s, the phenomenon of enforced disappearances resurfaced, shocking and outraging the world when individuals, numbering anywhere from 6,000 to 24,000, were reported to have "disappeared" during the military regime in Argentina. Enforced disappearances spread in Latin America, and the issue became an international concern when the world noted its widespread and systematic use by State security forces in that continent under Operation Condor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and during the Dirty War<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> in the 1970s and 1980s. The escalation of the practice saw political activists secretly arrested, tortured, and killed as part of governments' counter-insurgency campaigns.  As this form of political brutality became routine elsewhere in the continent, the Latin American media standardized the term "disappearance" to describe the phenomenon. The victims of enforced disappearances were called the "<b>desaparecidos,</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> which literally means the "disappeared ones."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In general, there are three different kinds of "disappearance" cases:<br><br><blockquote>1) those of people arrested without witnesses or without positive identification of the arresting agents and are never found again;<br><br>2) those of prisoners who are usually arrested without an appropriate warrant and held in complete isolation for weeks or months while their families are unable to discover their whereabouts and the military authorities deny having them in custody until they eventually reappear in one detention center or another; and<br><br>3) those of victims of "salvaging" who have disappeared until their lifeless bodies are later discovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the Philippines, enforced disappearances generally fall within the first two categories,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and 855 cases were recorded during the period of martial law from 1972 until 1986.  Of this number, 595 remained missing, 132 surfaced alive and 127 were found dead. During former President Corazon C. Aquino's term, 820 people were reported to have disappeared and of these, 612 cases were documented.  Of this number, 407 remain missing, 108 surfaced alive and 97 were found dead.  The number of enforced disappearances dropped during former President Fidel V. Ramos' term when only 87 cases were reported, while the three-year term of former President Joseph E. Estrada yielded 58 reported cases. KARAPATAN, a local non-governmental organization, reports that as of March 31, 2008, the records show that there were a total of 193 victims of enforced disappearance under incumbent President Gloria M. Arroyo's administration. The Commission on Human Rights' records show a total of 636 verified cases of enforced disappearances from 1985 to 1993.  Of this number, 406 remained missing, 92 surfaced alive, 62 were found dead, and 76 still have undetermined status.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>  Currently, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> reports 619 outstanding cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances covering the period December 1, 2007 to November 30, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br><b><i>Enforced Disappearances </i></b><br><b><i>Under Philippine Law</i></b><br><br>The <i>Amparo</i> Rule expressly provides that the "writ shall cover extralegal killings and enforced disappearances or threats thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>  We note that although the writ specifically covers "enforced disappearances," this concept is neither defined nor penalized in this jurisdiction. The records of the Supreme Court Committee on the Revision of Rules (<i>Committee)</i> reveal that the drafters of the <i>Amparo </i>Rule initially considered providing an elemental definition of the concept of enforced disappearance:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br><blockquote>JUSTICE MARTINEZ: I believe that first and foremost we should come up or formulate a specific definition [for] extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

So we'll have to agree among ourselves about the nature of killings and disappearances for instance, in other jurisdictions, the rules only cover state actors.  That is an element incorporated in their concept of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.  In other jurisdictions, the concept includes acts and omissions not only of state actors but also of non state actors.  Well, more specifically in the case of the Philippines for instance, should these rules include the killings, the disappearances which may be authored by let us say, the NPAs or the leftist organizations and others.  So, again we need to define the nature of the extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances that will be covered by these rules. [Emphasis supplied] <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the end, the Committee took cognizance of several bills filed in the House of Representatives<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> and in the Senate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> on extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, and resolved to do away with a clear textual definition of these terms in the Rule.  The Committee instead focused on the nature and scope of the concerns <i>within its power to address</i> and provided the appropriate remedy therefor, mindful that an elemental definition may intrude into the ongoing legislative efforts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>As the law now stands, extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances in this jurisdiction are not crimes penalized separately from the component criminal acts undertaken to carry out these killings and enforced disappearances and are now penalized under the Revised Penal Code and special laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup>  The simple reason is that the Legislature has not spoken on the matter; the determination of what acts are criminal and what the corresponding penalty these criminal acts should carry are matters of substantive law that only the Legislature has the power to enact under the country's constitutional scheme and power structure.<br><br>Even without the benefit of directly applicable substantive laws on extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances, however, the Supreme Court is not powerless to act under its own constitutional mandate to promulgate <i>"rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice and procedure in all courts,"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> since extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, by their nature and purpose, constitute State or private party violation of the constitutional rights of individuals to life, liberty and security.  Although the Court's power is strictly procedural and as such does not diminish, increase or modify substantive rights, the legal protection that the Court can provide can be very meaningful through the procedures it sets in addressing extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The Court, through its procedural rules, can set the <i>procedural standards </i>and thereby directly compel the public authorities to act on actual or threatened violations of constitutional rights. To state the obvious, judicial intervention can make a difference - even if only procedurally - in a situation when the very same investigating public authorities may have had a hand in the threatened or actual violations of constitutional rights.<br><br>Lest this Court intervention be misunderstood, we clarify once again that we do not rule on any issue of <i>criminal culpability</i> for the extrajudicial killing or enforced disappearance.  This is an issue that requires criminal action before our criminal courts based on our existing penal laws.  Our intervention is in determining whether an enforced disappearance has taken place and who is responsible or accountable for this disappearance, and to define and impose the appropriate remedies to address it.  The burden for the public authorities to discharge in these situations, under the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo,</i> is twofold.  The <i>first</i> is to ensure that all efforts at <b><i>disclosure</i></b> and <b><i>investigation</i></b> are undertaken under pain of indirect contempt from this Court when governmental efforts are less than what the individual situations require.  The <i>second</i> is to address the disappearance, so that the life of the victim is preserved and his or her liberty and security restored. In these senses, our orders and directives relative to the writ are continuing efforts that are not truly terminated until the extrajudicial killing or enforced disappearance is fully addressed by the complete determination of the fate and the whereabouts of the victim, by the production of the disappeared person and the restoration of his or her liberty and security, and, in the proper case, by the commencement of criminal action against the guilty parties.<br><br><b><i>Enforced Disappearance </i></b><br><b><i>Under International Law</i></b><br><br>From the International Law perspective, involuntary or enforced disappearance is considered a flagrant violation of human rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>  It does not only violate the right to life, liberty and security of the <i>desaparecido</i>; it affects their families as well through the denial of their right to information regarding the circumstances of the disappeared family member.  Thus, enforced disappearances have been said to be "a double form of torture," with "doubly paralyzing impact for the victims," as they "are kept ignorant of their own fates, while family members are deprived of knowing the whereabouts of their detained loved ones" and suffer as well the serious economic hardship and poverty that in most cases follow the disappearance of the household breadwinner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The UN General Assembly first considered the issue of "Disappeared Persons" in December 1978 under Resolution 33/173.

The European Court of Human Rights (<i>ECHR</i>), however, has applied the Convention in a way that provides ample protection for the underlying rights affected by enforced disappearance through the Convention's Article 2 on the right to life; Article 3 on the prohibition of torture; Article 5 on the right to liberty and security; Article 6, paragraph 1 on the right to a fair trial; and Article 13 on the right to an effective remedy.

It further found the applicant (the disappeared person's mother) to be a victim of a violation of Article 3, as a result of the silence of the authorities and the inadequate character of the investigations undertaken.

The court further elaborated on the significance of UN declarations, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>These U.N. declarations are significant because they specify with great precision the obligations of member nations under the Charter. Since their adoption, "(m)embers can no longer contend that they do not know what human rights they promised in the Charter to promote." Moreover, a U.N. Declaration is, according to one authoritative definition, "a formal and solemn instrument, suitable for rare occasions when principles of great and lasting importance are being enunciated." Accordingly, it has been observed that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights "no longer fits into the dichotomy of `binding treaty' against `non-binding pronouncement,' but is rather an authoritative statement of the international community." Thus, a Declaration creates an expectation of adherence, and "insofar as the expectation is gradually justified by State practice, a declaration may by custom become recognized as laying down rules binding upon the States." Indeed, several commentators have concluded that the Universal Declaration has become, in <i>toto</i>, a part of binding, customary international law.

Manalo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> this Court, in ruling that the right to security of persons is a guarantee of the protection of one's right by the government, held that:<br><br><blockquote>The right to security of person in this third sense is a corollary of the policy that the State "guarantees full respect for human rights" under Article II, Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution. <i>As the government is the chief guarantor of order and security, the Constitutional guarantee of the rights to life, liberty and security of person is rendered ineffective if government does not afford <b>protection</b> to these rights especially when they are under threat. </i> <b>Protection includes conducting effective investigations, organization of the government apparatus to extend protection to victims of extralegal killings or enforced disappearances (or threats thereof) and/or their families, and bringing offenders to the bar of justice</b>.  The Inter-American Court of Human Rights stressed the importance of investigation in the <b>Velasquez Rodriguez Case</b>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>(The duty to investigate) <b>must be undertaken in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">serious manner</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not as a mere formality preordained to be ineffectiv</span>e.</b>  An investigation must have an objective and be <b>assumed by the State as its own legal duty, not as a step taken by private interests that depends upon the initiative of the victim or his family</b> or upon their offer of proof, without an effective search for the truth by the government. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote></blockquote><br><i>Manalo</i> significantly cited <i>Kurt v. Turkey,</i>[140] where the ECHR interpreted the "right to security" not only as a prohibition on the State against arbitrary deprivation of liberty, but also as the imposition of a positive duty to afford protection to the right to liberty.  The Court notably quoted the following ECHR ruling:<br><br><blockquote>[A]ny deprivation of liberty must not only have been effected in conformity with the substantive and procedural rules of national law but must equally be in keeping with the very purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness... Having assumed control over that individual, it is incumbent on the authorities to account for his or her whereabouts.  For this reason, <b>Article 5 must be seen as requiring the authorities to take effective measures to safeguard against the risk of disappearance and to conduct a prompt effective investigation into an arguable claim that a person has been taken into custody and has not been seen since</b>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>These rulings effectively serve as the backdrop for the Rule on the Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, which the Court made effective on October 24, 2007.  Although the <i>Amparo </i>Rule still has gaps waiting to be filled through substantive law, as evidenced primarily by the lack of a concrete definition of "enforced disappearance," <b>the materials cited above, among others, provide ample guidance and standards on how, through the medium of the <i>Amparo </i>Rule, the Court can provide remedies and protect the constitutional rights to life, liberty and security that underlie every enforced disappearance.</b><br><br><b><i>Evidentiary Difficulties Posed </i></b><br><b><i>by the Unique Nature of an </i></b><br><b><i>Enforced Disappearance</i></b><br><br>Before going into the issue of whether the respondent has discharged the burden of proving the allegations of the petition for the Writ of <i>Amparo </i>by the degree of proof required by the <i>Amparo </i>Rule, we shall discuss briefly the unique evidentiary difficulties presented by enforced disappearance cases; these difficulties form part of the setting that the implementation of the <i>Amparo </i>Rule shall encounter.<br><br>These difficulties largely arise because the State itself - the party whose involvement is alleged - investigates enforced disappearances. Past experiences in other jurisdictions show that the evidentiary difficulties are generally threefold.<br><br><i>First</i>, there may be a <b>deliberate concealment of the identities of the direct perpetrators.</b>[141] Experts note that abductors are well organized, armed and usually members of the military or police forces, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The victim is generally arrested by the security forces or by persons acting under some form of governmental authority. In many countries the units that plan, implement and execute the program are generally specialized, highly-secret bodies within the armed or security forces. They are generally directed through a separate, clandestine chain of command, but they have the necessary credentials to avoid or prevent any interference by the "legal" police forces. These authorities take their victims to secret detention centers where they subject them to interrogation and torture without fear of judicial or other controls.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></blockquote><br>In addition, there are usually no witnesses to the crime; if there are, these witnesses are usually afraid to speak out publicly or to testify on the disappearance out of fear for their own lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup>  We have had occasion to note this difficulty in <i>Secretary of Defense v. Manalo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> when we acknowledged that "where powerful military officers are implicated, the hesitation of witnesses to surface and testify against them comes as no surprise."<br><br><i>Second</i>, <b>deliberate concealment of pertinent evidence of the disappearance</b> is a distinct possibility; the central piece of evidence in an enforced disappearance - <i>i.e</i>., the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the victim's body - is usually concealed to effectively thwart the start of any investigation or the progress of one that may have begun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> <i>The problem for the victim's family is the State's virtual monopoly of access to pertinent evidence</i>. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights (<i>IACHR</i>) observed in the landmark case of <i>Velasquez Rodriguez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> that inherent to the practice of enforced disappearance is the deliberate use of the State's power to destroy the pertinent evidence.  The IACHR described the concealment as a clear attempt by the State to commit the perfect crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i> is the <b>element of denial</b>; in many cases, the State authorities deliberately deny that the enforced disappearance ever occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> "Deniability" is central to the policy of enforced disappearances, as the absence of any proven disappearance makes it easier to escape the application of legal standards ensuring the victim's human rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Experience shows that government officials typically respond to requests for information about <i>desaparecidos </i>by saying that they are not aware of any disappearance, that the missing people may have fled the country, or that their names have merely been invented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>These considerations are alive in our minds, as these are the difficulties we confront, in one form or another, in our consideration of this case.<br><br><b><i>Evidence and Burden of Proof in </i></b><br><b><i>Enforced Disappearances Cases </i></b><br><br>Sections 13, 17 and 18 of the <i>Amparo</i> Rule define the nature of an <i>Amparo</i> proceeding and the degree and burden of proof the parties to the case carry, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 13.  <i>Summary Hearing</i>.  The hearing on the petition shall be <b>summary</b>.  However, the court, justice or judge may call for a preliminary conference to simplify the issues and determine the possibility of obtaining stipulations and admissions from the parties.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Section 17.  <i>Burden of Proof and Standard of Diligence Required</i>. - The parties shall establish their claims by <b>substantial evidence.  </b><br><br>The respondent who is a private individual must prove that ordinary diligence as required by applicable laws, rules and regulations was observed in the performance of duty.<br><br>The respondent who is a public official or employee must prove that extraordinary diligence as required by applicable laws, rules and regulations was observed in the performance of duty.<br><br>The respondent public official or employee cannot invoke the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed or evade responsibility or liability.<br><br>Section 18.  <i>Judgment</i>. - ... If the <b>allegations in the petition are proven by substantial evidence</b>, the court shall <b>grant </b>the privilege of the writ and such reliefs as may be proper and appropriate; <b>otherwise</b>, the privilege shall be <b>denied</b>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>These characteristics - namely, of being summary and the use of substantial evidence as the required level of proof (in contrast to the usual preponderance of evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt in court proceedings) - reveal the clear intent of the framers of the <i>Amparo </i>Rule to have the equivalent of an administrative proceeding, albeit judicially conducted, in addressing <i>Amparo</i> situations.  The standard of diligence required - the duty of public officials and employees to observe extraordinary diligence - point, too, to the extraordinary measures expected in the protection of constitutional rights and in the consequent handling and investigation of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearance cases.<br><br>Thus, in these proceedings, the <i>Amparo</i> petitioner needs only to properly comply with the substance and form requirements of a Writ of <i>Amparo</i> petition, as discussed above, and prove the allegations by substantial evidence. Once a rebuttable case has been proven, the respondents must then respond and prove their defenses based on the standard of diligence required.  The rebuttable case, of course, must show that an enforced disappearance took place under circumstances showing a violation of the victim's constitutional rights to life, liberty or security, and the failure on the part of the investigating authorities to appropriately respond.<br><br>The landmark case of <i>Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> provided the Court its first opportunity to define the substantial evidence required to arrive at a valid decision in administrative proceedings. To directly quote <i>Ang Tibay</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.  <b>It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion</b>. [citations omitted]  The statute provides that `the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity shall not be controlling.'  The obvious purpose of this and similar provisions is to free administrative boards from the compulsion of technical rules so that the mere admission of matter which would be deemed incompetent in judicial proceedings would not invalidate the administrative order. [citations omitted] But this assurance of a desirable flexibility in administrative procedure does not go so far as to justify orders without a basis in evidence having rational probative force. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>In<i> Secretary of Defense v. Manalo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><i> </i>which was the Court's first petition for a Writ of <i>Amparo</i>, we recognized that the full and exhaustive proceedings that the substantial evidence standard regularly requires do not need to apply due to the summary nature of <i>Amparo</i> proceedings.  We said:<br><br><blockquote>The remedy [of the writ of amparo] provides rapid judicial relief as it partakes of a summary proceeding that requires only substantial evidence to make the appropriate reliefs available to the petitioner; it is not an action to determine criminal guilt requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt, or liability for damages requiring preponderance of evidence, <b><u>or administrative responsibility requiring substantial evidence that will require full and exhaustive proceedings</u>.</b> [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Not to be forgotten in considering the evidentiary aspects of <i>Amparo </i>petitions are the unique difficulties presented by the nature of enforced disappearances, heretofore discussed, which difficulties this Court must frontally meet if the <i>Amparo</i> Rule is to be given a chance to achieve its objectives.  These evidentiary difficulties compel the Court to adopt standards appropriate and responsive to the circumstances, <i>without transgressing the due process requirements that underlie every proceeding.</i><br><br>In the seminal case of <i>Velasquez Rodriguez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> the IACHR - faced with a lack of direct evidence that the government of Honduras was involved in Velasquez Rodriguez' disappearance - adopted a relaxed and informal evidentiary standard, and established the rule that presumes governmental responsibility for a disappearance if it can be proven that the government carries out a general practice of enforced disappearances and the specific case can be linked to that practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> <i>The IACHR took note of the realistic fact that enforced disappearances could be proven only through circumstantial or indirect evidence or by logical inference; otherwise, it was impossible to prove that an individual had been made to disappear</i>.  It held:<br><br><blockquote>130. The practice of international and domestic courts shows that direct evidence, whether testimonial or documentary, is not the only type of evidence that may be legitimately considered in reaching a decision. <b>Circumstantial evidence, indicia, and presumptions may be considered, so long as they lead to conclusions consistent with the facts. </b><br><br>131. <b>Circumstantial or presumptive evidence is especially important in allegations of disappearances, because this type of repression is characterized by an attempt to suppress all information about the kidnapping or the whereabouts and fate of the victim. </b>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>In concluding that the disappearance of Manfredo VelÃ¡squez (<i>Manfredo</i>) was carried out by agents who acted under cover of public authority, <b>the IACHR relied on circumstantial evidence including the hearsay testimony o</b>f Zenaida VelÃ¡squez, the victim's sister, who described Manfredo's<i> </i>kidnapping on the basis of conversations she had with witnesses who saw Manfredo kidnapped by men in civilian clothes in broad daylight. She also told the Court that a former Honduran military official had announced that Manfredo was kidnapped by a special military squadron acting under orders of the Chief of the Armed Forces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>  The IACHR likewise considered the hearsay testimony of a second witness who asserted that he had been told by a Honduran military officer about the disappearance, and a third witness who testified that he had spoken in prison to a man who identified himself as Manfredo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br><i>Velasquez</i> stresses the lesson that flexibility is necessary under the unique circumstances that enforced disappearance cases pose to the courts; to have an effective remedy, the standard of evidence must be responsive to the evidentiary difficulties faced.  On the one hand, we cannot be arbitrary in the admission and appreciation of evidence, as arbitrariness entails violation of rights and cannot be used as an effective counter-measure; we only compound the problem if a wrong is addressed by the commission of another wrong.  On the other hand, we cannot be very strict in our evidentiary rules and cannot consider evidence the way we do in the usual criminal and civil cases; precisely, the proceedings before us are administrative in nature where, as a rule, technical rules of evidence are not strictly observed.  Thus, while we must follow the substantial evidence rule, we must observe flexibility in considering the evidence we shall take into account.<br><br>The fair and proper rule, to our mind, is to consider all the pieces of evidence adduced in their totality, and to consider any evidence otherwise inadmissible under our usual rules to be admissible if it is consistent with the admissible evidence adduced.  In other words, <b>we reduce our rules to the most basic test of reason - <i>i.e</i>., to the relevance of the evidence to the issue at hand and its consistency with all other pieces of adduced evidence.  Thus, even hearsay evidence can be admitted if it satisfies this basic minimum test.</b><br><br>We note in this regard that the use of flexibility in the consideration of evidence is not at all novel in the Philippine legal system. In child abuse cases, Section 28 of the Rule on Examination of a Child Witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> is expressly recognized as an exception to the hearsay rule.  This Rule allows the admission of the hearsay testimony of a child describing any act or attempted act of sexual abuse in any criminal or non-criminal proceeding, subject to certain prerequisites and the right of cross-examination by the adverse party.  The admission of the statement is determined by the court in light of specified subjective and objective considerations that provide sufficient indicia of reliability of the child witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup>  These requisites for admission find their counterpart in the present case under the above-described conditions for the exercise of flexibility in the consideration of evidence, including hearsay evidence, in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearance cases.<br><br><b><i>Assessment of the Evidence</i></b><br><br>The threshold question for our resolution is: was there an enforced disappearance within the meaning of this term under the UN Declaration we have cited?<br><br>The Convention defines enforced disappearance as "the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup>  Under this definition, the elements that constitute enforced disappearance are essentially fourfold:[160]<br><br><blockquote><b>(a) arrest, detention, abduction or any form of deprivation of liberty</b>;<br><br><b>(b) carried out by agents of the State or persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State;</b><br><br>(c) followed by a refusal to acknowledge the detention, or a concealment of the fate of the disappeared person; and<br><br>(d)  placement of the disappeared person outside the protection of the law. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>We find no <i>direct evidence</i> indicating how the victim actually disappeared.  The <i>direct evidence</i> at hand only shows that Tagitis went out of the ASY Pension House after depositing his room key with the hotel desk and was never seen nor heard of again.  The undisputed conclusion, however, from all concerned - the petitioner, Tagitis' colleagues and even the police authorities - is that Tagistis disappeared under mysterious circumstances and was never seen again. The respondent injected the causal element in her petition and testimony, as we shall discuss below.<br><br>We likewise find no <i>direct evidence</i> showing that operatives of PNP CIDG Zamboanga abducted or arrested Tagitis.  If at all, only the respondent's allegation that Tagistis was under CIDG Zamboanga custody stands on record, but it is not supported by any other evidence, direct or circumstantial.<br><br>In her direct testimony, the respondent pointed to two sources of information as her bases for her allegation that Tagistis had been placed under government custody (in contrast with CIDG Zamboanga custody). The first was an unnamed friend in Zamboanga (later identified as Col. Ancanan), who occupied a high position in the military and who allegedly mentioned that Tagitis was in good hands.  Nothing came out of this claim, as both the respondent herself and her witness, Mrs. Talbin, failed to establish that Col. Ancanan gave them any information that Tagitis was in government custody.  Col. Ancanan, for his part, admitted the meeting with the respondent but denied giving her any information about the disappearance.<br><br><b>The more specific and productive source of information was Col.

Kasim never denied that he met with the respondent and her friends, and that he provided them information based on the input of an unnamed asset. He simply claimed in his testimony that the "informal letter" he received from his informant in Sulu did not indicate that Tagitis was in the custody of the CIDG.  He also stressed that the information he provided the respondent was merely a "raw report" from "<i>barangay </i>intelligence" that still needed confirmation and "follow up" as to its veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>To be sure, the respondent's and Mrs. Talbin's testimonies were far from perfect, as the petitioners pointed out. The respondent mistakenly characterized Col. Kasim as a "military officer" who told her that "her husband is being abducted because he is under custodial investigation because he is allegedly `<i>parang liason ng J.I</i>.'" The petitioners also noted that "Mrs. Talbin's testimony imputing certain statements to Sr. Supt. Kasim that Engr. Tagitis is with the military, but he is not certain whether it is the PNP or AFP is not worthy of belief, since Sr. Supt. Kasim is a high ranking police officer who would certainly know that the PNP is not part of the military."<br><br>Upon deeper consideration of these inconsistencies, however, what appears clear to us is that the petitioners never really steadfastly disputed or presented evidence to refute the credibility of the respondent and her witness, Mrs. Talbin. The inconsistencies the petitioners point out relate, more than anything else, to details that should not affect the credibility of the respondent and Mrs. Talbin; the inconsistencies are not on material points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup>  We note, for example, that these witnesses are lay people in so far as military and police matters are concerned, and confusion between the police and the military is not unusual.  As a rule, minor inconsistencies such as these indicate truthfulness rather than prevarication<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> and only tend to strengthen their probative value, in contrast to testimonies from various witnesses dovetailing on every detail; the latter cannot but generate suspicion that the material circumstances they testified to were integral parts of a well thought of and prefabricated story.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup><br><br><b>Based on these considerations and the unique evidentiary situation in enforced disappearance cases, we hold it duly established that Col. Kasim informed the respondent and her friends, based on the informant's letter, that Tagitis, reputedly a liaison for the JI and who had been under surveillance since January 2007, was "in good hands" and under custodial investigation for complicity with the JI after he was seen talking to one Omar Patik and a certain "Santos" of Bulacan, a "Balik Islam" charged with terrorism.</b>  The respondent's and Mrs. Talbin's testimonies cannot simply be defeated by Col. Kasim's plain denial and his claim that he had destroyed his informant's letter, the critical piece of evidence that supports or negates the parties' conflicting claims. Col. Kasim's admitted destruction of this letter - effectively, a suppression of this evidence - raises the presumption that the letter, if produced, would be proof of what the respondent claimed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup>  For brevity, we shall call the evidence of what Col. Kasim reported to the respondent to be the "Kasim evidence."<br><br>Given this evidence, our next step is to decide whether we can accept this evidence, in lieu of direct evidence, as <i>proof that the disappearance of Tagitis was due to action with government participation, knowledge or consent and that he was held for custodial investigation</i>.  We note in this regard that Col. Kasim was never quoted to have said that the custodial investigation was by the CIDG Zamboanga.  The Kasim evidence only implies government intervention through the use of the term "custodial investigation," and does not at all point to CIDG Zamboanga as Tagitis' custodian.<br><br>Strictly speaking, we are faced here with a classic case of hearsay evidence - <i>i.e</i>., evidence whose probative value is not based on the personal knowledge of the witnesses (the respondent, Mrs. Talbin and Col. Kasim himself) but on the knowledge of some other person not on the witness stand (the informant).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup><br><br>To say that this piece of evidence is incompetent and inadmissible evidence of what it substantively states is to acknowledge - as the petitioners effectively suggest - that in the absence of any direct evidence, we should simply dismiss the petition.  To our mind, an immediate dismissal for this reason is no different from a statement that the <i>Amparo </i>Rule - despite its terms - is ineffective, as it cannot allow for the special evidentiary difficulties that are unavoidably present in <i>Amparo</i> situations, particularly in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The <i>Amparo </i>Rule was not promulgated with this intent or with the intent to make it a token gesture of concern for constitutional rights.  It was promulgated to provide effective and timely remedies, <i>using and profiting from local and international experiences</i> in extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, as the situation may require. Consequently, we have no choice but to meet the evidentiary difficulties inherent in enforced disappearances with the flexibility that these difficulties demand.<br><br>To give full meaning to our Constitution and the rights it protects, we hold that, as in <i>Velasquez</i>, we should at least take a close look at the available evidence to determine the correct import of every piece of evidence - even of those usually considered inadmissible under the general rules of evidence - taking into account the surrounding circumstances and the test of reason that we can use as basic minimum admissibility requirement.  In the present case, we should at least determine whether the Kasim evidence before us is relevant and meaningful to the disappearance of Tagistis and reasonably consistent with other evidence in the case.<br><br>The evidence about Tagitis' personal circumstances surrounded him with an air of mystery.  He was reputedly a consultant of the World Bank and a Senior Honorary Counselor for the IDB who attended a seminar in Zamboanga and thereafter proceded to Jolo for an overnight stay, indicated by his request to Kunnong for the purchase of a return ticket to Zamboanga the day after he arrived in Jolo. <i>Nothing in the records indicates the purpose of his overnight sojourn in Jolo</i>. A colleague in the IDB, Prof. Matli, early on informed the Jolo police that Tagitis may have taken funds given to him in trust for IDB scholars.  Prof Matli later on stated that he never accused Tagitis of taking away money held in trust, although he confirmed that the IDB was seeking assistance in locating funds of IDB scholars deposited in Tagitis' personal account.  Other than these pieces of evidence, no other information exists in the records relating to the personal circumstances of Tagitis.<br><br>The actual disappearance of Tagitis is as murky as his personal circumstances.  While the <i>Amparo</i> petition recited that he was taken away by "burly men believed to be police intelligence operatives," no evidence whatsoever was introduced to support this allegation.  Thus, the available direct evidence is that Tagitis was last seen at 12.30 p.m. of October 30, 2007 - the day he arrived in Jolo - and was never seen again.<br><br>The Kasim evidence assumes critical materiality given the dearth of direct evidence on the above aspects of the case, as it supplies the gaps <i>that were never looked into and clarified</i> by police investigation.  It is the evidence, too, that colors a simple missing person report into an enforced disappearance case, as it injects the element of participation by agents of the State and thus brings into question how the State reacted to the disappearance.<br><br>Denials on the part of the police authorities, and frustration on the part of the respondent, characterize the attempts to locate Tagitis. Initially in Jolo, the police informed Kunnong that Tagitis could have been taken by the Abu Sayyaf or other groups fighting the government.  <i>No evidence was ever offered on whether there was active Jolo police investigation and how and why the Jolo police arrived at this conclusion.</i>  The respondent's own inquiry in Jolo yielded the answer that he was not missing but was with another woman somewhere.  <i>Again, no evidence exists that this explanation was arrived at based on an investigation</i>.  As already related above, the inquiry with Col. Ancanan in Zamboanga yielded ambivalent results not useful for evidentiary purposes. Thus, it was only the inquiry from Col. Kasim that yielded positive results.  Col. Kasim's story, however, confirmed only the fact of his custodial investigation (and, impliedly, his arrest or abduction), without identifying his abductor/s or the party holding him in custody. The more significant part of Col. Kasim's story is that the abduction came after Tagitis was seen talking with Omar Patik and a certain Santos of Bulacan, a "Balik Islam" charged with terrorism. Mrs. Talbin mentioned, too, that Tagitis was being held at Talipapao, Sulu. <i>None of the police agencies participating in the investigation ever pursued these leads</i>. Notably, Task Force Tagitis to which this information was relayed did not appear to have lifted a finger to pursue these aspects of the case.<br><br>More denials were manifested in the Returns on the writ to the CA made by the petitioners.  Then PNP Chief Gen. Avelino I. Razon merely reported the directives he sent to the ARMM Regional Director and the Regional Chief of the CIDG on Tagitis, and these reports merely reiterated the open-ended initial report of the disappearance. The CIDG directed a search in all of its divisions with negative results.  These, to the PNP Chief, constituted the exhaustion "of all possible efforts."  PNP-CIDG Chief General Edgardo M. Doromal, for his part, also reported negative results after searching "all divisions and departments [of the CIDG] for a person named Engr. Morced N. Tagitis . . . and after a diligent and thorough research, records show that no such person is being detained in the CIDG or any of its department or divisions."  PNP-PACER Chief PS Supt. Leonardo A. Espina and PNP PRO ARMM Regional Director PC Superintendent Joel R. Goltiao did no better in their affidavits-returns, as they essentially reported the results of their directives to their units to search for Tagitis.<br><br>The extent to which the police authorities acted was fully tested when the CA constituted Task Force Tagitis, with specific directives on what to do.  The negative results reflected in the Returns on the writ were again replicated during the three hearings the CA scheduled.  Aside from the previously mentioned "retraction" that Prof. Matli made to correct his accusation that Tagitis took money held in trust for students, PS Supt. Ajirim reiterated in his testimony that the CIDG consistently denied any knowledge or complicity in any abduction and said that there was no basis to conclude that the CIDG or any police unit had anything to do with the disappearance of Tagitis; he likewise considered it premature to conclude that Tagitis simply ran away with the money in his custody. As already noted above, the Task Force notably did not pursue any investigation about the personal circumstances of Tagitis, his background in relation to the IDB and the background and activities of this Bank itself, and the reported sighting of Tagistis with terrorists and his alleged custody in Talipapao, Sulu.  No attempt appears to have ever been made to look into the alleged IDB funds that Tagitis held in trust, or to tap any of the "assets" who are indispensable in investigations of this nature. These omissions and negative results were aggravated by the CA findings that it was only as late as January 28, 2008 or three months after the disappearance that the police authorities requested for clear pictures of Tagitis.  Col. Kasim could not attend the trial because his subpoena was not served, despite the fact that he was designated as Ajirim's replacement in the latter's last post. Thus, Col. Kasim was not then questioned.  No investigation - even an internal one - appeared to have been made to inquire into the identity of Col. Kasim's "asset" and what he indeed wrote.<br><br><b>We glean from all these pieces of evidence and developments a consistency in the government's denial of any complicity in the disappearance of Tagitis, disrupted only by the report made by Col. Kasim to the respondent at Camp Katitipan.</b>  Even Col. Kasim, however, eventually denied that he ever made the disclosure that Tagitis was under custodial investigation for complicity in terrorism.  <b>Another distinctive trait that runs through these developments is the government's dismissive approach to the disappearance,</b> starting from the initial response by the Jolo police to Kunnong's initial reports of the disappearance, to the responses made to the respondent when she herself reported and inquired about her husband's disappearance, and even at Task Force Tagitis itself.<br><br>As the CA found through Task Force Tagitis, the investigation was at best haphazard since the authorities were looking for a man whose picture they initially did not even secure. The returns and reports made to the CA fared no better, as the CIDG efforts themselves were confined to searching for custodial records of Tagitis <i>in their various departments and divisions</i>.  To point out the obvious, if the abduction of Tagitis was a "black" operation because it was unrecorded or officially unauthorized, no record of custody would ever appear in the CIDG records; Tagitis, too, would not be detained in the usual police or CIDG detention places<b>. In sum, none of the reports on record contains any meaningful results or details on the depth and extent of the investigation made.</b>  To be sure, reports of top police officials indicating the personnel and units they directed to investigate can never constitute exhaustive and meaningful investigation, or equal detailed investigative reports of the activities undertaken to search for Tagitis.  Indisputably, the police authorities from the very beginning failed to come up to the extraordinary diligence that the <i>Amparo</i> Rule requires.<br><br><center><b><u>CONCLUSIONS AND THE AMPARO REMEDY</u></b></center><br><br>Based on these considerations, we conclude that Col. Kasim's disclosure, made in an unguarded moment, unequivocally point to some government complicity in the disappearance.  The consistent but unfounded denials and the haphazard investigations cannot but point to this conclusion.  For why would the government and its officials engage in their chorus of concealment if the intent had not been to deny what they already knew of the disappearance? Would not an in-depth and thorough investigation that at least credibly determined the fate of Tagitis be a feather in the government's cap under the circumstances of the disappearance?  From this perspective, the evidence and developments, particularly the Kasim evidence, already establish a concrete case of enforced disappearance that the <i>Amparo</i> Rule covers.  From the prism of the UN Declaration, heretofore cited and quoted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> the evidence at hand and the developments in this case confirm the fact of the enforced disappearance and government complicity, under a background of consistent and unfounded government denials and haphazard handling. The disappearance as well effectively placed Tagitis outside the protection of the law - a situation that will subsist unless this Court acts.<br><br>This kind of fact situation and the conclusion reached are not without precedent in international enforced disappearance rulings.  While the facts are not exactly the same, the facts of this case run very close to those of <i>Timurtas v. Turkey</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> a case decided by ECHR.  The European tribunal in that case acted on the basis of the photocopy of a "post-operation report" in finding that Abdulvahap Timurtas (<i>Abdulvahap</i>) was abducted and later detained by agents (<i>gendarmes</i>) of the government of Turkey.  The victim's father in this case brought a claim against Turkey for numerous violations of the European Convention, including the right to life (Article 2) and the rights to liberty and security of a person (Article 5).  The applicant contended that on August 14, 1993, <i>gendarmes</i> apprehended his son, Abdulvahap for being a leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (<i>PKK</i>) in the Silopi region. The petition was filed in southeast Turkey nearly six and one half years after the apprehension. According to the father, <i>gendarmes</i> first detained Abdulvahap and then transferred him to another detainment facility. <b>Although there was no eyewitness evidence of the apprehension or subsequent detainment</b>, <b>the applicant presented evidence corroborating his version of events, including a photocopy of a post-operation report signed by the commander of gendarme operations in Silopi, Turkey.</b> The report included a description of Abdulvahap's arrest and the result of a subsequent interrogation during detention where he was accused of being a leader of the PKK in the Silopi region.  On this basis, Turkey was held responsible for Abdulvahap's enforced disappearance. <br><br><b>Following the lead of this Turkish experience - adjusted to the Philippine legal setting and the Amparo remedy this Court has established, as applied to the unique facts and developments of this case - we believe and so hold that the government in general, through the PNP and the PNP-CIDG, and in particular, the Chiefs of these organizations together with Col.
