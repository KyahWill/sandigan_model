				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These consolidated cases involve (a) the administrative charges of graft and corruption against respondents Judge Renato J. Dilag (Judge Dilag) and Court Stenographer III Concepcion A. Pascua (Pascua) of Branch 73 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City, Zambales filed by Nilda Verginesa-Suarez (Suarez), Court Stenographer III of the same court; and (b) the administrative charges for gross misconduct and gross ignorance of the law against Judge Dilag filed by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).&nbsp; These cases also include the counter-charges of Judge Dilag and Pascua against Suarez for falsification, negligence in the transcription of stenographic notes, and absence without official leave.<br><br><b>Administrative Matter No. RTJ-06-2014</b> stemmed from the <i>Complaint-Affidavit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> </i>dated November 25, 2005 and <i>Letter</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>dated January 11, 2006 filed before the OCA by Suarez against Judge Dilag and Pascua allegedly for collecting P30,000.000 from litigants in consideration of favorable judgments in cases for annulment or declaration of nullity of marriage.&nbsp; Suarez supported her accusation with a sworn statement of a certain Belen Trapane who allegedly paid the amount of P30,000.00 to Pascua to obtain a favorable judgment in an action for declaration of nullity of marriage lodged before the court presided by Judge Dilag.&nbsp; She also attached an anonymous letter addressed to former Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr., which stated that Judge Dilag charged the amount of P30,000.00 for a favorable judgment in every annulment case.&nbsp; Suarez further pointed out the existence of conflicting decisions rendered by Judge Dilag in the following cases:<br><ol><li>Civil Case No. 180-0-2001 entitled "Lanie Pancho v. Rolando Gopez" (<i>Pancho</i> case) for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage which was dismissed in a <i>Decision</i> dated March 14, 2005 but granted in a <i>Decision</i> dated June 16, 2005;<br><br></li><li>Civil Case No. 433-0-2003 entitled "Jeffrey Joseph T. Tomboc v. Ruth Tomboc" (<i>Tomboc</i> case) for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage which was dismissed in a <i>Decision</i> dated April 29, 2005 but granted in a <i>Decision</i> dated May 20, 2005; and<br><br></li><li>Special Proceeding No. 436-0-2002 entitled "Petition for Voluntary Dissolution of the Conjugal Partnership of Gains and for the Separation of the Common Properties, Danilo del Rosario and Rachelle del Rosario, Petitioners" (<i>Del Rosario</i> case) which was dismissed in a <i>Decision</i> dated July 27, 2004 but granted in a <i>Decision</i> dated September 7, 2004.<br></li></ol>Judge Dilag and Pascua filed their respective answers to the complaint in compliance with the directive of the OCA.&nbsp; In his <i>Answer</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>dated February 21, 2006, Judge Dilag denied the allegation of graft and corruption and he filed administrative countercharges against Suarez for falsification or fabrication of the purported dismissed decisions; negligence in the transcription of stenographic notes assigned to her, supported by several manifestations and motions of lawyers; and absence without official leave from November 22, 2005 to December 12, 2005.<br><br>In her <i>Kontra-Salaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 23, 2006, Pascua denied that she collected money from litigants for Judge Dilag and also filed countercharges against Suarez.<br><br>Suarez filed a <i>Supplemental Affidavit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><i> </i>dated March 16, 2006 and alleged therein that Judge Carmelita Fruelda of Branch 43 of the RTC of San Fernando, Pampanga, attempted to persuade her to withdraw the administrative case she filed against Judge Dilag and Pascua. Suarez also filed separate replies to the comments of Judge Dilag and Pascua.&nbsp; In her <i>Reply to the Comment of Judge Renato Dilag</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated May 10, 2006, Suarez contended that she had transcribed her pending transcript of stenographic notes and denied that she went on absence without official leave during the period adverted to by Judge Dilag.&nbsp; Suarez further pointed out that Judge Dilag had been previously charged and sanctioned administratively in <i>Ma. Teresa De Jesus v. Judge Renato J. Dilag</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> wherein Judge Dilag was fined P30,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>The OCA observed that the controversies between the parties were replete with substantial factual issues, and so it recommended a formal administrative inquiry to be conducted by a designated Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In a <i>Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated August 2, 2006, this Court resolved, upon the recommendation of the OCA, to: (1) treat the comment of Judge Dilag as a complaint against Suarez; (2) redocket the instant matter as an administrative matter and refer the same to an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals for investigation within ninety (90) days from receipt of the record; and (3) require the Investigating Justice to submit a report within thirty (30) days from termination of the investigation.<br><br><b>Administrative Matter No. 06-07-415-RTC</b>, on the other hand, arose from a series of anonymous letters which reported the alleged graft and corrupt practices of Judge Dilag.&nbsp; As early as December 25, 2003, an anonymous letter addressed to former Chief Justice Davide, Jr. was indorsed and referred to the OCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; According to this letter, Judge Dilag would initially dismiss a case, but, after payment, would subsequently re-open the case and grant the same.&nbsp; Another anonymous letter dated February 1, 2004 likewise reported that Judge Dilag collected P30,000.00 for a favorable judgment in cases of annulment of marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; On February 9, 2005, the OCA received the last of these anonymous letters which alleged that Judge Dilag issued two (2) conflicting decisions in the <i>Del Rosario</i> case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On February 10, 2005, the OCA directed a discreet investigation of the allegations against Judge Dilag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Pascua, in the meantime, submitted her resignation <i>Letter </i>dated May 11, 2006 addressed to Judge Dilag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]&nbsp; </sup>On May 22 to 26, 2006, a judicial audit team composed of Atty. Teresita A. Tuazon, Martha Florentina A. Bedana, Noe A. Ple√±os, Jacklyn Manabat, Zernan S. Perez, and Ma. Rosario Cristina I. Ferrer pursued the directive of the OCA and conducted a physical inventory of cases in the court presided by Judge Dilag.&nbsp; In its <i>Audit Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted at the Regional Trial Court, Branch 73, Olongapo City, Zambales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14] </sup>dated June 15, 2006, the judicial audit team observed, among others, that Judge Dilag committed irregularities in the handling and disposition of cases before his sala as follows:<br><br>(a) In <i>Lilibeth Agustin v. Angel B. Lopez, </i>CV. No. 242-0-2003, a petition dated May 4, 2003 was filed for declaration of nullity of marriage on the ground of lack of a valid marriage license and psychological incapacity of the respondent. In a Decision dated July 22, 2005, the petition was dismissed for lack of merit for failure of the petitioner to establish that the record or entry of the marriage license applied for and issued from 1983 to 1991 was unavailable due to destruction when Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991.&nbsp; On August 2, 2005, a motion for reconsideration was filed stressing the psychological incapacity of the defendant.&nbsp; In a Resolution dated September 30, 2005, the marriage was declared null and void <i>ab initio </i>pursuant to Art. 36 of the Family Code.<br><br>(b) There were two (2) conflicting decisions in SP No. 436-0-2002, "Danilo del Rosario and Rachelle del Rosario, an action for the Voluntary Dissolution of the Conjugal Partnership of Gains and for the Separation of the Common Properties."&nbsp; To the Monthly Report for the Month of July 2004, attached was a Decision dated July 27, 2004 <b>dismissing</b> the petition for an Agreement on a Voluntary Dissolution of Conjugal Partnership of Gains dated December 19, 2001 entered into by petitioner spouses for being contrary to law, moral, public policy and public order.&nbsp; However, in the case record, attached was a Decision dated September 7, 2004, <b>granting</b> the petition based on the same Agreement for not being contrary to law, moral, public policy and public order.<br><br>(c) In <i>Lourdes Sotto v. Cresencio Diwa</i>, CV No. 221-0-2005, which involved a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, a decision (dated January 24, 2006) was rendered before the expiration of the period for the parties to submit memoranda (on January 26, 2006).&nbsp; Also, an entry of judgment dated February 20, 2006 was issued despite lack of a certificate from the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) that it had received a copy of the decision.<br><br>(d) In <i>Joyce Moreno v. Alvin Moreno</i>, CV No. 188-0-01, also a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, the petition was originally denied in a decision dated February 12, 2003. On February 24, 2003, a Motion for New Trial was filed alleging newly discovered evidence consisting, among other things, of the psychological report concerning defendant, which would show that indeed he was psychologically incapacitated to perform the marital obligations.&nbsp; On March 20, 2003, the Motion was granted and the marriage was declared null and void.&nbsp; Entry of Judgment was made on June 9, 2003 with no return or certificate showing that the OSG had received a copy of the decision / order.<br><br>(e) Two (2) petitions entitled <i>Eliodoro Q. Perez v. Adelita Perez </i> for declaration of nullity of marriage were filed.&nbsp; The first petition was filed on July 17, 2001 and docketed as CV No. 328-0-2001.&nbsp; In an Order dated October 28, 2003, the Motion to Dismiss dated September 25, 2003 filed by the plaintiff was granted, considering that no counterclaim was pleaded by the defendant in her answer and there was no opposition interposed by the public prosecutor.&nbsp; The case was considered dismissed <b>with prejudice</b>.&nbsp; However, a second petition was filed on February 01, 2005 docketed as CV No. 44-0-05 involving the same parties and also for declaration of nullity of marriage.&nbsp; The petition was granted in a Decision dated June 15, 2005, wherein the marriage was declared null and void <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp; Entry of Judgment was effected on July 11, 2005 without proof of receipt of the decision by the OSG.&nbsp; There was a rumor circulating within the courts that petitioner in these cases sponsored the family vacation of Judge Dilag in the US worth US$6,000.00.&nbsp; The audit team also noted the speed in the disposition of this case, having been filed only on February 01, 2005 and decided on July 15, 2005.<br><br>(f) In <i>Aurea Rowena Cayabyab v. Carlo Cayabyab, </i>CV No. 125-0-05, an action for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, the petition was granted in a Decision dated February 7, 2006, and a Certificate of Finality was issued on March 01, 2006 by Clerk of Court VI John V. Aquino of the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC) based on the registry return card with a stamped receipt by the OSG of the subject decision.&nbsp; Subsequently, the OSG filed a Manifestation and Motion dated March 21, 2006 to Recall Certificate of Finality dated March 01, 2006, asserting that the OSG was never furnished with a copy of the decision.&nbsp; In an Order dated March 21, 2006, the Certificate of Finality issued on March 1, 2006 was recalled, and the OSG was furnished with a copy of the decision. During a conference with the audit team, Judge Dilag relayed to the Team Leader that he had his own investigation on the matter, and that he found out that the fake registry return card attached to the records was the wrongdoing of Pascua.&nbsp; Consequently, he asked Pascua to resign in order to preserve the integrity of the Court. Pascua resigned per a letter dated May 11, 2006 effective May 16, 2006 for personal reasons.<br><br>(g) In a petition for adoption filed by the spouses Angelito D. Roldan and Yolanda Roldan, a similarly fake registry return card purportedly showing receipt of the subject decision by the OSG was found in the case records.<br><br>(h) Entry of Judgment was made in the following cases despite absence of proof that the OSG received copies of the decisions:<br><blockquote><table ¬†="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%">i) </td> <td width="95%">CV Case No. 321-0-03 (<i>Edwin Santos v.

It was also recommended that the resolution of the issue of the resignation of respondent Pascua be deferred and subjected to the outcome of the investigation by the Investigating Justice. The OCA adopted the recommendations of the judicial audit team.&nbsp; In a <i>Resolution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated August 1, 2006, this Court approved the recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>These cases were then assigned to Associate Justice Ramon R.

Teresita A.

Angel Lopez</i>, <i>Lourdes Sotto v. Cresencio Diwa</i>,<i> Joyce Moreno v. Alvin Moreno</i>,<i> Eliodoro Perez v. Adelita Perez</i> and<i> Aurea Rowena Cayabyab v.

Cresencio Diwa</i>, the decision rendered by Judge Dilag was allegedly done with undue haste.&nbsp; Judge Dilag required the parties to file their respective memoranda within a certain period, but he then decided the case without waiting for those memoranda or even before the lapse of the period to file said memoranda.<br><br>In <i>Joyce Moreno v. Alvin Moreno</i>, the final ruling issued by Judge Dilag was allegedly based on a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, even if the said evidence was not attached to the motion, in violation of Section 2 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Moreover, the purported newly discovered evidence consisted of a psychological report of a psychiatrist, which should had been presented before or during the trial proceedings and not after the case had been dismissed.&nbsp; In any event, the entry of judgment of the final ruling was made without furnishing the OSG a copy thereof.<br><br>In <i>Eliodoro Perez v. Adelita Perez</i>, Judge Dilag was allegedly grossly ignorant of basic legal procedures, particularly of Section 2 of Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, because, despite the fact that the first petition filed had been "dismissed with prejudice" at the instance of the plaintiff, the second petition filed was subsequently granted.&nbsp; Moreover, the case was decided even before the submission of a report on the existence of collusion between the parties as required by Section 9 of the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages.<br><br>In <i>Cayabyab v. Cayabyab</i>, a fake registry return card showing receipt by the OSG of the decision rendered therein was exposed; Pascua was allegedly responsible therefore and allegedly asked by Judge Dilag to resign because of such incident.<br><br>In the <i>Angelito Roldan and Yolanda Roldan</i> adoption case, the records of this case and those of the OSG conflicted as to the date of receipt by the latter of the decision rendered therein, which resulted in a premature entry of judgment on the said decision.<br><br>Finally, in <i>Dinoso v. Corpuz</i>, the decision rendered by Judge Dilag showed receipt by the OSG and an entry of judgment that had been made but the records of the OSG revealed that it had no records of the case.<br><br><b>Rizalina Tiongson</b> was the Chief Administrative Officer of the Docket Division of the OSG.&nbsp; Contrary to the earlier findings of the judicial audit team, she attested to the fact of receipt by the OSG of copies of the decision rendered in the following cases:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1) <i>Lourdes Sotto v.

Corpuz</i>.&nbsp; The Investigating Justice also found Pascua guilty of the administrative charges of graft and corruption.<br><br>The Investigating Justice further recommended that the matter raised by the OCA against Atty. Lourdes I. de Dios be referred to the Office of the Bar Confidant for appropriate action.<br><br>The exhaustive evaluation of evidence and findings of fact by the Investigating Justice are quoted hereunder:<br><blockquote><b>A.M. No. RTJ-06-2014</b><br><br><b>A. Respondent Judge Renato J. Dilag</b><br><br>This Investigating Justice finds that there is <b>no sufficient, clear and convincing evidence to hold respondent Judge administratively liable for graft and corruption</b>.&nbsp; Jurisprudence dictates that the ground for the removal of a judicial officer must be established beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The general rules regarding the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials apply to charges of misconduct in office, willful neglect, corruption or incompetence.<br><br>In the instant case, there is no clear and convincing evidence that indeed respondent Judge received money from litigants to obtain favorable decisions.&nbsp; The testimonies of Belen Trapane and Aurea Rowena Cayabyab, stating to the effect that they each paid P30,000.00 to respondents, through respondent Pascua, cannot be given due weight against respondent Judge for being hearsay evidence.&nbsp; By the same token, the rumors relative to the alleged acceptance of money in exchange for a favorable decision remain as such and cannot be admitted as evidence, let alone given due evidentiary weight.&nbsp; Corollary, private complainant Suarez fell short of the required degree of proof needed in an administrative charge of graft and corruption.<br><br>Respondent Judge, however, should be made accountable for <b>gross misconduct</b> constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Sections 1 and 2 of Canon 2; Section 2 of Canon 3; and, Section 1 of Canon 4, of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary which provide:<br><br>Canon 2. Integrity is essential not only to the proper discharge of the judicial office but also to the personal demeanor of judges.<br><blockquote>Section 1. Judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer.<br><br>Section 2. The behavior and conduct of judges must reaffirm the people's faith in the integrity of the judiciary.&nbsp; Justice must not merely be done but must also be seen to be done.<br></blockquote>Canon 3. Impartiality is essential to the proper discharge of the judicial office. It applies not only to the decision itself but also to the process by which the decision to made.<br><blockquote>Section 2. Judges shall ensure that his or her conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances the confidence of the public, the legal profession and litigants in the impartiality of the judge and the judiciary.<br></blockquote>Canon 4. Propriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of all the activities of a judge.<br><blockquote>Section 1. Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety of a judge.<br></blockquote>This finds support in the case of Kaw vs. Judge Osorio [A.M. No. RTJ-03-1801, March 23, 2004], where the Supreme Court, though dismissing the charges of extortion and graft and corruption against respondent judge therein, nevertheless, held him administratively liable for violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>In the case at bench, the existence of the two (2) sets of conflicting decisions in the Pancho, Tomboc and Del Rosario cases, respectively, though speculative, absent clear evidence that respondent Judge received monetary considerations, the same, however, from a reasonable point of view, would seriously arouse the suspicion of a reasonable mind that something is wrong.&nbsp; In other words, while not conclusively and clearly proving the charge of graft and corruption, the same casts a cloud of suspicion upon the integrity, impartiality and propriety of which respondent Judge is expected to possess and manifest.&nbsp; These requirements are concepts of the mind which can only be manifested through actuations of a magistrate.&nbsp; Thus, as explicitly worded in the New Code of Judicial Conduct, a judge must not merely possess these requirements but he must be also be seen and perceived to be such. The judiciary is the bastion of justice, fairness and equity.&nbsp; Certainly, it cannot afford to have erring magistrates who will only tarnish its image rather than maintain and preserve the same.<br><br>Contrary to respondent Judge's protestation and vehement denial, the evidence on record substantially proves that the three (3) dismissed Decisions dated March 14, 2005, April 29, 2005, and July 27, 2005 are, indeed, genuine decisions bearing respondent Judge's signature.&nbsp; Section 22, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides that:<br><blockquote>Section 22. How genuineness of handwriting proved. - The handwriting of a person may be proved by any witness who believes it to be the handwriting of such person because he has seen the person write, or has seen the writing purporting to be his upon which the witness has acted or been charged, and has thus acquired knowledge of the handwriting of such person.&nbsp; Evidence respecting the handwriting of such person may also be given by a comparison, made by the witness or the court, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the judge.<br></blockquote>In the case at bench, a comparison of and closer look at the several documents admittedly bearing the signature of respondent Judge sufficiently show that indeed the signature in the three (3) dismissed Decisions were his.&nbsp; Furthermore, three (3) court personnel of respondent Judge, who are familiar with his signature, testified that the signature in the dismissed Decision dated July 27, 2005 in the Del Rosario case belongs to respondent Judge.<br><br>By the same token, respondent Judge cannot raise as an excuse that the three (3) dismissed decisions were never promulgated, nor received by the parties and their clients. It is sufficient that it was proven to genuinely exist and that they could create the suspicion of irregularity. It also bears stressing that respondent Judge cannot wash his hands that he had no participation in the preparation of the Monthly Report to which the dismissed Decision dated July 27, 2004 in the Del Rosario case was attached.&nbsp; Need it be pointed out that he declared under oath the truth and correctness of the information in the report.&nbsp; He cannot also put the blame for the error in the Monthly Report to his staff. He cannot use, as a shield, the negligence or malfeasance of court employees for his failure to perform his duties.&nbsp; As an administrator of the court, respondent Judge is directly responsible for the discharge of his official function and the administrative management thereof. He is called upon to supervise court personnel to ensure prompt and efficient dispatch of the court's business for a speedy administration of justice.&nbsp; This may be gleaned from Rule 3.08 and 3.09, Canon 3, Code of Judicial Conduct which provide:<br><blockquote>Rule 3.08. A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in court management, and facilitate the performance of the administrative functions of other judges and court personnel.<br><br>Rule 3.09. A Judge should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all time the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<br></blockquote>Worthy of stressing is the applicability by analogy of People vs. Elpedes [1 SCRA 1344] to the case at bench.&nbsp; In the said case, the Supreme Court ratiocinated that where the judge signed two (2) conflicting decisions on the same day, one of conviction and another of acquittal, the losing party could not be blamed for bringing an administrative action against the judge and that the unpromulgated decision of conviction is relevant evidence against the judge.&nbsp; The pertinent portions of the decision read:<br><blockquote>... [I]t is unheard of, verging on the suspicions, that on the same day should sign two decisions, one of conviction and one of acquittal, and on extremely irreconcilable terms.&nbsp; That is what happened in the Elpedes incident. Therefore, counsel for the losing party (A√±osa) could not be blamed for implying something wrong and resorting to this Court against Judge Benitez, and enclosing in support of his accusation, a copy of the unpromulgated decision.<br><center><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>The unpromulgated decision was relevant evidence against the judge in the administrative case which the Supreme Court had given due course.<br></blockquote><b>B. Court Stenographer III Concepcion A. Pascua</b><br><br>The undersigned Investigating Justice finds respondent Pascua guilty of graft and corruption.<br><br>Witnesses Belen Trapane and Aurea Rowena Cayabyab categorically and straightforwardly testified that they each paid the amount of P30,000.00 to respondent Pascua so as to facilitate a favorable outcome of their cases.&nbsp; The bare and flat denial of respondent Pascua cannot overcome the positive and straightforward testimony of Belen Trapane.&nbsp; It is well-settled that to find merit in denial, the same must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability.&nbsp; Likewise, the testimony of Aurea Rowena Cayabyab remains uncontroverted despite the opportunity to refute the same.&nbsp; It should be noted that during the latter part of the investigation, respondent Pascua did not anymore appear, nor can she be reached or contacted even by her own lawyers.&nbsp; Such disappearance is indicative of guilt.<br><br><b>C. Nilda Verginesa-Suarez</b><br><br>The counter-charges of respondent Judge against private complainant Suarez must be dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>The allegation of respondent Judge that private complainant falsified the three (3) dismissed Decisions dated March 14, 2005, April 29, 2005, and July 27, 2004, respectively, must fail.&nbsp; There is absolutely no proof advanced by respondent Judge that the three (3) dismissed Decisions were falsified.&nbsp; Respondent Judge should know that mere allegation, absent any proof, is not evidence. On the contrary, it was indubitably established by private complainant that the three dismissed decisions do exist and that they genuinely bear the signature of respondent judge.<br><br>The charge of failure to transcribe TSNs must also fail.&nbsp; Respondent Judge had not shown any clear proof that indeed private complainant failed to transcribe the TSNs of the cases that were assigned to her.&nbsp; It is elementary that he who alleges must prove the same.&nbsp; Be that as it may, private complainant has sufficiently established that she has already transcribed the TSNs of the cases that were assigned to her.<br><br>Finally, there is also no merit in the charge of AWOL from November 22, 2005 to December 12, 2005. Evidence on record shows that on November 21, 2005 and November 30, 2005, respectively, private complainant filed two (2) applications for leave for November 22 to 25 and 29 to 30, 2005 and December 1, 2, 5 to 9, and 12 to 16, 2005.&nbsp; Though these applications were initially disapproved by respondent Judge, the same, however, were already inconsequential since the Supreme Court, through the OCA, had already acted upon her applications for leave as four (4) days of vacation leave with pay from December 13 to 16, 2005 and fourteen (14) days of vacation leave with pay from November 22 to December 12, 2005, as evidenced by the Certification dated May 24, 2006 signed by Hermogena F. Bayani, SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer, Leave Division.<br><br><b>A.M. No. 06-07-415<br><br>Anent the OCA's charge of gross negligence, gross inefficiency, gross misconduct and/or gross ignorance of the law and procedure, this Investigating Justice finds respondent Judge guilty thereof.</b><br><br>Respondent Judge exhibited acts amounting to <b>gross ignorance of the law and procedure</b> in handling the cases cited in the Audit Report.<br><br>The grant of the Motion for New Trial in the Joyce Moreno vs. Alvin Moreno case was not proper because the psychological report and the affidavit of the psychiatrist who conducted the examination were not attached to the motion pursuant to 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of Section 2, Rule 37 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which requires that a motion for new trial based on newly-discovered evidence shall be supported by affidavits of witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given, or by duly authenticated documents which are proposed to be introduced in evidence.&nbsp; Likewise, the psychological report cannot be considered as newly discovered evidence shall be supported by affidavits of witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given, or by duly authenticated documents which are proposed to be introduced in evidence.&nbsp; Likewise, the psychological report cannot be considered as newly discovered evidence because it did not exist yet at the time of the trial as the psychological examination was conducted only after the case was initially dismissed.&nbsp; It is well-entrenched that newly-discovered evidence refers to evidence already existing prior or during the trial but which could not have been secured and presented during the trial despite reasonable diligence on the part of the litigant offering it or his counsel.<br><br>In the Eliodoro Perez vs. Adelita Perez case, respondent Judge was grossly ignorant when he erroneously took cognizance of the second petition for declaration of nullity of marriage on the ground of psychological incapacity filed by petitioner therein considering that he had already dismissed with prejudice the first petition involving the same parties, issues and causes of action with that of the first petition. Under Section 2, Rule 17 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, the dismissal of the complaint upon the motion of plaintiff is without prejudice unless otherwise specified in the order.&nbsp; Thus, the only instance when dismissal of an action under the rule is with prejudice is when the order itself so states.&nbsp; In the instant case, the Order dated October 28, 2003 dismissing the petition stated that the dismissal was with prejudice.&nbsp; Corollary, in accordance with elementary legal procedure, a dismissal with prejudice is an adjudication on the merits which would bar its refilling on the ground of res judicata.&nbsp; It must be stressed that respondent Judge's ignorance of the procedure was re-affirmed during this investigation when he was asked the reason for the qualification of the dismissal with prejudice, to which he answered that whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice, the parties can still re-file the case.<br><br>In the same Perez case, respondent Judge also disregarded basic law and procedure when he decided the case even before the submission of the City Prosecutor relative to the investigation to determine collusion between the parties as required under Section 9 of the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages.<br><br>A judge is the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence to uphold and maintain public confidence in the legal system.&nbsp; Thus, while he is expected to keep abreast of developments in law and jurisprudence, he is presumed to have more than a cursory knowledge of the rules of procedure. Not every error is indicative of ignorance, for if committed in good faith, no administrative sanction is imposed. Good faith, however, inheres only within the parameters of tolerable judgment.&nbsp; It does not apply where the issues are so simple and the applicable legal procedures evident and basic as to be beyond possible margins of error. In the case at bench, respondent Judge failed to follow basic legal procedures which are not excusable but renders him liable to administrative sanction for gross ignorance of the law and procedure.<br><br>Respondent judge argued that the insinuations of the OCA that malice and fraud attended the dispositions of these cases have not been sufficiently proven.&nbsp; The argument fails.&nbsp; In the case of <i>Ora vs. Judge Almajar</i> [A.M. No. MTJ-05-1599, October 14, 2005], the Supreme Court, while finding that there was no allegation that respondent judge therein was motivated by bad faith, malice or corruption, nevertheless, held him administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law.&nbsp; The pertinent portions of the decision read:<br><blockquote>Respondent judge is charged with gross ignorance of the law.&nbsp; However, to warrant a finding of gross ignorance of the law, the error must be so gross and patent as to produce an inference of bad faith.&nbsp; The acts complained of must not only be contrary to existing law and jurisprudence, but were also motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, and corruption.&nbsp; For to hold a judge administratively accountable for every erroneous order or decision he renders would be intolerable.<br><br>In the case at bar, there was no allegation whatsoever that respondent judge was motivated by bad faith, malice or corruption when he issued the premature warrant of arrest. Be that as it may, however, we hold him administratively liable for his unfamiliarity with the rules on the conduct of preliminary investigations.&nbsp; We have always exhorted judges to be conversant with basic legal norms and precepts as well as with statutes and procedural rules.&nbsp; They are expected to follow developments in the law and to apply them.&nbsp; Having accepted the exalted position of a judge, whereby he judges his fellowmen, the judge owes it to the public who depend on him, and to the dignity of the court he sits in, to be proficient in the law.&nbsp; Thus, the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to be faithful to the law and be the embodiment of professional competence.<br></blockquote>In his desperate bid to evade liability, respondent Judge reasoned out that since the OSG did not appeal, the same indicates the correctness of his decisions.&nbsp; The argument, however, has no persuasive effect. It bears stressing that in the instant case, no private rights are involved.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, however, is not proscribed from taking cognizance of the irregularities committed by judges and justices.&nbsp; The Court, through the OCA, has the power of judicial discipline over lower court justices, judges, and court personnel pursuant to paragraph C (1) of the Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 30-91.&nbsp; The findings, therefore, contained in the Audit Report and approved by the Supreme Court to be included in this investigation is merely an exercise of such power.<br><br>Finally, respondent Judge was <b>grossly negligent and inefficient</b> in failing to administer proper supervision over his staff when a fake registry return receipt was effected in the Cayabyab case and Entries of Judgement were effected in the Joyce Moreno vs. Alvin Moreno, Angelito and Yolanda Roldan and Dinoso vs. Corpuz cases without copies of the decisions thereof being furnished to the OSG.&nbsp; He tried to evade liability by declaring that these were no longer his tasks but those of his staff.&nbsp; This is a lame excuse which merits scant consideration since it is well-settled that a judge cannot use as a shield the malfeasance or negligence of his staff. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>We adopt the findings of fact and recommendations of the Investigating Justice with respect to the administrative sanctions to be imposed upon respondent Pascua, the dismissal of the counter-administrative charges against private complainant Suarez, and the action to be taken on the charge for illegal practice of law against Atty. Lourdes I. de Dios.&nbsp; However, we raise the administrative sanction to be imposed upon respondent Judge Dilag to the maximum penalty.<br><br>Judge Dilag is found guilty of serious charges falling under Section 8 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, namely, "gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct" in A.M. No. RTJ-06-2014 and "gross ignorance of the law or procedure," as well as "gross negligence or inefficiency" in A.M. No. 06-07-415-RTJ.&nbsp; Under Section 11(A) of the said rules, the imposable penalties for the commission of a serious charge are as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 11. Sanctions. - A. If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions may be imposed:<br><ol><li>Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations: Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br></li><li>Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br></li><li>A fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Considering that Judge Dilag had already been administratively sanctioned in <i>Ma. Teresa De Jesus v. Judge Renato J. Dilag</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> wherein he was fined in the amount of P30,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law, Judge Dilag's already grave offenses are further aggravated.&nbsp; Therefore, this Court imposes upon Judge Dilag the extreme administrative penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, excluding accrued leave benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>On the other hand, the administrative liability of Pascua for graft and corruption is classified as a grave offense sanctioned by Paragraph A (9) of Section 52, in relation with Section 58, Rule IV of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19-99 as follows:<br><blockquote>Par. A (9), Section 52. - Receiving for personal use of a fee, gift, or other valuable thing in the course of official duties or in connection therewith when such fee, gift or other valuable thing is given by any person in the hope or expectation of receiving a favor or better treatment than that accorded to other persons, or committing acts punishable under the anti-graft laws.&nbsp; 1<sup>st</sup> Offense - Dismissal.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>Section 58.&nbsp; Administrative Disabilities Inherent in Certain Penalties.<br><br>a. The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it that of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision.<br></blockquote>Thus, the Court imposes upon Pascua the penalty of dismissal from the service which carries the accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government service.&nbsp; The Court further agrees with the Investigating Justice that in view of the evidence on record, Pascua should be investigated for possible criminal liability for the same acts.<br><br>Finally, the Court approves the recommendation to refer the charge of illegal practice of law against Atty. Lourdes I. de Dios (raised by the OCA in its memorandum) to the Office of the Bar Confidant.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing, we hold as follows:<br><ol><li>Respondent Judge Renato J.
