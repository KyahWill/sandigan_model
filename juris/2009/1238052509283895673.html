Appellant was angered by her reply and said, "<i>Anong </i>Doser?" and thereafter pulled a kitchen knife from his right side and stabbed her on the stomach.&nbsp; When she tried to escape from the room, four-year-old Marvin rushed towards her. She then grabbed him and ran towards the gate.&nbsp; However, before reaching the gate, she fell down and appellant stabbed her right leg. The appellant then proceeded to stab Marvin, hitting the latter twice on the arm and twice on his left chest. Marvin died on 3 April 2000 as a result of these injuries. After stabbing Marvin, appellant returned back to the house, towards Raquel's two daughters Michelle and Melissa. When Raquel pleaded that the appellant spare her daughters' lives, he retorted: "<i>Ngayon pa, nagawa ko na.</i>"&nbsp; Melissa died because of the stab wounds that the appellant inflicted on her; while Michelle, who was able to hide under the <i>papag</i> merely sustained serious physical injuries.&nbsp; The appellant also attacked two-year-old Jeffer by striking him on the head with the screwdriver, but the latter managed to run to the house of Raquel's sister-in-law.&nbsp; Raquel got up and ran for help, but the appellant followed her.&nbsp; Their neighbor, Ronaldo Galvez, came to their rescue and tried to subdue the appellant.&nbsp; Raquel, thereafter, lost consciousness.&nbsp; She also relayed that she was later informed that a struggle ensued between appellant and Galvez.&nbsp; Appellant inflicted wounds on Galvez's upper left chest and arms, after which Galvez was able to hit appellant with a piece of wood, which rendered the latter unconscious. Raquel, Melissa, Marvin, Jeffer, Galvez and the appellant were taken to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Raquel also testified that she spent P15,000.00 for the casket of Melissa Indon, P27,000.00 for the burial expenses of Melissa Indon and Marvin Indon, and approximately P30,000.00 for the food served during their wake.&nbsp; She also stated that because of her stab wounds, she spent P90,000.00 for hospitalization expenses and medicines.&nbsp; However, the receipts were lost except those issued by Sagrada Familia Hospital and Bulacan Provincial Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Jeffer Indon, who was five years old at the time he testified, stated that the scar on his forehead was the result of the stab wound inflicted by Doser.&nbsp; However, on cross-examination, he admitted that he did not know who stabbed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Michelle Indon identified the appellant as the man who stabbed her mother, her brother Marvin and her sister Melissa.&nbsp; She testified that the appellant stabbed her in the back once.&nbsp; Thereafter, she hid under the <i>papag</i>.&nbsp; She related that she did not go to the hospital anymore, because a certain <i>Nanang</i> Ella had already seen to her stab wound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Dr. Jacinto Caluag stated under oath that he treated Raquel Indon for multiple stab wounds.&nbsp; He testified that he also assisted in the operation on Raquel to repair her liver and gallbladder, which were damaged.&nbsp; He also disclosed that Raquel would have gone into shock and died had she not been given medical attention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Police officers Asher Villegas and Rogelio Santos testified that they proceeded to the scene of the crime after the neighbors of the complainant reported the incident.&nbsp; When they arrived at the crime scene, appellant was already tied up.&nbsp; They took pictures of the victims, while the kitchen knife and the screwdriver allegedly used by the appellant were turned over to Police Officer Villegas.&nbsp; The complainants and the appellant were then brought to the hospital.&nbsp; They recorded the incident in the Police Blotter and prepared the statements of the witnesses.&nbsp; After the accused was treated for injuries, he was brought to the police station and detained.&nbsp; When asked why he committed the crime, accused denied knowledge of what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated 10 July 2003, the trial court ordered that Ronaldo Galvez's testimony during his direct examination be stricken off the records due to his absences on the days he was scheduled to be cross-examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The documentary evidence offered by the prosecution included the following: (1) the sketches of Raquel Indon's house, to prove that the light from the kitchen allowed her to identify the appellant, marked as Exhibits "A to A-6;" (2) the Death Certificate of Marvin Indon marked as Exhibit "D;" (3) the Medico-Legal Certificates of Raquel Indon, Marvin Indon, Jeffer Indon, and Ronaldo Galvez marked as Exhibits "E," "F," "H," and "L," respectively; (4) the Birth Certificates of Marvin Indon and Michelle Indon marked as Exhibits "B" and "N;" (5) pictures of Melissa Indon's lifeless body marked as Exhibits "G" and "O;" (6) Sworn Statements of Ronaldo Galvez and Michelle Indon marked as Exhibits "K" and "M;" (7) Statement of Account of the Medical Expenses incurred by Raquel Indon, issued by Sagrada Familia Hospital in the amount of P38,500.00, marked as Exhibit "I;" and (8) Statement of Account of the Medical Expenses incurred by Raquel Indon, issued by the Bulacan Provincial Hospital, in the amount of P7,843.00, marked as Exhibit "J."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In his defense, appellant testified that prior to the incident, he was in good terms with the Indon family and that he had no record of mental illness.&nbsp; However on 20 March 2000, he went to East Avenue Medical Center for a medical check-up, and he was advised to have an operation.&nbsp; He suffered from sleeplessness, lack of appetite, and nervousness.&nbsp; Occasionally, a voice would tell him to kill.&nbsp; He averred that when he regained his memory, one week had already passed since the incidents, and he was already detained. He only came to know of the incidents from his sister and his children who visited him.&nbsp; On cross-examination he admitted that when he regained his memory, he did not even ask the police officers why he was incarcerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Regienald Afroilan, a witness for the defense, also testified that appellant was first brought to the National Center for Mental Health (Center) in August 2004 for a psychiatric evaluation, psychological examination and final testing to determine if he could stand trial.&nbsp; Dr. Afroilan stated that based on his evaluation, appellant suffered from Schizophrenia, a mental disorder characterized by the presence of delusions and or hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, poor impulse control and low frustration tolerance.&nbsp; He could not find out when the appellant started to suffer this illness, but the symptoms of Schizophrenia which were manifested by the patient indicated that he suffered from the illness six months before the Center examined the appellant.&nbsp; On cross-examination, he clarified that the evaluation finding that appellant suffered from Schizophrenia covered the period when the appellant submitted himself to examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated 13 November 2006, the RTC decreed that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide in Criminal Cases No. 1496-M-00 and No. 1497-M-00, frustrated homicide in Criminal Cases No. 1499-M-00 and No. 1500-M-00, and attempted homicide in Criminal Cases No. 1498-M-00 and No. 1501-M-00.&nbsp; The RTC gave credence to the principal eyewitness, Raquel Indon, whose testimony was corroborated by Michelle Indon, regarding appellant's attack on 29 March 2000. The trial court found the appellant's defense of insanity unmeritorious, since what was presented was proof of appellant's mental disorder that existed five years after the incident, but not at the time the crimes were committed. The RTC also considered it crucial that appellant had the presence of mind to respond to Raquel Indon's pleas that her daughters be spared by saying, "<i>Ngayon pa, nagawa ko na.</i>"&nbsp; It also noted that based on the psychiatrist's findings, the appellant was competent to stand trial.&nbsp; However, the trial court declared that there were no qualifying circumstances to support the charges of Murder, Frustrated Murder or Attempted Murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive part of the Decision dated 13 November 2006 reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of:<br><br>a) In Crim. Case No. 1496-M-00, Homicide, for the death of Marvin G.

CR No. 30511, wherein he faulted the RTC for not taking note of the inconsistencies in Raquel Indon's testimony and for not giving due weight to his defense of insanity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In a Decision dated 30 April 2008, the appellate court adjudged that Raquel Indon's testimony was credible, and that the inconsistency pointed out by appellant—whether or not Raquel was standing up or lying down when appellant stabbed her legs—referred to minor details.&nbsp; Moreover, insanity exempts the accused only when the finding of mental disorder refers to appellant's state of mind immediately before or at the very moment of the commission of the crime.&nbsp; This was not the case when appellant was first medically examined more than four years after the commission of the crimes.&nbsp; Appellant's response to Raquel Indon's pleas also proved that his faculties of reasoning were unimpaired at the time of the attack against Raquel's children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals nevertheless modified the RTC's Decision dated 13 November 2006 and declared that the qualifying circumstance of treachery, which was alleged in the six Informations along with evident pre-meditation, was adequately proven by the prosecution. Raquel Indon, Michelle Indon, Melissa Indon, Marvin Indon, and Jeffer Indon were merely sleeping inside their bedroom and had not even given the slightest provocation when appellant attacked them without warning. Furthermore, the killing of Marvin Indon and Melissa Indon, both minors who could not be expected to defend themselves against an adult, was considered treacherous, and would sustain a conviction for murder.&nbsp; The penalties imposed were adjusted accordingly. Appellant's conviction for frustrated homicide in Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2000 was affirmed, since prosecution failed to prove appellant's treachery or evident premeditation in his assault against Rolando Galvez, who came to the scene of the crime to subdue the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also modified the trial court's award of damages. It reduced the civil indemnity of P75,000.00 awarded by the trial court, occasioned by the deaths of Marvin Indon and Melissa Indon, to P50,000.00 and awarded the heirs of each murder victim moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00.&nbsp; The awards for funeral expenses of P42,000.00 and food expenses of P30,000.00 were deleted by the appellate court for lack of sufficient evidence to support the same.&nbsp; The appellate court awarded Raquel Indon civil indemnity of P30,000.00 and moral damages of P25,000.00, but reduced the actual damages of P90,000.00 awarded by the RTC to P46,343.00, in accordance with the Statement of Accounts from Sagrada Familia Hospital and Bulacan Provincial Hospital.&nbsp; It affirmed the trial court's award for moral damages of P10,000.00 in favor of Michelle Indon and P10,000.00 in favor of Jeffer Indon.&nbsp; Moral damages of P25,000.00 were also awarded by the appellate court in favor of Ronaldo Galvez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the Decision dated 30 April 2008, the <i>fallo</i> reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision dated November 13, 2006 of the trial court is modified as follows:<br><br>1) In Criminal Case No. 1496-M-2000, accused-appellant Jesus Domingo is convicted of the crime of murder and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Marvin Indon the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.&nbsp; The trial court's award of funeral and food expenses of P42,000.00 and P30,000.00 respectively, are hereby deleted.<br><br>2) In Criminal Case No. 1497-M-2000, accused-appellant Jesus Domingo is convicted of the crime of murder and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Melissa Indon the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>3) In Criminal Case No. 1498-M-2000, accused-appellant Jose Domingo is convicted of the crime of attempted murder and is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i> maximum, as the minimum penalty, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as the maximum penalty and to pay Michelle Indon P10,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>4) In Criminal Case No. 1499-M-2000, accused-appellant Jose Domingo is convicted of the crime of frustrated homicide and is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of five (5) years of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum to eight (8) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum and to pay Ronaldo Galvez P25,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>5) In Criminal Case No. 1500-M-2000, accused-appellant Jose Domingo is convicted of the crime of frustrated murder and is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years of <i>prision mayor</i> maximum, as the minimum penalty, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, as the maximum penalty and to pay Raquel Indon the amount of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P46, 343.00 as actual damages and P25,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>6) In Criminal Case No. 1501-M-2000, accused-appellant Jose Domingo is convicted of the crime of attempted murder and is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i> maximum, as the minimum penalty, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as the maximum penalty and to pay Jefferson (sic) Indon P10,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition where the appellant reiterates the assignment of errors that were raised before the Court of Appeals, to wit:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIMES CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT; and<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>ASSUMING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT COMMITTED THE CRIMES CHARGED, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT EXEMPTING HIM FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN VIEW OF HIS INSANITY AT THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE SAME.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court affirms the judgment of conviction.<br><br>The testimony of the principal witness of the prosecution, Raquel Indon, is assailed by appellant for not being credible due to an inconsistency in her testimony and a lack of conformity with the experience of ordinary men.<br><br>Appellant refers to Raquel's testimony during cross-examination wherein she narrated that after the appellant entered her bedroom, she screamed.&nbsp; Her sister-in-law, who lived next door, responded by asking Raquel who her assailant was, and the latter identified the appellant.&nbsp; Appellant claims that the conversation between Raquel and her sister-in-law was contrary to the ordinary course of things, and that the initial reaction of people in such a situation would be to ask for help from other people in order to save those who are in danger.&nbsp; Secondly, Raquel also testified during cross-examination that the appellant stabbed the front of her legs when she fell down.&nbsp; It is also argued that the appellant could not have stabbed the front of her legs, since she would be lying on front of her legs when she fell down.<br><br>This Court finds no merit in these arguments. To begin with, there was nothing out of the ordinary as regards Raquel's testimony on these two matters.&nbsp; First, there was nothing unusual about the sister-in-law's query as to who was attacking Raquel.&nbsp; Considering that the exchange merely consisted of this question and the reply to it, it would not even be accurate to refer to it as a "conversation."&nbsp; Secondly, it was not impossible for the appellant to stab the front of Raquel's legs, had her legs been positioned sideways when she fell.&nbsp; But more importantly, these are peripheral details that do not affect the substantial aspects of the incident.&nbsp; Raquel clearly and positively testified that she was carrying her son Marvin when she rushed to the gate and fell down, and the appellant stabbed her legs and thereafter proceeded to stab Marvin who later died from the stab wounds.&nbsp; Her testimony was supported by the Medico-Legal Reports marked as Exhibits "E" and "F." Any inconsistencies in such peripheral details would not exculpate the appellant.<br><br>Appellant also asserts that he was insane or completely deprived of intelligence during the commission of the alleged crimes, and therefore should be exempted from criminal liability in accordance with Article 12, Chapter 2 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; However, this claim is not supported by evidence.<br><br>Appellant offers his uncorroborated testimony as the only proof that he was insane at the time he committed the crime. He testified that nine days before he committed the crime, he suffered from lack of appetite, sleeplessness, and anxiety.&nbsp; In addition, he allegedly heard voices ordering him to kill bad people.&nbsp; He claims that he does not remember anything that happened on 29 March 2000, when the crimes were committed, and that he was already detained when he became conscious of his surroundings.<br><br>The law presumes every man to be of sound mind.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, the law presumes that all acts are voluntary, and that it is improper to presume that acts are done unconsciously.&nbsp; Thus, a person accused of a crime who pleads the exempting circumstance of insanity has the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that he or she was insane immediately before or at the moment the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Insanity exists when there is a complete deprivation of intelligence while committing the act; <i>i.e</i>., when the accused is deprived of reason, he acts without the least discernment because there is a complete absence of power to discern, or there is total deprivation of freedom of the will.&nbsp; Mere abnormality of the mental faculties is not enough, especially if the offender has not lost consciousness of his acts. Insanity is evinced by a deranged and perverted condition of the mental faculties and is manifested in language and conduct.&nbsp; An insane person has no full and clear understanding of the nature and consequences of his or her acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that appellant's testimony is credible, his sleeplessness, lack of appetite, nervousness and his hearing imaginary voices, while suggestive of an abnormal mental condition, cannot be equated with a total deprivation of will or an absence of the power to discern.&nbsp; Mere abnormality of mental faculties will not exclude imputability.&nbsp; The popular conception of the word "crazy" is used to describe a person or an act unnatural or out of ordinary.&nbsp; Testimony that a person acted in a crazy or deranged manner days before the commission of the crime does not conclusively prove that he is legally insane and will not grant him or her absolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Raquel Indon's narration of the events presents evidence that is more revealing of appellant's mental state at the time the crime was committed.&nbsp; Appellant's reply to her pleas that her daughters' lives be spared, "<i>Ngayon pa, nagawa ko na,</i>" was a positive sign that he was aware of what he was doing, and that his reasoning faculties were unimpaired.<br><br>The trial court found the testimony of Raquel Indon more credible than that of the accused, and its findings were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It is settled that when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court.&nbsp; This Court does not generally disturb the findings of fact of the trial court because it is in a better position to examine real evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of witnesses while testifying on the stand.&nbsp; Unless there is a clear showing that it overlooked certain facts and circumstances that might alter the result of the case, the findings of fact made by the trial court will be respected and even accorded finality by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It is also remarkable that appellant's testimony is not supported by his family's or intimate friends' accounts of his purported insanity. Appellant testified that he had been suffering from symptoms of insanity nine days before the incident.&nbsp; Insanity may be shown by the surrounding circumstances fairly throwing light on the subject, such as evidence of the allegedly deranged person's general conduct and appearance, his conduct consistent with his previous character and habits, his irrational acts and beliefs, as well as his improvident bargains.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; It is difficult to believe that appellant's behavior, conduct and appearance, which would denote mental disturbance, escaped the notice of his family and friends.<br><br>Appellant draws attention to the results of the medical examination conducted by Dr. Regienald Afroilan in 2004, showing that he was suffering from Schizophrenia.&nbsp; It should be noted however that the examination was taken four years after the crimes were committed, and that Dr. Afroilan admitted that his findings did not include the mental state of petitioner four years before. The alleged insanity of an accused should relate to the period immediately before or at the very moment the felony is committed, not at any time thereafter.&nbsp; Medical findings of mental disorder, referring to a period after the time the crime was committed, will not exempt him from criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant emphasizes the fact that he was a friend of the Indon family and would not have committed such atrocities against them, unless he was totally deprived of reason.&nbsp; In <i>People v.
