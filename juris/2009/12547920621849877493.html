				<H3>SPOUSES HU CHUAN HAI AND LEONCIA LIM HU, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES RENATO UNICO AND MARIA AURORA J. UNICO, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On December 13, 1978, respondent spouses Renato and Maria Aurora J. Unico purchased a 800-sq. m. residential property covered by TCT No. 236631 in Fairview Park Village, Quezon City from spouses Manuel and Adoracion de los Santos. After fully paying the purchase price, respondents built a house on the land and resided there. Respondents, however, neither registered the sale in the Registry of Deeds nor declared the property in their names for purposes of taxation.  They also failed to pay realty taxes.<br><br>Due to respondents' tax delinquency, the property was sold at public auction on March 5, 1984 to petitioner spouses Hu Chuan Hai and Leoncia Lim Hu for P6,322.14.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> A year later, petitioners filed a petition for consolidation of ownership and issuance of new title (LRC Case No. Q-3458<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>)  in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 93 which was granted in a decision dated September 8, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Consequently, TCT No. 236631 was cancelled and TCT No. 359854 was issued in petitioners' names.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On December 19, 1986, respondents decided to pay realty taxes on the property for the first time but they were informed that it was already registered in the names of petitioners.<br><br>Respondents filed a complaint for annulment of sale and damages (Civil Case No. Q-50553) against petitioner spouses, spouses de los Santos, the City Treasurer of Quezon City and the Registrar of Deeds of Quezon City in the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 104 assailing the validity of the tax sale. They pointed out that the City Treasurer and the Registrar of Deeds sent the notice of tax sale and advertisement to the spouses de los Santos. Because they were never informed of the tax sale, they were deprived of their property without due process of law. Hence, the tax sale was void.<br><br>Petitioners, in their answer, insisted that they could not be prejudiced by respondents' failure to receive the notice of tax sale and advertisement.<br><br>In a decision dated May 9, 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the RTC found that the City Treasurer sent the notice of tax sale and advertisement to the spouses de los Santos instead of respondents who were the actual occupants of the property. Thus, it nullified the tax sale.<br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The CA, however, affirmed the RTC decision <i>in</i> <i>toto.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Hence, this recourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioners basically claim that the courts <i>a quo </i>erred in nullifying the March 5, 1984 tax sale as they could not be prejudiced by respondents' failure to declare the property in their names as required by Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of PD 464.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We grant the petition.<br><br>This case is similar to <i>Talusan v. Tayag.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In <i>Talusan</i>, we ruled that the decision of a land registration court in a petition for consolidation of ownership and registration precludes another action for annulment of auction sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Hence, the September 8, 1986 decision of the RTC Branch 93 in LRC Case No. Q-3458(86) barred the institution of Civil Case No. Q-50553. The RTC Branch 104 should have dismissed the latter on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br>With regard to determining to whom the notice of sale should have been sent, settled is the rule that, for purposes of real property taxation, the registered owner of the property is deemed the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Thus, in identifying the real delinquent taxpayer, a local treasurer cannot rely solely on the tax declaration but must verify with the Register of Deeds who the registered owner of the particular property is. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Respondents not only neglected to register the transfer of the property but also failed to declare the property in their names as required by Section 6 of PD 464. TCT No. 236631 issued to the spouses de los Santos was never cancelled and respondents never paid realty tax on the property since they acquired it. Thus, the spouses de los Santos remained the registered owners of the property in the Torrens title and tax declaration. Since the transfer of the property to respondents was never registered, the City Treasurer correctly sent notice of the tax sale and advertisement to the spouses de los Santos and the tax sale conducted in connection therewith was valid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED. </b>The December  27, 2000 decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
