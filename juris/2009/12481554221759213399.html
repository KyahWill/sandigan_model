				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the May 15, 2003 and October 6, 2003 resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 69510.<br><br>On January 12, 2001, an Information charging petitioner Nely T. Co with violation of Section 22(d) in relation to Section 28(e) of RA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 1161, as amended by RA 8282 (the Social Security Law of 1997)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was filed in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City, Branch 78, on the basis of the complaint of respondent spouses Jose and Mercedes Lim, who claimed to be petitioner's employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Petitioner was accused of failing to remit the compulsory contributions of respondent spouses to respondent Social Security System (SSS).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On July 3, 2001, petitioner filed a motion to quash the Information, arguing that the facts alleged in the Information did not constitute an offense because respondent spouses were not her employees.  In support of her motion, petitioner cited the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) on the issue of whether petitioner and respondent spouses had an employer-employee relationship with her or her company.<br><br>Prior to this, on March 27, 2000 (before the filing of the Information), respondent spouses had filed a labor case for illegal dismissal and nonpayment of overtime pay, holiday pay, holiday premium pay, service incentive leave and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay against Ever-Ready Phils., Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and its officers Joseph Thomas Co, William Co, Wilson Co and petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On September 29, 2000, labor arbiter (LA) Ernesto S. Dinopol rendered a decision dismissing the complaint for lack of merit. He held that respondent spouses had voluntarily left the company as shown by the deeds of release and quitclaim they executed.  They were also not entitled to their monetary claims under Article 82 of the Labor Code because they were field personnel of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, both parties appealed to the NLRC.  In a resolution dated May 31, 2001, it affirmed the decision of the LA and ruled that the respondent spouses, as sales representatives, were independent contractors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  Therefore, there was no employer-employee relationship between the parties.  This NLRC resolution attained finality on December 20, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding the NLRC ruling on the lack of employer-employee relationship between petitioner and respondent spouses, Judge Percival Mandap Lopez of the RTC denied petitioner's motion to quash (the Information charging violation of the SSS law) in a resolution dated November 12, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  On March 8, 2002, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition against Judge Lopez in the CA seeking to set aside the November 12, 2001 RTC resolution denying her motion to quash.<br><br>In a resolution dated January 13, 2003, the CA required petitioner to implead the People of the Philippines, SSS, Office of the Solicitor General and respondent spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  For petitioner's failure to comply with this order, the CA dismissed the petition on May 15, 2003 and denied reconsideration on October 6, 2003.  According to the CA, petitioner was bound by the negligence of her former counsel.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>For our resolution are the following issues: (1) whether petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the CA's dismissal of the petition was correctly denied and (2) whether petitioner's motion to quash should have been granted by the RTC.<br><br>On the first issue, petitioner argues that the CA should have granted her motion for reconsideration of the May 15, 2003 resolution.  She asserts that under Rule 37, Section 1 (a) of the Rules of Court, the abandonment of her case by her former counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> amounted to extrinsic fraud which was a meritorious ground.<br><br>Petitioner is incorrect.  Extrinsic fraud is a valid ground in a motion for new trial, not a motion for reconsideration:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.  <i>Grounds of and period for filing motion for new trial or reconsideration</i>. â€• Within the period for taking an appeal, the aggrieved party may move the trial court to set aside the judgment or final order and grant a <b>new trial</b> for one or more of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of said party:<br><br>(a) <b>Fraud</b>,  accident, mistake or excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against and by reason of which such aggrieved party has probably been impaired in his rights; or<br><br>(b) Newly discovered evidence, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial, and which if presented would probably alter the result.<br><br>Within the same period, the aggrieved party may also <b>move for reconsideration upon the grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner asserted no other ground aside from extrinsic fraud. Therefore, her motion was properly denied and we do not see the need to discuss the merits of such ground.<br><br>Nevertheless, in the interest of justice and to prevent undue delay in the disposition of this case, we tackle the next issue raised by petitioner despite the CA's proper dismissal of her petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  This was a criminal case and the possibility of a person being deprived unjustly of her liberty due to the procedural lapse of counsel was a strong and compelling reason to warrant suspension of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> For the rule-making power of this Court is coupled with the duty to protect and promote constitutional and substantive rights,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> not to defeat them. Thus, the rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, resulting in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be avoided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that the factual finding in the illegal dismissal case that respondent spouses were not her employees is binding in this case.  There being no employer-employee relationship, respondent spouses were not entitled to coverage under RA 1161, as amended, and petitioner should not be penalized under said law. We agree.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that the mandatory coverage of RA 1161, as amended, is premised on the existence of an employer-employee relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Applicable here is <i>Smith Bell &amp; Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Based on the records of the case at bar and those of G.R. No. L-44620, it is clear that the resolution of this Court dated 26 January 1977, rendered in G.R. No. L-44620 [illegal dismissal case], constitutes a bar to SSC Case No. 2453. We, therefore, find merit in the petition at bar.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx  xxx  xxx<br></div><br>It is true that in SSC Case No. 2453, private respondents sought to enforce their alleged right to compulsory coverage by the SSS on the main allegation that they are employees of petitioner company. On the other hand, in NLRC Case No. ROVII-153, private respondents, in order to support their position that they were illegally dismissed by petitioner company from their work, maintained that there was an employee-employer relationship existing between petitioner and private respondents at the time of such dismissal. In other words, <b>the issue common to both cases is whether there existed an employee-employer relationship at the time of the occurrence of the acts complained of both in SSC Case No. 2453 and NLRC Case No. RO-VII-153</b>.<br><br>It is well to note that the said <b>issue was adjudged with finality</b> in G.R. No. L-44620, through this Court's resolutions dated 26 January 1977 and 14 March 1977. The dismissal of the petition of the herein private respondents in G.R. No. L-44620, though contained in a minute resolution, was an adjudication on the merits of the case.<br><br><b>The present controversy, therefore, squarely falls under the umbrage of <i>res judicata</i>, particularly, under the rule on "conclusiveness of judgment."</b> Following this rule, as stated in <i>Bienvenida Machoca Arcadio vs. Carriaga, Jr.</i>, we hold that the judgment in G.R. No. L-44620 bars SSC Case No. 2453, as the relief sought in the latter case is inextricably related to the ruling in G.R. No. L-44620 to the effect that private respondents, are not employees of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The only difference is that the instant case is a criminal case whereas the case in <i>Smith Bell </i>was a civil case.  However, the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment also applies in criminal cases.  As we declared in <i>Constantino v. Sandiganbayan (First Division)</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Although the instant case involves a criminal charge whereas <i>Constantino</i> involved an administrative charge, still the findings in the latter case are binding herein because the same set of facts are the subject of both cases. What is decisive is that the issues already litigated in a final and executory judgment preclude -- by the principle of bar by prior judgment, an aspect of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, and even under the doctrine of "law of the case," -- the re-litigation of the same issue in another action.  It is well established that when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as it remains unreversed, it should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them.  The dictum therein laid down became the law of the case and what was once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision continues to be binding between the same parties as long as the facts on which the decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court. Hence, the binding effect and enforceability of that dictum can no longer be resurrected anew since such issue had already been resolved and finally laid to rest, if not by the principle of <i>res judicata</i>, at least by conclusiveness of judgment.<br><br>It may be true that the basis of administrative liability differs from criminal liability as the purpose of administrative proceedings on the one hand is mainly to protect the public service, based on the time-honored principle that a public office is a public trust. On the other hand, the purpose of the criminal prosecution is the punishment of crime.  However, the dismissal by the Court of the administrative case against <i>Constantino</i> based on the same subject matter and after examining the same crucial evidence operates to dismiss the criminal case because of the precise finding that the act from which liability is anchored does not exist.<br><br>It is likewise clear from the decision of the Court in <i>Constantino</i> that the level of proof required in administrative cases which is substantial evidence was not mustered therein. The same evidence is again before the Court in connection with the appeal in the criminal case. Ineluctably, the same evidence cannot with greater reason satisfy the higher standard in criminal cases such as the present case which is evidence beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>We are mindful that in <i>Republic v. Asiapro Cooperative</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> we ruled that the question on the existence of an employer-employee relationship for the purpose of determining the coverage of the SSS law falls within the jurisdiction of the Social Security Commission (SSC) which is primarily charged with the duty of settling disputes under RA 1161, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  In that case, the SSS filed a petition in the SSC praying that Asiapro Cooperative (Asiapro) be directed to register as an employer, to report its owners-members as covered employees under the compulsory coverage of SSS and to remit the necessary contributions in accordance with the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Asiapro sought the dismissal of the petition alleging that no employer-employee relationship existed between it and its owners-members, thus SSC had no jurisdiction over it.  We held that, based on Section 5 of RA 8282,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> SSC had jurisdiction over the petition.<br><br><i>Republic v. Asiapro Cooperative, </i>however, is inapplicable here as this case does not concern the issue of jurisdiction of the SSC. Furthermore, the question of the existence of an employer-employee relationship was already disposed of with finality, albeit in the context of an illegal dismissal case in the NLRC.  There was no need for the RTC to make an independent finding because the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment had already set in.<br><br><blockquote>The reasons for establishing the principle of "conclusiveness of judgment" are founded on sound public policy, and to grant this petition would have the effect of unsettling this well-settled doctrine. It is allowable to reason back from a judgment to the basis on which it stands, upon the obvious principle that where a conclusion is indisputable, and could have been drawn only from certain premises, the premises are equally indisputable with the conclusion.  <b>When a fact has been once determined in the course of a judicial proceeding, and a final judgment has been rendered in accordance therewith, it cannot be again litigated between the same parties without virtually impeaching the correctness of the former decision, which, from motives of public policy, the law does not permit to be done</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><i>Res judicata</i> has two concepts. The first is bar by prior judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (b), and the second is conclusiveness of judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (c). Both concepts are founded on the principle of estoppel, and are based on the salutary public policy against unnecessary multiplicity of suits. Like the splitting of causes of action, <i>res judicata</i> is in pursuance of such policy. <b>Matters settled by a Court's final judgment should not be litigated upon or invoked again. Relitigation of issues already settled merely burdens the Courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier cases</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>To sum up, the final and executory NLRC decision (to the effect that respondent spouses were not the employees of petitioner) was binding on this criminal case for violation of RA 1161, as amended. Accordingly, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it refused to grant petitioner's motion to quash the Information. Simply said, any conviction for violation of the SSS law based on the erroneous premise of the existence of an employer-employee relationship would be a transgression of petitioner's constitutional rights.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
