Hence, as the foreclosure sale in this instance was intended to be held on <u>14 November 2000</u>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the said Circular took effect, there was a need for the Notice of Sale to be re-published and re-posted.<br><br>However, <u style="font-weight: bold;">prior to the effectivity of Circular No. 7-2002, there was neither any statute nor judicial pronouncement from the Hon. Supreme Court requiring republication and reposting of a Notice of Sale in the event foreclosure did not proceed on the date originally intended</u><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals, however, anchored its Decision [on] the case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Philippine National Bank vs. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc., 394 SCRA 405</span>, which was, however, promulgated by the Hon. Supreme Court on <u style="font-weight: bold;">27 December 2002</u> or more than two (2) years <i>after </i>the intended auction sale in the instant case on <u style="font-weight: bold;">14 November 2000</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original; italics supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The sale at public auction of the properties covered by the foreclosed mortgage in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> cited by petitioner took place in 1976, also prior to the effectivity on April 22, 2002 of this Court's Circular No. 7-2002.  The Court therein held that under Act No. 3135, as amended, republication as well as reposting of the notice of sale is required if the foreclosure does not proceed on the date <i>originally </i>intended.<br><br><blockquote>The principal object of a notice of sale in a foreclosure of mortgage is not so much to notify the mortgagor as to inform the public generally of the nature and condition of the property to be sold, and of the time, place, and terms of the sale.  Notices are given to secure bidders and prevent a sacrifice of the property.  Clearly, <u>the statutory requirements of posting and publication are mandated, not for the mortgagor's benefit, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">for the public or third persons</span></u>.  In fact, personal notice to the mortgagor in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not even necessary, unless stipulated.  As such, it is imbued with public policy considerations and any waiver thereon would be inconsistent with the intent and letter of Act No. 3135.<br><br>Moreover, statutory provisions governing publication of notice of mortgage foreclosure sales must be <u>strictly complied with</u> and slight deviations therefrom will invalidate the notice and render the sale at the very least voidable.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, in the recent case of <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Aguirre</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the foreclosure sale held more than two (2) months after the published date of sale was considered void for lack of republication. Similarly, in the instant case, <u>the lack of republication of the notice of the December 20, 1976 foreclosure sale renders it <span style="font-weight: bold;">void</span></u>.<br><br>The right of a bank to foreclose a mortgage upon the mortgagor's failure to pay his obligation must be exercised according to its clear mandate, and every requirement of the law must be complied with, lest the valid exercise of the right would end.  The exercise of a right ends when the right disappears, and it disappears when it is abused especially to the prejudice of others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner not having republished the notice of the finally rescheduled auction sale, its petition must fail.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">, Bersamin</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">**</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Abad, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 757 dated October 12, 2009.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 765 dated  October 21, 2009.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibits "1" - "2," records, pp. 16-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 20-21; Exhibit "3," id. at 22-24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 61-64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 65-66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibits "10"-"12," records, pp. 111-114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 1-15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 7-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 60-63, 121-122.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 146-149.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 178-179.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 181-187.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 214.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, pp. 2-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Arcangelita M.
