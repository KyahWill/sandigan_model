				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pending our action is the Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 16 November 2007 of Atty. Eden T. Candelaria (Atty. Candelaria), Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer of this Court, recommending the imposition of administrative penalties on 16 employees who committed habitual tardiness during the first semester of 2007, in accordance with Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991 (Policy on Absenteeism and Tardiness) and Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999 (Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service).<br><br>The present administrative matter stemmed from the referral by the Leave Division to the Complaints and Investigation Division of the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) of the list of employees who incurred tardiness 10 times or more in a month for the first semester (January to June) of 2007, for appropriate action.  Atty. Candelaria then required the employees in said list to explain within five days from notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against them. The names of the concerned employees and their respective explanations are reproduced below:<br><blockquote>A. Employees with previous penalties of habitual tardiness:<br><br>1. Ms. Maria Teresa P.

There are times when she suffers a severe pain on her left foot which gives her a hard time in getting up from bed.  She admitted, however, she incurred tardiness but without any intention to violate the said CSC Memorandum Circular.  She now begs for the kind indulgence and compassion of the Court for her predicament.<br><br>The Court <i>En Banc</i> in a Resolution dated 4 May 2001 in Re: Habitual Tardiness for the Year 1999 suspended Ms. Olipas for one month. She was again suspended for five days pursuant to the Court En Banc Resolution dated 16 March 2004 Re: Habitual Tardiness for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Semesters of 2003 for her second incursion of the same offense.<br><br>2.

Thus, she is deemed to have waived her right to comment.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 23 October 2001, the Court <i>En Banc</i> in Re: Habitual Tardiness for the First Semester of 2001, Ms. Azurin was sternly warned.<br><br>3.

Baniel apologized for the late compliance with the OCA's directive to explain.  He stated that through oversight, he was not able to comply in due time because all the while he thought that he had already complied but as he checked his files none has been filed.<br><br>As to the tardiness he incurred in the 1<sup>st</sup> semester of 2007 he explained that it was a balance of priorities between domestic troubles and family problems as against the rules being required of civil servants.  He admitted that to decide between priorities, the latter should prevail. He now asks for temperance and promises to persevere and sacrifice more as he approaches his eighteenth year of service to the Court.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 13 September 2006, the Court <i>En Banc</i> in Re: Habitual Tardiness for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Semester 2005, sternly warned Atty.

He said that such incursion was neither intentional nor ingrained with bad faith.  Having been employed only in July 2006 as co-terminus, he is still at a loss on the procedure on attendance in the government.  That due to some domestic problems that he dealt with during said period, his performance at work was somehow affected. Mr. Chua now begs for the kind consideration on his case so as not to prejudice his chance of being employed elsewhere in the future when his appointment expires.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 5 June 2007, the Court <i>En Banc</i> in Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness in the Second Semester of 2006, Mr. Chua was sternly warned.<br><br>5.

On 10 December 2006, his estranged wife left for Singapore to work.  Their three children, two of whom are already attending school, are now living with him since she left and they are all being taken care of by himself alone. He is considering the idea of getting a household help but finds it difficult to get one.  He now begs that any disciplinary action that may be imposed on him as a result of his being habitually tardy be accorded with utmost compassion for humanitarian reasons.<br><br>Mr. Sanchez was sternly warned pursuant to the Court <i>En Banc</i> Resolution dated 17 April 2001, Re: Habitual Tardiness for the 1<sup>st</sup> Semester of 2000.<br><br>B.

Having acquired hypertension last year, she finds it difficult to adjust and still is unable to handle the situations up to the earlier part of this year.  She added that she is not used to uncomfortable feelings brought about by attacks of hypertension which caused her to slow down especially in the morning.  This predicament, she said, was compounded by the unprecedented street diggings that caused so much traffic along the different routes used by public utility vehicles which she takes to reach the office.<br><br>Nonetheless, she admitted that she failed to monitor the number of times she came late.  She promised, however, that this would not happen again especially now that she has been able to cope with her present health condition and the routes she takes daily to reach the office.<br><br>2. Mr. Crisanto C.

Nonetheless, he seeks favorable consideration due to the personal and health problems he was dealing with at that time compounded by the demand in school where he enrolled for his post graduate studies.  He promised to be more circumspect in his actions despite this predicament.<br><br>3. Mr. Manolito V.

That during those times, he was the one who took care of all the children's needs as he could not afford to get a household help.  He is hoping for the kind consideration on his predicament.<br><br>4. Mr. Roderick I. Duero (Mr. Duero), Utility Worker II, Office of the Chief Attorney.<br><br>Mr. Roderick I.

Nonetheless, he pleads that any disciplinary action that may be imposed on him for the said infraction be accorded with leniency for humanitarian reasons.<br><br>5. Mr. Rodel A.

He explained that his tardiness was incurred due to some circumstances attendant in his family life.  That during those times, his wife was set to travel to Australia for one year and had a short period to prepare for her trip.  Most of the time, he had to do the errands as his wife could not afford to be absent nor late for work.<br><br>He added further that two days before his wife left for Australia, his brother came home from Dubai and stayed there for his month-long vacation. With his wife away, he had to run the household by himself and attend to the needs of their children.  Despite all of these, he said that he tried his best to wake up early and catch the Court of Appeals shuttle bus at 6:00 a.m.  At times that he missed the shuttle service, he is sure that on his way to the office he will be caught in terrible traffic that hindered him from coming to work on time.<br><br>6.

Lacandula-Rodriguez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and Mr. Sanchez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> submitted their manifestations.  As for the others who failed to file their manifestations within the given period, despite due notice, we deemed as waived<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> their submission of supplemental comment/pleadings.  Resultantly, the administrative matter was deemed submitted for decision based on the pleadings filed.<br><br>We agree in the findings of Atty. Candelaria in her Memorandum. We, however, make some modifications on the penalties.<br><br>Under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991, a public employee shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months during the year.<br><br>There is no question that the employees herein were habitually tardy, as defined in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991, for which they must be penalized for such administrative offense which seriously compromises efficiency and hampers public service.<br><br>By being habitually tardy, these employees have fallen short of the stringent standard of conduct demanded from everyone connected with the administration of justice. By reason of the nature and functions of their office, officials and employees of the Judiciary must be role models in the faithful observance of the constitutional canon that public office is a public trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the Government, and ultimately, the people who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Thus, to inspire public respect for the justice system, court officials and employees are at all times behooved to strictly observe official time. As punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Likewise, in <i>Basco v. Gregorio</i><sup>5</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>The exacting standards of ethics and morality imposed upon court employees and judges are reflective of the premium placed on the image of the court of justice, and that image is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat. It thus becomes the imperative and sacred duty of everyone charged with the dispensation of justice, from the judge to the lowliest clerk, to maintain the court's good name and standing as true temples of justice. Circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility, their conduct at all times must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above suspicion. Indeed, every employee of the Judiciary should be an example of integrity, probity, uprightness, honesty and diligence. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The employees involved in the administrative matter before us, however, beg our indulgence and consideration, giving various explanations for their habitual tardiness, <i>i.e.</i>, domestic problems and responsibilities, health reasons, traffic and road repairs, overtime work, and unfamiliarity with the rules on attendance in government.  As correctly found by Atty. Candelaria, none of the justifications provided by the employees for their habitual tardiness merit our consideration. We have ruled that moral obligations, performance of household chores, traffic problems, health conditions, and domestic and financial concerns are not sufficient reasons to excuse habitual tardiness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or to exempt the guilty employee from the imposition of the penalty, although these may be considered to mitigate their liability.<br><br>Under Section 52(C)(4), Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>habitual tardiness shall be penalized as follows:<br><blockquote>First Offense - Reprimand<br><br>Second Offense - Suspension for 1-30 days<br><br>Third Offense - Dismissal from the service</blockquote>Thus, we modify the penalties recommended by Atty. Candelaria to be imposed against the erring employees.<br><br>In the case of Ms. Olipas, while she should already be dismissed from the service, as this is the third time she is found guilty of habitual tardiness, we believe, for humanitarian considerations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as well as taking into account her (30) long years of service<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in this Court, that a suspension of only fifteen (15) days is in order.  Ms. Olipas, however, is finally warned that this Court will not hesitate to impose the extreme penalty of dismissal in case of a repetition of the same or similar act in the future.<br><br>Ms. Azurin, Atty. Baniel, Mr. Chua, and Mr. Sanchez are suspended from the service for five (5) days without pay since they have committed the offense of habitual tardiness for the second time.<br><br>As for Ms. Buzon, Mr. Carillo, Mr. De Guzman, Mr. Duero. Mr. Gombio, Mr. Iglesias, Atty. Lacandula-Rodriguez, Mr. Napolitano, Ms. Palafox, Ms. Pendon, and Mr. Yacat, found guilty of habitual tardiness for the first time, we cannot approve Atty. Candelaria's recommendation that they should only be warned.  According to the Civil Service rules earlier cited, the proper penalty for the first offense of habitual tardiness is reprimand.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as recommended by Atty. Candelaria, we find the concerned Supreme Court employees administratively liable for habitual tardiness and are penalized as follows:<br><ol><li>Ms. Maria Teresa P. Olipas is <b>SUSPENDED</b> for fifteen (15) days without pay, for being habitually tardy for the third time, with a <b>FINAL WARNING</b> that a repetition of the same shall be dealt with more severely;<br><br></li><li>Ms. Marivic C. Azurin, Atty. Winston R. Baniel, and Mr. Jovito V. Sanchez are <b>SUSPENDED FOR 5 DAYS</b>, for being habitually tardy for the second time, with a <b>FINAL WARNING</b> that a repetition of the same shall be dealt with more severely;<br><br></li><li>Mr. Allan Michael L. Chua is <b>SUSPENDED</b> for 5 days for being habitually tardy for the second time. However, as such administrative sanction can no longer be imposed since his appointment expired on 30 November 2007, let a copy of this Decision be entered into his personal file for record purposes; and<i></i><br><br></li><li>The following employees:  (a) Ms. Maria Victoria S.
