The essential facts, based on the records, are summarized below.<br><br>At around 5:15 a.m. of September 14, 2003, SPO4 Mignelito Orbeta (<i>SPO4 Orbeta</i>), the desk officer of Precinct 1, Makati City, received a phone call from a concerned citizen regarding an on-going "pot session" at 2725 D. Gomez St., <i>Barangay</i> Tejeros, Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The house number was specified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Acting on this information, SPO4 Orbeta dispatched PO2 Faustino De Guia (<i>PO2 De Guia</i>), PO2 Renato De Guzman, (<i>PO2 De Guzman</i>), PO2 Gonzalo Acnam, PO1 Donie Tidang (<i>PO1 Tidang</i>), and one Major Ancheta to D. Gomez St., <i>Barangay</i> Tejeros to verify the report. They were in uniform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> They reached their intended destination at 5:25 a.m. which they found to be a house - three by six (3 x 6) meters - located along D. Gomez St. They found the door of the house slightly open.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> PO2 De Guzman peeped inside and saw the petitioner and Villaflor sniffing smoke<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> - "<i>may sinisinghot sila na usok</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> - <i> </i>while sitting on a bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> PO2 De Guzman gave a "thumbs-up" sign to his companions who joined him in immediately rushing inside the house. Villaflor was holding a tooter at that point, which he threw away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The petitioner initially showed resistance when the police introduced themselves as law enforcers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They frisked the petitioner and Villafor in accordance with police procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and recovered from the petitioner's right pocket a rectangular plastic sachet containing white crystalline substances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The police likewise found on top of the bed aluminum foils (later confirmed to have traces of <i>shabu)</i>, three (3) plastic sachets containing traces of white crystalline substance, a pair of scissors, a disposable lighter, a bag with a plastic zipper, and an improvised tooter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The police handcuffed the petitioner and Villaflor, informed them of their rights and their violation of R.A. No. 9165, and brought them to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>At the police station, PO2 De Guzman marked the confiscated items,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and turned them and the suspects to SPO4 Arsenio Mangulabnan (<i>SPO4 Mangulabnan</i>). The latter prepared a request for laboratory examination;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> immediately after, the seized items were brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory for analysis and examination. Police Inspector Karen S. Palacios (<i>Police Inspector Palacios</i>), Forensic Chemical Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, conducted an examination on the specimens submitted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and found them to be positive for the presence of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Urine tests conducted on the petitioner and Villaflor also yielded a positive result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The petitioner presented a different version of the events and narrated that he and Villaflor were talking at around 11:47 p.m. of September 13, 2003 when four men in civilian clothes barged into his house on D. Gomez Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The door at that time was closed but not locked. These men ordered them to stand, and then handcuffed them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> PO2 De Guzman frisked him and found P100.00 in his pocket. PO1 Tidang then conducted a search on the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Afterwards, the police brought them to Precinct 1 where they were detained. At the police station, the police asked them whether they had money to give in exchange for their liberty (i.e. "<i>pang-areglo</i>"). The police initially demanded P20,000.00, but the petitioner and Villaflor answered that they did not have this amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The petitioner likewise denied that he and Villaflor were using drugs when the police entered his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On cross examination, he testified that Villaflor was a friend of his sister, Julie; and that the latter requested Villaflor to borrow money from their (his sister's and his) mother, whose house was located in a nearby street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The money was for the baptism of Julie's daughter scheduled for the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He did not anymore accompany Villaflor to his mother's house because her mother was already asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He declared that he did not personally know the persons who arrested them prior to their arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> He also added that PO2 De Guzman demanded P20,000.00 from him in exchange for his liberty.<br><br>The RTC, in its decision of February 8, 2006, convicted the petitioner and Villaflor of the crimes charged, and sentenced them, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><blockquote><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 03-3559, the accused GILBERT ZALAMEDA y SUMILE is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 11, Article II, R.A.

CR No. 30061.  The CA affirmed the RTC decision in its decision of March 18, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The petitioner moved to reconsider this decision, but the CA denied his motion in its resolution of July 15, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the present petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> petitioner alleges that the items confiscated from him were inadmissible, and that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of the illegal drug.<br><br>For the State, the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>) counters with the argument that the testimonies of PO2 De Guzman and PO2 De Guia were straightforward and consistent on material points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In addition, the warrantless arrest conducted by the police was valid as the petitioner and Villaflor were caught sniffing <i>shabu</i>. Since the arrest was lawful, the search made incidental to the arrest of the two accused was also lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The OSG further argues that the prosecution was able to show all the elements of the crimes charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The police also complied with the procedure in the custody and disposition of seized drugs under Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Finally, the OSG contends that the petitioner's bare denial constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot prevail over the categorical and positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>We DENY the petition for lack of merit.  </b>The records of the case records support the conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing <i>all</i> the elements necessary for conviction for the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><br><u><b>The prosecution duly established </b><br><b>the elements of the crimes charged<br><br></b></u><br>Illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11 of R.A. No. 9165 carries the following elements: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) the possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> On the other hand, the elements of illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Section 12 are: (1) possession or control by the accused of any equipment, apparatus or other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug into the body; and (2) such possession is not authorized by law. The evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements.<br><br>PO2 De Guzman, in his testimony of January 28, 2004, narrated the circumstances that led them to go to the house of the petitioner;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> how he saw the petitioner and Villaflor in the act of "sniffing smoke";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and how they arrested and searched the petitioner and seized evidence they discovered in plain view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>PO2 De Guzman duly and positively identified the petitioner as the person he saw sniffing <i>shabu</i> with Villaflor, and as the same person from whose right pocket he recovered a rectangular plastic sachet containing white crystalline substances. He also narrated how the police inadvertently found various drug apparatus and paraphernalia scattered on top of the petitioner's bed. Per Report No. D-1142-03S of Police Inspector Palacios, the plastic sachet recovered from the petitioner was examined and found to contain 0.03 gram of methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug. The two aluminum foil strips and three unsealed transparent plastic sachets recovered on top of the petitioner's bed also tested positive for the presence of <i>shabu</i>. Thus, the petitioner knowingly possessed <i>shabu</i> - a prohibited drug - and had under his control various drug paraphernalia without legal authority to do so, all in violation of Sections 11 and 12 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br>PO2 De Guzman's testimony also presented a complete picture of the police operation - from the time the desk officer received a tip regarding an ongoing pot session at the petitioner's house on D. Gomez Street; to the time the police went there and arrested the petitioner and Villaflor; until they returned to the police station and marked the confiscated items.  PO2 De Guia corroborated PO2 De Guzman's testimony on all material points. <i>The defense did not contest the admissibility of the seized items as evidence during trial. </i>Significantly, the petitioner failed to produce convincing proof that the prosecution witnesses had any malicious or ulterior motive when they testified, or that the evidence submitted by the prosecution had been tampered with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>PO2 De Guzman testified in a spontaneous, straightforward and categorical manner, proving all the elements of the crimes charged; he never wavered despite the grueling cross-examination by the defense counsel.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Petitioner's Defenses</b><br><br><b><i>a.  The Legality of the Petitioner's Arrest</i></b><br><br><br>The petitioner alleges that since the warrantless arrest conducted by the police was illegal, the items seized from him as a result of said arrest were inadmissible.<br><br>This argument totally lacks merit.<br><br>We stress at the outset that the petitioner failed to question the legality of his warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused may be estopped from assailing the legality of his arrest if he failed to move for the quashing of the Information against him before his arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court's acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made <i>before he enters his plea</i>; otherwise the objection is deemed waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrest conducted on the petitioner was valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5.  <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i>. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>b) When an offense has just been committed, and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and<br><br>c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</blockquote><br>Paragraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> to be valid, two requisites must concur: (<i>1</i>) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (<i>2</i>) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>After carefully evaluating the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested <i>in flagrante delicto</i>.<br><br>We emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the petitioner's house and to his arrest were triggered by a "tip" from a concerned citizen that a "pot session" was in progress at the petitioner's house located on D. Gomez Street. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the "time element" involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be for an extended period of time and it was then 5:15 a.m.).  In view of the urgency, SPO4 Orbeta immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place - 2725 D. Gomez Street - to verify the report.  At the place, the responding police officers verified from a slightly opened door and saw the petitioner and Villaflor "sniffing smoke" to use the words of PO2 De Guzman, or "<i>sumisinghot ng shabu</i>" as PO2 De Guia put it.  There was therefore <b>sufficient probable cause</b> for the police officers to believe that the petitioner and Villaflor were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the petitioner indeed possessed a prohibited drug and, together with Villaflor, was even using a prohibited drug and likewise illegally possessed drug paraphernalia,  contrary to law. When an accused is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.<br><br>In the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the petitioner and Villaflor were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in the petitioner's possession. The police, aside from seeing Villaflor throw away a tooter, also saw various drug paraphernalia scattered on top of the petitioner's bed. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search and seizure that yielded one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i>.  In this regard, Section 13, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 13. <i>Search Incident to Lawful Arrest</i>. - A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant.<br></blockquote><br>The seizure of the various drug paraphernalia is likewise beyond question. Under the plain view doctrine, objects falling in the "plain view" of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be presented as evidence. This doctrine applies when the following requisites concur: (a) the law enforcement officer in search of the evidence has a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area; (b) the discovery of the evidence in plain view is inadvertent; and (c) it is immediately apparent to the officer that the item he observes may be evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>All the foregoing requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at the petitioner's place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the petitioner and Villaflor as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the petitioner incident to his arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be <i>shabu</i>. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered on the bed. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.<br><br>The petitioner also harps on the fact that the police did not conduct a prior surveillance to verify the tipped information. We emphasize that the "tip" has reference to an ongoing pot session - an activity that does not usually last for an extended period. We have held that when time is of the essence, the police may dispense with the need for prior surveillance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Simply stated, a prior surveillance is not necessary where the police operatives are pressed for time to capture a suspected offender, as in this case. Thus, the absence of a surveillance did not undermine the validity of the petitioner's arrest.<br><br><b><i>b. </i></b><b><i>Denial and Extortion</i></b><br><br>The petitioner denied that he and Villaflor were caught sniffing <i>shabu</i>, and maintained that they were just talking to each other when the police arrived at his house at 11:47 p.m. of September 13, 2003. According to the petitioner, Villaflor was in his house because he (Villafor) had been requested by Julie (the petitioner's own sister) to borrow money from their mother, Milagros, who lives in a nearby street. The money was for the baptism of Julie's daughter, scheduled for the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The petitioner maintained that he did not bring Villaflor to Milagros' house as soon as he (Villaflor) arrived in the evening of September 13, 2003 because it was already late and Milagros was already asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> He maintained that he and Villaflor were arrested and detained on September 13, 2003 and not on September 14, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>As the lower courts did, we find the petitioner's story unworthy of belief.<br><br>We find the petitioner's claim that he was arrested and detained in the evening of September 13, 2003 to be self-serving and uncorroborated by any separate competent evidence. The petitioner, in fact, admitted that he has no proof of such detention in his testimony of March 31, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The justification that the petitioner offered for Villaflor's presence at his place, in the absence of any corroborating evidence, is likewise questionable.  Allegedly, Villaflor was asked by Julie to borrow from Milagros money to be used in a baptism to be held on the following day. No reason exists in the records explaining why Villaflor would proceed to the petitioner's house and stay there, given the urgency of his task and given that, by the petitioner's own admission, Milagros was expecting Villaflor that night. The questionable status of this basic component of the denial, to our mind, renders the whole denial itself questionable.  The latin maxim <i>"falsus in unus, falsus in omnibus"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> best explains our reason.<br><br>The petitioner's denial must likewise fail in light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witnesses. As we stated earlier, these witnesses testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. They did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.<br><br>Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP Crime Laboratory on the various drug and drug paraphernalia recovered from the petitioner and Villaflor which revealed that the following confiscated items tested positive for the presence of <i>shabu</i>: (a) one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet with marking "GSZ" containing 0.03 gram of white crystalline substance; (b) two aluminum foil strips both with markings "AHV," each containing white crystalline substance; and (c) three unsealed transparent plastic sachets all with markings "RSG" each containing white crystalline substance. In addition, the drug tests conducted on the petitioner and Villaflor both yielded <i>positive results</i>.<br><br>Petitioner's claim of extortion is similarly untenable. An allegation of frame-up and extortion by police officers is a common and standard defense in most dangerous drug cases. It is viewed by this Court with disfavor, for it can be easily concocted. To substantiate such a defense, the evidence must be clear and convincing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In the present case, the petitioner was unable to support his allegation of extortion with any other evidence. The petitioner also admitted that he did not know the policemen previous to the arrest, hence negating any improper motive on the part of the police. Such lack of dubious motive coupled with the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, as well as the findings of the trial court on the credibility of prosecution witnesses, should prevail over the petitioner's self-serving and uncorroborated extortion claim. It is also worth noting that the petitioner has not filed a single complaint against the police officers who allegedly attempted to extort money from him.<br><br><b><i>c. </i></b><b><i>Non-presentation of the Informant</i></b><br><br>The petitioner argues that the informant was never presented in court to corroborate the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>We do not find this argument convincing.<br><br>The settled rule is that the presentation of an informant in an illegal drugs case is not essential for conviction nor is it indispensable for a successful prosecution because his testimony would be merely corroborative and cumulative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Moreover, informants are usually not presented in court because of the need to hide their identities and preserve their invaluable service to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, we held in <i>People v.

Intelligence agents, due to the nature of their work, are often not called to testify in court so as not to reveal their identities publicly.  Once known, they could no longer be used again and, worse, may be the object of revenge by the criminals they implicate.  The prevailing doctrine is that their testimonies are not essential for conviction, nor are they indispensable to a successful prosecution.

Besides, as earlier stated, the petitioner did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during trial. <b>The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drug seized from the petitioner were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.</b><br><br>We also reject the petitioner's claim that the non-presentation of the forensic chemist was fatal to the prosecution's case. The petitioner never raised in issue before the trial court the non-presentation of Police Inspector Palacios. <b>In fact, the defense during the pre-trial agreed to dispense with her testimony.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></b></b> It must also be stressed that Police Inspector Palacios is a public officer, and her report carries the presumption of regularity. Besides, Section 44, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that entries in official records made in the performance of his duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specifically enjoined by law, are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts therein stated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Police Inspector Palacios' findings that Exhibits "F," "G," "H," "I," "I-1," and "I-2" were found positive for the presence of <i>shabu</i> are, therefore, conclusive in the absence of evidence proving the contrary.<br><br>Jurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply with Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible.  What is of utmost importance is the <i>preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items</i>, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised.  We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense.  All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court.  In <i>People v. Del Monte</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> we explained:<br><br><blockquote>We would like to add that non-compliance with Section 21 of said law, particularly the making of the inventory and the photographing of the drugs confiscated and/or seized, will not render the drugs inadmissible in evidence. Under Section 3 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court, evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is <i>not excluded by the law or these rules</i>.  For evidence to be inadmissible, there should be a law or rule which forbids its reception. If there is no such law or rule, the evidence must be admitted subject only to the evidentiary weight that will accorded it by the courts. x x x<br><br>We do not find any provision or statement in said law or in any rule that will bring about the non-admissibility of the confiscated and/or seized drugs due to non-compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165. The issue therefore, if there is non-compliance with said section, is not of admissibility, but of weight - evidentiary merit or probative value - to be given the evidence.  The weight to be given by the courts on said evidence depends on the circumstances obtaining in each case.</blockquote><br><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Proper Penalties</span><br><br></b><br>The petitioner was caught in possession of 0.03 gram of<i> shabu</i> or methamphetamine hydrochloride.
