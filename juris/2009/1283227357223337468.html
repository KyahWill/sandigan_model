CR-HC No. 00215. The Court of Appeals affirmed, with modification, the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Lapu-lapu City in Criminal Case No. 013324-L, finding appellant Ida Montesclaros (Ida) guilty as an accomplice in the commission of rape.<br><br>The present appeal stems from two criminal cases: (1) Criminal Case No. 013324-L charging Bartolome Tampus (Tampus) and Ida as conspirators in the rape of ABC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on April 1, 1995 at 4:30 p.m.; and (2) Criminal Case No. 013325-L charging Tampus of raping ABC on April 4, 1995 at 1:00 a.m.<br><br>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in each case reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>CRIM.

Ida worked as a waitress in Bayanihan Beer House in Mabini, Cebu City.&nbsp; On February 19, 1995, Ida and ABC started to rent a room in a house owned by Tampus, a barangay tanod. On April 1, 1995, about 4:30 p.m., ABC testified that she was in the house with Ida and Tampus<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> who were both drinking beer at that time. They forced her to drink beer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and after consuming three and one-half (3 1/2) glasses of beer, she became intoxicated and very sleepy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> While ABC was lying on the floor of their room, she overheard Tampus requesting her mother, Ida, that he be allowed to "remedyo "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or have sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant Ida agreed and instructed Tampus to leave as soon as he finished having sexual intercourse with ABC. Ida then went to work, leaving Tampus alone with ABC. ABC fell asleep and when she woke up, she noticed that the gaiter of her panties was loose and rolled down to her knees. She suffered pain in her head, thighs, buttocks, groin and vagina, and noticed that her panties and short pants were stained with blood which was coming from her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When her mother arrived home from work the following morning, she kept on crying but appellant Ida ignored her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>ABC testified that on April 4, 1995 around 1:00 a.m., she was left alone in the room since her mother was at work at the beer house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Tampus went inside their room and threatened to kill her if she would report the previous sexual assault to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He then forcibly removed her panties. ABC shouted but Tampus covered her mouth and again threatened to kill her if she shouted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; He undressed himself, spread ABC's legs, put saliva on his right hand and he applied this to her vagina; he then inserted his penis into ABC's vagina and made a push and pull movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> After consummating the sexual act, he left the house. When ABC told appellant Ida about the incident, the latter again ignored her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On May 4, 1995, after being maltreated by her mother, ABC sought the help of her aunt, Nellie Montesclaros (Nellie).&nbsp; She told Nellie about the rape and that her mother sold her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; ABC, together with Nellie and Norma Andales, a traffic enforcer, reported the incident of rape to the police. On May 9, 1995, Nestor A. Sator , M.D. (Dr. Sator), head of the Medico-Legal Branch of the Philippine National Crime Laboratory Services, Regional Unit 7, conducted a physical examination of ABC and issued a Medico-Legal Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Dr. Sator testified that the result of his examination of ABC revealed a deep healed laceration at the seven (7) o'clock position and a shallow healed laceration at the one (1) o'clock position on ABC's hymen.<br><br>On September 22, 1995, ABC filed two Complaints. She accused Tampus of taking advantage of her by having carnal knowledge of her, against her will, while she was intoxicated and sleeping on April 1, 1995 at 4:30 p.m. She declared in her Complaint that this was done in conspiracy with accused Ida who gave permission to Tampus to rape her.&nbsp; And again, she stated that on April 3, 1995, she was threatened with a wooden club by Tampus, who then succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, against her will.<br><br>Tampus denied raping ABC on April 1, 1995. He claimed that at 4:00 p.m. of April 1, 1995, he left the house to go to the public market of Lapu-lapu City. When he arrived home at 6:00 p.m., ABC and Ida were not there as they usually go to the beer house at 4:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He denied forcing ABC to drink beer. He also denied asking Ida to allow him to have sexual intercourse with ABC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant Ida also testified that she and ABC left for the beer house at 4:00 p.m. of April 1, 1995 and they came back at 6:00 a.m. the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; She said that she always brought her daughter to the beer house with her and there was never an instance when she left her daughter alone in the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> She denied forcing ABC to drink beer at 4:30 p.m. of April 1, 1995, and she denied giving permission to Tampus to have sexual intercourse with ABC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Tampus also denied raping ABC on April 4, 1995. He testified that he arrived at the Barangay Tanod Headquarters between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. of April 3, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and that his actual duty time shift was from midnight to 5:00 a.m. of April 4, 1995. Guillermo Berdin (Berdin), a defense witness, testified that on April 3, 1995, Tampus reported, for duty at the police outpost at 8:00 p.m. and left at 5:00 a.m. of April 4, 1995, as reflected in the attendance logbook.&nbsp; However, on cross-examination, Berdin could not tell whether the signature appearing on the logbook really belonged to Tampus. It was noted by the trial court that the handwriting used by Tampus in the logbook entry on April 2, 1995 is different from his handwriting appearing on April 3, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; It was also revealed that the house of Tampus is just 500 meters away or just a three-minute walk from the barangay tanod outpost and that the barangay tanod on duty could leave the outpost unnoticed or without permission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Agustos B. Costas, M.D.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Dr. Costas), the Head of the Department of Psychiatry of the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, issued a Medical Certification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which showed that appellant Ida was treated as an outpatient at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center Psychiatry Department from November 11, 1994 to January 12, 1995 and was provisionally diagnosed with Schizophrenia, paranoid type.<br><br>The trial court convicted Tampus of two counts of rape, as principal in Criminal Case No. 013324-L and Criminal Case No. 013325-L.&nbsp; Appellant Ida was found guilty as an accomplice in Criminal Case No. 013324-L.&nbsp; The trial court appreciated in Ida's favor the mitigating circumstance of illness which would diminish the exercise of will-power without depriving her of the consciousness of her acts, pursuant to Article 13(9) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision states, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds accused Bartolome Tampus GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of two counts of rape, as principals <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[sic]</span>, in Criminal Case No. 013324-L and Criminal Case No. 013325-L and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua in each of the aforementioned cases.<br><br>The Court also finds accused Ida Montesclaros GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT as an accomplice in Criminal Case No. 013324-L, and she is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years, and eight (8) months of Reclusion Temporal.<br><br>Both accused are hereby ordered, jointly and severally, to indemnify the offended party, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[ABC]</span>, the sum of P50,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 013324-L.<br><br>With costs against the accused. SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Pending resolution of the appeal before the Court of Appeals, accused Tampus died on November 16, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and his appeal was dismissed by the Third Division of this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, the appeal before the Court of Appeals dealt only with that of appellant Ida. The appellate court gave credence to the testimony of ABC and affirmed the trial court's decision with modification. It appreciated the mitigating circumstance of illness in favor of Ida, but found that Ida failed to prove that she was completely deprived of intelligence on April 1, 1995. On the basis of the medical report and the testimony of the attending physician, Ida's schizophrenia was determined by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals to have diminished the exercise of her will-power though it did not deprive her of the consciousness of her acts. The dispositive portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is <i><b>DISMISSED</b></i> for lack of merit. The assailed decision is<b> AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b>. Appellant Ida Montesclaros is guilty beyond reasonable doubt as accomplice in the commission of rape and hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty often (10) years and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> as maximum.&nbsp; Further, she is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay moral damages in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (Php 50,000.00) and exemplary damages in the amount of twenty-five thousand pesos (Php 25,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We find the findings of the lower courts to be well-taken.<br><br>The finding of guilt of Ida as an accomplice in the rape of ABC is dependent on proving the guilt of the principal accused. Upon examination of the records of the case, we agree with the ruling of the trial and appellate courts that the testimony of ABC is clear and straightforward, and is sufficient to conclude that Tampus is guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal in the rape of ABC, in Criminal Case No. 013324-L, as well as to convict appellant Ida as an accomplice in the same criminal case.<br><br>The findings of the trial courts carry great weight and respect and, generally, appellate courts will not overturn said findings unless the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which will alter the assailed decision or affect the result of the case.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</span></sup>&nbsp; The rule finds an even more stringent application where the said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The trial court has carefully scrutinized the testimony of complainant ABC and has given full faith and credence to her testimony. Both the trial and appellate courts found that the rape of ABC by Tampus on April 1, 1995 has been established beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Indeed, it is highly inconceivable for a young girl to impute the crime of rape, implicate her own mother in such a vile act, allow an examination of her private parts and subject herself to public trial if she has not been a victim of rape and was impelled to seek justice for the defilement of her person. Testimonies of child-victims are normally given full credit.<br><br>Tampus was positively identified by ABC as the person who had carnal knowledge of her against her will on April 1, 1995. The denial of Tampus cannot prevail over the positive and direct identification by the victim, ABC. Although ABC was asleep and unconscious at the time the sexual debasement was committed by Tampus, circumstantial evidence established beyond doubt that it is Tampus who raped ABC. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.41 In cases like the one at bar, the Court takes into consideration the events that transpired before and after the victim lost consciousness in order to establish the commission of the act of coitus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly determined, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The prosecution has clearly established by its evidence that accused Bartolome Tampus had carnal knowledge of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[ABC]</span> on April 1, 1995 under the circumstance set forth in Article 335 (2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended; that is, when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The Court cannot accept accused Bartolome Tampus' defense of denial and alibi. His denial pales in effect against the positive evidence given by <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[ABC]</span> that he ravished her <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[on]</span> two occasions.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>It is true that in the first incident on April 1, 1995, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[ABC]</span> did not see Tampus lie down with her. What she saw was the aftermath of her deflowering upon waking up. Nevertheless, the Court has taken note of the following circumstances: (1) The drinking session where the complainant was forced to drink beer by both accused; (2) The conversation between the two accused when accused Tampus requested accused Ida Montesclaros, and was granted by the latter, permission to have sexual intercourse with the complainant; (3) Accused Tampus and the complainant were the only persons left in the house when Ida Montesclaros went to work after acceding to the request of Tampus; (4) The bloodstained pants, the pain and blood in complainant's vagina and the pain in her head, groin and buttocks; (5) The threat made by accused Tampus on the complainant in the dawn of April 4, 1995 that he would kill her if she would tell about the previous incident on April 1, 1995; and (6) The second incident of rape that immediately ensued.&nbsp; These circumstances form a chain that points to accused Bartolome Tampus as the person who had carnal knowledge of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[ABC]</span> when she was asleep in an inebriated condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote><br>After establishing the guilt of Tampus as principal, the trial court then determined the guilt of Ida. Although Ida was charged as a conspirator, the trial court found her liable as an accomplice. The trial court ruled that her act of forcing or intimidating ABC to drink beer and then acceding to the request of co-accused Tampus to be allowed to have sexual intercourse with ABC did not prove their conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, it held that, "[undoubtedly, Ida Montesclaros participated in the commission of the crime by previous acts but her participation, not being indispensable, was not that of a principal. She is liable as an accomplice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In her appeal, appellant Ida argued that it is against human nature for a mother to allow her daughter to be raped. She maintained that there was no instance when she left ABC alone in the house. The Court of Appeals dismissed appellant Ida's appeal as it also gave credence to the testimony of ABC.<br><br>In her appeal brief filed before this Court, Ida raises the following assignment of errors:<br><br><blockquote><center style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED BARTOLOME TAMPUS OF THE CRIMES OF RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">II<br></center><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING IDA MONTESCLAROS AS ACCOMPLICE TO THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HER GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</span><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</span></span></sup></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We affirm the trial and appellate courts in ruling that Ida is liable as an accomplice in the rape of her daughter, ABC.<br><br>Accomplices are persons who, not being included in Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code, cooperate in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts.47 The following requisites must be proved in order that a person can be considered an accomplice:<br><br></span><blockquote><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(a) </span></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">community of design, i.e., knowing that criminal design of the principal by direct participation, he concurs with the latter in his purpose;</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(b)</span></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> he cooperates in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts; and,</span></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(c)</span></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> there must be a relation between the acts done by the principal and those attributed to the person charged as accomplice.</span><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</span></span></sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></span><br></blockquote><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The testimony of ABC establishes that Ida cooperated in the execution of the rape by Tampus when prior to the act of rape by Tampus, she forced ABC to drink beer and she agreed to Tampus' request for him to have sexual intercourse with ABC.

The testimony of ABC shows that there was community of design between Ida and Tampus to commit the rape of ABC. Ida had knowledge of and assented to Tampus' intention to have sexual intercourse with her daughter. She forced ABC to drink beer, and when ABC was already drunk, she left ABC alone with Tampus, with the knowledge and even with her express consent to Tampus' plan to have sexual intercourse with her daughter.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>It is settled jurisprudence that the previous acts of cooperation by the accomplice should not be indispensable to the commission of the crime; otherwise, she would be liable as a principal by indispensable cooperation. The evidence shows that the acts of cooperation by Ida are not indispensable to the commission of rape by Tampus. First, because it was both Ida and Tampus who forced ABC to drink beer, and second because Tampus already had the intention to have sexual intercourse with ABC and he could have consummated the act even without Ida's consent.<br><br>The acts of Ida are closely related to the eventual commission of rape by Tampus.

Unlike the cases cited above where the principal and accomplice were held solidarity liable for the entire amount of the civil indemnity or half of it, in <b>Nulla</b>, the court particularly determined the amount for which each shall respond.&nbsp; This is consistent with Article 109 and Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code, which require that the courts should determine the amount for which the principals, accomplices and accessories must respond to and upon specifying this amount, the principals are solidarity liable within their class for their quota, the accomplices are solidarity liable among themselves for their quota and the accessories are solidarity liable for their quota.

The sole accomplice was ordered to pay P101,000.00 which is roughly one-sixth (1/6) of the entire civil indemnity, while the two principals were ordered to pay the rest of the indemnity and damages amounting to P500,000.00.<br><br>The cases cited above demonstrate the <i>ad hoc</i> method by which the ratio of shares of the civil indemnity and damages among the principal, accomplice and accessory is determined. Though the responsibility to decide the respective shares of persons liable for a felony is left to the courts, this does not mean that this amount can be decided arbitrarily or upon conjecture. The power of the courts to grant indemnity and damages demands factual, legal and equitable justification, and cannot be left to speculation and caprice.<br><br>The entire amount of the civil indemnity, together with the moral and actual damages, should be apportioned among the persons who cooperated in the commission of the crime according to the degree of their liability, respective responsibilities and actual participation in the criminal act. Salvador Viada, an authority in criminal law, is of the opinion that there are no fixed rules which are applicable in all cases in order to determine the apportionment of civil liability among two or more persons civilly liable for a felony, either because there are different degrees of culpability of offenders, or because of the inequality of their financial capabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>&nbsp; On this note, he states in his commentaries on the 1870 Penal Code of Spain that the law should leave the determination of the amount of respective liabilities to the discretion of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> The courts have the competence to determine the exact participation of the principal, accomplice, and accessory in the commission of the crime relative to the other classes because they are able to directly consider the evidence presented and the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses.<br><br>We must stress, however, that the courts' discretion should not be untrammelled and must be guided by the principle behind differing liabilities for persons with varying roles in the commission of the crime. The person with greater participation in the commission of the crime should have a greater share in the civil liability than those who played a minor role in the crime or those who had no participation in the crime but merely profited from its effects. Each principal should shoulder a greater share in the total amount of indemnity and damages than every accomplice, and each accomplice should also be liable for a greater amount as against every accessory. Care should also be taken in considering the number of principals versus that of accomplices and accessories. If for instance, there are four principals and only one accomplice and the total of the civil indemnity and damages is P6,000.00, the court cannot assign two-thirds (2/3) of the indemnity and damages to the principals and one-third (1/3) to the accomplice. Even though the principals, as a class, have a greater share in the liability as against the accomplice-- since one-third (1/3) of P6,000.00 is P2,000.00, while two-thirds (2/3) of P6,000.00 is P4,000.00— when the civil liability of every person is computed, the share of the accomplice ends up to be greater than that of each principal. This is so because the two-thirds (2/3) share of the principals—or P4,000.00—is still divided among all the four principals, and thus every principal is liable for only P1,000.00.<br><br>In the case at bar, the trial court ruled that the accomplice is solidarity liable with the principal for the entire amount of the civil indemnity of P50,000.00. This is an erroneous apportionment of the civil indemnity.&nbsp; First, because it does not take into account the difference in the nature and degree of participation between the principal, Tampus, versus the accomplice, Ida.&nbsp; Ida's previous acts of cooperation include her acts of forcing ABC to drink beer and permitting Tampus to have sexual intercourse with her daughter.&nbsp; But even without these acts, Tampus could have still raped ABC.&nbsp; It was Tampus, the principal by direct participation, who should have the greater liability, not only in terms of criminal liability, but also with respect to civil liability.&nbsp; Second, Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code states that the apportionment should provide for a quota amount for every class for which members of such class are solidarity liable within their respective class, and they are only subsidiarily liable for the share of the other classes. The Revised Penal Code does not provide for solidary liability among the different classes, as was held by the trial court in the case at bar.<br><br>Thus, taking into consideration the difference in participation of the principal and accomplice, the principal, Tampus, should be liable for two-thirds (2/3) of the total amount of the civil indemnity and moral damages and appellant Ida should be ordered to pay one-third (1/3) of the amount. Civil indemnity for simple rape was correctly set.at P50,000.00 and moral damages at P50,000.00. The total amount of damages to be divided between Tampus and Ida is P100,000.00, where Tampus is liable for P66,666.67 (which is two-thirds <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2/3]</sup> of P100,000.00) and Ida is liable for P33,333.33 (which is one-third <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1/3]</span> of P100,000.00). This is broken down into civil indemnity of P16,666.67 and moral damages of P16,666.67.&nbsp; However, since the principal, Tampus, died while the case was pending in the Court of Appeals, his liability for civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> is extinguished by reason of his death before the final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>&nbsp; His share in the civil indemnity and damages cannot be passed over to the accomplice, Ida, because Tampus' share of the civil liability has been extinguished. And even if Tampus were alive upon the promulgation of this decision, Ida would only have been subsidiarily liable for his share of the civil indemnity of P66,666.67.&nbsp; However, since Tampus' civil liability <i>ex delicto</i> is extinguished, Ida's subsidiary liability with respect to this amount is also eliminated, following the principle that the accessory follows the principal. Tampus' obligation to pay P66,666.67 — his quota of the civil indemnity — is the principal obligation, for which Ida is only subsidiarily liable. Upon the extinguishment of the principal obligation, there is no longer any accessory obligation which could attach to it; thus, the subsidiary liability of Ida is also extinguished.<br><br>On the matter of exemplary damages, we find that exemplary damages were incorrectly awarded by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In criminal cases, exemplary damages are imposed on the offender as part of the civil liability when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Also known as "punitive" or "vindictive" damages, exemplary or corrective damages are intended to serve as a deterrent to serious wrongdoings, and as a vindication of undue sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Exemplary damages may be awarded only when one or more aggravating circumstances are alleged in the information and proved daring the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, no qualifying or aggravating circumstance was appreciated against Ida. Although, the minority of the victim coupled with the fact that the offender is the parent of the victim could have served to qualify the crime of rape, the presence of these concurring circumstances cannot justify the award of exemplary damages since the relationship of the offender, Ida, to the victim, ABC, was not alleged in the Information. " The minority of the rape victim and her relationship with the offender must both be alleged in the information and proved during the trial in order to be appreciated as an aggravating/qualifying circumstance. While the information in the instant case alleged that ABC was a minor during the incident, there was no allegation that Ida was her parent. Since the relationship between ABC and appellant was not duly established, the award of exemplary damages is not warranted.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, Visayas Station, dated September 29, 2006, in CA-G.R.
