Reyes in the consolidated cases of <i>Limkaichong v. Comelec, Villando v. Comelec, Biraogo v. Nograles and Limkaichong, </i>and <i>Paras v. Nograles, </i>docketed asG.R. Nos. 178831-32, 179240-41, 179120 and 179132-33, respectively, (Limkaichong case) which was used by this Court as a working basis for its deliberations.&nbsp; Since no one raised any further objections to the draft, the En Banc approved it.&nbsp; It having been already printed on Gilbert paper, albeit a number of Justices manifested that they were concurring "in the result," Justice Reyes immediately circulated the <i>ponencia</i> during the same session.<br><br>After the session and during lunch, Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno noted that seven of the 13 Justices (excluding Justice Reyes) concurred "in the result" with the <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Reyes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(hereafter Gilbert copy or Justice Reyes's </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">ponencia</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> or </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">ponencia</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> or unpromulgated </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">ponencia</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span>.&nbsp; Justices Minita Chico-Nazario and Teresita Leonardo-De Castro then informed the Chief Justice that they too wanted to concur only "in the result." Since nine Justices, not counting the Chief Justice, would concur only "in the result," the Justices unanimously decided to withhold the promulgation of the Gilbert copy. It was noted that if a majority concurred only "in the result," the <i>ponencia</i> would have no doctrinal value. More importantly, any decision ousting a sitting member of the House of Representatives should spell out clearly the legal basis relied upon by the majority for such extreme measure. Justice Antonio T. Carpio then volunteered to write his <i>Reflections </i>on Justice Reyes's <i>ponencia</i> for discussion in the following week's En Banc session.<br><br>During its session on July 22, 2008, the En Banc deliberated on Justice Carpio's <i>Reflections</i> which had in the meantime been circulated to the members of the Court<i>.</i> As a result, the En Banc unanimously decided to push through and set the date for holding oral arguments on the Limkaichong case on August 26, 2008.<br><br>On the request of Justice Reyes, however, the Limkaichong case was included in the agenda of July 29, 2008 where it was listed as Item No. 66.&nbsp; The decision to hold oral arguments remained, however.<br><br>On December 9, 2008, Louis C. Biraogo, petitioner in <i>Biraogo v. Nograles and Limkaichong, </i>G.R. No. 179120, held a press conference at the Barrio Fiesta Restaurant in Maria Orosa Street, Ermita, Manila, and circulated to the media an undated letter signed by him, together with what appeared to be a xerox copy of the unpromulgated <i>ponencia</i>.&nbsp; In his letter, Biraogo insinuated that the Court, at the instance of the Chief Justice and with the implied consent of the other Justices, unlawfully and with improper motives withheld the promulgation of the <i>ponencia</i>.<br><br>Noting that the unauthorized release of a copy of the unpromulgated <i>ponencia</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> infringed on the confidential internal deliberations of the Court and constituted contempt of court,</span> the Court, in a Resolution dated December 10, 2008, directed<br><ol type="1"><li>The creation of an Investigating Committee, chaired by Senior Associate Justice Leonardo A. Quisumbing, with Associate Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago, Chairperson, Third Division and Associate Justice Antonio T.

He instructed Manabat to rush to Justice Nachura's office because the latter was going out for lunch.&nbsp; After more than 30 minutes, Manabat returned with the Gilbert copy already signed by Justice Nachura, who was the last to sign.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Del Rosario then transmitted the Gilbert copy together with the <i>rollo</i>, temporary <i>rollos</i>, and diskettes to the OCJ pursuant to standard operating procedures for the promulgation of decisions. The documents were received by Ramon Gatdula on the same day at around 3:00 p.m.<br><br>The following day, on July 16, 2008, at around 4:00 p.m., Justice Reyes instructed him to retrieve the Gilbert copy and the accompanying documents and diskettes as he was told that the promulgation of the <i>ponencia </i>had been placed on hold.&nbsp; He brought the Gilbert copy to Justice Reyes who told him to keep it. He then placed the Gilbert copy in a sealed envelope and placed it inside his unlocked drawer and wrote a note in his logbook when he retrieved the Gilbert copy that its promulgation was on hold and would be called again on July 29, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br><br>The Gilbert copy was in his sole custody from July 16, 2008 until December 15, 2008 (when the investigating committee held its first hearing).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; He never opened the envelope from the day he sealed it on July 16, 2008 until December 10, 2008, when Justice Reyes told everybody in their office that the Gilbert copy had been photocopied and leaked.&nbsp; He did not have any news of any leakage before then. And he also did not photocopy the Gilbert copy.&nbsp; The seal placed on the envelope was still intact when he opened it on December 10, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the lawyers in their office knew that he kept original copies of drafts in his unlocked drawer, he believed that nobody in his office was interested in photocopying the Gilbert copy.&nbsp; He was solely responsible for keeping the Gilbert copy.&nbsp; He did not know any of the parties to the case and none of them ever called him.&nbsp; And he did not know what Gatdula did after receiving the Gilbert copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>The Limkaichong case was called again on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 29, 2008 as Item No. 66.&nbsp; The Office of Justice Reyes received the En Banc agenda for the said date on July 25, 2008.&nbsp; Upon receipt of the said En Banc agenda and the new item number, their office prepared a new cover page and attached it to the Gilbert copy.

Moncupa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup>&nbsp; the Court found the evidence against the clerk for malversation of public funds eloquently speaks of her criminal misdeed to justify the application of the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.&nbsp; The clerk admitted the shortage in the court funds in her custody and pleaded for time to pay the amount she had failed to account for.<br><br>In maintaining an earlier Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; the Court, in <i>In re Wenceslao Laureta</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; also declared that nothing more was needed to be said or proven and the necessity to conduct any further evidentiary hearing was obviated.&nbsp; In that case, the Court found that the letters and charges leveled against the Justices were, of themselves and by themselves, malicious and contemptuous, and undermined the independence of the judiciary.<br><br>Meanwhile, in <i>Emiliano Court Townhouses Homeowners Association v. Dioneda</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; it was held that it was reasonable to conclude that under the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the respondent committed an infringement of ethical standards by his act of receiving money as acceptance fee for legal services in a case and subsequently failing to render such service.&nbsp; The Court found the respondent liable for disloyalty to his client and inexcusable negligence in legal matters entrusted to him.<br><br>The Court, in <i>Dizon</i>, clarified the doctrine <i>of res ipsa loquitur</i>, viz:<br><blockquote>In these <i>res ipsa loquitur </i>resolutions, there was on the face of the assailed decisions, an inexplicable grave error bereft of any redeeming feature, a patent railroading of a case to bring about an unjust decision, or a manifestly deliberate intent to wreak an injustice against a hapless party. <u>The facts themselves, previously proven or admitted, were of such a character as to give rise to a <b>strong inference</b> that evil intent was present. Such intent, in short, was clearly deducible from what was already of record. The <i>res ipsa loquitur </i>doctrine does not except or dispense with the necessity of proving the facts on which the inference of evil intent is based. It merely expresses the clearly sound and reasonable conclusion that when such facts are admitted or are already shown by the record, and no credible explanation that would negative the strong inference of evil intent is forthcoming, no further hearing to establish them to support a judgment as to the culpability of a respondent is necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> (Underscoring and emphasis supplied.)</u><br></blockquote>The apparent toning down of the application of the <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> rule was further amplified in at least two cases.&nbsp; In<i> Louis Vuitton S.A. v. Villanueva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup>&nbsp; the Court ruled that the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> does not apply to cases of knowingly rendering a manifestly unjust judgment, and even if the doctrine is appreciable, complainant still has to present proof of malice or bad faith.<br><br>Then came <i>Fernandez v. Verzola</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; where it was held that failure to substantiate a claim of corruption and bribery and mere reliance on conjectures and suppositions cannot sustain an administrative complaint.&nbsp; In dismissing the complaint, the Court rejected as untenable the reasoning that the decision <span style="text-decoration: underline;">itself</span> is evidence of corruption per doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>.&nbsp; It upheld the rule that rendering an erroneous or baseless judgment, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in itself</span>, is not sufficient to justify the judge's dismissal from the service.<br><br>The supposed tempering of the principle of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> in <i>Dizon</i> only bolstered and solidified the application of the doctrine in cases not only of gross negligence but of serious misconduct as well, since it speaks of "<b>inference of evil intent</b>."<br><br>As explained in <i>Louis Vuitton,</i> the familiar rule in administrative cases is that <b>the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action, and that he cannot be subjected to civil, criminal or administrative liability for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as long as he acts in good faith.</span></b> The rule adds that the proper remedy is via judicial recourse and not through an administrative action.<br><br>It must be pointed out that <i>Louis Vuitton</i> involves gross ignorance of the law and/or knowingly rendering an unjust judgment.&nbsp; In cases of leakage or breach of confidentiality, however, the familiar rule obviously does not apply. While the injured party is the Court itself, there is no judicial remedy available to undo the disclosure.&nbsp; Moreover, the premature disclosure does not spring from the four corners of the assailed decision or resolution nor can it gleaned on the face of the issuance itself.&nbsp; Indeed, one need not dwell on the substance of the decision since that in itself is inherently insufficient.&nbsp; In unearthing the misdeed, it becomes not only desirable but also necessary to trace the attendant circumstances, apparent pattern and critical factors surrounding the entire scenario.<br><br>In <i>Macalintal v. Teh</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; the Court pronounced:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the inefficiency springs from a failure to consider so basic and elemental a rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his duties, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority. </span>In both instances, the judge's dismissal is in order. After all, faith in the administration of justice exists only if every party-litigant is assured that occupants of the bench cannot justly be accused of deficiency in their grasp of legal principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>The same norm equally applies in the breach of the basic and essential rule of confidentiality that, as described in one case, "[a]ll conclusions and judgments of the Court, be they e<i>n banc</i> or by Division, are arrived at only after deliberation [and c]ourt personnel are not in a position to know the voting in any case because all deliberations are held behind closed doors without any one of them being present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup> <br><br>As <i>Dizon</i> declared, the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> does not dispense with the necessity of proving the facts on which the inference of evil intent is based. It merely expresses that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absent a credible explanation,</span> it is clearly sound and reasonable to conclude a strong inference of evil intent on the basis of facts duly admitted or shown by the record.&nbsp; In fine, jurisprudence allows the reception of circumstantial evidence to prove not only gross negligence but also serious misconduct.<br><br><b><i>Justice Reyes is Likewise Liable for Violating his Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>For leaking a confidential internal document of the En Banc, the committee likewise finds Justice Reyes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">administratively liable for </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">GROSS MISCONDUCT</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> for violating his lawyer's oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility</span>, for which he may be disbarred or suspended per Section 27, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup>&nbsp; Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility requires a lawyer to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes.&nbsp; It is likewise provided in Rule 1.01 and 1.02 of the said canon that a lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct and that a lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here, the act of Justice Reyes not only violated the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Canons of Judicial Ethics, it also infringed on the internal deliberations of the Court and impeded and degraded the administration of justice.</span> The act is rendered all the more pernicious considering that it was committed by no less than a justice of the Supreme Court who was supposed to serve as example to the bench and bar.<br><br>That Justice Reyes was an impeachable officer when the investigation started is of no moment.&nbsp; The rule prohibiting the institution of disbarment proceedings against an impeachable officer who is required by the Constitution to be a member of the bar as a qualification in office applies only during his or her tenure and does not create immunity from liability for possibly criminal acts or for alleged violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct or other supposed violations. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[280]</sup>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once the said impeachable officer is no longer in office because of his removal, resignation, retirement or permanent disability, the Court may proceed against him or her and impose the corresponding sanctions for misconduct committed during his tenure,</span> pursuant to the Court's power of administrative supervision over members of the bar.&nbsp; <b>Provided that the requirements of due process are met</b>, the Court may penalize retired members of the Judiciary for misconduct committed during their incumbency.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Cañada v. Suerte</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[281]</sup>&nbsp; this Court ordered the disbarment of a retired judge for misconduct committed during his incumbency as a judge.<br><br><span lang="EN-PH">However, pernicious as Justice Reyes's infractions may have been, the committee finds the imposition of the supreme penalty of disbarment unwarranted. In the determination of the imposable disciplinary sanction against an erring lawyer, the Court takes into account the primary purpose of disciplinary proceedings, which is to protect the administration of justice by requiring that those who exercise this important function shall be competent, honorable, and reliable men in whom courts and clients may repose confidence.&nbsp; While the assessment of what sanction may be imposed is primarily addressed to the Court's sound discretion, the sanction should neither be arbitrary or despotic, nor motivated by personal animosity or prejudice. Rather, it should ever be controlled by the imperative need to scrupulously guard the purity and independence of the bar. Thus, the supreme penalty of disbarment is meted out only in clear cases of misconduct that seriously affect the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and member of the bar.&nbsp; Under the circumstances of this case, the committee finds the penalty of indefinite suspension from the practice of law sufficient and proper.<br><br><b><i>Liability of Atty.
