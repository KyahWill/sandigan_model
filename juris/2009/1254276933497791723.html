CV No. 67231 and CA-G.R. CV No. 67232, respectively, the appellate court <u>reversed and set aside</u> the decisions of the RTC and dismissed petitioner's applications.<br><br>In finding for the Republic in CA-G.R. CV No. 67231, the appellate court noted that petitioner's possession was short of the 30-year period of possession.<br><br><blockquote>[I]n the case at bench, it is beyond dispute that [petitioner] acquired the subject land through purchased [sic] from Spouses Edgardo and Jorgina Pagkalinawan on April 30, 1997.  In addition, [<b>petitioner's] predecessors-in-interests have been<u> in possession of the subject land only as early as 1967</u> as evidenced by the <i>Tax Declaration No. 1980</i> (Record, p. 92, Exhibit "R-8-B"); <i>Tax Declaration No. 1981</i> (Record, p.80, Exhibit "R-5-C") and <i>Tax Declaration No. 1982</i> (Record, p.84, Exhibit "R-7") issued in their names. </b> However, said possession of [petitioner's] predecessors-in-interest in 1967 <u>could not be used as the basis for the reckoning of the thirty (30) years period</u> [<i>sic</i>] in view of the <i>Certification</i> dated February 3, 1999 (Record, p. 101) issued by the CENR Office declaring that subject land is <b>"<i>within the Alienable or Disposable Land Per Land Classification Map. No. 3013 established under Project No. 20-A under FAO 4-1656 <u>on March 15, 1982</u></i>", </b>hence, the reckoning period should be March 15, 1982 and not 1967.<br><br>Applying March 15, 1982 as the date when the subject land was classified as alienable, it can be concluded that since [petitioner] filed this <i>Application</i> on September 7, 1998 (Record pp. 1-5) and her predecessors-in-interest have been <b><u>in possession of the subject land for only sixteen (16) years</u></b><u>, short of the thirty (30) years possession as required by P.D. [No.] 1529</u>, the application for registration of title should have been denied by the court a quo.  Moreover, <u>the number of years from 1967 to 1982 or fifteen (15) years to be exact cannot be credited or included in the computation of the thirty (30)[-]year period since <b>during that time (1967-1982) the subject land was still inalienable and belongs [sic] to [the] public domain</b></u>. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Whereas, in CA-G.R. CV No. 67232, the appellate court also noted that petitioner's possession was short of the 30-year period of possession.<br><br><blockquote>[I]n the case at bench, it is beyond dispute that [petitioner] acquired the subject land through purchased [sic] from Spouses Edgardo and Jorgina Pagkalinawan on April 30, 1997.  In addition, <b>[petitioner's] predecessors-in-interest have been <u>in possession of the subject land[s] only in 1994</u> as shown in the Tax Declaration No. 18582 (Record p.10, Annex "A") issued in their name (Spouses Pagkalinawan).</b>  <b>No other evidence was adduced by [petitioner] that her predecessors[-]in[-]interest have been in possession of the subject land earlier than 1994.</b> As such, the possession of [petitioner] and her predecessors[-]in[-]interest was <u>only for a period of 3 years</u> (from 1994-1997).  This falls short of the required 30 years period [<i>sic</i>] of possession in order to have the land registered and titled.<br><br>Assuming arguendo that [petitioner's] predecessors-in[-]interest have been in possession of the land for a period of 30 years, the application of said period is misplaced because per Certification dated February 3, 1999 (Record, p. 101) issued by the CENR Office, <b>the subject land was declared as "<i><u>within the Alienable or Disposable Land </u></i><i>Per Land Classification Map.

Deducting the year 1997 (date of purchase) from 1982 (the year the land was classified an [sic] alienable and disposable), [petitioner] have [<i>sic</i>] been <u>in possession of the subject land only for a period of 15 years</u></b>, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Her motions for reconsideration having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> petitioner lodged the present petitions for review.  By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of September 6, 2006, the Court consolidated both petitions which fault the appellate court as follow:<br><br><blockquote>I.  . . . IN FINDING THAT PETITIONER HAS NOT PERFORMED ALL THE CONDITIONS ESSENTIAL TO A GOVERNMENT GRANT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 48 (B) OF COMMONWEALTH ACT NO. 141, AS AMENDED, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PUBLIC LAND ACT, THAT IS, THE OPEN, CONTINUOUS, EXCLUSIVE AND NOTORIOUS POSSESSION AND OCCUPATION OF PUBLIC AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR AT LEAST THIRTY (30) YEARS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FILING OF HER APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OF TITLE, THUS, PETITIONER IS NOT ENTITLED TO A CONFIRMATION OF HER INCOMPLETE AND IMPERFECT TITLE OVER [THE] SUBJECT PROPERTY.<br><br>II.  . . .

She draws attention to the testimony of Destura as well as the documentary evidence pointing to the payment of real property taxes as far back as 1967 in the name of Trinidad Mercado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, posits that petitioner herself submitted evidence that proves fatal to her applications, citing the CENRO February 3, 1999 Certifications which reflect the failure to satisfy the requirements of the law regarding c<u>lassification of the lots as alienable and disposable land since June 12, 1945 or earlier</u>, or for 30 years or more at the time of the filing of the applications in 1998.<br><br>Respondent emphasizes that the lots were classified to be alienable and disposable only on March 15, 1982, hence, petitioner's possession or occupancy of the lots could only be reckoned from said date onwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Respondent further posits that, in any event, petitioner failed to prove that possession was continuous from 1941 up to the filing of the applications in 1998 as no factual evidence thereof was proffered, the testimony of Destura having only established the transfers of ownership over the lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The petitions fail.<br><br>The twin applications for registration were decided by the trial court on the basis of the <i>Public Land Act </i>"and/or" the <i>Property Registration Decree.  </i><br><br>The <i>Property Registration Decree</i> involves original registration through ordinary registration proceedings.  Under Section 14 (1) of said law, the requisites for the filing of an application for registration of title are:  that the property in question is alienable and disposable land of the public domain; that the applicants by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation; and that such possession is under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As the Solicitor General proffers, the alienable and disposable character of the lots should have already been established on June 12, 1945 or earlier; and given that they were declared alienable only on March 15, 1982, as reflected in the CENRO Certifications, petitioner could not have maintained a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier.<br><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals and Naguit,<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></b> </i>the Court declared that Section 14(1) of the <i>Property Registration Decree </i><br><br><blockquote>...<b>merely requires the property sought to be registered as<u> already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed.</u></b> If the State, at the time the application is made, has not yet deemed it proper to release the property for alienation or disposition, the presumption is that the government is still reserving the right to utilize the property; hence, the need to preserve its ownership in the State irrespective of the length of adverse possession even if in good faith. However<b>, <u>if the property has already been classified as alienable and disposable</u>, </b>as it is in this case,<b> <u>then there is already an intention on the part of the State to abdicate its exclusive prerogative over the property</u>. </b><br><br>This reading aligns conformably with our holding in <i><u>Republic v. Court of Appeals</u></i>. Therein, the Court noted that "to prove that the land subject of an application for registration is alienable, an applicant must establish the existence of a positive act of the government such as a presidential proclamation or an executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or a statute."  <u>In that case, the subject land had been certified by the DENR as alienable and disposable in 1980, thus the Court concluded that the alienable status of the land, <b>compounded </b>by the established fact that therein respondents had occupied the land even before 1927, sufficed to allow the application for registration of the said property. In the case at bar, even the petitioner admits that the subject property was released and certified as within alienable and disposable zone in 1980 by the DENR <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></u> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>As gathered from the CENRO Certifications, the lots were verified to be alienable or disposable lands on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 15, 1982</span>.  These Certifications enjoy the presumption of regularity in the absence of contradictory evidence.<br><br>In another vein, there is no sufficient proof that petitioner's predecessors-in-interest had been in open, continuous and adverse possession of the lots since June 12, 1945 or earlier.  Petitioner's reliance on the testimony of Destura does not lie.<br><br>Petitioner's witness Destura merely recounted petitioner's version of the chain of ownership of the lots.  His testimony consists of general statements with no specifics as to when petitioner's predecessors-in-interest began actual occupancy of the lots.  It did not establish the character of the possession of petitioner and her predecessors-in-interest over the lots.

Since these words are separated by the conjunction <b>and</b>, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the other. Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession. When, therefore, the law adds the word occupation, it seeks to delimit the all encompassing effect of constructive possession. <b>Taken together with the words open, continuous, exclusive and notorious, the word occupation serves to highlight the fact that <u>for an applicant to qualify, his possession must not be a mere fiction. <i>Actual</i> possession of a land consists in the <i>manifestation of acts of dominion</i></u> over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property</b>.
