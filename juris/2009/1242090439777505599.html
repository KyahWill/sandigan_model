Hizon argued that the NLRC correctly sent the resolution of 16 December 2003 to counsel's allegedly old address, considering that same was counsel's address of record, there being no formal notice filed with the NLRC informing it of a change of address.&nbsp; They contended that the aforesaid resolution had become final and executory, and that Atty. Garcia should bear the consequences of his inequitable conduct and/or gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; On 10 January 2005, the NLRC denied the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>On 14 March 2005, Atty. Garcia appealed to the Court of Appeals <i>via</i> a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.&nbsp; It prayed that the Decision dated 21 March 2003 and resolution dated 16 December 2003 of the NLRC be annulled and set aside, and that the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 30 September 2002 be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; The appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 88887.<br><br>On 28 March 2005, ETPI and Atty.

Hizon's argument that Atty. Garcia's petition for <i>certiorari </i>was filed out of time, ruled that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in liberally applying the rules regarding changes in the address of counsel.&nbsp; It likewise ruled that Atty. Garcia, being the Vice President for Business Support Services and Human Resource Departments of ETPI, was a corporate officer at the time he was removed.&nbsp; Being a corporate officer, his removal was a corporate act and/or an intra-corporate controversy, the jurisdiction of which rested with the Securities and Exchange Commission (now with the Regional Trial Court), and not the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC.&nbsp; It added that ETPI and Atty. Hizon were not estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter before the NLRC on appeal, inasmuch as said issue was seasonably raised by ETPI and Atty. Hizon in their reply memorandum before the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>On 18 April 2006, Atty.

Garcia - whether the termination or removal of an officer of a corporation is an intra-corporate controversy that falls under the original exclusive jurisdiction of the regional trial courts - is not novel.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, in a long line of cases, has decreed that <b>a corporate officer's dismissal or removal is always a corporate act and/or an intra-corporate controversy,</b> over which the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] (now the Regional Trial Court)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> has original and exclusive jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>We have ruled that an intra-corporate controversy is one which pertains to any of the following relationships: (1) between the corporation, partnership or association and the public; (2) between the corporation, partnership or association and the State insofar as the former's franchise, permit or license to operate is concerned; (3) <b><i>between the corporation</i></b>, partnership or association <b><i>and its</i></b> stockholders, partners, members or <b><i>officers</i></b>; and (4) among the stockholders, partners or associates themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Lozon v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> we declared that Presidential Decree No. 902-A confers on the SEC original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide controversies and cases involving intra-corporate and partnership relations between or among the corporation, officers and stockholders and partners, including their elections or appointments x x x.<br><br>Before a dismissal or removal could properly fall within the jurisdiction of the SEC, it has to be first established that the person removed or dismissed was a corporate officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>&nbsp; "Corporate officers" in the context of Presidential Decree No. 902-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; are those officers of the corporation who are given that character by the Corporation Code or by the corporation's by-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>&nbsp; There are three specific officers whom a corporation must have under Section 25 of the Corporation Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>&nbsp; These are the president, secretary and the treasurer.&nbsp; The number of officers is not limited to these three.&nbsp; A corporation may have such other officers as may be provided for by its by-laws like, but not limited to, the vice-president, cashier, auditor or general manager.&nbsp; The number of corporate officers is thus limited by law and by the corporation's by-laws.<br><br>In the case before us, the by-laws of ETPI provide:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE V<br><br>Officers<br></center><br>Section 1. <i>Number</i>. - The officers of the Company shall be a Chairman of the Board, a President, one or more Vice-Presidents, a Treasurer, a Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, and such other officers as may be from time to time be elected or appointed by the Board of Directors. One person may hold any two compatible offices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote>Atty. Garcia tries to deny he is an officer of ETPI.&nbsp; Not being a corporate officer, he argues that the Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; One of the corporate officers provided for in the by-laws of ETPI is the Vice-President. It can be gathered from Atty. Garcia's complaint-affidavit that he was Vice President for Business Support Services and Human Resource Departments of ETPI when his employment was terminated effective 16 April 2000. It is therefore clear from the by-laws and from Atty. Garcia himself that he is a corporate officer.&nbsp; One who is included in the by-laws of a corporation in its roster of corporate officers is an officer of said corporation and not a mere employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>&nbsp; Being a corporate officer, his removal is deemed to be an intra-corporate dispute cognizable by the SEC and not by the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>We agree with both the NLRC and the Court of Appeals that Atty. Garcia's ouster as Vice-President, who is a corporate officer of ETPI, partakes of the nature of an intra-corporate controversy, jurisdiction over which is vested in the SEC (now the RTC).&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter thus erred in assuming jurisdiction over the case filed by Atty. Garcia, because he had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy.<br><br>Having ruled which body has jurisdiction over the instant case, we find it unnecessary, due to mootness, to further discuss and rule on the issues raised by ETPI and Atty. Hizon regarding the NLRC order dated 23 August 2004 granting Atty. Garcia's Motion to Set Aside Finality of Judgment with Opposition to Motion to Discharge Appeal Bond, and its resolution dated 10 January 2005 denying their motion for reconsideration thereon.&nbsp; The decision of the Labor Arbiter, who had jurisdiction over the case, was properly dismissed by the NLRC.&nbsp; Consequently, Supersedeas Bond No. JCL (15) 00823 SICI Bond No. 75069 dated 18 November 2002, posted by ETPI as a requirement for the filing of an appeal before the NLRC, is ordered discharged.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> of Atty. Garcia in G.R. No. 173115 is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. The petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of ETPI and Atty. Hizon in G.R. Nos. 173163-64 is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b> insofar as the discharge of Supersedeas Bond No. JCL (15) 00823 SICI Bond No. 75069 dated 18 November 2002 is concerned.&nbsp; This ruling is without prejudice to Atty. Garcia's taking recourse to and seeking relief through the appropriate remedy in the proper forum.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, Nachura,</i> and <i>Peralta, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Renato C.
