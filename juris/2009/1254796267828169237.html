				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Edmund Rey (respondent) was hired by petitioner Bio Quest Marketing, Inc. on December 1, 1997 as its Area Collector in Quezon, Batangas and all the provinces of the Bicol region.  As Area Collector, he was tasked to collect payment for various veterinary products sold to feedmill companies, piggery and poultry farms within his area of assignment.<br><br>Allegedly as part of its cost cutting measures brought about by a decline in its sales receipts and collections, petitioner furnished the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) a copy of the retrenchment notice on September 3, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  And by letter of August 30, 2003 which was received by respondent, petitioner terminated his services on September 29, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Claiming that he was dismissed without a valid cause and the observance of due process, respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner averred, however, that it furnished complainant a retrenchment notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in compliance with Art. 283 of the Labor Code;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  and that it had the prerogative to retrench its employees including respondent to forestall business losses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to prove which claim of business losses it submitted a comparative report of its sales and collections for 2001-2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>By Decision of March 10, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Labor Arbiter found that respondent was illegally dismissed and accordingly disposed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering the respondents <b>Bio [Q]uest Marketing, Inc. and/or Jose L.

It thus VACATED its Decision of November 23, 2005 and disposed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the respondent's Motion for Reconsideration is hereby, GRANTED.  Accordingly, the decision sought to be reconsidered is hereby, VACATED and SET ASIDE.  A new one is hereby entered <u>ordering the respondent to pay the complainant separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Respondent thus elevated the case via Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to the Court of Appeals which, by Decision of September 28, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> held that herein petitioner "failed to prove convincingly that [herein respondent] was validly terminated on account of retrenchment" and accordingly reversed and set aside the decision of the NLRC, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing considered, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the assailed Decision is <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  </b>Accordingly, private respondents are ordered to:<br><br>Reinstate petitioner to his former position without loss of seniority rights and if this is no longer possible, to pay him:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) separation pay, in addition to;<br><br>(b) backwages equivalent to one-half month pay for every year of service from the time he was illegally dismissed up to the finality of this decision;<br><br>(c) his 13<sup>th</sup> month pay in the amount of Twenty-eight Thousand Five Hundred Seven Pesos and 68/100 (P28,507.68), as computed by the Labor Arbiter.<br></div><br>Let this case be <b>REMANDED</b> to the Labor Arbiter for the computation of the amounts due petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> having been denied by the appellate court by Resolution of January 23, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> petitioner comes before this Court via petition for review on certiorari, advancing the following argument:<br><br><blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN REVERSING AND SETTING ASIDE THE NLRC DECISION BY DECLARING THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PROVE IT WAS SUFFERING FROM SUBSTANTIAL, ACTUAL OR IMMINENT LOSSES.</blockquote><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Retrenchment to avoid or minimize business losses is a justified ground to dismiss employees under Article 283 of the Labor Code.  The employer, however, bears the burden to prove such ground with clear and satisfactory evidence, failing which the dismissal on such ground is unjustified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  In discharging its burden, the employer must satisfy certain established standards, all of which must concur,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely <i>de minimis</i>, but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer;<br><br></li><li>That the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment;<br><br></li><li>That the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher;<br><br></li><li>That the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in goof faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees' right to security of tenure; and<br><br></li><li>That the employer used fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who would be dismissed and who would be retained among the employees, such as status, efficiency, seniority, physical fitness, age, and financial hardship for certain workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Petitioner contends that contrary to the findings of the Labor Arbiter and the appellate court, the comparative report of its sales and collections for years 2001, 2002 and 2003 sufficiently proves that it was "suffering or [was] about to suffer imminent losses due to the gap between sales and collection, and/or poor collection efforts, coupled with declining sales;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and that although the report showed an increase of sales from 2001 to 2002, there was a sharp decline thereof in 2003 by more than P38 Million while collections from 2002 to 2003 decreased by almost P100 Million.<br><br>While the above-said comparative report of sales and collections indicates that there was a decrease in the amount of sales and collections from 2002 to 2003, the same does not suffice to prove that petitioner was suffering or about to suffer losses within the contemplation of Article 283 of the Labor Code.<br><br><i>Clarion Printing House, Inc. v. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> teaches that sliding incomes or decreasing gross revenues <i>alone</i> do not necessarily indicate business losses within the meaning of Article 283, for, in the nature of things, the possibility of incurring losses is constantly present in business operations.<br><br>The decline in petitioner's sales and collections from 2002 to 2003 cannot thus be considered as <i>the</i> loss referred to in Article 283 of the Labor Code, petitioner having failed to prove the stringent requirement that it was substantial, continuing and without any immediate prospect of abating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>To consider every loss incurred or expected to be incurred by a company as a justification of retrenchment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> would be susceptible to abuse by scheming employers who might be merely feigning business losses or reverses in their business ventures to ease out employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As for the Statement of Profit and Loss submitted by petitioner, the same does not bear the signature of a certified public accountant.  Neither is there a showing that it was audited by an independent auditor, hence, it is a self-serving document which ought to be treated as a mere scrap of paper devoid of any probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>At all events, even if the comparative report were to be considered, the Court is not persuaded on the necessity of resorting to retrenchment to prevent or minimize actual or imminent business losses on the part of petitioner.  For retrenchment should only be resorted to when other less drastic means have been tried and found to be inadequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  So <i>Polymart Paper Industries, Inc. v. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> instructs:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [E]ven if business losses were indeed sufficiently proven, the employer <b>must still prove that retrenchment was resorted to only after less drastic measures</b> such as the reduction of both management and rank-and-file bonuses and salaries, going on reduced time, improving manufacturing efficiency, reduction of marketing and advertising costs, faster collection of customer accounts, reduction of raw materials investment and others, <b>have been tried and found wanting</b>.  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, petitioner did not adduce evidence to prove that retrenchment was resorted to because other measures were undertaken to abate actual or future business losses but thus failed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Petition is <b>DENIED</b> and the challenged Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>  SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;  Brion, Del Castillo,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Abad, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member per Special Order No. 691 dated September 4, 2009.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, Vol. I, p. 26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Art. 283.
