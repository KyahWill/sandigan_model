It is settled that handwriting experts, while useful, are not indispensable in examining or comparing handwritings or signatures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  For Section 22 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>The handwriting of a person may be <u>proved by any witness</u> who believes it to be the handwriting of the person because he has seen the person write, or has seen writing purporting to be his upon which the witness has acted or been charged, and has thus acquired knowledge of the handwriting of such person.  Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given <u>by a comparison, made by the witness or the court</u>, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the judge.  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Complementing the said provision is Section 50 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court which allows the reception of the opinion of a witness, like Judge Laviña, for which proper basis is given, as evidence regarding a handwriting with which he has sufficient familiarity.<br><br>As the Court finds that the Deed of Absolute Sale in Milagrosa's favor is not genuine, it transmitted no rights to her.
