				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals dated August 23, 2007 in CA-G.R. SP No. 01027 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated June 25, 2004 and its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 30, 2005 declaring petitioners guilty of illegal dismissal.  Also assailed is the Court of Appeals' Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Sometime in 1989, petitioners hired private respondent Benjamin Sabulao as helper in its hardware business, then as a delivery truck driver from 1993 until May 12, 2001.  During the first week of May 2001, Sabulao alleged that he asked permission to be absent for five days due to his grandfather's death; that petitioner Francisco Romualdez granted his request but when he reported for work on May 12, 2001, he was informed not to work anymore.  Thereafter, he returned to his hometown and engaged in the copra business to support the needs of his family.<br><br>On August 10, 2001, Sabulao together with Mario Villanueva filed before the NLRC's Regional Arbitration Branch No. VIII, a complaint for illegal dismissal and money claims against petitioners.  Eventually, Mario Villanueva executed a Statement of Quitclaim and Release hence, his complaint was dismissed.<br><br>Petitioners denied having illegally dismissed Sabulao and alleged that he abandoned his work.  Allegedly, Sabulao had been a frequent absentee without notice since March and April of 2001 that petitioners would even send Edgar Enopia to fetch him to report for work.  During the first week of May 2001, petitioners learned that Sabulao was already engaged in the "Ukay-Ukay" business.<br><br>On October 2, 2002, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> finding Sabulao to have abandoned his work. At the same time, petitioners were ordered to pay Sabulao his salary differentials and service incentive leave pay. The other money claims were denied for failure to substantiate the same. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered-<br><br>1. Finding no illegal dismissal of complainant;<br>2.

All other claims are denied for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter, thus:<br><br>    <blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby <b>SET ASIDE and VACATED </b>and a new one entered finding complainant to have been illegally dismissed.  As such, respondent (Tacloban) Far East (M)arketing Corporation is hereby ORDERED to pay complainant his backwages and separation pay from the date of dismissal up to the date of this decision.  In addition, respondent is ORDERED to pay salary differentials and service incentive leave pay in the amount of P15,628.00.<br><br>    SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>The NLRC found that Sabulao's frequent absences could not by itself constitute abandonment and that no proof of overt acts was adduced showing that he intended to abandon his work; that the three-month delay in the filing of the case is not an indication of abandonment; and that the amounts mentioned in the mandatory conference before the labor arbiter should not be considered in determining the merits of the case.<br><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the NLRC in its Resolution dated June 30, 2005.  In addition, as prayed for by Sabulao, the NLRC made a detailed computation of the award due him as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="43%"><div align="justify">Backwages: May 2001 - June 2005</div></td> <td valign="top" width="23%"><div align="right">P209,332.99</div></td> <td width="34%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">13<sup>th</sup> month pay</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right">12,558.00</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">SILP</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="top"><div align="right">640.00</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="top"><div align="right">222,529.99</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Salary Differentials</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="top"><div align="right">15,628.00</div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right"></div><br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>TOTAL DIFFERENTIALS </b></div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="right"><b>P238, 157.99</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Thereafter, petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals which rendered the herein assailed Decision denying the petition and affirming the NLRC Decision finding respondent to have been illegally dismissed.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that the act of filing a complaint for illegal dismissal negates any intention on the part of the employee to abandon his job; that Sabulao's filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal only after three months from the time he was dismissed would not negate the finding that he did not abandon his work; that his returning to his hometown and engaging in copra business could not be taken against him; that engaging in the "Ukay-Ukay" business neither demonstrated an intention to abandon his job; that mere absence is not enough to constitute abandonment, rather, it should be coupled with overt acts showing that the employee is no longer interested to work anymore; and that Sabulao's prayer for separation pay should not be taken against him.<br><br>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied on January 24, 2008; hence, this petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>A.<br></center><br>THE QUESTIONED DECISION OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IS BASED ON MISAPPRECIATION OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BEFORE THE LABOR ARBITER AND IT OVERLOOKED FACTS OF SUBSTANCE AND VALUE, THAT IF CONSIDERED WOULD DEFINITELY CONCLUDE THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT ABANDONED HIS EMPLOYMENT WITH HEREIN PETITIONER, HENCE, IN DOING SO, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION.<br><br><center>B.</center><br>PUBLIC RESPONDENT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO EXCESS OF OR LACK OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT ORDERED THE PAYMENT OF BACKWAGES AND OTHER CLAIMS TO PRIVATE RESPONDENT DESPITE A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE SHOWING AN ABANDONMENT OF WORK BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT.<br></blockquote><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>At the outset, it must be stated that petitioners adopted the wrong mode of remedy in bringing the case before this Court.  It is well-settled that the proper recourse of an aggrieved party to assail the decision of the Court of Appeals is to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup><sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></sup></sup>  The Rules precludes recourse to the special civil action of certiorari if appeal, by way of a petition for review is available, as the remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>For a writ of certiorari to issue, a petitioner must not only prove that the tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction but must also show that he has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Certiorari cannot be used as a substitute for a lost appeal.  Though there are instances when certiorari was granted despite the availability of appeal,<sup><sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></sup></sup> none of these recognized exceptions was shown to be present in the case at bar.<br><br>Moreover, while it is true that the Court may treat a Petition for Certiorari as having been filed under Rule 45 in the interest of substantial justice, the present petition could not be given the same leniency because it was filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period within which to file a petition for review on certiorari.  The records of the case show that petitioners received a copy of the January 24, 2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals denying the motion for reconsideration on February 5, 2008.  Instead of filing a petition for review on certiorari within 15 days from receipt thereof, petitioners waited for two months before filing the instant petition. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals had already become final and executory and beyond the purview of this Court to act upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The inescapable conclusion is that the present petition was filed belatedly to make up for a lost appeal.<br><br>At any rate, even if the Court allows the present petition for certiorari, it would still be dismissible for lack of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the Court of Appeals.  For certiorari to prosper, the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.<sup><sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></sup></sup><br><br>In the instant case, there was no showing that the Court of Appeals ruled in a capricious and whimsical manner amounting to an arbitrary exercise of its powers.<br><br>It is well-settled that in termination cases, the burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal was for a just and valid cause and failure to discharge the same would mean that the dismissal is not justified and therefore illegal.  Hence, in arguing that Sabulao abandoned his work, it is incumbent upon the petitioners to prove: (1) that the employee failed to report for work or had been absent without valid or justifiable reason; and (2) that there must have been a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship as manifested by some overt acts.  Clearly, jurisprudence dictates that the burden of proof to show that there was unjustified refusal to go back to work rests on the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The NLRC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, correctly found that petitioners failed to substantiate its claim that Sabulao abandoned his work.  No evidence was presented to prove that Sabulao clearly intended to sever the employer-employee relationship as manifested by some overt acts.  As regards petitioners' allegation that Sabulao is a field personnel and therefore not entitled to the money claims awarded by the NLRC, suffice it to state that the issue was raised only before the Court of Appeals in contravention to the rule that questions not raised before the tribunals <i>a quo</i> cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  As such, it deserves no consideration by this Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.  The August 23, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 01027 which affirmed the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission declaring petitioners guilty of illegal dismissal, and the January 24, 2008 Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration, are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, Velaco, Jr., Nachura,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Peralta, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 22-31.
