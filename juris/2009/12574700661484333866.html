				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this special civil action for <i>certiorari,</i> the Court again determines whether or not the exclusion of certain election returns from the canvass due to allegations of irregularities and statistical improbability made by a candidate are proper grounds for a pre-proclamation controversy by which to annul the proclamation of his rival as duly-elected.<br><br><center><b>THE CASE</b><br></center><br>The Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) of Patikul, Sulu had earlier ruled against petitioner Ismunlatip H. Suhuri's plea for the exclusion of 25 election returns from the canvass of votes cast for the 2007 mayoralty race in Patikul, Sulu and then proclaimed respondent Kabir E. Hayudini as the duly-elected Mayor. Appealing to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), Suhuri insisted on the invalidity of the proclamation because of the existing pre-proclamation controversy involving the exclusion of the 25 election returns. The COMELEC, Second Division, had sustained Suhuri's appeal and nullified Hayudini's proclamation, but the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>reversed the Second Division through the assailed resolution of January 29, 2008.<br><br>Suhuri thus assails on <i>certiorari</i> the January 29, 2008 resolution of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> that reversed the resolution of the Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  He claims that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> thereby gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>ANTECEDENTS</b><br></center><br>Suhuri ran for the position of Municipal Mayor of Patikul, Sulu during the May 14, 2007 national and local elections.

Section 243 of the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i> enumerates the scope of a pre-proclamation controversy, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 243. <i>Issue that may be raised in pre-proclamation controversy - </i>The following shall be proper issues that may be raised in a pre-proclamation controversy:<br><br>(a) Illegal composition or proceedings of the board of canvassers;<br><br>(b) The canvassed election returns are incomplete, contain material defects, appear to be tampered with or falsified, or contain discrepancies in the same returns or in other authentic copies thereof as mentioned in Sections 233, 234, 235, and 236 of this Code;<br><br>(c) The election returns were prepared under duress, threats, coercion, or intimidation, or they are obviously manufactured or not authentic; and<br><br>(d) When substitute or fraudulent returns in controverted polling places were canvassed, the results of which materially affected the standing of the aggrieved candidate or candidates.</blockquote><br>Clearly, Section 243, <i>supra</i>, limits a pre-proclamation controversy to the questions enumerated therein.

Indeed, the mere attendance or presence of the formal defects did not establish the commission of palpable irregularities in the election returns. As held in <i>Baterina v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the grounds for the exclusion of election returns from the canvassing as raised by the petitioners' therein -referring to, among others, the failure to close the entries with the signatures of the election inspectors, and the lack of signatures of the petitioners' watchers, <i>both involving a violation of the rules governing the preparation and delivery of election returns for canvassing</i> - did not necessarily affect the authenticity and genuineness of the subject election returns as to warrant their exclusion from the canvassing, being but defects in form insufficient to support the conclusion that these had been tampered with or spurious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this regard, the Court has said that the conclusion that election returns were obviously manufactured or false and should consequently be disregarded from the canvass must be approached with extreme caution and made only upon the most convincing proof;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and that only when the election returns were palpably irregular might they be rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Secondly, the MBC corrected the defects <i>before</i> the canvass of the election returns upon finding the cause of the defects to be satisfactorily explained by the members of the Board of Election Tellers. The MBC's report bears this out, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><blockquote>3. Minutes of the canvass x x x will show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there were only very few election returns that were not signed by some members of the Board of Election Tellers. The Board decided to defer the canvass on those returns and issued written directives to each of the concerned Board of Election Teller to appear before the Board of Canvassers for explanation for such omission.  True enough, the summoned members of the Board of Election Tellers who failed to affix their signatures in the return appeared and gave the explanation in open session that they failed to affix their signature not because there was fraud, violence or other irregularities in the preparation thereof, but such omission was caused solely and unwittingly by the fact that they were heavily sleepy, tired, hungry and miserably exhausted in the waiting for the delivery of the election returns</span>.  Prior to this, they have been in the different polling centers spread throughout the municipality of Patikul early morning on election day for the preparation of the voting and the voting proper.<br><br>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some testified that the counting of ballots and the preparation of election returns in their respective precinct was merely lighted by candles outside the school classrooms since the school classrooms were not enough to accommodate all the precincts for the purpose of counting and preparation of election returns</span>. This had unwittingly contributed to the faultless and innocent omission to affix the signature.<br><br><b><i>5. </i></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the presence of lawyers from different political parties and candidates, official watchers and before the Board of Canvassers, the members of the Board of Election Tellers affixed their signature on the previously incomplete election returns</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>.</i></b><br><br>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After such completion and towards the end of the canvass, not a single election return appeared to be materially defective</span> x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> expectedly approved of the MBC's actions, absent any <i>other</i> plausible explanation for the defects supported by substantial evidence. In the assailed resolution,<i> </i>the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>aptly stated,<i> viz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We meticulously re-examined <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the questioned election returns and they all appear to be regular and authentic</span>.  No showing of alterations and erasures could be seen on their faces.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The re-examination would also show that twenty three (23) of the returns were completely signed and thumbmarked by all the members of the Board of Election Inspectors</span>.  Some were signed by at least two (2) watchers. In Precinct Nos. 47A/48A and 91A/92A, all the watchers signed the returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only two (2) returns, Precinct Nos. 9A/10A and 99A/100A did not contain the signatures of poll watchers, but were signed and thumbmarked by the Chairmen and Third Members</span>.<b><i> </i></b>Even then, this is not a formal defect which would constitute a proper ground for exclusion. This means that the asseverations of the petitioner-appellant has no leg to lean on. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>We agree with the COMELEC <i>en banc.</i> The actions of the MBC were reasonable and warranted.  Judicial notice is properly taken of the fact that the conduct of elections in many parts of this country, particularly in areas like Patikul, Sulu, often come under circumstances less than ideal and convenient for the officials administering the elections; and of the fact that the process of elections usually involved sleepless nights, tiresome work, and constant dangers to the lives and personal safeties of the many officials who work to see to it that the elections are orderly and peaceful and their results are obtained smoothly and with the least delay. We can easily conclude that such trying circumstances often lead to unintended omissions in form similar to those Suhuri pointed out.<br><br>Thirdly, the allegation of a statistical improbability reflected in the election returns for Precinct Nos. 11A/12A, 17A/18A, 89A/90A, 91A/92A, 93A/94A and 95A/96A (wherein Suhuri obtained zero) and for Precinct Nos. 13A/14A (wherein Hayudini garnered 210 out of the 211 total registered voters, with Suhuri being credited with one vote) lacks substance and merit.<br><br>The doctrine of statistical improbability was first pronounced in <i>Lagumbay</i> <i>v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> in which the Court upheld the power and duty of the COMELEC to reject the returns of about 50 precincts affecting the elections of Senators, because their results were "contrary to all statistical probabilities," thus:<br><br><blockquote>It appearing therein that -- contrary to all statistical probabilities -- in the first set, in each precinct the number of registered voters equalled the number of ballots and the number of votes reportedly cast and tallied for each and every candidate of the Liberal Party, the party in power; whereas, all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party got exactly zero; and in the second set, -- again contrary to all statistical probabilities -- all the reported votes were for candidates of the Liberal Party, all of whom were credited with exactly the same number of votes in each precinct, ranging from 240 in one precinct to 650 in another precinct; whereas, all the candidates of the Nacionalista Party were given exactly zero in all said precincts.</blockquote><br><i>Lagumbay</i> expounded on the doctrine of statistical improbability and the doctrine's effect on the power of the COMELEC to reject the results reflected in the election returns when such returns showed <i>prima facie</i> that they did not reflect the true and valid reports of regular voting, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We opined that the election result in said precincts as reported was utterly improbable and clearly incredible. For it is not likely, in the ordinary course of things, that all the electors of one precinct would, as one man, vote for all the eight candidates of the Liberal Party, without giving a single vote to one of the eight candidates of the Nacionalista Party. Such extraordinary coincidence was quite impossible to believe, knowing that the Nacionalista Party had and has a nationwide organization, with branches in every province, and was, in previous years, the party in power in these islands.<br><br>We also know from our experience in examining ballots in the three Electoral Tribunals (Presidential, Senate, and House) that a large portion of the electors do not fill all the blanks for senators in their ballots. Indeed, this observation is confirmed by the big differences in the votes received by the eight winning senators in this as well as in previous national elections; 2 almost a million votes between the first place and the eight. Furthermore, in 1965, the total number of electors who cast their votes was 6,833,369 (more or less). If every voter had written eight names on his ballot, the total number of votes cast for all the candidates would be that number multiplied by 8, namely 54,666,952. But the total number of votes tallied for the candidates for senator amounted to 49,374,942 only. The difference between the two sums represents the number of ballots that did not contain eight names for senators. In other words, some 5 million ballots did not carry eight names. Of course, this is a rough estimate, because some ballots may have omitted more names, in which case, the number of incomplete ballots would be less. But the general idea and the statistical premise is there.<br><br>The same statistical result is deducible from the 1963 election data: total number of electors who voted, 7,712,019; if each of them named eight senators, the total votes tallied should have been 61,696,152, and yet the total number tallied for all the senatorial candidates was 45,812,470 only. A greater number of incomplete ballots.<br><br>It must be noted that this is not an instance wherein one return gives to one candidate all the votes in the precinct, even as it gives exactly zero to the other. This is not a case where some senatorial candidates obtain zero exactly, while some others receive a few scattered votes. Here, all the eight candidates of one party garnered all the votes, each of them receiving exactly the same number; whereas all the eight candidates of the other party got precisely nothing.<br><br>The main point to remember is that there is no blockvoting nowadays.<br><br>What happened to the vote of the Nacionalista inspector? There was one in every precinct. Evidently, either he became a traitor to his party, or was made to sign a false return by force or other illegal means. If he signed voluntarily, but in breach of faith, the Nacionalista inspector betrayed his party; and, any voting or counting of ballots therein, was a sham and a mockery of the national suffrage.<br><br>Hence, denying <i>prima facie</i> recognition to such returns on the ground that they are manifestly fabricated or falsified, would constitute a practical approach to the Commission's mission to insure free and honest elections.<br><br>In <i>Mitchell vs. Stevens, supra</i>, the returns showed a noticeable excess of votes over the number of registered voters, and the court rejected the returns as obviously "manufactured". Why? The excess could have been due to the fact that, disregarding all pertinent data, the election officers wrote the number of votes their fancy dictated; and so the return was literally a "manufactured", "fabricated" return. Or maybe because persons other than voters, were permitted to take part and vote; or because registered voters cast more than one ballot each, or because those in charge of the tally sheet falsified their counts. Hence, as the Mitchell decision concluded, the returns were "not true returns . . . but simply manufactured evidences of an attempt to defeat the popular will." All these possibilities and/or probabilities were plain fraudulent practices, resulting in misrepresentation of the election outcome. "Manufactured" was the word used. "Fabricated" or "false" could as well have been employed.<br><br>The same <i>ratio decidendi</i> applies to the situation in the precincts herein mentioned. These returns were obviously false or fabricated -- <i>prima facie</i>. Let us take for example, precinct No. 3 of Andong, Lanao del Sur. There were 648 registered voters. According to such return all the eight candidates of the Liberal Party got 648 each, and the eight Nacionalista candidates got exactly zero. We hold such return to be evidently fraudulent or false because of the inherent improbability of such a result -- against statistical probabilities -- specially because at least one vote should have been received by the Nacionalista candidates, <i>i.e</i>., the vote of the Nacionalista inspector. It is, of course, "possible" that such inspector did not like his party's senatorial line-up; but it is not probable that he disliked all of such candidates, and it is not likely that he favored all the eight candidates of the Liberal Party. Therefore, most probably, he was made to sign an obviously false return, or else he betrayed his party, in which case, the election therein -- if any -- was no more than a barefaced fraud and a brazen contempt of the popular polls.<br><br>Of course we agree that frauds in the holding of the election should be handled -- and finally settled -- by the corresponding courts or electoral tribunals. That is the general rule, where testimonial or documentary evidence, is necessary; but where the fraud is so palpable from the return itself (<i>res ipsa loquitur</i> -- the thing speaks for itself), there is no reason to accept it and give it <i>prima facie</i> value.<br><br>At any rate, fraud or no fraud, the verdict in these fifty precincts may ultimately be ascertained before the Senate Electoral Tribunal. All we hold now is that the returns show "<i>prima facie</i>" that they do not reflect true and valid reports of regular voting. The contrary may be shown by candidate Climaco -- in the corresponding election protest.</blockquote><br>Under <i>Lagumbay</i>, therefore, the doctrine of statistical improbability is applied only where the unique uniformity of tally of all the votes cast in favor of all the candidates belonging to one party <i>and</i> the systematic blanking of all the candidates of all the opposing parties appear in<b> </b>the<b> </b>election return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  The doctrine has no application where there is <i>neither</i> uniformity of tallies <i>nor</i> systematic blanking of the candidates of one party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, the bare fact that a candidate for public office received <i>no</i> votes in one or two precincts, standing alone and without more, cannot adequately support a finding that the subject election returns are statistically improbable. Verily, a <i>zero </i>vote for a particular candidate in the election returns is but one strand in the web of circumstantial evidence that the electoral returns were prepared under duress, force and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Court has thus warned that the doctrine of statistical improbability must be restrictively viewed, with the utmost care being taken lest in penalizing fraudulent and corrupt practices - which is truly called for -  innocent voters become disenfranchised, a result that hardly commends itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Such prudential approach makes us dismiss Suhuri's urging that some of the electoral results had been infected with the taint of statistical improbability as to warrant their exclusion from the canvass in a pre-proclamation controversy. Specifically, his petition and the records nowhere show that his party-mates received a similar number of votes (or lack of any) by which to conclude that there were a unique uniformity of tally <i>and</i> a systematic blanking of other candidates belonging to one party.<br><br>Fourthly, Suhuri contends that threat, violence, duress and intimidation were attendant in the preparation of election returns of the 25 contested precincts.  He has presented the affidavits of voters and poll watchers from the 25 precincts whose election returns he questioned;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the affidavit of one Ermalyn J. Jamasali, a member of the BEI of one of the precincts; and the affidavit of Police Inspector Panisan, Chief of Police of Patikul, Sulu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Yet, the affidavits, because they referred to incidents that had occurred at the <i>various</i> <i>precincts</i> during the voting, did not substantiate Suhuri's allegation of duress, threats, coercion, and intimidation during the preparation or making of the election returns. The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> rightly noted and pointed this out in its assailed resolution, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x the various affidavits presented by the petitioner do not even relate to the fact of the election returns being manufactured or prepared under duress, but to the alleged irregularities in the voting which are proper grounds in an election protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Fifthly, BEI member Jamasali narrated in her affidavit her having personally witnessed fraud committed during the elections. Even assuming that the fraud she thereby exposed constituted an irregularity in the conduct of the elections, the incident, being isolated, did not warrant the exclusion of <i>all</i> the 25 election returns, but only of the return for the precinct where the fraud had occurred. However, the exclusion of the election returns from that precinct (<i>i.e</i>., Precinct 17A/18A), if called for, would not alter the overall result for the mayoralty contest in Patikul, Sulu,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> considering that said precinct had only 189 registered voters. We note that Hayudini had a winning margin of 775 votes over Suhuri.<br><br>Lastly, Police Inspector Panisan's election report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <i>albeit</i> official, would not justify the exclusion of the returns from the precincts clustered in the Anuling Elementary School. Concededly, Panisan's report, being hearsay because he had not himself actually witnessed the incidents described in the report, was unreliable and had no value for purposes of Suhuri's petition-appeal. It would not be trite to emphasize that the results of an election should not be annulled based on hearsay evidence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote><b>II</b><br><b>COMELEC <i>En Banc</i></b>  <br><b>Did Not Gravely Abuse Its Discretion</b><br></blockquote></div><br>In a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, the petitioner carries the burden of proving not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public respondent for its issuance of the impugned order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion is present "when there is a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, such as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In other words, the tribunal or administrative body must have issued the assailed decision, order or resolution in a capricious or despotic manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Suhuri did not discharge his burden as petitioner, to satisfactorily show that his grounds were proper for a pre-proclamation controversy.  We cannot go to his succor, for the COMELEC cannot not look behind or beyond the 25 contested election returns in a pre-proclamation controversy. Moreover, contrary to his urging, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> did not rely mainly on the report submitted by the MBC on December 4, 2007 in order to find against him. It is clear that the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>took note of the matters and circumstances that Suhuri himself had submitted to its consideration when it rendered its assailed resolution. If it did not accept his submissions, it<i> </i>did not abuse its discretion, because it based its assailed resolution on the established facts, the law, and the pertinent jurisprudence.<br><br>Before closing, we stress that the powers of the COMELEC are essentially executive and administrative in nature. This is the reason why the question of whether or not there were terrorism, vote-buying and other irregularities in the elections <i>should be</i> ventilated in regular election protests. The COMELEC is not the proper forum for deciding such protests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  Accordingly, a party seeking to raise issues, the resolution of which compels or necessitates the COMELEC's piercing the veil of election returns that appear <i>prima facie</i> to be regular on their face, has his proper remedy in a regular election contest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we affirm the resolution dated January 29, 2008 issued in S.P.C.
