In March 1999, a Special Audit Team composed of Fatima Bermudez (Bermudez), Carolina Supsup, Gerry Estrada, and Yolando Atienza, by virtue of Local Government Audit Office Assignment Order No. 99-002, audited selected transactions of Parañaque City for the calendar years 1996 to 1998, including the <i>walis tingting </i>purchases.<br><br>In connection with the <i>walis tingting </i>purchases audit, the audit team gathered the following evidence:<br><br>1.   Documents furnished by the Office of the City Mayor of Parañaque City upon request of the audit team;<br><br>2.   Sample <i>walis tingting </i>with handle likewise submitted by the Office of the City Mayor of Parañaque City;<br><br>3.   Samples of <i>walis tingting </i>without handle actually utilized by the street sweepers upon ocular inspection of the audit team;<br><br>4.   Survey forms accomplished by the street sweepers containing questions on the <i>walis tingting</i>;<br><br>5.   Evaluation by the Technical Services Department<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the reasonableness of the <i>walis tingting </i>procurement compared to current prices thereof;<br><br>6.   A separate canvass by the audit team on the prices of the <i>walis tingting</i>, including purchases thereof at various merchandising stores;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and<br><br>7.   Documents on the conduct and process of procurement of <i>walis tingting</i> by the neighboring city of Las Piñas.<br><br>Parenthetically, to ascertain the prevailing price of <i>walis tingting</i> for the years 1996 to 1998, the audit team made a canvass of the purchase prices of the different merchandise dealers of Parañaque City. All, however, were reluctant to provide the team with signed quotations of purchase prices for <i>walis tingting</i>. In addition, the audit team attempted to purchase <i>walis tingting</i> from the named suppliers of Parañaque City. Curiously, when the audit team went to the listed addresses of the suppliers, these were occupied by other business establishments. Thereafter, the audit team located, and purchased from, a lone supplier that sold <i>walis tingting</i>.<br><br>As previously adverted to, the audit team made a report which contained the following findings:<br><br>1.   The purchase of <i>walis tingting</i> was undertaken without public bidding;<br><br>2.   The purchase of <i>walis tingting</i> was divided into several purchase orders and requests to evade the requirement of public bidding and instead avail of personal canvass as a mode of procurement;<br><br>3.   The purchase of <i>walis tingting </i>through personal canvass was attended with irregularities; and<br><br>4.   There was glaring overpricing in the purchase transactions.<br><br>Consequently, the COA issued Notices of Disallowance Nos. 01-001-101 (96) to 01-006-101 (96), 01-001-101 (97) to 01-011-101 (97), and 01-001-101 (98) to 01-004-101 (98) covering the overpriced amount of P1,302,878.00 for the purchases of 142,612 <i>walis tingting</i>, with or without handle, by Parañaque City in the years 1996-1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Objecting to the disallowances, petitioners Marquez and Caunan, along with the other concerned local government officials of Parañaque City, filed a request for reconsideration with the audit team which the latter subsequently denied in a letter to petitioner Marquez.<br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners and the other accused appealed to the COA which eventually denied the appeal. Surprisingly, on motion for reconsideration, the COA excluded petitioner Marquez from liability for the disallowances based on our rulings in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and <i>Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On the other litigation front, the criminal aspect subject of this appeal, the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict petitioners and the other local government officials of Parañaque City for violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019. Consequently, the five (5) Informations against petitioners, <i>et al</i>. were filed before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>After trial and a flurry of pleadings, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment finding petitioners Caunan and Marquez, along with Silvestre de Leon and Marilou Tanael, guilty of violating Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019. As for accused Flocerfida Babida, Ailyn Romea and private individual Razo, the Sandiganbayan acquitted them for lack of sufficient evidence to hold them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offenses charged. The Sandiganbayan ruled as follows:<br><br>1.   The prosecution evidence, specifically the testimony of Bermudez and the Special Audit Team's report, did not constitute hearsay evidence, considering that all the prosecution witnesses testified on matters within their personal knowledge;<br><br>2.   The defense failed to question, and timely object to, the admissibility of documentary evidence, such as the Las Piñas City documents and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) price listing downloaded from the Internet, which were certified true copies and not the originals of the respective documents;<br><br>3.   The Bids and Awards Committee was not properly constituted; the accused did not abide by the prohibition against splitting of orders; and Parañaque City had not been afforded the best possible advantage for the most objective price in the purchase of <i>walis tingting</i> for failure to observe the required public bidding;<br><br>4.   The contracts for procurement of <i>walis tingting</i> in Parañaque City for the years 1996-1998 were awarded to pre-selected suppliers; and<br><br>5.   On the whole, the transactions undertaken were manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.<br><br>Expectedly, the remaining accused, Caunan, Marquez and Tanael, moved for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan decision. Caunan and Tanael, represented by the same counsel, collectively filed a Motion for Reconsideration (with Written Notice of Death of Accused Silvestre S. de Leon). Marquez filed several motions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> including a separate Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>All the motions filed by Marquez, as well as Caunan's motion, were denied by the Sandiganbayan. However, with respect to Tanael, the Sandiganbayan found reason to reconsider her conviction.<br><br>Hence, these separate appeals by petitioners Marquez and Caunan.<br><br>Petitioner Caunan posits the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>1.   [WHETHER] THE PROSECUTION'S PROOF OF OVERPRICING [IS] HEARSAY.<br><br>2.   [WHETHER THE] RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN [ERRED] IN ADMITTING WITNESS FATIMA V. BERMUDEZ' TESTIMONY DESPITE THE FACT THAT ITS SOURCES ARE THEMSELVES ADMITTEDLY AND PATENTLY HEARSAY.<br><br>3.

CONSEQUENTLY, [WHETHER] RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING [CAUNAN].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]<br><br></sup></blockquote>For his part, petitioner Marquez raises the following:<br><br><blockquote>1.

WHETHER THE ALLEGED OVERPRICING WHICH WAS THE BASIS FOR CLAIMING THAT THE CONTRACTS OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY [MARQUEZ] IN BEHALF OF PARAÑAQUE CITY WERE MANIFESTLY AND GROSSLY DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT WAS ASCERTAINED OR DETERMINED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OR PROCEDURES PRESCRIBED UNDER COA MEMORANDUM NO. 97-012 DATED MARCH 31, 1997[;]<br><br>6.

WHETHER [MARQUEZ] IS ENTITLED TO NEW TRIAL SINCE HIS RIGHT TO AN IMPARTIAL TRIAL WAS VIOLATED IN THE SUBJECT CRIMINAL CASES WHEN THE CHAIRMAN (JUSTICE GREGORY ONG) REFUSED TO INHIBIT DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF SERIOUS CONFLICT OF INTEREST RAISED BY THE FORMER BEFORE THE JUDGMENT BECAME FINAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>In a Resolution dated February 23, 2009, we directed the consolidation of these cases. Thus, we impale petitioners' issues for our resolution:<br><br>1.   First and foremost, whether the Sandiganbayan erred in finding petitioners guilty of violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019.<br><br>2.   Whether the testimony of Bermudez and the report of the Special Audit Team constitute hearsay and are, therefore, inadmissible in evidence against petitioners.<br><br>3.   Whether petitioner Marquez should be excluded from liability based on our rulings in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and <i>Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Both petitioners insist that the fact of overpricing, upon which the charge against them of graft and corruption is based, had not been established by the quantum of evidence required in criminal cases, <i>i.e.,</i> proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Petitioners maintain that the evidence of overpricing, consisting of the report of the Special Audit Team and the testimony thereon of Bermudez, constitutes hearsay and, as such, is inadmissible against them. In addition, petitioner Marquez points out that the finding of overpricing was not shown to a reliable degree of certainty as required by COA Memorandum No. 97-012 dated March 31, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In all, petitioners asseverate that, as the overpricing was not sufficiently established, necessarily, the last criminal element of Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 -- <i>a contract or transaction grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government </i>-- was not proven.<br><br>Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3.    <i>Corrupt practices of public officers</i>--In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(g)    Entering on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction, manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby.<br></blockquote><br>For a charge under Section 3(g) to prosper, the following elements must be present: (1) that the accused is a public officer; (2) that he entered into a contract or transaction on behalf of the government; and (3) that such contract or transaction is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The presence of the first two elements of the crime is not disputed. Hence, the threshold question we should resolve is whether the <i>walis tingting </i>purchase contracts were grossly and manifestly injurious or disadvantageous to the government.<br><br>We agree with petitioners that the fact of overpricing is embedded in the third criminal element of Section 3 (g) of R.A. No. 3019. Given the factual milieu of this case, the subject contracts would be grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government if characterized by an overpriced procurement. However, the gross and manifest disadvantage to the government was not sufficiently shown because the conclusion of overpricing was erroneous since it was not also adequately proven. Thus, we grant the petitions.<br><br>In criminal cases, to justify a conviction, the culpability of an accused must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The burden of proof is on the prosecution, as the accused enjoys a constitutionally enshrined disputable presumption of innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The court, in ascertaining the guilt of an accused, must, after having marshaled the facts and circumstances, reach a moral certainty as to the accused's guilt. Moral certainty is that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Otherwise, where there is reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted.<br><br>In finding that the <i>walis tingting </i>purchase contracts were grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government, the Sandiganbayan relied on the COA's finding of overpricing which was, in turn, based on the special audit team's report. The audit team's conclusion on the standard price of a <i>walis tingting</i> was pegged on the basis of the following documentary and object evidence: (1) samples of <i>walis tingting </i>without handle actually used by the street sweepers; (2) survey forms on the <i>walis tingting</i> accomplished by the street sweepers; (3) invoices from six merchandising stores where the audit team purchased <i>walis tingting</i>; (4) price listing of the DBM Procurement Service; and (5) documents relative to the <i>walis tingting</i> purchases of Las Piñas City. These documents were then compared with the documents furnished by petitioners and the other accused relative to Parañaque City's <i>walis tingting</i> transactions.<br><br>Notably, however, and this the petitioners have consistently pointed out, the evidence of the prosecution did not include a signed price quotation from the <i>walis tingting </i>suppliers of Parañaque City. In fact, even the <i>walis tingting</i> furnished the audit team by petitioners and the other accused was different from the <i>walis tingting</i> actually utilized by the Parañaque City street sweepers at the time of ocular inspection by the audit team. At the barest minimum, the evidence presented by the prosecution, in order to substantiate the allegation of overpricing, should have been identical to the <i>walis tingting</i> purchased in 1996-1998.  Only then could it be concluded that the <i>walis tingting</i> purchases were disadvantageous to the government because only then could a determination have been made to show that the disadvantage was so manifest and gross as to make a public official liable under Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019.<br><br>On the issue of hearsay, the Sandiganbayan hastily shot down petitioners' arguments thereon, in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>We find no application of the hearsay rule here. In fact, all the witnesses in this case testified on matters within their personal knowledge. The prosecution's principal witness, Ms. Bermudez, was a State Auditor and the Assistant Division Chief of the Local Government Audit Office who was tasked to head a special audit team to audit selected transactions of Parañaque City. The report which she identified and testified on [was] made by [the] Special Audit Team she herself headed. The disbursement vouchers, purchase orders, purchase requests and other documents constituting the supporting papers of the team's report were public documents requested from the City Auditor of Parañaque and from the accused Mayor Marquez. Such documents were submitted to the Special Audit Team for the specific purpose of reviewing them. The documents were not executed by Ms. Bermudez or by any member of the Special Audit Team for the obvious reason that, as auditors, they are only reviewing acts of others. The Special Audit Team's official task was to review the documents of the <i>walis tingting</i> transactions. In the process of [the] review, they found many irregularities in the documentations --violations of the Local Government Code and pertinent COA rules and regulations. They found that the transactions were grossly overpriced. The findings of the team were consolidated in a report. The same report was the basis of Ms. Bermudez's testimony. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>The reasoning of the Sandiganbayan is specious and off tangent. The audit team reached a conclusion of gross overpricing based on documents which, at best, would merely indicate the present market price of <i>walis tingting</i> of a <b>different specification, </b>purchased from a <b>non-supplier</b> of Parañaque City, and the price of <i>walis tingting</i> purchases <b>in Las Piñas City</b>. Effectively, the prosecution was unable to demonstrate the requisite burden of proof, <i>i.e.,</i> proof beyond reasonable doubt, in order to overcome the presumption of innocence in favor of petitioners.<br><br>As pointed out by petitioner Caunan, not all of the contents of the audit team's report constituted hearsay. Indeed, as declared by the Sandiganbayan, Bermudez could very well testify thereon since the conclusions reached therein were made by her and her team. However, these conclusions were based on incompetent evidence. Most obvious would be the market price of <i>walis tingting </i>in Las Piñas City which was used as proof of overpricing in Parañaque City. The prosecution should have presented evidence of the actual price of the particular <i>walis tingting</i> purchased by petitioners and the other accused at the time of the audited transaction or, at the least, an approximation thereof. Failing in these, there is no basis to declare that there was a glaring overprice resulting in gross and manifest disadvantage to the government.<br><br>We are not unmindful of the fact that petitioners failed to conduct the requisite public bidding for the questioned procurements. However, the lack of public bidding alone does not automatically equate to a manifest and gross disadvantage to the government. As we had occasion to declare in <i>Nava v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the absence of a public bidding may mean that the government was not able to secure the lowest bargain in its favor and may open the door to graft and corruption. However, this does not satisfy the third element of the offense charged, because the law requires that the disadvantage must be manifest and gross. After all, penal laws are strictly construed against the government.<br><br>With the foregoing disquisition, we find no necessity to rule on the applicability of our rulings in <i>Arias </i>and <i>Magsuci</i> to petitioner Marquez. Nonetheless, we wish to reiterate herein the doctrines laid down in those cases.  We call specific attention to the sweeping conclusion made by the Sandiganbayan that a conspiracy existed among petitioners and the other accused, most of whom were acquitted, particularly private individual Razo, the proprietor of Zaro Trading.<br><br>Our ruling in <i>Magsuci</i>, citing our holding in <i>Arias</i>, should be instructive, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>The Sandiganbayan predicated its conviction of [Magsuci] on its finding of conspiracy among Magsuci, Ancla and now deceased Enriquez.<br><br>There is conspiracy "when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it." Conspiracy is not presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. While conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, all taken together, however, the evidence therefore must reasonably be strong enough to show a community of criminal design.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Fairly evident, however, is the fact that the actions taken by Magsuci involved the very functions he had to discharge in the performance of his official duties. There has been no intimation at all that he had foreknowledge of any irregularity committed by either or both Engr. Enriquez and Ancla. Petitioner might have indeed been lax and administratively remiss in placing too much reliance on the official reports submitted by his subordinate (Engineer Enriquez), but for conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense. Conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intentionality on the part of cohorts.<br><br>In <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i>, this Court, aware of the dire consequences that a different rule could bring, has aptly concluded:<br><br><blockquote>"We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of office plagued by all too common problems--dishonest or negligent subordinates, overwork, multiple assignments or positions, or plain incompetence--is suddenly swept into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not personally examine every single detail, painstakingly trace every step from inception, and investigate the motives of every person involved in a transaction before affixing his signature as the final approving authority.<br><br>"x x x x<br><br>"x x x. All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. x x x. There has to be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail. Any executive head of even small government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices or department is even more appalling."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated August 30, 2007 and Resolution dated March 10, 2008 of the Sandiganbayan in  Criminal Case Nos. 27944, 27946, 27952, 27953, &amp; 27954 are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
