				<BR><STRONG>PERALTA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to annul and set aside the Resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 25, 2005 and April 5, 2005, issued by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 88160.<br><br>The antecedents are as follows:<br><br>On November 28, 1991, an Information for murder committed against Emmanuel Mendoza was filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 6, Tanauan, Batangas, against Joven de Grano (Joven), Armando de Grano (Armando), and Estanislao Lacaba (Estanislao), together with their co-accused Leonides Landicho (Leonides), Domingo Landicho (Domingo), and Leonardo Genil (Leonardo), who were at-large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; It was docketed as Criminal Case No. 2730, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on April 21, 1991, between 9:00 o'clock and 10:00 o'clock in the evening, in Barangay Balakilong, [M]unicipality of Laurel, [P]rovince of Batangas, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, all the above named accused, conspiring, confederating, and helping one another, motivated by common design and intent to kill, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, and by means of treachery and with evident premeditation, shoot EMMANUEL MENDOZA with firearms, inflicting upon him eight gunshot wounds and causing his death thereby, thus committing the crime of MURDER to the damage and prejudice of his heirs in the amount&nbsp; as the Honorable Court shall determine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Duly arraigned, Joven, Armando, and Estanislao pleaded "not guilty" to the crime as charged; while their co-accused Leonides, Leonardo, and Domingo remained at-large.&nbsp; Thereafter, respondents filed a motion for bail contending that the prosecution's evidence was not strong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, considering that one of the accused was the incumbent Mayor of Laurel, Batangas at the time when the crime was committed, Senior State Prosecutor Hernani T. Barrios moved that the venue be transferred from the RTC, Branch 6, Tanauan, Batangas to any RTC in Manila. Consequently, the case was transferred to the RTC Manila for re-raffling amongst its Branches.&nbsp; The case was re-docketed as Criminal Case No. 93-129988 and was initially re-raffled to Branches 6, 9, and 11 before being finally raffled to Branch 27, RTC, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Before transferring the case to the RTC, Branch 27, Manila, the trial court deferred the resolution of respondents' motion for bail and allowed the prosecution to present evidence.&nbsp; Thereafter, the hearing of the application for bail ensued, wherein the prosecution presented Teresita and Dr. Leonardo Salvador. After finding that the prosecution's evidence to prove treachery and evident premeditation was not strong, the RTC, Branch 11, Manila, granted respondents' motion for bail.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration was filed, but it was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The prosecution then filed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 41110, which was denied.&nbsp; Aggrieved, they sought recourse before this Court in G.R. No. 129604.&nbsp; In a Resolution dated July 12, 1999, this Court granted the petition and set aside the decision of the CA together with the Order of the RTC granting bail to the respondents. The RTC was also ordered to immediately issue a warrant of arrest against the accused. The resolution was also qualified to be immediately executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; As a result, Estanislao was re-arrested, but Joven and Armando were not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>However, upon respondents' motion for reconsideration, this Court, in a Resolution dated September 4, 2001, resolved to remand the case to the RTC. We noted that, in view of the transmittal of the records of the case to this Court in connection with the petition, the trial court deferred the rendition of its decision.&nbsp; Consequently, the case was remanded to the RTC for further proceedings, including the rendition of its decision on the merits.<br><br>After the presentation of the parties' respective sets of evidence, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated April 25, 2002, finding several accused guilty of the offense as charged, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, CONSIDERING ALL THE FOREGOING, this Court finds the accused JOVEN DE GRANO, ARMANDO DE GRANO, DOMINGO LANDICHO and ESTANISLAO LACABA, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER, qualified by treachery, and there being no modifying circumstance attendant, hereby sentences them to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, and to indemnify the heirs of Emmanuel Mendoza the sum of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>The case as against accused Leonides Landicho and Leonardo Genil is hereby sent to the files or archived cases to be revived as soon as said accused are apprehended.<br><br>Let alias warrants of arrest be issued against accused Leonardo Genil and Leonides Landicho.</blockquote><br>Only Estanislao was present at the promulgation despite due notice to the other respondents.<br><br>Respondents, thru counsel, then filed a Joint Motion for Reconsideration dated May 8, 2002, praying that the Decision dated April 25, 2002 be reconsidered and set aside and a new one be entered acquitting them based on the following grounds, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>1. The Honorable Court erred in basing the decision of conviction of all accused solely on the biased, uncorroborated and baseless testimony of Teresita Duran, the common-law wife of the victim;<br><br>2. The Honorable Court erred in not giving exculpatory weight to the evidence adduced by the defense, which was amply corroborated on material points;<br><br>3. The Honorable Court erred in not finding that the failure of the prosecution to present rebuttal evidence renders the position of the defense unrebutted;<br><br>4. The Honorable Court erred in adopting conditional or preliminary finding of treachery of the Supreme Court in its Resolution dated July 12, 1999; and<br><br>5. The Honorable Court erred in rendering a verdict [sic] of conviction despite the fact that the guilt of all the accused were not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Opposition, the prosecution pointed out that while the accused jointly moved for the reconsideration of the decision, all of them, except Estanislao, were at-large.&nbsp; Having opted to become fugitives and be beyond the judicial ambit, they lost their right to file such motion for reconsideration and to ask for whatever relief from the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Acting on respondents' motion for reconsideration, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated April 15, 2004 modifying its earlier decision by acquitting Joven and Armando, and downgrading the conviction of Domingo and Estanislao from murder to homicide.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the Order reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, </b>the Court modifies its decision and finds accused <b>DOMINGO LANDICHO and ESTANISLAO LACABA, "GUILTY"</b> beyond reasonable doubt, as principal of the crime of <b>Homicide, </b>and in default of any modifying circumstance, sentences them to an indeterminate prison term of SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of Prision Mayor, as minimum, to TWELVE YEARS [and] ONE DAY of Reclusion Temporal, as maximum.&nbsp; Said accused shall be credited with the full period of their preventive imprisonment pursuant to B.P. Blg. 85.<br><br>Accused <b>ARMANDO DE GRANO </b>and <b>JOVEN DE GRANO</b> are hereby <b>ACQUITTED</b> on the basis of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; They are likewise declared free of any civil liability.<br><br>To the<i> </i>extent herein altered or modified, the Decision dated April 25, 2002 stands.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>Estanislao filed a Notice of Appeal, while the prosecution sought reconsideration of the Order arguing that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>There was absolutely no basis for this Court to have taken cognizance of the "Joint Motion for Reconsideration" dated May 8, 2002, citing Sec. 6, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court.<br><br></li><li>The testimony of Teresita Duran deserves credence.&nbsp; The delay in the taking of Ms. Duran's written statement of the events she witnessed is understandable considering that Joven de Grano was the mayor of the municipality where the crime was committed and that another accused, Estanislao Lacaba, was a policeman in the same municipality.<br><br></li><li>The crime committed is murder.<br><br></li><li>Accused Armando de Grano and Joven de Grano participated in the conspiracy.</li></ol></blockquote><br>On September 28, 2004, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> denying the motion and giving due course to Estanislao's notice of appeal.<br><br>Petitioner, thru Assistant City Prosecutor Cesar Glorioso of the Office of the Manila City Prosecutor, with the assistance of private prosecutor Atty. Michael E. David, filed a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA arguing that:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">the private respondents, having deliberately evaded arrest after being denied bail and deliberately failing to attend the promulgation of the Decision despite due notice, lost the right to move for reconsideration of their conviction; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">the grounds relied upon by respondent RTC in modifying its Decision are utterly erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Petitioner alleged that it had no other plain, adequate, and speedy remedy, considering that the State could not appeal a judgment of acquittal.&nbsp; However, by way of exception, a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case may be assailed in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court upon a showing by the petitioner that the lower court, in acquitting the accused, committed not only reversible errors of judgment, but also grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, or a denial of due process, thus rendering the assailed judgment void.&nbsp; Consequently, the accused cannot be considered at risk of double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Respondent De Grano filed a Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> arguing that the verification and certification portion of the petition was flawed, since it was signed only by counsel and not by the aggrieved party.&nbsp; Also, the petition did not contain the conformity of the Solicitor General.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2005, petitioner, through the private prosecutor, filed an Opposition to Motion to Dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner explained that, for lack of material time, it failed to secure the conformity of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) when it filed the petition, but it would nevertheless obtain it.&nbsp; A day after filing the petition, the private prosecutor sought the OSG's conformity in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 12, 2005. The OSG, in turn, informed the private prosecutor that rather than affixing its belated conformity, it would rather await the initial resolution of the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Also, so as not to preempt the action of the Department of Justice (DOJ) on the case, the OSG instructed the private prosecutor to secure the necessary endorsement from the DOJ for it to pursue the case.&nbsp; Anent the verification and certification of the petition having been signed by the private prosecutor, petitioner explained that private complainant Teresita was in fear for her life as a result of the acquittal of former Mayor Joven de Grano, but she was willing to certify the petition should she be given ample time to travel to Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>However, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated January 25, 2005, which was received by the petitioner on the same day it filed its Opposition or on January 31, 2005, the petition was dismissed outright by the CA on the grounds that it was not filed by the OSG and that the assailed Orders were only photocopies and not certified true copies.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Resolution reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, this petition is hereby <b>OUTRIGHTLY DISMISSED</b>.</blockquote><br>Petitioner timely filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In addition to the justifications it raised in its earlier Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, petitioner argued that the petition was not only signed by the private prosecutor, it was also signed by the prosecutor who represented the petitioner in the criminal proceedings before the trial court.&nbsp; Petitioner also maintains that the certified true copies of the assailed Orders were accidentally attached to its file copy instead of the one it submitted.&nbsp; To rectify the mistake, it attached the certified true copies of the assailed Orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This was opposed by the respondents in their Comment/Opposition to Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, in its 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated March 15, 2005, DOJ Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez, endorsed the petition filed by the Assistant City Prosecutor, with the assistance of the private prosecutor, to the Solicitor General for his conformity.<br><br>On April 5, 2005, the CA issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> denying the motion, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, petitioner's motion for reconsideration is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.</blockquote><br>In denying the motion, the CA opined that the rule on double jeopardy prohibits the state from appealing or filing a petition for review of a judgment of acquittal that was based on the merits of the case.&nbsp; If there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom, if it will not put the accused in double jeopardy, on the criminal aspect, may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General.&nbsp; It added that a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court may be filed by the person aggrieved. In such case, the aggrieved parties are the State and the private offended party or complainant.&nbsp; Moreover, the records reveal that the petition was not filed in the name of the offended party; and worse, the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to the petition was signed not by the private offended party, but by her counsel.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the efforts exerted by the petitioner to secure the confirmation of the OSG and the endorsement of the DOJ, there is no showing of any subsequent participation of the OSG in the case.<br><br>Hence, the petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI ON THE GROUND OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY.<br><br>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI FOR NOT HAVING BEEN FILED BY THE OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL NOR IN THE NAME OF THE OFFENDED PARTY.<br><br>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR AND GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI ON THE GROUND THAT THE VERIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION ATTACHED TO THE PETITION WAS SIGNED BY THE PRIVATE COUNSEL AND NOT BY THE OFFENDED PARTY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner, through the Solicitor General, argues that, except for Estanislao, none of the respondents appeared at the promulgation of the Decision.&nbsp; Neither did they surrender after promulgation of the judgment of conviction, nor filed a motion for leave to avail themselves of the judicial remedies against the decision, stating the reasons for their absence.&nbsp; The trial court thus had no authority to take cognizance of the joint motion for reconsideration filed by the respondents as stated in Section 6, Rule 120 of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.&nbsp; As such, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Having been issued without jurisdiction, the Order dated April 15, 2004 is void.&nbsp; Consequently, no double jeopardy attached to such void Order. The CA, therefore, committed reversible error when it dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari </i>on the ground of double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also contends that, with the endorsement of the DOJ and the letter of the OSG manifesting its intention to pursue the petition, the OSG had in fact conformed to the filing of the petition and agreed to pursue the same.&nbsp; Had the CA given the OSG ample time to file the necessary pleading, the petition would not have been dismissed for the reason that it was filed by the said office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>With respect to the verification and certification of non-forum shopping, petitioner invokes a liberal application of the Rules for private complainant's failure to personally sign it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner maintains that out of extreme fear arising from the unexpected acquittal of Joven, private complainant was reluctant to travel to Manila. After she was taken out of the witness protection program, she took refuge in the Visayas and she was there at the time her signature was required.&nbsp; Since the period for filing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was about to lapse, and it could not be filed without the verification and certification of non-forum shopping, the private prosecutor was left with no option but so sign it, instead of allowing the deadline to pass without filing the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Moreover, petitioner maintains that the OSG has the authority to sign the verification and certification of the present petition, because the real party-in-interest is the OSG itself as the representative of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On their part, respondents contend that the petition for <i>certiorari </i>questioning the order of acquittal is not allowed and is contrary to the principle of double jeopardy.&nbsp; Respondents argue that, contrary to the OSG's contention, respondents Joven and Domingo's absence during the promulgation of the Decision dated April 25, 2002 did not deprive the trial court of its authority to resolve their Joint Motion for Reconsideration, considering that one of the accused, Estanislao, was present during the promulgation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Joven, Armando, and Domingo maintain that while they were not present during the promulgation of the RTC Decision, Estanislao, who was under police custody, attended the promulgation of the said Decision. Thus, when they filed their Joint Motion for Reconsideration, which included that of Estanislao, the RTC was not deprived of its authority to resolve the joint motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondents insist that the CA properly dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari, </i>as it was not instituted by the OSG on behalf of the People of the Philippines, and that the verification and certification portion thereof was not signed by private complainant Teresita.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Respondents also argue that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> before this Court should be dismissed, since the verification and certification thereof were signed by a solicitor of the OSG, not private complainant.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Before considering the merits of the petition, we will first address the technical objections raised by respondents.<br><br>As regards the issue of the signatory of the verification and certification of non-forum shopping, a liberal application of the Rules should be applied to the present case.<br><br>The purpose of requiring a verification is to secure an assurance that the allegations in the petition have been made in good faith; or are true and correct, not merely speculative.&nbsp; This requirement is simply a condition affecting the form of pleadings, and noncompliance therewith does not necessarily render it fatally defective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Truly, verification is only a formal, not a jurisdictional, requirement.&nbsp; Hence, it was sufficient that the private prosecutor signed the verification.<br><br>With respect to the certification of non-forum shopping, it has been held that the certification requirement is rooted in the principle that a party-litigant shall not be allowed to pursue simultaneous remedies in different <i>fora</i>, as this practice is detrimental to an orderly judicial procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; However, this Court has relaxed, under justifiable circumstances, the rule requiring the submission of such certification considering that although it is obligatory, it is not jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Not being jurisdictional, it can be relaxed under the rule of substantial compliance.<br><br>In <i>Donato v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> </i>and<i> Wee v. Galvez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court noted that the petitioners were already in the United States; thus, the signing of the certification by their authorized representatives was deemed sufficient compliance with the Rules.&nbsp; In <i>Sy Chin v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><i> </i>the Court upheld substantial justice and ruled that the failure of the parties to sign the certification may be overlooked, as the parties' case was meritorious.&nbsp; In <i>Torres v. Specialized Packaging and Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court also found, among other reasons, that the extreme difficulty to secure all the required signatures and the apparent merits of the substantive aspects of the case constitute compelling reasons for allowing the petition.<br><br>In <i>Ortiz v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and similar rulings, the following has always been pointed out:<br><br><blockquote>The attestation contained in the certification on non-forum shopping requires personal knowledge by the party who executed the same. <i>To merit the Court's consideration, petitioners here must show reasonable cause for failure to personally sign the certification. The petitioners must convince the court that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of justice</i>.</blockquote><br>Thus, petitioners need only show that there was reasonable cause for the failure to sign the certification against forum shopping, and that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>We find that the particular circumstances of this case advance valid reasons for private complainant's failure to sign the certification.&nbsp; As pointed out in the petition, it was out of extreme fear that private complainant failed to personally sign the certification.&nbsp; It is to be noted that when Armando and Joven were acquitted, Teresita was already out of the witness protection program and was in hiding in the Visayas.&nbsp; As such, she could not travel to Manila to personally sign the petition.&nbsp; Moreover, as maintained by the petitioner, since the period for filing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was about to lapse, the private prosecutor was left with no option but to sign the verification and certification, instead of allowing the period to file the petition to pass without it being filed.&nbsp; A relaxation of the procedural rules, considering the particular circumstances, is justified.&nbsp; The requirement was thus substantially complied with.<br><br>As summarized in <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> when a strict and literal application of the rules on non-forum shopping and verification would result in a patent denial of substantial justice, they may be liberally construed.&nbsp; An unforgiving application of the pertinent provisions of the Rules will not be given premium if it would impede rather than serve the best interests of justice in the light of the prevailing circumstances in the case under consideration.<br><br>We reiterate our holding in <i>City Warden of the Manila City Jail</i> <i>v. Estrella</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><i> </i>that the signature of the Solicitor General on the verification and certification of non-forum shopping in a petition before the CA or with this Court is substantial compliance with the requirement under the Rules, considering that the OSG is the legal representative of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and its agencies and instrumentalities; more so, in a criminal case where the People or the State is the real party-in-interest and is the aggrieved party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Also, respondents' contention that there is no showing of any subsequent participation of the OSG in the petition before the CA does not hold water.&nbsp; In the letter dated January 18, 2004, the OSG instructed the private prosecutor to secure the necessary endorsement from the DOJ for it to pursue the case.&nbsp; In its 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated March 15, 2005, DOJ Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez, endorsed the petition to the Solicitor General for his conformity.&nbsp; When the CA denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration for its outright dismissal of the petition, the OSG filed motions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> for extension of time to file the present petition.&nbsp; Moreover, the OSG filed a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> on respondents' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, any doubt regarding the endorsement, conformity, and participation of the OSG in the petitions is dispelled.<br><br>Now on the substantive aspect.<br><br>A peculiar situation exists in the instant case.&nbsp; Petitioner has sought recourse before the CA, <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65, from an Order of the trial court drastically modifying its earlier findings convicting the respondents of the crime of murder, by acquitting Joven and Armando, and downgrading the convictions of their co-accused from murder to homicide; this, notwithstanding that all the accused, except Estanislao Lacaba, failed to personally appear at the promulgation of the Decision despite due notice thereof.<br><br>Petitioner contends that its petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with the CA was the proper remedy, since the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it entertained the Joint Motion for Reconsideration with respect to Armando and Joven despite the fact that they had not regained their standing in court.<br><br>Petitioner's recourse to the CA was correct.<br><br>A writ of <i>certiorari</i> is warranted when (1) any tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (2) there is no appeal,&nbsp; nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> An act of a court or tribunal may be considered as grave abuse of discretion when the same was performed in a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty, or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner because of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>By way of exception, a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case may be assailed in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, but only upon a clear showing by the petitioner that the lower court, in acquitting the accused, committed not merely reversible errors of judgment but also grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, or to a denial of due process, thus rendering the assailed judgment void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; In which event, the accused cannot be considered at risk of double jeopardy — the revered constitutional safeguard against exposing the accused to the risk of answering twice for the same offense.<br><br>Double jeopardy has the following essential elements: (1) the accused is charged under a complaint or an information sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction;
