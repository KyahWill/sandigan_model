His embarkation was made in fulfillment of his contractual obligation pursuant to the 7 August 2001 POEA-SEC he signed with respondent Algosaibi.  According to the pertinent pages of his Seaman's Book, petitioner Nisda's latest deployment lasted until 7 March 2002, the day he again disembarked from the vessel <i>M/V Algosaibi-22</i> at the port of Gizan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, only to embark the very next day, 8 March 2002, on another vessel, <i>M/V Algosaibi-42</i>, this time, at the port of Tanjib, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.<br><br>On 5 May 2002, petitioner Nisda was brought to the <i>Dar Al-Ta'afi Medical Services</i> complaining of "<i>pain of parascapular region of 6 months duration [with] paresthesia and numbness of both upper limbs</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  In a <i>Medical Report</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><i> </i>issued by one Dr. Hossam A. Abubeih, an Orthopedist, petitioner Nisda was diagnosed to be suffering from "Myositis of Parascapular (indistinct symbol) [with] Paresthesia on upper limbs."  When examined, petitioner Nisda's blood pressure turned out to be 160/100 mm/Hg; thus, he was advised to follow-up "<i>for BP taking regularly</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>According to petitioner Nisda, on account of the illness he suffered while on board <i>M/V Algosaibi-42</i>, he signed off and disembarked from said vessel at the port of Rastanura, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 17 July 2002, and was repatriated to his point of hire, <i>i.e.</i>, Quezon City, Philippines.  Within three days from his arrival in the Philippines, petitioner Nisda claimed to have presented himself at the office of Nobel for the requisite post-employment medical examination, in compliance with the reportorial requirement under Sec. 20(B) of his POEA-SEC.  However, petitioner Nisda was allegedly asked to return a week after for the necessary physical examination at the St. Magdalene Diagnostic Clinic, Inc., the accredited medical service provider of Nobel.<br><br>In the meantime, petitioner Nisda went home to Miagao, Iloilo, on 18 July 2002. Only a day after arriving in Miagao, Iloilo, petitioner Nisda complained of difficulty in breathing and chest pains radiating to the back, the same condition for which he was brought to the clinic in Saudi Arabia in May 2002.  Petitioner Nisda went to see a Dr. Geraldine Monteclaro Torrefiel, an internist who specialized in allergy, asthma and immunology.  In a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated 19 July 2002, Dr. Torrefiel confirmed that she saw petitioner Nisda on even date and reported that -<br><br><blockquote>[B]ecause of chest pain which radiates to the back associated with exertional dyspnea. I therefore recommend him to see a cardiologist for a complete cardiac evaluation and management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>On 22 July 2002, petitioner Nisda went back to Nobel and was sent to St. Magdalene Diagnostic Clinic, Inc.  An electrocardiograph<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (ECG or EKG) of petitioner Nisda's heart was done at the said clinic, and the test result<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> revealed that he had -<br><br><blockquote>Normal Sinus Rhythm<br>LVH<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> w/ strain and/or ischemia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>In view of his ECG/EKG result, petitioner Nisda was referred, on 24 August 2002, by St. Magdalene Diagnostic Clinic, Inc. to St. Luke's Medical Center for a coronary angiogram.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Said test was conducted on petitioner Nisda on 25 August 2002. The Coronary Angiogram Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> contained the following details -<br><br><blockquote><i>IMPRESSION:</i>      <i>Severe Three Vessel Coronary Artery Disease</i><br><i>                            LV Diastolic Dysfunction</i></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing Coronary Angiogram Report, cardiologists impressed upon petitioner Nisda the necessity of a bypass operation.  Hence, absent further ado, in view of the seriousness of his condition, petitioner Nisda underwent a <i>triple</i> [coronary artery] <i>bypass surgery</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> at the Makati Medical Center on 5 September 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  On 6 September 2002, the Makati Heart Foundation provided respondent ADAMS the "hospital package"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> for petitioner Nisda's bypass operation.  It would appear from the record that there was no response from respondent ADAMS.<br><br>A couple of months thereafter, petitioner Nisda obtained a medical certificate from a certain Dr. Levi Rejuso, an internist who specialized in neurology, declaring that -<br><br><blockquote>Upon review of [petitioner Nisda's] history and as per recommendation by his cardiologist (sic) he is refrained (sic) from doing stressful activities. In this regard (sic) he can no longer perform his duties as a Ship Master and is categorized with grade I disability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>The lack of response from respondent ADAMS and Nobel regarding petitioner Nisda's request for payment of disability benefits was deafening.  Hence, petitioner Nisda was "forced" to engage the services of counsel.  In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 4 November 2002, a formal demand was made against the foreign employer, respondent ADAMS, and its local manning agent, Nobel, for the payment of the following:<br><blockquote><ol><li>the amount of <u>US$60,000.00</u> as his disability benefit under the POEA Contract;<br><br></li><li>the amount of <u>US$6,600.00</u> as illness as allowance for 120 days, and;<br><br></li><li>reimbursement of medical, hospital, surgery and medicine expenses in the amount of <u>P675,000.00</u>.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Despite the formal demand, respondent ADAMS and Nobel still failed to pay petitioner Nisda's claims.  Consequently, petitioner Nisda instituted a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> against respondent ADAMS, Nobel, and Guerrero, with the NLRC on 16 January 2003, alleging that "while under contract on board and on vacation pay [he] was medically ill,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> with "severe coronary heart disease, <i>etc.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Nisda anchored his claim for disability benefit on Section (Sec.) 20(B), paragraph 6 of his POEA-SEC, which, as earlier mentioned, incorporated the <i>2000</i> <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i>, and thus provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS<br><br>x x x x<br><br>B.  COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS<br><br>The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><ol start="6"><li>In case of permanent total or partial disability of the seafarer caused by either injury or illness the seafarer shall be compensated in accordance with the schedule of benefits enumerated in Section 32 of this Contract. Computation of his benefits arising from an illness or disease shall be governed by the rates and the rules of compensation applicable at the time the illness or disease was contracted.</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br>Petitioner Nisda claimed that the abovequoted provision entitled him to claim disability benefits or compensation from his foreign employer, respondent ADAMS, and its local manning agent, Nobel, since his illness was supposedly contracted during the term of his POEA-SEC. Likewise, petitioner Nisda prayed for the award of moral and exemplary damages due to the supposed deliberate and wanton refusal of respondent ADAMS and Nobel to pay his monetary claims.<br><br>While petitioner Nisda's Complaint was pending before the NLRC, respondent ADAMS remitted on 16 March 2003 to the Makati Medical Center and Makati Heart Foundation the amounts of Four Thousand Three Hundred Eighty-Nine Dollars and Forty Cents (US$4,389.40) and Five Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Seven Dollars and Thirty-Three Cents (US$5,997.33), respectively, representing medical and/or hospital expenses, including professional fees of the attending physicians, arising from petitioner Nisda's bypass operation.<br><br>Nobel and Guerrero rebutted petitioner Nisda's Complaint before the NLRC, averring that "[t]he illness benefits being claimed by the complainant are not compensable under the POEA Standard Contract as they occurred after the expiration of the complainant's employment contract";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that "[t]he foreign principal already remitted the payment for the medical expenses of the complainant";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and that Guerrero was not personally liable for the complainant's alleged claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On 12 May 2003, Nobel and Guerrero filed a <i>Motion</i> <i>to</i> <i>Implead</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> herein respondent Sea Serve Maritime Agency (respondent Sea Serve) on the ground that respondent ADAMS had already transferred its accreditation to the former as evidenced by the <i>Affidavit of Assumption of Responsibility</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> executed by one Josephine A. Jocson (Jocson), Managing Director of respondent Sea Serve on 5 May 2003.  In said Affidavit, affiant Jocson deposed and stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that -<br><br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>That as agent in the Philippines of the above principal in the Philippines (sic) our company assumes full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations to the seafarers originally recruited and processed by Nobel Shipping Inc. for the vessel(s) MV Algosaibi 1, 2, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; MV Midnight Arrow; Algosaibi 21<br><br></li><li>That in case of our failure to effect all contractual obligations of the principal to its seafarers, DOLE/POEA shall impose the necessary penalties in accordance with its Rules and Regulations, including but not limited to suspension/cancellation of our license/authority as well as confiscation of bonus.</li></ol></blockquote><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated 23 July 2003, Labor Arbiter Fatima Jambaro-Franco found petitioner Nisda's Complaint meritorious. The decretal part of said Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering the respondents Nobel Ship Services, Inc./Annabel Guerrero/Khalifa A. Algosaibi Diving &amp; Marine Services Company to jointly and severally pay complainant Carlos N. Nisda the amount of Seventy Three Thousand Two Hundred Sixty US Dollars (US$73,260.00) or its equivalent in Philippine Peso at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of actual payment representing his disability benefits, sickness allowance and attorney's fees.<br><br>All other claims are DISMISSED for lack of merit.</blockquote><br>The Labor Arbiter found that there was no doubt that petitioner Nisda's heart condition was contracted during his 15 long years of employment with respondent ADAMS.  Factors of said employment, <i>i.e.</i>, 12-hour work days and the different weather conditions he was exposed to, predisposed said seafarer to heart disease. In ruling that petitioner Nisda suffered from a permanent disability with a Grade 1 disability or impediment rating, the Labor Arbiter relied on the Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> issued by Dr. Levi Rejuso, a neurologist which states:<br><br><blockquote>This is to certify that Mr. Carlos N. Nisda, 60/M came in today for his check-up. Upon review of his history and as per recommendation by his cardiologist (sic) he is refrained (sic) from doing stressful activities. In this regard (sic) he can no longer perform his duties as a Ship Master and is categorized with grade I disability.<br></blockquote><br>Ephraim B. Cortez (Atty. Cortez), counsel of respondent ADAMS, Nobel, and Guerrero, withdrew his appearance as counsel for said parties on 18 August 2003.<br><br>Petitioner Nisda moved, on 4 September 2003, for the issuance of a writ of execution based on the allegation that respondent ADAMS, Nobel, and Guerrero failed to appeal to the NLRC the 23 July 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>Petitioner Nisda next filed, on 22 September 2003, a <i>Manifestation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> calling the attention of the Labor Arbiter to the fact that "the dispositive portion of the decision by pure inadvertence alone, did not mention the resolved merits in the body of the decision itself adjudging Sea Serve Maritime Agency with joint and several liability with the rest of the Respondents to Complainant's monetary awards."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Acting on petitioner Nisda's Manifestation, the Labor Arbiter issued an Order dated 30 September 2003, amending the <i>fallo </i>of the 23 July 2003 Decision to add the name of respondent Sea Serve to the list of those jointly and severally liable for petitioner Nisda's money claims.<br><br>Atty. Cortez filed another notice, on 29 September 2003, which reiterated his withdrawal as counsel of record for respondent ADAMS, Nobel, and Guerrero.<br><br>On 10 October 2003, respondent Sea Serve received a copy of the 30 September 2003 <i>Order</i> of the Labor Arbiter amending the dispositive portion of her 23 July 2003 Decision.  Apparently, it was only on said date that respondent Sea Serve learned of the adverse decision rendered against it and its foreign principal, respondent ADAMS. Alarmed, on 14 October 2003, Atty. Jedrek C. Ng (Atty. Ng), counsel of respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, personally "went to the office of the Labor Arbiter Fatima Jambaro-Franco to verify the records of the case x x x [and] discovered that through mistake, the respondent-appellant [Sea Serve] was not furnished a copy of the <i>Decision</i> x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On 20 October 2003, six days after obtaining a copy of the 23 July 2003 <i>Decision</i> of the Labor Arbiter, respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS filed their <i>Memorandum of Appeal</i> before the NLRC.  They maintained that petitioner Nisda's heart ailment was diagnosed long after his 7 August 2001 POEA-SEC expired on 21 September 2002, so he was no longer entitled to disability benefits under said contract.  Petitioner Nisda likewise could not claim any benefits under his 30 August 2001 employment contract, which he signed directly with respondent ADAMS, and which had no force and effect in this jurisdiction absent the prior approval of the POEA.<br><br>Petitioner Nisda later on filed a <i>Motion for Immediate Remand for Execution</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> on the argument that the joint appeal filed by respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS was deemed not perfected for lack of the requisite appeal bond.  He cited the 3 November 2003 <i>Memorandum</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> issued by then NLRC Chairperson Roy Señeres stating that the Acropolis Central Guaranty Corporation, the surety company that posted the appeal bond for respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, was not authorized to transact business in courts all over the Philippines.<br><br>The Third Division of the NLRC promulgated its <i>Decision</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> on 14 May 2004, ruling in favor of respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, thereby reversing the Labor Arbiter's Decision dated 23 July 2003. The dispositive portion of the subject Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: a) dismissing the instant complaint against respondent-appellant Sea Serve Maritime Agency; b) denying the claims of complainant Carlos N. Nisda for disability benefits; and c) upholding respondent Khalifa A. Algosaibi Diving Marine Services' payment of the amounts of US$4,389.40 and US$5,997.33, to the Makati Medical Center and Makati Heart Foundation, respectively, as payment for the hospital expenses of complainant.<br></blockquote><br>The NLRC gave due course to the joint appeal filed by respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, since there was substantial compliance with the rules on appeal, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the surety bond issued by Acropolis Central Guarantee Corporation was posted on October 17, 2003, or prior to the issuance of the Memorandum dated November 3, 2003, issued by the NLRC Chairman depriving Acropolis of its accreditation. Respondents cannot be faulted for this unexpected and supervening development, and to pin the blame on them would be tantamount to putting a premium on technicalities and deprive them of procedural due process. Besides, the issue has since become moot and academic, inasmuch as respondents-appellants have complied and transferred its surety bond to a duly authorized bonding company, i.e., South Sea Surety &amp; Guarantee Insurance Co., Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Anent the substantive matter of the appeal, the NLRC initially ruled that respondent Sea Serve could not be held liable with respondent ADAMS for the claim of petitioner Nisda, "inasmuch as the execution of the employment contract, illness, operation and the filing of the instant case all occurred before respondent Sea Serve was impleaded in the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  Nonetheless, the foregoing pronouncement was deemed <i>functus</i> <i>officio</i> when the NLRC eventually reversed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed petitioner Nisda's claim for payment of disability benefits on the ground that his POEA-SEC had long expired when his illness arose.  The NLRC, referring to Secs. 2(B) and 20(B) of the POEA-SEC, which incorporated the <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i>, ratiocinated that:<br><br><blockquote>It necessarily follows that in order for an employer to be held liable to the seafarer on account of the latter's illness, the cause thereof must arise during the term of a duly approved POEA contract, which obviously did not happen in the case at bar. In addition, complainant violated the Rules and Regulations of the POEA by entering into a contract exceeding 12 months. He even deceived respondent Nobel by deliberately executing another contract without its consent and sans any approval from the POEA. In his 15 years of working overseas, he cannot feign ignorance of that basic requirement. Thus, for not coming to court with clean hands and in order to prevent complainant from profiting from his own deception, basic rules of fair play dictate that we deny complainant's claim for disability and other medical benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner Nisda's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC for lack of merit in a <i>Resolution </i>dated 26 September 2004.<br><br>Undaunted, petitioner Nisda filed an original action for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals imputing grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, to the NLRC for reversing the 23 July 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>In a Decision rendered on 27 September 2006, the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner Nisda's Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>for lack of merit<i>.</i>  The appellate court affirmed the challenged 14 May 2004 <i>Decision </i>and 26 September 2004 <i>Resolution</i> of the NLRC, reasoning thus:<br><br><blockquote>It appears that on May 5, 2002, as certified by the Dar Al Ta'afi Medical Services Co., Ltd. In Saudi Arabia, the petitioner sought medical attention from the said institution due to a complaint of "pain of parascapular region of 6 months duration with parasthesia and numbness of both upper limbs." [Petitioner Nisda] was diagnosed of having Myositis of Parascapular with Paresthesia on upper limbs. He was thus advised to check his blood pressure regularly. He was repatriated on July 17, 2002. Thereafter, his heart ailment was discovered, then he underwent an open heart surgery. Subsequently, he filed the monetary claims against the respondents.<br><br>[Petitioner Nisda] based his claims under Section 20(B) of the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing Seafarers On-Board Ocean Going Vessels, most commonly known as the POEA-SEC (Standard Employment Contract). This section specifically provides for the liabilities of the employer for an injury or illness suffered by a seaman during the term of his contract. Primarily, for an injury or illness to be duly compensated under the POEA-SEC, there must be a showing that such injury or illness occurred or was suffered during the effectivity of the employment contract. The same is true with respect to any disability caused by either injury or illness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, the Court of Appeals concluded that:<br><br><blockquote>[Petitioner Nisda] is claiming compensation for an illness suffered beyond the effectivity and enforceability of the POEA approved contract. While he was allegedly repatriated due to an illness on July 17, 2002, his POEA approved contract apparently expired on May 22, 2002. He cannot insists (sic) that his illness commenced on May 5, 2002 when he once sought medical treatment in Saudi Arabia because he has not shown any evidence to prove that there is a correlation between "Myositis of Parascapular with Paresthesia on upper limbs" and his heart ailment.<br><br>Neither can the petitioner invoke the existence of the second contract to hold the respondents liable to his claims pursuant to the provisions of POEA-SEC. The said contract was executed in violation of the POEA Rules and Regulations. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>And the NLRC decreed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

This clearly involves a factual inquiry, the determination of which is not the statutory function of this Court.  As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in and resolved by this Court on petitions brought under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.  "The reason being that the Court is not a trier of facts; it is not duty-bound to re-examine and calibrate the evidence on record. Moreover, findings of fact of quasi-judicial bodies like the NLRC, as affirmed by the [Court of Appeals], are generally conclusive on this Court".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In exceptional cases, however, we may be constrained to delve into and resolve factual issues when there is insufficient or insubstantial evidence to support the findings of the tribunal or court below, or when too much is concluded, inferred or deduced from the bare or incomplete facts submitted by the parties, or where the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC came up with conflicting positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  The case at bar constitutes one of these exceptional cases.<br><br>The first error imputed by petitioner Nisda to the Court of Appeals essentially concerns the issue of jurisdiction, <i>i.e.</i>, whether or not the NLRC and Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to alter, modify or reverse the 23 July 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter that had, allegedly, already attained finality.  Petitioner Nisda asserts that the Labor Arbiter's Decision dated 23 July 2003 was already final and executory, since respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS (1) filed their appeal with the NLRC beyond the ten-day reglementary period provided by the NLRC Rules of Procedure; and (2) failed to perfect their appeal before the NLRC because they were not able to post the requisite appeal bond.<br><br>We are not persuaded.  After a careful review of the records of the case, we see no reason to disturb the finding of the NLRC and the Court of Appeals that the joint appeal filed by respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS was duly filed and perfected in compliance with the NLRC Rules of Procedure.<br><br>In the first place, nowhere in the records of the present petition is it shown that, indeed, respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS were notified of the adverse 23 July 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter.  It must be remembered that, by virtue of the <i>Affidavit of Assumption of Responsibility</i> dated 5 May 2003, respondent Sea Serve assumed "full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations to the seafarers originally recruited and processed by Nobel Shipping Inc. for the vessel(s) <i>MV Algosaibi</i> 1, 2, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 &amp; MV Midnight Arrow; <i>Algosaibi 21</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Said affidavit was made pursuant to Sec. 6, Rule I,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Book III,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the 1991 POEA Rules and Regulation Governing Overseas Employment, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Transfer of Accreditation.</i> - The accreditation of a principal or a project may be transferred to another agency provided that transfer shall not involve any diminution of wages and benefits of workers.<br><br>The transferee agency in these instances shall comply with the requirements for accreditation andshall assume full and complete responsibility to all contractual obligations of the principals to its workers originally recruited andprocessed by the former agency.  Prior to the transfer of accreditation, the Administration shall notify the previous agency and principal of such application.</blockquote><br>Let it be made clear that there is no issue as to the assumption by respondent Sea Serve of any accountability that may arise or may have arisen from the employment contracts previously instituted and processed by Nobel for respondent ADAMS; or the relief of Nobel from its contractual obligations to the Filipino overseas workers whose employment contracts it processed for respondent ADAMS.  The transferee agency, respondent Sea Serve, had assumed long ago from Nobel, the full and complete responsibility of the contractual obligations of the principal, respondent ADAMS, including the alleged liability to petitioner Nisda that is subject of the case at bar.  That being the case, therefore, it was imperative upon the Labor Arbiter to have notified respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS of the adverse decision taken against them.  Unfortunately, the Labor Arbiter failed to take into account the import of aforementioned transfer of accreditation.  This omission is obvious from the face of the Notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> dated 1 August 2003, attached to the Labor Arbiter's <i>Decision</i> dated 23 July 2003, which informed merely petitioner Nisda and his counsel, Nobel, Guerrero and their counsel.<br><br>In as much as respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS were left in the dark, so to speak, how can they be expected to question something that they have no knowledge of?  It is indisputable that service of the decision of the labor arbiter should be made on parties or their counsel, and the reglementary period for filing an appeal shall be reckoned from the date of such service.  Not until respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS were served notice of the 23 July 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter, the reglementary period for them to appeal the same to the NLRC had not yet commenced.  The 10-day reglementary period to appeal to the NLRC only started to run on 14 October 2003, when Atty. Ng, counsel for respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, was able to personally secure a copy of the Labor Arbiter's Decision dated 23 July 2003.  Therefore, the Joint Appeal Memorandum, filed by respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS on 20 October 2003, just six days after receiving notice and copy of the appealed Decision of the Labor Arbiter, was not filed belatedly.<br><br>And secondly, as for petitioner Nisda's contention of non-perfection of the appeal of respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS for failure of the latter two to post the appeal bond, the Court of Appeals succinctly addressed the same as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is not disputed that the respondents' Memorandum of Appeal had already been perfected, with the filing of the requisite appeal bond within the 10-day mandatory period, when the Memorandum of the NLRC concerning the disaccreditation of Acropolis Central Guaranty Corporation, which has the effect of rendering the appeals with bond posted by the said company not perfected, was released. But, just like what the NLRC Chair stated in his letter dated February 10, 2004, the said Memorandum should be applied prospectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are of the view that the second, more critical, error imputed by petitioner Nisda against the Court of Appeals, concerning the denial of his right to disability benefits, must be sustained given the factual milieu of the present case.  Sifting through the evidence on record, we are ineluctably convinced that the conclusion of the NLRC and the appellate court, that petitioner Nisda's heart condition is non-compensable, rests on rather shaky foundation.<br><br>In his Petition, petitioner Nisda points out that "[he] was certified by the <i>Dar al Ta'afi</i> Medical Services Co.

But unlike that of others, deemed written in the seafarer's contract is a set of standard provisions set and implemented by the POEA, called the <i>Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i>, which are considered to be the minimum requirements acceptable to the government for the employment of Filipino seafarers on board foreign ocean-going vessels<i>.</i>  Thus, the issue of whether petitioner Nisda can legally demand and claim disability benefits from respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS for an illness suffered is best addressed by the provisions of his POEA-SEC, which incorporated the <i>Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i>.  When petitioner Nisda was employed on 7 August 2001, it was the <i>2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><i> </i>(hereinafter referred to simply as <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i> for brevity) that applied and were deemed written in or appended to his POEA-SEC.<br><br>Sec. 20(B), paragraph 6, of the <i>2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i> provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 20.

Petitioner Nisda's disease was serious enough to necessitate a Triple Bypass Operation on his heart.<br><br>Petitioner Nisda's Coronary Artery Disease was diagnosed only after numerous tests and evaluations conducted, owing to his consistent and persistent physical complaints.  His medical history was well-documented.  On 5 May 2002, petitioner Nisda was brought to the <i>Dar Al-Ta'afi Medical Services, </i>a clinic in Saudi Arabia, for <b>"<i><u>pain of parascapular region of 6 months duration [with] paresthesia and numbness of both upper limbs</u></i>."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><b> </b> Petitioner Nisda then had blood pressure of 160/100 mm/Hg.  Dr. Hossam A. Abubeih, an Orthopedist at the clinic, initially diagnosed petitioner Nisda as having <i>Myositis</i> of the parascapular region with paresthesia on the upper limbs.  On 19 July 2002, only two days after being repatriated to the Philippines, Dr. Torrefiel attended to petitioner Nisda in Iloilo when the latter suffered from <b>"<i><u>chest pain which radiates to the back associated with exertional dyspnea</u></i>."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  Dr. Torrefiel advised petitioner Nisda to undergo complete cardiac evaluation.

A barrage of cardio-vascular tests followed thereafter, including the Coronary Angiogram, to fully assess the condition of petitioner Nisda's heart.  The Coronary Angiogram irrefutably exposed petitioner Nisda's <b><i><u>Severe Three Vessel Coronary Artery Disease and Left Ventricle Diastolic Dysfunction</u></i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>According to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institutes of the National Institutes of Health,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the primary medical research agency of the United States of America,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> <i>coronary artery disease</i> is a condition in which plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries.  These arteries supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. When the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked, oxygen-rich blood cannot reach the heart muscle. This can cause <b><i><u>angina</u></i></b>, a feeling of pain in the chest area or discomfort that occurs when not enough oxygen-rich blood is flowing to an area of the heart muscle.  It may also feel like pressure or squeezing in the chest which can be felt in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.  Generally, the pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest.  Or a <b><i><u>heart attack</u></i></b>, which can occur when blood flow to an area of the heart muscle is completely blocked.  When oxygen-rich blood is prevented from reaching a specific area of the heart muscle, the tissue of the affected area can die. Another common symptom of the disease is <b><i><u>shortness of breath</u></i></b>, due to fluid build up in the lungs in the event of heart failure or when the heart cannot pump enough blood throughout the body.<br><br>The severity of these symptoms varies.  The symptoms may get more severe as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries. Some people who have coronary artery disease, however, have no signs or symptoms, and the disease may be left undiagnosed until a person shows signs and symptoms of a heart attack, heart failure, or arrhythmia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>We observe that the physical discomforts of petitioner Nisda, for which he sought medical attention as early as 5 May 2002 when he was brought to the clinic in Saudi Arabia, bear the hallmarks of coronary artery disease.  Such disease does not develop overnight.  The plaque in the coronary arteries would have taken months, if not years, to build up, making it highly probable that petitioner Nisda already had the disease during the life of his POEA-SEC, although it went undiagnosed because he had yet to experience the symptoms.<br><br>In <i>Seagull Shipmanagement and Transport, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> we awarded benefits to the heirs of the seafarer therein who worked as a radioman on board a vessel; and who, after ten months from his latest deployment, suffered from bouts of coughing and shortness of breath, necessitating open heart surgery.  We found in said case that the seafarer's work exposed him to different climates and unpredictable weather, which could trigger a heart attack or heart failure.  We likewise ruled in said case that the seafarer had served the contract for a significantly long amount of time, and that his employment had contributed, even to a small degree, to the development and exacerbation of his disease.<br><br>In the instant case, records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> reveal that petitioner Nisda had been deployed by respondent ADAMS numerous times in a span of 15 years, under several employment contracts.  Petitioner Nisda was first hired and deployed by respondent ADAMS as a Tug Boat Master in 1987.  He was immediately hired and deployed again by respondent ADAMS after the expiration of each employment contract.  Through the years, petitioner Nisda worked for respondent ADAMS essentially under the same or closely similar conditions, <i>i.e.</i>, 48-hour work weeks with a maximum of 105 hours of overtime.<br><br>If we found in <i>Seagull Shipmanagement</i> that the different climates and unpredictable weather, as well as the stress of the job, had a correlation with the heart disease of a seafarer working as a radioman on a vessel, then what more in the heart disease of a seafarer serving as a ship master, a position involving more strain and pressure?  A Tug (boat) Master is primarily tasked to operate tug boats, a powerful marine vessel that meets large ships out at sea and attach a line to guide/steer the same into and out of berths.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>  In operating such a powerful vessel, a Tug Master requires not just a thorough knowledge of the port environment in which he is operating, but a high level of skill as well.  In fact, in the case at bar, respondent ADAMS recognized how grueling petitioner Nisda's job was, according the latter a month of paid vacation every three months of straight service.  Thus, more than a reasonable connection between the nature of petitioner Nisda's job and his Coronary Artery Disease has been established.  Petitioner Nisda was able to sufficiently prove, by substantial evidence, that his Coronary Artery Disease was work-related, given the arduous nature of his job that caused his disease or, at least, aggravated any pre-existing condition he might have had.  Respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, on the other hand, utterly failed to refute the said connection.<br><br>Respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS cannot rely on the seemingly imprecise Medical Report issued by the <i>Dar Al Ta'afi</i>, which stated that petitioner Nisda was suffering from Myositis, or a non-specific inflammation of the muscles of the parascapular region or chest area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>  We note that petitioner Nisda was then only attended to by an Orthopedist, a surgeon whose area of expertise is the skeletal system composed of the bones and muscles. Petitioner Nisda was not seen by a cardiologist in Saudi Arabia even though his blood pressure was high, high enough that he was advised to regularly monitor the same.<br><br>It is also of no moment that petitioner Nisda passed his pre-employment medical examination before he was hired and deployed by respondent ADAMS as a seafarer.  It has been accepted that pre-employment medical examinations are usually not exploratory in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The same is not intended to be a totally in-depth and thorough examination of an applicant's medical condition.  It merely determines whether one is "fit to work" at sea or "fit for sea service"; it does not describe the real state of health of an applicant.  "While a [pre-employment medical examination] may reveal enough for the [foreign employer] to decide whether a seafarer is fit for overseas employment, it may not be relied upon to inform petitioners of a seafarer's true state of health.  The [pre-employment medical examination] could not have divulged respondent's illness considering that the examinations were not exploratory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>As a defense against any liability, respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS incessantly posit that petitioner Nisda's POEA-SEC had already expired when the latter was repatriated to the Philippines on 17 July 2002 and subsequently diagnosed with Coronary Artery Disease.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>To be sure, the duration of petitioner Nisda's POEA-SEC was "6 MONTHS - Continuation of 3 months,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> or nine months entirely.  Petitioner Nisda signed his POEA-SEC on 7 August 2001; but per Sec. 2(A) of the same, it was to commence only on 22 August 2001, the date of petitioner Nisda's actual departure from the airport in the point of hire, which was Quezon City, carrying with him his POEA-approved employment contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  The period of nine months, counted from 22 August 2001, expired on 21 May 2002.<br><br>However, Sec. 2(A) of the POEA-SEC also provides that the POEA-SEC shall be effective until the seafarer's date of arrival at the point of hire upon termination of the employment contract, pursuant to Sec. 18 of the same contract.  Sec. 18 states -<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 18. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT<br><br><ol type="A"><li> The employment of the seafarer shall cease when the seafarer completes his period of contractual service aboard the vessel, signs-off from the vessel and arrives at the point of hire.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Record of the present case reveals that petitioner Nisda signed off and disembarked from <i>M/V Algosaibi-42</i>, and was repatriated to the Philippines, only on 17 July 2002. Hence, it was only on said date that petitioner Nisda's POEA-SEC actually concluded.<br><br>We cannot subscribe to the assertion of respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS that from 21 May 2002 until his repatriation on 17 July 2002, petitioner Nisda was already toiling under the provisions of the second employment contract he signed with respondent ADAMS without the endorsement of the POEA.<br><br>In <i>Placewell International Services Corporation v. Camote</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> we held that the subsequently executed side agreement of an overseas contract worker with the foreign employer is void, simply because it is against our existing laws, morals and public policy.  The subsequent agreement cannot supersede the terms of the standard employment contract approved by the POEA.  Republic Act No. 8042, commonly known as the Migrant Workers Act of 1995, expressly prohibits the substitution or alteration, to the prejudice of the worker, of employment contracts already approved and verified by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) from the time of the actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the period of the expiration of the same, without the approval of DOLE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>  Since the second employment contract petitioner Nisda signed with respondent ADAMS was void for not having been sanctioned by the POEA, then petitioner Nisda's employment with respondent ADAMS was still governed by his POEA-SEC until his repatriation to the Philippines on 17 July 2002.<br><br>That petitioner Nisda was diagnosed with heart disease only on 19 July 2002, already two days after his return to the Philippines, is of no adverse significance to his claim.  Sec. 20(B)(3) of the <i>2000 POEA</i> <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions </i>requires that a seafarer, signing off from the vessel for medical treatment, must submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS<br><br>x x x x<br><br>B.

In the case at bar, petitioner Nisda's post-employment medical examination revealed a far more serious medical condition, Coronary Heart Disease, than what he was first diagnosed with in Saudi Arabia.  And, as we previously established herein, it is highly improbable that petitioner Nisda developed said disease only within the few days from his arrival in the Philippines.  The far more reasonable and logical conclusion is that he already had the disease while still on board the vessel of respondent ADAMS and well within the life of his POEA-SEC.<br><br>Moreover, well worth considering is the riposte to the query: If respondent ADAMS truly considered that petitioner Nisda contracted his Coronary Artery Disease way after the effectivity of the latter's POEA-SEC, then why did it remit the amounts of US$4,389.40 and US$5,997.33 to the Makati Medical Center and Makati Heart Foundation, respectively, as payment for the expenses incurred for a former employee's triple bypass operation?<br><br>Any dispute as to petitioner Nisda's state of health could have easily been resolved had respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS stayed true to the provisions of the <i>2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i>, particularly Sec. 20(B)(3), which allows the following option:<br><br><blockquote><i> </i>3.  Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance x x x until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><u>If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties.</u></b>  (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Without the opinion of a doctor for respondents Sea Serve and ADAMS, or one they could have jointly chosen with petitioner Nisda, we are constrained to make a ruling based on the evidence already submitted by the parties and made part of the records of this case, including the medical certifications petitioner Nisda obtained from his attending physicians.<br><br>Undoubtedly then, under his POEA-SEC, which incorporated the <i>2000 POEA</i> <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i>, petitioner Nisda has a right to receive disability benefit and sickness allowance for 120 days, on account of his Coronary Heart Disease, which qualifies as a total and permanent disability with Grade I Impediment.  The computation of the monetary award as stated in the decision of the labor arbiter, however, must be modified in that the sickness allowance for 120 days should be based merely on petitioner Nisda's basic salary of US$1,437.00 per month under his POEA-SEC, multiplied by 4 months for a total of US$5,748.00.  With regard to his disability benefit classified as Grade I Impediment, he should receive 120% of US$50,000.00 as dictated by the 2000 POEA <i>Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i>, specifically Secs. 20(B)(3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and 20(B)(6)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> <i>vis-à-vis</i> Secs. 32<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and 32-A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  The 10% attorney's fee that was awarded by the Labor Arbiter shall also be maintained, but must reflect the modified amount of the sickness allowance and disability benefit and to be deducted from the winning amount due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>All told, the evidence, including medical documentation, presented by petitioner Nisda, substantially proved that a reasonable connection existed between the work he performed for respondent ADAMS and the development and exacerbation of his Coronary Artery Disease, hence, making it an occupational disease, as described and compensated for by Sec. 32-A of the <i>2000 POEA Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i>.  Consequently, it was erroneous for the NLRC and the Court of Appeals to deny petitioner Nisda's claims for disability benefits under Sec. 20(B), paragraph 6 of the <i>2000 POEA Amended Standard Terms and Conditions</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant Petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed Decision dated 27 September 2006 and Resolution 10 August 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
