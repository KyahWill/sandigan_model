				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an administrative case against Evelyn Y. Roncal (Roncal), former Officer-in-Charge (OIC) and Court Stenographer II of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Dinalupihan-Hermosa, Bataan, in connection with her accountability for the period January 1, 2003 to November 11, 2004 as per a comprehensive financial audit conducted at the said court.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>In compliance with Travel Order No. 72-2004 dated October 5, 2004, an audit team from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) headed by team leader Dindo V. Sevilla, Management and Audit Analyst IV, proceeded to the MCTC, Dinalupihan-Hermosa, Bataan to conduct a comprehensive financial audit on the books of account of accountable officers of the MCTC, including respondent Roncal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In a report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 23, 2005, the audit team submitted the following findings relative to the accountability of Roncal:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>The cash inventory conducted by the audit team on 8 November 2004 showed an undeposited collection in the amount of P100,825.00 for which Ms. Roncal failed to present the corresponding official receipts for each of the funds constituting the amount mentioned.<br><br></li><li>Out of One Hundred Ten (110) booklets of Official Receipts (O.R.s) [consisting] of fifty (50) receipts for each booklet issued by the Supreme Court to [the] MCTC-Dinalupihan, Bataan as of the time [of] audit, five (5) booklets of Official Receipts or a total of Two Hundred Fifty (250) receipts were missing and unaccounted for.<br><br></li><li>One of the Official Receipts included in the abovementioned booklets later turned out in Criminal Case No. 11518, entitled "People of the Philippines v. Alfonso Baul y Reyes".&nbsp; The records of said case show that an Official Receipt with number 10044970 was issued on October 12, 2004 for the cash bond posted [by] Anita Baul in the amount of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00).&nbsp; This O.R. was issued during the incumbency of Ms. Roncal as OIC, but no such bail was reported in the cashbook.&nbsp; There was also no corresponding deposit of the said collection reflected in the bank account for fiduciary funds of the court.<br><br></li><li>After a tedious scrutiny of the records and reconciliation of figures, the audit team laid bare the following shortages in the collection of fees and/or under-remittances attributable to Ms. Roncal:<br></li></ol><table  ="" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="70%">Clerk of Court General Fund (CoCGF) —</td> <td style="text-align: right;" width="30%">P 4,478.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ) —</td> <td style="text-align: right;">11,465.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Judiciary Development Fund (JDF)</td> <td style="text-align: right;">28,029.60</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fiduciary Fund (FF)</td> <td style="text-align: right;">104,000.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>TOTAL</td> <td style="text-align: right;">147,972.60<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [3]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The audit team also uncovered the following irregularities committed by Roncal:<br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Failure to issue Official Receipt</i> - In the course of the audit, the accused in Criminal Case No. 11428 went to the MCTC demanding the release of his cash bond in the amount of P60,000 from Roncal, to whom he earlier made the payment. The accused adverted to an order directing his release after posting his cash bond and another order directing the release of said bond.&nbsp; He claimed, however, that he was not issued a receipt when he paid the bond.&nbsp; A verification of the records of the case disclosed that both orders existed, but no such cash bond was reported in the cashbook or deposited with the court.&nbsp; The audit team also noted the report of incumbent Clerk of Court Jonathan Visitacion that in Criminal Case No. 11382, no cash bond documents were found in the records of the case despite the existence of an order of release referring to a bond posted.&nbsp; Based on the records, the bond, if any, should have been part of the July 2004 collection during the incumbency of Roncal as OIC.<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Using the same Official Receipt number in another transaction</i> - Upon further probe in Criminal Case No. 11428, the audit team discovered that the official receipt number referred to in the order (OR# 17475783) was also the same official receipt number appearing on record in Criminal Case No. 10863.&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 10863, the cash bond was posted on March 4, 2004.<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Failure to update cashbook</i> - The audit team observed the practice in the MCTC, Dinalupihan, Bataan of preparing the Monthly Report ahead of accomplishing the cashbook.&nbsp; This erroneous practice led to each transaction or collection not being promptly documented as soon as they transpired, which should have been the function of the cashbook.&nbsp; The latter therefore became subject to the limitations of human recollection or memory.<br><br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Failure to regularly submit Monthly Reports</i> - As can be gleaned from the records of the court and implicitly admitted by Roncal in her Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><b> </b>dated August 22, 2005, there was a delay in the filing of reports for the months of January to October 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated August 15, 2005, this Court resolved to:<br><blockquote>(a) <b><i>REDOCKET</i></b> the subject financial audit report as a regular administrative matter against former Officer-in-Charge and Court Stenographer II Ms. Evelyn Y.

Roncal, Court Stenographer II, MCTC, Hermosa-Dinalupihan, Bataan, be <b>DISMISSED</b> from the service with forfeiture of retirement and other benefits except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to re-employment in any government office or instrumentality, including government-owned and controlled-corporation.&nbsp; It is further recommended that respondent be <b>ORDERED</b> to restitute the amount of P147,972.60 representing [her] shortages in the following: General Fund - P4,478.00; SAJ - P11,465.00; JDF - P28,029.60; and Fiduciary Fund - P104,000.00.<br><br>The Employees Leave Division, Office of the Administrative Services, OCA shall also be <b>DIRECTED</b> to compute the balance of respondent's earned leave credits and forward the same to the Finance Division, Fiscal Management Office, OCA, which shall compute its monetary value.&nbsp; The amount as well as the other benefits she may be entitled to shall be applied as restitution of the shortage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>After review, we adopt the findings and recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>Needless to over-emphasize, as Officer-in-Charge, Roncal occupied an important and very sensitive position in our judicial system.<br><br>As the person entrusted with the various funds of the court, her duty was to deposit her collections immediately in authorized government depositories.&nbsp; She was not supposed to keep these funds in her possession or leave them elsewhere.<br><br>The procedure in the collection of different judiciary funds, as outlined by the OCA in its Memorandum, is as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">The Official Receipts to be used in the collections of the [Special Allowance for the Judiciary] <b>(SAJ)</b>, [Judiciary Development Fund] <b>(JDF)</b>, [Fiduciary Fund]<b> </b>(<b>FF)</b>, [Sheriff's Trust Fund]<b> (STF)</b>, and [General Fund]<b> (GF)</b> are requisitioned at the Property Division, Office of the Court Administrator, Supreme Court; the [Victim's Compensation Fund]<b> (VCF)</b>, at the Department of Justice; the <b>Cadastral Fees</b>, at the Land Registration Authority; and the [Legal Research Fund]<b> (LRF)</b>, at the U.P.

Such conduct could only be indicative of guilt.<br><br>We therefore agree with the investigating judge and the OCA that Roncal is guilty of gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and acts prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br>Failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds collected to the Municipal Treasurer constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.&nbsp; Under Rule IV, Section 52-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the Civil Service Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, these are grave offenses punishable by dismissal even if committed for the first time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Evelyn Y.
