(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Section 211 (19) is meant to avoid confusion in the minds of the election officials as to the candidates actually voted for and to stave off any scheming design to identify the vote of the elector, thus defeating the secrecy of the ballot which is a cardinal feature of our election laws.&nbsp; Section 211 (19) also enforces Section 195 of the Omnibus Election Code which provides that in preparing the ballot, each voter must "fill his ballot by writing in the proper place for each office the name of the individual candidate for whom he desires to vote."<br><br>Excerpted from Section 211 (19) are ballots with (1) <u>a general misplacement of an <i>entire series</i> of names intended to be voted for successive offices appearing in the ballot</u>, (2) a single or double misplacement of names where such names were preceded or followed by the title of the contested office or where the voter wrote after the candidate's name a directional symbol indicating the correct office for which the misplaced name was intended; and (3) a single misplacement of a name written (a) off-center from the designated space, (b) slightly underneath the line for the contested office, (c) immediately above the title for the contested office, or (d) in the space for an office immediately following that for which the candidate presented himself.&nbsp; In these instances, the misplaced votes are nevertheless credited to the candidates for the office for which they presented themselves because the voters' intention to so vote is clear from the face of the ballots. This is in consonance with the settled doctrine that ballots should be appreciated with liberality to give effect to the voters' will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Underscoring and italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Nor does the Court find grave abuse of discretion in the COMELEC's not rejecting Exhibit "C-17"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as a marked ballot, there being no indication that the blot therein was deliberately placed to identify the voter.&nbsp; Thus, Section 211 (22) of the Omnibus Election Code states<br><blockquote><u>Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks</u>, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the first name and surname of a candidate, or in other parts of the ballot, traces of the letter "T", "J", and other similar ones, the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue, the use of two or more kinds of writing and unintentional or accidental flourishes, strokes, or strains, <u>shall not invalidate the ballot</u>.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner argues, nevertheless, that the COMELEC did not examine the original ballot marked as Exhibit "C-17," for if it did, it could have seen that what appears thereon is not a mere ink smudge but a hole with "searing around it deliberately burned by a lighted cigarette."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Both parties admitted the <u>authenticity</u> of the copies of the ballots examined in the case, however.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that what appears to be an ink smudge on Exhibit "C-17" is actually a hole burned by a lighted cigarette, there is no proof that the burning was deliberately done to identify the voter.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Carpio, Corona, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion,</i> and <i>Peralta, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez,</i> and <i>Tinga, J.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 62.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 63.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Penned by Commissioner Florentino A.
