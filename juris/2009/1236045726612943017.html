The RTC found the accused-appellant, Rolly Canares y Almanares (<i>Canares</i>), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of <i>statutory rape.</i><br><br>Canares was charged in two separate Informations for rape and attempted rape in relation with Republic Act No. 7610 (the Child Abuse Law).

At pre-trial, the parties made no admission or stipulation of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The prosecution marked its documentary evidence with the reservation to present additional evidence in the course of the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The defense did not mark any documentary evidence.<br><br>At the trial proper, the prosecution presented the following as witnesses: AAA (the alleged victim), BBB (the victim's aunt), and Dr. Bernadette Madrid (the Director of the Philippine General Hospital [<i>PGH</i>] Child Protection Unit).  The defense relied on the sole testimony of Canares who simply denied any sexual intercourse with AAA.<br><br><center><b><u>The Background Facts &amp; Developments</u></b><br></center><br>AAA was born on September 8, 1982 and was only about 9 or 10 years old when Canares, a helper in AAA's grandmother's house at Barangay Sabutan, Silang, Cavite, allegedly first sexually abused her.  Living with AAA and her grandmother in the house were her uncle and 7 younger cousins. The sexual intercourse took place at around midnight sometime in 1992; AAA could no longer recall the exact date. AAA and her cousins were then the only occupants in their grandmother's house and were in bed sleeping.  AAA awoke and found Canares lying beside them. Canares undressed her, removed her shorts and panty, and then had sexual intercourse with her by inserting his penis into her genital organ. AAA felt pain and bled but kept the incident to herself because Canares threatened to kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Canares allegedly repeated the sexual abuse more than ten times between the first incident in 1992 and 1995.  He stopped from 1996-1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> AAA attributed the gap to the lack of opportunity on Canares' part; her uncle was then always at home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Canares also began working as a tricycle driver and subsequently went to the province where he temporarily stayed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Except for the sexual abuse in 1992, AAA could no longer remember the details of the other incidents.  She was certain, however, that there was penile penetration in every incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The last incident that immediately gave rise to the present charges occurred on March 25, 1999.  AAA met Canares at the stairs of her grandmother's house as Canares was on his way to the <i>bodega</i> of the house which he used as his sleeping quarters. He told AAA that he had something to tell her and pulled her towards the <i>bodega</i>. Inside, Canares embraced her and pulled down her shorts. AAA resisted and pushed against Canares as she also shouted for help. BBB - AAA's aunt - came to her rescue and hit Canares on the head with a flower vase.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Triggered by this incident, AAA disclosed to her mother and relatives the sexual abuse she had long suffered in the hands of Canares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On March 26, 2000, AAA went to the PGH Child Protection Unit for medical examination. The findings showed that she had a healed laceration at the 6:00 position of her hymen <i>indicating previous penetration</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><i> </i>On March 27, 2000, AAA and BBB executed their respective <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay </i>about Canares' sexual abuses before the police authorities. After the Joint Preliminary Examination conducted before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Silang-Amadeo, Cavite on April 26, 1999, AAA lodged a formal complaint for rape and attempted rape against Canares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Canares denied the accusations against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He claimed that the charges were filed against him at the instance of AAA's grandmother and uncle because of the nonpayment of his salary as a farm hand and as a tricycle driver. AAA's uncle also allegedly failed to pay him a previous loan of P10,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He also claimed that it was impossible for him to rape AAA because she came to live at her grandmother's house only in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He argued that the rape could not have possibly occurred considering the number of people staying in the house; a shout from someone being assaulted could easily be heard in the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The RTC gave greater credence to the prosecution's evidence, particularly, the testimony of AAA which it found to be straightforward, truthful, and convincing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The trial court observed that AAA's young age and gender rendered it unlikely that she would concoct a story of defloration that would subject her to public trial and ridicule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> At the same time, the RTC rejected Canares' unsubstantiated denial and held that it cannot prevail over credible positive testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the guilt of the accused ROLLY CANARES Y ALMARANES to be beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA. Accused is also ordered to indemnify <br> the victim Catherine Amodente the sum of Php100,000.00 as moral damages. Costs against the accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC acquitted Canares of the crime of attempted rape for the prosecution's failure to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt:<br><blockquote>...From the preponderance of evidence presented, the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused in this case beyond reasonable doubt. The court therefore ACQUITS the accused Rolly Canares of the crime of "Attempted Rape" and the case against him is DISMISSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA affirmed with modification Canares' rape conviction, ruling as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the assailed Decision dated March 17, 2003 of the RTC, Branch 18, Tagaytay City, in Criminal Case No. TG-3255-99, is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with <b>MODIFICATION</b>, by reducing the award of moral damages from Php 100,000.00 to Php 50,000.00, and ordering the accused-appellant to pay AAA the amount of Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, in addition to moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>In his Appeal Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Canares raises the lone issue:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION.<br></blockquote>Canares contends that he should not have been convicted of rape because the Information was defective: it failed to specify with certainty when the alleged rape was committed. He argues that the allegation that the rape was committed <i>"</i>sometime between the year 1992 to 1995" is very broad, considering particularly AAA's testimony that she was raped more than 10 times. He posits that since the specific incident of rape for which he was convicted is uncertain, the doubt should be resolved in favor of his acquittal.<br><br>In their Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the People maintain that Canares' rape conviction is backed by the evidence on record. The argument that the Information was defective should also fail because the allegation of the exact date and time of the rape is not a material point in charging the accused of rape. In any case, this alleged defect was cured when AAA testified that Canares raped her "in one<i> </i>evening of 1992."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><i> </i><br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>We find no reason to overturn the conviction of Canares and hereby confirm his guilt for the crime of statutory rape committed against AAA sometime in 1992.<br><br><i><u>The Procedural Issue</u> </i><br><br>The argument that the Information in Criminal Case No. TG-3255-99 is defective for the prosecution's failure to allege the date and time of the rape is far from novel. We have repeatedly met and debunked this line of argument in rape cases.<br><br>An information, under Section 6, Rule 110 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, is deemed sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense given by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the <i>approximate date</i> of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed. Section 11 of the same Rule also provides that it is not necessary to state in the complaint or information the precise date the offense was committed except when the date of commission is a material element of the offense. The offense may thus be alleged to have been committed on a date as near as possible to the actual date of its commission.  At the minimum, an indictment must contain all the essential elements of the offense charged to enable the accused to properly meet the charge and duly prepare for his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Following these principles, we held in<i> People v. Bugayong</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that when the time given in the information is not the essence of the offense, such time does not need to be proven as alleged; the complaint will be sustained if the proof shows that the offense was committed at any time within the period of the statute of limitations and before the commencement of the action. We again emphasized this doctrine in the case of<i> People v. Rafon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> when we held it unnecessary to state in the information the precise date when the offense was committed, except when it is an essential element of the offense.<br><br><i>People v. Lizada,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> specifically involving the charge of rape, followed the above general principle; we stated that an information for rape is not rendered defective for failure to specify the exact date when the rape was committed.  The reason for this is plain: the precise date of the commission <br> of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <b>The gravamen of the crime of rape is carnal knowledge of the woman under any of the circumstances provided by law</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Thus, we have ruled that allegations of rape in the information committed, "sometime in the year 1991 and the days thereafter,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> "on or about and sometime in the year 1988,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or "from November 1990 up to July 21, 1994,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> "sometime in the year 1982 and dates subsequent thereto," and "sometime in the year 1995 and subsequent thereto,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> all constitute sufficient compliance with Section 11 of Rule 110. In <i>People v. Salalima</i>, we also ruled that the allegation that the sexual assaults were committed, "sometime during the month of March 1996 or thereabout," or "sometime during the month of April 1996 or thereabout," and also, "sometime during the month of May 1996 or thereabout" substantially informed the accused of the crimes charged since all the elements of rape were stated in the informations. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The situation in the present case can be directly compared with <i>People v.</i> <i>Bugayong</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> where the information charged that the accused committed multiple rapes "before and until October 15, 1994."  We found this allegation sufficient to convict the accused of rape committed in 1993 on account of the categorical statement in the private complainant's sworn affidavit of the year when the rape was committed. The Court found that this allegation substantially cured the perceived vagueness in the criminal charge and ruled that the accused has been sufficiently informed under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In this regard, AAA unequivocally and repeatedly stated that the first sexual intercourse Canares had with her occurred sometime in 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Following <i>Bugayong, </i>this statement removes from Canares any reason to complain that he was not adequately informed of the charge against him before he was arraigned.  The Information referred to a rape that started in 1992 and this first incident was sufficiently narrated in AAA's statements before and after arraignment. Canares never raised this argument in any motion filed with the trial court before his arraignment. He likewise fully participated in the trial on the merits without raising this argument; he cross-examined the prosecution witnesses and formally objected to the prosecution's offer of evidence.  Raised for the first time in this appeal, we can only label the argument as a desperation move that is too late in the day for the defense to make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We add that while AAA testified that Canares had raped her more than 10 times, Canares was not charged for all ten rapes.  The Information only sought to hold him liable for a single count of rape committed "sometime between 1992 to 1995." The Information is very specific, too, that the victim was then nine (9) years old so that the rape referred to was the incident on or about 1992, given that AAA was born in September 1982. In her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> that became the basis for the Information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> AAA clearly stated that Canares raped her when she was 9 years old, but did not report it to her parents because she was scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (AAA would have been 9 years old if the rape occurred before September 8, 1992.)  At the trial, on the other hand, AAA was firm and categorical about the fact of rape and of Canares' identity as the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Thus, AAA clearly referred to the first incident of rape that happened around midnight in 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Following <i>People v. Gianan<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></b></i> that the Office of the Solicitor General cited, her testimony substantially cured any defect posed by the date stated in the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In<i> Gianan</i>, we held:<br><br><blockquote>In any event, even if the information failed to allege with certainty the time of the commission of the rapes, the defect, if any, was cured by the evidence presented during the trial and any objection based on this ground must be deemed waived as a result of accused-appellant's failure to object before arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i><u>Substantive Issue</u></i></b><br><br><i>Statutory rape</i> is committed by sexual intercourse with a woman below 12 years of age regardless of her consent to the act or lack of it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Proof of force, intimidation or consent is unnecessary; force is not an element of<i> statutory </i>rape and the absence of free consent is conclusively presumed when the complainant is below the age of twelve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The law presumes that a woman below this age does not possess discernment and is incapable of giving intelligent consent to the sexual act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>To convict an accused of the crime of <i>statutory rape</i>, the prosecution must prove: <b>first,</b> the age of the complainant; <b>second</b>, the identity of the accused; and <b>last but not the least</b>, the carnal knowledge between the accused and the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The first and second elements have been established by the presentation of a Certification from the Office of the Municipal Civil Registrar of Silang, Cavite dated April 21, 1999 stating that AAA was born on September 8, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  Hence, she was only 9, or at most 10, years old when the rape was committed in 1992. In and out of court, she consistently identified Canares as her rapist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Carnal knowledge is proven by proof of the entry or introduction of the male organ into the female organ; the "touching" or "entry" of the penis into the <i>labia majora </i>or the <i>labia minora</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> of the victim's genitalia constitutes consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The prosecution proved this element when AAA narrated during the trial the details of her rape, committed sometime in 1992, as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">What did he do exactly to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He touched my breasts and he inserted his private organ into mine, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he able to insert his organ into yours?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FISCAL VELASCO, JR.:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Considering, as you said, that (sic) was the first time, how did you feel?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">WITNESS:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">It was painful, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">COURT:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">...</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">How many times were you abused on that evening?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">WITNESS:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Once, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he able to penetrate your private organ on that first night?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You mean he was able to insert his penis into your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Parenthetically, the pain that AAA said she suffered is, in itself, an indicator of the commission of rape.  We so held in <i>People v. Tampos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><i> </i>and <i>People v. Borromeo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> There is the added element, too, that AAA's testimony is supported by physical and supporting testimonial evidence.  There was the healed laceration found in her hymen which is remarkably compatible with her claim of sexual molestation.  Dr. Madrid, in testifying on the healed laceration, stated that it could have been caused by a penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Both the RTC and CA found the above testimony <i>straightforward, truthful and convincing</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> AAA's identification of Canares as the culprit was <i>positive, categorical</i> and <i>consistent and devoid of any showing of ill-motive on her part</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> We find no reason to disturb these findings. Courts usually give greater weight to the testimony of a female victim of sexual assault, especially a minor, because no woman would willingly undergo a public trial and put up with the shame, humiliation and dishonor of exposing her own degradation except to condemn the injustice done and to secure the offender's apprehension and punishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Testimonies of youthful rape victims are, as a general rule, given full faith and credit, considering that when a girl says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In this case, she could not have come up with a detailed narration of what she suffered if the rape, in fact, did not really happen.<br><br>Canares mainly interposed the defense of denial, an inherently weak defense that must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As negative evidence, it pales in comparison with a positive testimony that asserts the commission of a crime and the identification of the accused as its culprit. We find that the facts in this case do not present any exceptional circumstance warranting a deviation from these established rules.<br><br>Canares likewise claimed before the RTC that the rape as alleged did not take place since AAA was not living at her grandmother's house from 1992 up to 1995. We find this argument untenable. AAA refuted this claim during her direct examination when she stated that she was already living at her grandmother's house as early as 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The defense utterly failed to disprove this testimony when AAA was cross-examined. Canares, for his part, made inconsistent statements about this claim during his own cross-examination.  Under this evidentiary situation, we give weight to what AAA had declared.<br><br>A last defense was the imputation of ill motives on AAA by making it appear that the criminal cases were filed for monetary reasons. We find this argument contrary to human experience. We find it inconceivable that a child's future and a family's reputation would be placed at risk and exposed to possible humiliation and dishonor for the trifling reasons Canares gave. If Canares had not really been paid his salaries, then he, not AAA and her family, would have the motivation to carry a grudge.
