Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> we held that there are three (3) essential dates that must be stated in a petition for <i>certiorari </i>brought under Rule 65.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, the date when notice of the judgment or final order or Resolution was received; <i>second</i>, when a motion for new trial or reconsideration was filed; and <i>third</i>, when notice of the denial thereof was received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner failed to indicate all the three material dates, namely, the date of receipt of the June 18, 2007 Order, the date of filing of the motion for reconsideration, as well as the date of receipt of the denial thereof, which is the reckoning date of the 60-day period.&nbsp; Moreover, the certified true copies of the assailed orders were not attached to the petition.&nbsp; Thus, the petition must be dismissed.<br><br>As to the September 26, 2007 and November 12, 2007 Orders, we find that while the petition was seasonably filed, the same must nevertheless fail on the merits.&nbsp; The Shari'a Court did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motion to fully implement the March 7, 2007 Writ of Execution.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion exists where an act is performed in a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; None of the foregoing circumstances are present in this case.<br><br>The March 7, 2007 Writ of Execution was issued to enforce the December 20, 2006 Order requiring respondent Tominoray to deliver petitioner's alleged share in the Coloi Farmland in the amount of Php450,580.00.&nbsp; However, this was later superseded by the June 18, 2007 and July 19, 2007 Orders of the Shari'a Court which recognized the extra-judicial partition of the proceeds of the subject property, ordered its exclusion from the partition, and declared the controversy closed and terminated.<br><br>As such, the writ of execution had become <i>functus officio </i>as there was nothing to enforce insofar as the Coloi Farmland is concerned. Indeed, the proceeds from the subject property had already been distributed among the heirs of Hadji.&nbsp; This was established during the proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and acknowledged by petitioner himself who admitted to having received the amount of Php150,000.00 from respondent Tominoray.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>At this point, we reiterate that the orders excluding the Coloi Farmland from the partition have attained finality and can no longer be assailed.&nbsp; Petitioner failed to timely appeal therefrom, whether in the form of an ordinary appeal or an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Instead, he filed a motion to fully implement and enforce the March 7, 2007 Writ of Execution which is actually a substitute for lost appeal.&nbsp; This is not allowed.&nbsp; While procedural irregularities are on occasion set aside in the interest of justice, it must be stressed that liberality of construction of the rules should not be a panacea for all procedural maladies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Finally, there is no merit to petitioner's contention that the Shari'a Court rendered the action for partition unresolved. It bears stressing that the court did not modify its May 6, 2005 Order with regard to the other properties mentioned in the second project plan of partition submitted by petitioner.&nbsp; The subsequent orders assailed by petitioner pertained only to the Coloi Farmland and to no other property.&nbsp; The partition of the Balagunun Farmland, Coba o Hadji, and Soiok estates was never at issue and, thus, the May 6, 2005 Order of the Shari'a Court with regard to these properties remains unchanged.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DISMISSED.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, Nachura,</i> and <i>Peralta, JJ.,</i> concur.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 3-35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id. </i>at 36; penned by Judge Rasad G.
