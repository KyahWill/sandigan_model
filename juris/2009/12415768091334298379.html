				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><br>Upon her arrest during an alleged drug buy-bust operation conducted on November 5, 2002, Susan J. Sales (petitioner) was charged for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q-02-113122-3.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 7, 2002 filed against petitioner reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of November, 2002 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully and unlawfully <u>sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as broker</u> in the said transaction, zero point one four <u>(0.14) gram of white crystalline substance</u> containing methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Danilo D. Sanchez, who was also allegedly buying a prohibited drug from petitioner on the same occasion, was charged separately but tried jointly with petitioner. He was acquitted on reasonable doubt.  Hence, the <u>present appeal pertains only to petitioner.</u><br><br>Culled from the evidence for the prosecution consisting of, in the main, the testimony of PO1 Teresita B. Reyes (PO1 Teresita), a police officer assigned at the District Drug Enforcement Unit (DDEU), Camp Karingal, Sikatuna Village, Quezon City, is the following version:<br><br>On November 5, 2002, an informant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> reported to the chief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the DDEU that one named "Susan," who was later identified by PO1 Teresita to be petitioner, was peddling prohibited drugs along Scout Tobias Street, Barangay South Triangle, Quezon City.  The DDEU chief at once formed a police team to conduct a buy-bust operation with PO1 Teresita as poseur buyer, PO1 Roberto Manalo as team leader, and PO1 Gerry Pacheco and PO1 Filnar Mutia as members.  PO1 Teresita was given a P500.00 bill to be used as buy-bust money which she marked with her initials "TBR" (Exhibits "A" &amp; "A-1").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At past 4:00 p.m. that same day of November 5, 2002, the team, together with the informant, proceeded to Barangay South Triangle.  On reaching Scout Tobias Street at around 5:00 p.m., PO1 Teresita, together with the informant, started walking along the street as the team members strategically deployed themselves in the vicinity.<br><br>Upon seeing petitioner standing at the side of the street, the informant approached her and introduced PO1 Teresita as a "<i>kaibigan ko i-iscore daw sya</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Petitioner thereupon asked PO1 Teresita how much she would buy, to which she replied "P500.00," at the same time handing to petitioner the P500 bill. Petitioner in turn, gave PO1 Teresita a small plastic sachet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  At that instant, another person, who turned out to be Danilo D. Sanchez (Sanchez), appeared from nowhere and told petitioner that he also wanted to "score"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (buy).  Almost simultaneously PO1 Teresita carried out the pre-arranged hand signal to her colleagues and embraced petitioner as she introduced herself as a police officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  The team members rushed towards them, and PO1 Roberto Manalo immediately searched petitioner from whom he recovered the buy-bust money.  Sanchez was searched too and a sachet was recovered from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The team arrested the two.<br><br>On their way back to Camp Karingal, PO1 Teresita marked the plastic sachet recovered from petitioner with her initials "TBR." She too marked the plastic sachet taken from Sanchez with her initials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  The team later turned over the buy-bust money to the desk officer, and transmitted the sachets to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In Chemistry Report No. D-1324-02 dated November 8, 2002 (Exhibit "E"),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the contents of the sachets were found positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu.</i>  The sachet taken from petitioner weighed 0.14 gram (that from Sanchez weighed 0.09 gram).<br><br>The defense proffered an entirely different version.<br><br>Petitioner, a real estate consultant residing at No. 547 Kundiman Street, Sampaloc, Manila, and her witness Edwin Isaguirre (Isaguirre), denying PO1 Teresita's tale, gave the following account.<br><br>On November 4, 2002, at past 9 o'clock in the evening, petitioner was at Isaguirre's house located at No. 65 K-7<sup>th</sup> Street, Kamias, Quezon City to visit Agnes, Isaguirre's sister-in-law and petitioner's high school classmate and close friend, who just arrived from the USA. While there, petitioner, together with Isaguirre, his wife, and Teresa, played <i>pusoy </i>and <i>tong-its </i>at the library when armed men, who turned out to be policemen, barged into the house by passing through the open main door adjacent to the library.  Without any search and arrest warrant, the armed men searched the house and arrested petitioner together with Isaguirre and Teresa, but not after they (armed men) took petitioner's cellular phone, jewelry and cash of over P3,000.<br><br>Petitioner, Isaguirre and Teresa were invited for questioning bearing on drugs.  Despite their protestation of innocence, they were forcibly brought to Camp Karingal where they were detained separately.<br><br>While on detention, petitioner was prevented from contacting her lawyer or any person and was constantly asked if she knew of any drug pusher, but she denied any knowledge.  Petitioner remained on detention, while Isaguirre and Teresa were released.<br><br>By Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated August 28, 2006, the trial court, crediting the version of the prosecution and finding that "[t]he police followed the normal and regular procedure in conducting the entrapment operation, x x x,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> convicted petitioner, as charged, and imposed upon her life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.  Thus it disposed:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. Q-02-113122, accused <b>SUSAN SALES y JIMENA </b>is hereby found <b>GUILTY </b>beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5 of R.A. 9165 (for drug pushing) as charged and she is hereby sentenced to suffer a jail term of <b>LIFE IMPRISONMENT </b>and to pay a fine of <b>P500,000.00</b>; and<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. Q-02-113123, accused <b>DANILO SANCHEZ y DISTAJO</b> is hereby <b>ACQUITTED </b>of violation of Section 11 of R.A. 9165 (possession of <i>shabu</i>) as charged due to reasonable doubt.<br></li></ol>The <i>shabu</i> involved in each of these cases in two sachets (A &amp; B) weighing 0.14 gram and 0.09 gram, respectively, are ordered transmitted to the PDEA thru the DDB for proper disposition per R.A. 9165.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.  (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>On appeal, the Court of Appeals, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated December 17, 2007, affirmed the trial court's decision.  Her motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioner filed the present petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals in relying on the improbable and incredible testimony of PO1 Teresita that she (petitioner) was arrested during a buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Assuming there was such a buy-bust operation, petitioner posits, the police team did not comply with the guidelines required by law concerning her arrest and the confiscation and custody of the illegal drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in its Comment prays that the petition be denied for lack of merit.<br><br>This Court, aware that in some instances law enforcers resort to the practice of planting evidence to extract information or even to harass civilians,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> has been issuing cautionary warnings to courts to exercise <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extra vigilance</span> in trying drug cases, lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses.<br><br>After a considered examination of the records of the case, the Court finds that a reversal of the challenged Court of Appeals decision is in order.<br><br>PO1 Teresita's testimony is not only improbable but also incredible.  Consider her following testimony, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div>      <div style="text-decoration: underline;" align="justify">CROSS EXAMINATION:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

At any rate, if, indeed, petitioner was a peddler, she would know the perils inherent in her illegal trade and would not simply peddle prohibited drugs <u><b>openly</b> along a <b>busy street</b>, Scout Tobias, in <b>broad daylight</b></u>.  For carrying out illicit business under these circumstances<u> is contrary to common experience,</u> given the clandestine nature of illegal-drug dealings.  As this Court stressed in <i>People v. Pagaura</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> peddling prohibited or dangerous drugs is a "nefarious" business which is "<u>carried on with utmost secrecy or whispers to avoid detection.</u>"<br><br>As for PO1 Teresita's following account, quoted <i>verbatim,</i> of what transpired upon her introduction to petitioner, the same  must be received with caution<i>: </i><br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div>      <div align="justify"><b>CROSS-EXAMINATION: </b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"></div>      <div align="justify">ATTY.

That is why the Court, in <i>Pagaura</i>, found it "rather foolish that one who peddles illegal drugs would boldly and unashamedly present his wares to <u>total strangers</u> lest he be caught in <i>flagrante.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>But even granting <i>arguendo </i>that petitioner was indeed arrested during a buy-bust operation, the police team <u>failed to follow the legal procedure and guidelines</u> on her arrest and the confiscation of the illegal drug, which omission is fatal to warrant her acquittal.<br><br>In all prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act, the existence of all dangerous drugs is a <i>sine qua non </i>for conviction.  The dangerous drug is the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime of violation of the said Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  It is thus essential that the prohibited drug confiscated or recovered from the suspect <u>is the very same substance</u> offered in court as exhibit; and that the<u> identity of said drug be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.</u>  The "chain of custody" requirement performs this function in that it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>As a method of authenticating evidence, the <u>chain of custody rule requires</u> that the admission of an exhibit be <u>preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.  It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence</u>, in such a way that <u>every person who touched the exhibit</u> would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court finds that <u>neither was physical inventory nor photograph</u> of the sachet and buy-bust money taken in the presence of petitioner, or her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, as required by law, was taken.  <u>No justification whatsoever</u> was proffered by the apprehending team for its failure to observe the legal safeguards.<br><br>In fine, the prosecution failed to establish petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Her acquittal is thus in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated December 17, 2007 and Resolution of March 10, 2008 in CA-G.R.
