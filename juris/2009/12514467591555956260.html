				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 14 August 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02381, which affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Odiongan, Romblon, Branch 82, finding appellant Bienvenido Lazaro <i>alias</i> Benny (Bienvenido) guilty of the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. OD-875.<br><br>Bienvenido was charged before the RTC with the complex crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape.  The accusatory portion of the Complaint reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 31<sup>st</sup> day of August, 1995 at around 6:00 o'clock in the morning, in Barangay XXX, Municipality of Odiongan, Province of Romblon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with lewd design, did then and there willfully and feloniously take by force and abduct the undersigned offended party by then and there taking and bringing her to the house of said accused, against her consent and by means of violence, and had carnal knowledge with her, against the latter's will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment on 4 March 1996, Bienvenido, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The evidence of the prosecution, as gathered from the testimonies of the victim AAA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, the victim's uncle BBB, and Dr. Aida Dusaban Atienza, the government physician who examined AAA, are as follows:<br><br>AAA, an eleven-year-old girl, was born on 24 December 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  She lived with her grandmother at the latter's house in Barangay XXX, Odiongan, Romblon. At 6:00 o'clock in the morning of 31 August 1995, while AAA was walking on her way to school, Bienvenido, whom AAA called <i>Lolo</i>, stopped her and brought her to his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  There, Bienvenido removed AAA's panties and made her lie down on the floor, with her face up. Beienvenido took off his pants and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina and made the push and pull movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Thereafter, Bienvenido donned his pants and threatened to kill AAA if she divulged his bestial act to anyone. Afraid of Bienvenido's threatening words, AAA cried.  She went back to her grandmother's house.  When AAA arrived, her aunt was there, but she did not tell her aunt about the incident.  On 29 September 1995, worried about AAA's changing demeanor, AAA's uncle, BBB, insistently questioned her. It was then that AAA revealed her ordeal. BBB wasted no time and brought her to the health center where she was examined by Dr. Aida Atienza.  Dr. Atienza's examination showed that AAA's breast was still on its pre-puberty stage. AAA's vaginal wall had been penetrated possibly by fingers or by a penis, and there were healed complete lacerations at the 4:00, 5:00 and 9:00 o'clock positions.<br><br>The defense interposed the defense of denial and alibi and presented the testimonies of Bienvenido and his niece, Yolanda Forcadas.<br><br>Bienvenido denied molesting AAA.  He said that at 5:00 in the morning of 31 August 1995, he went to the port of Poctoy, Odiongan, Romblon to sell his crops.  At around 12:00 noon when his goods were sold, he went to the house of his nephew, Rolando Forcadas, which was situated near the port, where he stayed until 6:00 in the morning of the following day.<br><br>At around 9:00 a.m. of 31 August 1995, he saw AAA together with a certain Felmor Perater, Jr. embracing each other.  He called the attention of the two, saying that he would report the incident to AAA's grandmother. He did not report the said incident to AAA's grandmother.<br><br>However, on re-direct examination, Bienvenido made another declaration that at around 6:00 in the morning of 31 August 1995, he was in Barangay XXX, Odiongan, Romblon, harvesting corn.  Thereafter, he went back to his house and took a rest.  The next day, while he was in the field, he caught AAA and Felmor Perater, Jr. engaged in sexual intercourse. He scolded the two and reported the matter to AAA's grandmother.  He also claimed he was the one who accompanied AAA to the Rural Health Officer for a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>For her part, Yolanda Forcadas testified that on 11 August 1995, Bienvenido visited her in Barangay Batiano, Odiongan, Romblon.  In the morning of 12 August 1995, Bienvenido returned to his place.<br><br>The RTC, in a decision dated 24 July 2001, convicted Bienvenido of the crime of rape only.  The RTC ruled out forcible abduction, since evidence tended to show that the victim was lured by the perpetrator to go with him to his house.  This was buttressed by AAA's admission that she had been given money by Bienvenido twice, and that she had been to the house of the former once.  The RTC imposed upon Bienvenido the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered him to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.  The decretal portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused BIENVENIDO LAZARO is hereby found GUILTY of rape and is hereby meted the penalty of reclusion perpetua, with all the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>Accused is entitled to full time of his preventive imprisonment pursuant to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>Bienvenido appealed the judgment of conviction to the Court of Appeals.  In its decision dated 14 August 2008, the Court of Appeals affirmed the guilty verdict and the sentence imposed by the RTC.  In addition to the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, the Court of Appeals ordered Bienvenido to pay the victim P75,000.00 as moral damages, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 82, in Odiongan, Romblon in Crim. Case No. OD-875, finding accused-appellant Bienvenido Lazaro guilty of the crime of rape and imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua, is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant is further ordered to pay the victim P75,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, the instant recourse.<br><br>Bienvenido claims that it was witness BBB, the victim's uncle, who initiated the filing of the criminal complaint against him. Since Article 344<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code and Section 5, Rule 110<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the Revised Rules of Court require that the right to file an action be given to the parents, grandparents or guardians of the minor, the filing by BBB of the complaint renders the same defective.<br><br>In a bid to be exculpated from the charge, Bienvenido contends that AAA's testimony had material inconsistency as to the date of the commission, since at one point AAA declared that the rape happened on 12 August 1995; and in the rest of her testimony, she said it occurred on 31 August of the same year.<br><br>In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in cases of rape, the courts have been traditionally guided by three settled principles, namely: (a) an accusation for rape is easy to make, difficult to prove, and even more difficult to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with utmost caution; and (c) the evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own merits and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Since the crime of rape is essentially one committed in relative isolation or even secrecy, it is usually only the victim who can testify with regard to the fact of the forced <i>coitus.<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></b></i>  In its prosecution, therefore, the credibility of the victim is almost always the single and most important issue to deal with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  If her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused can justifiably be convicted on the basis thereof; otherwise, he should be acquitted of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In this case, upon assessing the victim's testimony, the RTC found her credible, thus:<br><br><blockquote>There is no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why the victim in the case would testify falsely against the accused or falsely implicate him in a heinous crime.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The laceration on the vagina of the girl who was examined weeks after the incident by Dra. Atienza is indicative of some object having entered it. Adding to this is the testimony of AAA that accused rode on her body and made a "pull and push movement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>This Court itself has diligently pored over the transcripts of stenographic notes of this case and, like the RTC, it finds the victim's testimony on the incident forthright or straightforward, consistent with an honest and realistic account of the tragedy that befell her. She narrated the incident and the circumstances immediately after it in this manner:<br><br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr

</tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, the prosecution satisfactorily established in vivid detail that during the incident in question, Bienvenido, whom AAA called <i>Lolo</i>, enticed her with monetary favor to go with him to his house. Unaware of the plot hatched by the person she treated as a grandfather and at some point a provider, AAA went along with him.  Taking advantage of the trust and the tender age of AAA, Bienvenido was able to consummate his evil design.  Ignorant of the ways of men, AAA did not protest or agree to the sexual advances of the malefactor.  As Bienvenido inserted his penis and made a push and pull movement, AAA could only feel the pain of the insertion, not knowing that molestation had more far-reaching consequences on her emotional growth and social development.<br><br>Although the evidence is bereft of any indication that AAA, 11 years old during the incident, was coerced by the perpetrator, this fact cannot be utilized by the latter.  This Court has held that if the woman is under twelve (12) years of age, proof of force and consent becomes immaterial, not only because force is not an element of statutory rape, but also because the absence of free consent is presumed when the woman is below 12 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The two elements of statutory rape are: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that the woman was below 12 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Sexual congress with a girl under 12 years old is always rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Medical findings revealed that the victim's vagina had old lacerations that were consistent with her claim that she was molested.  Against the damning evidence adduced by the prosecution, what appellant could only muster is a barefaced denial.  Unfortunately for him, his defense is much too flaccid to stay firm against the weighty evidence for the prosecution.  Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a negative and self-serving evidence, which deserves no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimonies of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Between the self-serving testimony of Bienvenido and the positive declaration of the victim, the latter deserves greater credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Also unavailing is Bienvenido's insinuation that it was a certain Felmor Perater, Jr. who might have violated AAA's womanhood and not he. Again, this was simply a futile attempt on the part of the accused, unsubstantiated by any thread of evidence, to extricate himself from the charge.  His differing declarations on this matter (at one point, he said AAA and Felmor were just embracing each other, then at another he said the two were engaged in sexual intercourse) expose the fallacy of his claim of innocence.<br><br>Bienvenido's defense of alibi cannot be believed.  For the defense of alibi to prosper, the following must be established: (a) the presence of the accused-appellant in another place at the time of the commission of the offense; and (b) the physical impossibility for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Bienvenido testified that he was in the same <i>barangay </i>when the incident took place.  This testimony destroys his alibi.  Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Bienvenido was in Barangay Poctoy, a neighboring <i>barangay</i>, when the questioned event took place, still there is a great possibility that he could have traveled from there to the <i>locus criminis</i> in no time.  Thus, his defense of alibi cannot prosper.<br><br>Although AAA reported the incident to her uncle only on 29 September 1995, almost a month after she was ravished, this cannot be taken against her.  She was seriously threatened by the malefactor if she told the said occurrence to anyone.  Naturally, as a very young girl, she must have had an overpowering fear that prevented her from telling her uncle of her grueling experience in the hands of Bienvenido.  It is not uncommon for a young girl to conceal for some time the assault on her virtue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  Her initial hesitation may be due to her youth and the molester's threat against her. Besides, rape victims, especially child victims, should not be expected to act the way mature individuals would when placed in such a situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  It is not proper to judge the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experience by the norms of behavior expected from adults under similar circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  The range of emotions shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by calculus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  It is, thus, unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from them.  Certainly, the Court has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after she has been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the victim depending on the circumstances, but her credibility should not be tainted with any modicum of doubt.  Indeed, different people react differently to a given stimulus or type of situation, and there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  It would be insensitive to expect the victim to act with equanimity and to have the courage and the intelligence to disregard the threat made by Bienvenido.  When a rape victim is paralyzed with fear, she cannot be expected to think and act coherently. This is especially true in this case, since AAA was threatened by appellant that she would be killed if ever she would tell anybody about the rape incident.<br><br>We go now to the allegation that the complaint filed was defective.<br><br>The pertinent laws existing at the time the crime was committed in 1995 were Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code (prior to its amendment by Republic Act No. 835319, otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997," which took effect on 22 October 1997) and Section 5 of Rule 110 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Under the said laws, rape was considered as a private crime, the prosecution of which must be initiated by the minor victim or her parents, grandparents or guardian. Bienvenido asserts that it was AAA's uncle BBB who filed the complaint, rendering the same defective.  This assertion is baseless.  It remains an allegation, since Bienvenido failed to present any proof thereof.  On the contrary, a thorough examination of the complaint and the sworn affidavit would establish that the same were duly signed by private offended party AAA.  There is no indication these documents were initiated by AAA's uncle.  As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals, AAA's statements were only reduced into writing by the authorities; but, at the end part of the documents, her signature was affixed thereto conforming to the contents of AAA's affidavit and the fact that she personally initiated the complaint.  The affidavit was executed by AAA in the presence of the police officers and other witnesses and was countersigned by the public prosecutor.<br><br>As to Bienvenido's claim that AAA's testimony was riddled with material inconsistencies, since she gave varying dates of the commission of the crime, the same cannot be taken in his favor.<br><br>Firstly, the exact date of the commission of rape is not material.  In rape cases, the time of commission of the crime is not a material ingredient of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  In this connection, this Court also ruled that in rape cases, victims of rape hardly retain in their memories the dates, number of times, and manner in which they were violated.  In the same vein, to be material, discrepancies in the testimony of the victim should refer to significant facts that are determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused, not to mere details that are irrelevant to the elements of the crime, such as the exact time of its commission in a case of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Secondly, the mention of 12 August 1995 as the date of commission of the crime was a mere inadvertence on the part of the public prosecutor.  The complaint-affidavit mentions 31 August 1995 as the date when AAA was raped.  There was only one instance in her whole testimony when "12 August 1995" was mentioned, on page 3 of the transcript of records taken on 1 January 1996, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

The Court has long adhered to the rule that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great respect, unless the trial court overlooked substantial facts and circumstances, which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  In rape cases, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose conclusion thereon deserves much weight and respect, because the judge has the direct opportunity to observe them on the stand and ascertain if they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  This deference to the trial court's appreciation of the facts and of the credibility of witnesses is consistent with the principle that when the testimony of a witness meets the test of credibility, that alone is sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  This is especially true when the factual findings of the trial court are affirmed by the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As to the penalty imposed, the RTC correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Statutory rape is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.  Since there was no aggravating or mitigating circumstance attendant to the crime, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is the proper penalty.<br><br>Also affirmed is the award of the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, the same being in conformity with the recent jurisprudence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, the Court of Appeals' award of moral damages in the amount of P75,000 must be modified to P50,000.00.  In <i>People v. Sambrano</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court decreed that the award of P75,000 as moral damages is only warranted when the rape is perpetrated with any of the attending qualifying aggravating circumstances that require the imposition of the death penalty. The instant case involves a simple rape.  Hence, the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DENIED</b>.  The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 14 August 2008 in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02381, finding Bienvenido Lazaro a.k.a.
