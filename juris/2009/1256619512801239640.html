				<BR><STRONG>PERALTA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present administrative matter arose from a letter dated June 17, 2009 of Justice Adolfo S. Azcuna, Chancellor of the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA), addressed to Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, Chairperson of the PHILJA Board of Trustees, requesting the Court's approval of the following amendments in the PHILJA's staffing pattern, solely referring to the Chancellor's Office.  Thus:<br><br><blockquote>We refer your Honor to the Court <i>En Banc</i> Resolution dated 23 September 2008, in Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, (<i>Further Clarifying and Strengthening the Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-up of the Philippine Judicial Academy</i>), which approved PHILJA's staffing pattern, hereto attached as Annex "A."<br><br>In reference to the abovementioned Resolution, may we respectfully request the Court's approval of the following amendments solely referring to the Chancellor's Office.<br><br>1) To convert the position of <b>PHILJA Attorney VI</b>, salary grade 27, to <b>Judicial Staff Head</b> with the same salary grade 27, and change it from permanent to coterminous.<br><br>The conversion of the position will accord the Chancellor the discretion to hire a non-lawyer for the position when necessary.<br><br>2) To revert the status of the following positions from permanent to coterminous:<br><br><blockquote>SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer  SG 25 Judicial Staff Officer III  SG 18 Records Officer II  SG 14 Judicial Staff Assistant III SG 10<br></blockquote><br>Under the Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, the status of the above-mentioned positions were changed from coterminous to permanent status.<br><br>In view of the nature of work required by the Chancellor for the staff under the Office of the Chancellor, there is a need to appoint such personnel of trust and confidence of the Chancellor.<br><br>May we respectfully request that the permanent status of these positions be reverted to coterminous status.<br><br>For the Chief Justice's consideration and approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>In the Resolution dated June 23, 2009, the Court referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Services for comment thereon within ten (10) days from notice thereof.<br><br>In a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 22, 2009, Atty. Eden T. Candelaria, Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer, Office of Administrative Services, made the following observation and recommendation:<br><br><blockquote>This refers to the directive of the Honorable Court <i>En Banc</i> in its resolution dated June 23, 2009 to this Office to comment on the attached letter of Justice Adolfo S. Azcuna, Chancellor, PHILJA requesting the following:<br><br>1.  the conversion of the position of one (1) PHILJA Attorney VI (SG 27) in the Office of the Chancellor to Judicial Staff Head with the same Salary Grade 27; and<br><br>2.  the reversion of the status from permanent to coterminous of the positions in the Office of the Chancellor enumerated below:<br><br><blockquote>SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer      SG 25<br>Judicial Staff Officer III              SG 18<br>Records Officer II                  SG 14<br>Judicial Staff Assistant III         SG 10</blockquote><br>Under the Revised A.M. No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA, re: <i>"Further Clarifying and Strengthening the Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-up of the Philippine Judicial Academy,"</i> dated September 23, 2008, the status of the aforesaid positions, among others, was changed from coterminous to permanent.<br><br>Justice Azcuna avers that the nature of work required for the staff under the Office of Chancellor necessitates that their appointments be based on his trust and confidence.<br><br>Shown below is the plantilla of the Office of the Chancellor as approved pursuant to A.M.

However, with due respect to him, we cannot favorably recommend its conversion as Judicial Staff Head with the same Salary Grade of 27, primarily because the position of Judicial Staff Head is exclusively used only in the Offices of the Justices; and, secondly, per the Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the position of Judicial Staff Head has an assigned Salary Grade of 28, not Salary Grade 27.<br><br>As an alternative, we propose that the position of PHILJA Attorney VI in the Office of the Chancellor be converted and/or reclassified as PHILJA Head Executive Assistant with the same Salary Grade 27 as that of Court Attorney VI.<br><br>As regards the second request of Justice Azcuna, we propose the reversion of the status of the permanent positions in his Office to coterminous except, however, to the position of Records Officer II which we proposed to be retained as permanent in order that there would be continuity of the smooth operations in the office should there be a chance of a new administration.  All of the four (4) subject positions have existing funds.<br><br>Meanwhile, we believe that the restructuring of the Office of the Chancellor might as well affect the hierarchy of positions in the Offices of the Vice-Chancellor and Executive Secretary. Hence, with due respect also to Honorables Justo P. Torres and Marina L. Buzon, PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary, respectively, we propose that some changes be likewise made in their respective plantillas.<br><br>Shown below are the plantillas of the Offices of the PHILJA Vice-Chancellor and PHILJA Executive Secretary pursuant to the Revised A.M.

No. 01-1-04-SC-PHILJA for the purpose of clarifying and strengthening the organizational structure and administrative set-up of the PHILJA, including the key operating systems, staffing pattern, and the need to make it more appropriate to an academic institution.  The Court amended the staffing pattern of the following offices of the PHILJA:<br><br><blockquote>A.  Office of the Chancellor:<br><br>1.  PHILJA Attorney VI (SG 27) - newly created item; coterminous<br>2. SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) - from coterminous to permanent<br>3.

Clerk III (SG 6) - from coterminous to permanent</blockquote><br>In <i>Re: Clarifying and Strengthening the</i> <i>Organizational Structure and Administrative Set-Up of the Philippine Judicial Academy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><i> </i> the Court saw the necessity of retaining the originally proposed titles and salary grades of the positions of SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) and Supervising Judicial Staff Officer (SG 23) in the PHILJA as part of further enhancing its organizational structure and administrative set-up.<br><br>Corollarily, while the Court grants the request of Justice Azcuna that the PHILJA Attorney VI (SG 27), a newly created item, be changed to a non-lawyer designation, the appropriate position title should be PHILJA Head Executive Assistant with same Salary Grade 27, instead of Judicial Staff Head, which has an assigned Salary Grade 28, per Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades issued by the DBM.  The change in the position title to PHILJA Head Executive Assistant will afford him the discretion to hire an individual, including a non-lawyer, who possesses the qualifications required for the highly sensitive and confidential position.  The position of Judicial Staff Head is peculiar to the Offices of the Associate Justices performing functions pertaining to the adjudication of cases and administrative supervision and other confidential matters.  Additionally, as PHILJA Chancellor, Justice Azcuna should be given a free hand to select his office staff based on his trust and confidence and, hence, the need to have some position status changed from permanent to coterminous.  The position of Records Officer II should remain to be permanent as there is a need to ensure the continuity of workflow and preserve the records management.<br><br>Similarly, the changes in the nomenclature for the positions of PHILJA Attorney V to PHILJA Executive Assistant Supervisor (with same SG 26) for the Office of the Vice-Chancellor, and PHILJA Attorney IV to PHILJA Executive Assistant VI (with same SG 25) of the Office of the Executive Secretary, both being newly created and with position status of coterminous, are justified as the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive Secretary have the prerogative to hire heads of their office staff upon whom they can repose their trust and confidence.  The heads of the three offices who occupy Private Secretary positions perform functions which are primarily confidential in nature and, thus, coterminous with the official they<br><br>serve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In like manner, the hiring of key positions which are categorized as<br><br>confidential should be reverted from permanent to coterminous, except the position of Clerk III (SG 6) in each office which should remain to be permanent as there is a need to ensure the continuity of workflow and preserve the records management.<br><br>Thus, the following will be the amended staffing pattern of the respective offices of the PHILJA:<br><br>A.  Office of the Chancellor:<br><br><ol><li>PHILJA Head Executive Assistant (SG 27) -<br>newly-created item; coterminous<br></li><li>SC Chief Judicial Staff Officer (SG 25) -<br>from permanent to coterminous<br></li><li>Judicial Staff Officer III (SG 18) -<br>from permanent to coterminous<br></li><li>Judicial Staff Assistant III (SG 10) -<br>from permanent to coterminous</li></ol><br>B.

To <b>GRANT</b> the request of Justice Adolfo S. Azcuna, Chancellor of the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA), with regard to the Office of Chancellor, as follows:<br><br>a.
