CV No. 68934.&nbsp; The appellate court had affirmed the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 15, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lucena City, Branch 59, in Civil Case No. 99-129, dismissing the petitioners' complaint for annulment of title and damages against the respondents.<br><br>The subject matter of the controversy is the alleged foreshore land with an area of about 85,521 square meters, fronting Tayabas Bay in Guisguis, Sariaya, Quezon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On October 13, 1971, respondent Dioscoro Velasco was issued Original Certificate of Title No. P-16783<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><b> </b>covering said property by the Register of Deeds of Quezon Province, based on Homestead Patent No. 133300.&nbsp; On March 22, 1977, Velasco sold the property to respondent Sylvia Flores, and Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-160923<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><b> </b>was issued in her name.&nbsp; On January 4, 1981, the property was sold by Flores to Mildred Christine Flores-Tantoco and TCT No. T-177735<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was issued in the latter's name.&nbsp; Later, the property was divided into seven lots and TCT Nos. T-177777, T-177778, T-177779, T-177780, T-177781, T-177782, and T-177783 were issued in the name of Mildred Christine Flores-Tantoco.&nbsp; On January 18, 1992, the lots covered by TCT Nos. T-177780<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and T-177781<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> were sold back to Flores such that TCT No. T-278112<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><b> </b>and TCT No. 278110<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> were issued in her name.<br><br>Adjacent and contiguous to the alleged foreshore land is the agricultural land owned by petitioners.<br><br>On August 31, 1999, the petitioners filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for Annulment of Title and Damages against respondents before the RTC of Lucena City. They alleged that the issuance of the homestead patent and the series of transfers involving the same property were null and void.&nbsp; They further alleged that they applied for lease of the foreshore land and the government had approved in their favor Foreshore, Reclaimed Land or Miscellaneous Lease Application.&nbsp; Petitioners claimed that they were in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and use of said foreshore land since 1961.&nbsp; They stated that they had introduced improvements thereon and planted coconut seedlings (which had grown up into coconut trees) as well as other fruit-bearing trees and plants.&nbsp; They added that they had subleased the land to several tenants.<br><br>Petitioners averred that Dioscoro Velasco was not qualified to become a grantee of a homestead patent since he never occupied any portion nor introduced any improvements on the land.&nbsp; They claimed that Velasco was issued a homestead patent because he committed fraud, misrepresentation, and falsification in connivance with employees of the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; They argued that the sale between Velasco and Flores was invalid because it was not approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources as required under Commonwealth Act No. 141, otherwise known as "The Public Land Act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Hence, they claimed that the sale by Flores to Tantoco was likewise invalid.<br><br>On December 2, 1999, respondents moved to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the complaint on the following grounds: (1) petitioners do not have the legal personality to file the complaint since the property forms part of the public domain and only the Solicitor General could bring an action for reversion or any action which may have the effect of canceling a free patent and the corresponding certificate of title issued on the basis of the patent; (2) the sale of the property by Velasco to Flores is valid even without approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources as the required approval may be obtained after the sale had been consummated; (3) the certificate of title issued to Velasco can no longer be reviewed on the ground of fraud since a homestead patent registered in conformity with the provisions of Act No. 496<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> partakes of the nature of a certificate issued in a judicial proceeding and becomes indefeasible and incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from its issuance; and (4) petitioners' action is barred by laches since for almost 28 years, they failed to assert their alleged right over said property.<br><br>On June 15, 2000, the RTC granted the Motion to Dismiss and ruled that petitioners do not have the legal personality to file the complaint.&nbsp; It held that the government, not petitioners, is the real party in interest and, therefore, only the Solicitor General may bring the action in court.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the RTC's Order states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant Motion is granted and the plaintiffs['] complaint dismissed.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's Order, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp; The Order dated June 15, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 59, Lucena City dismissing plaintiffs-appellants' complaint for annulment of title with damages is <b>AFFIRMED</b> and <b>UPHELD</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioners raise the following issue for our resolution:<br><blockquote>[WHETHER OR NOT] THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISMISSING THE APPEAL AND IN AFFIRMING AND UPHOLDING THE ORDER OF DISMISSAL OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF LUCENA, BRANCH 59 THAT THE PETITIONERS DO NOT HAVE THE LEGAL PERSONALITY TO INSTITUTE THE COMPLAINT FOR CANCELLATION OF OCT NO. P-16789 ISSUED PURSUANT TO HOMESTEAD PATENT NO. 133300 IN THE NAME OF DIOSCORO VELASCO AND THE TRANSFER CERTIFICATES OF TITLES SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED IN FAVOR OF S[Y]LVIA L. FLORES AND MILDRED CHRISTINE FLORES-TANTOCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Stated simply, the sole issue in this case is whether or not petitioners are real parties in interest with authority to file a complaint for annulment of title of foreshore land.<br><br>Petitioners concede that under Section 101 of Commonwealth Act No. 141,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> only the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead may institute all actions for reversion in the proper courts. However, they invoke the principle of equity, arguing that equity and social justice demand that they be deemed real parties in interest and given a right to present evidence showing that the land titles of respondents are void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents, on the other hand, reiterate that petitioners are not real parties in interest because they do not represent the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>After due consideration of the submissions and arguments of the parties, we are in agreement that the instant petition lacks merit.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Parties in interest</i>. - A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.&nbsp; <b>Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest<i>.</i></b>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is admitted by both parties that the subject matter of controversy is foreshore land, which is defined as that strip of land that lies between the high and low water marks and is alternatively wet and dry according to the flow of the tides.&nbsp; It is that part of the land adjacent to the sea, which is alternately covered and left dry by the ordinary flow of tides.&nbsp; It is part of the alienable land of the public domain and may be disposed of only by lease and not otherwise.&nbsp; Foreshore land remains part of the public domain and is outside the commerce of man. It is not capable of private appropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Section 101 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 provides:<br><blockquote>All actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<br></blockquote>In all actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon, the Republic of the Philippines is the real party in interest.&nbsp; The action shall be instituted by the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, such action does not prescribe.&nbsp; Prescription and laches will not bar actions filed by the State to recover its property acquired through fraud by private individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing, we rule that petitioners are not the real parties in interest in this case. We therefore affirm the dismissal by the trial court of the complaint and the ruling of the Court of Appeals that petitioners must first lodge their complaint with the Bureau of Lands in order that an administrative investigation may be conducted under Section 91<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of The Public Land Act.<br><br>As to petitioners' contention that they should be deemed real parties in interest based on the principle of equity, we rule otherwise.&nbsp; Equity, which has been aptly described as "justice outside legality," is applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law or judicial rules of procedure.&nbsp; Positive rules prevail over all abstract arguments based on equity <i>contra legem</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated April 28, 2004 and the Resolution dated June 22, 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
