				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When the party-list group <i>Alagad</i> first won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1998, Diogenes S. Osabel (Osabel) sat as the party's representative in Congress.  In 2004, when the party again won one seat, Rodante D. Marcoleta (Marcoleta) sat as <i>Alagad</i>'s representative.<br><br>Due to infighting within <i>Alagad</i>'s ranks, however, Osabel and Marcoleta parted ways, each one claiming to represent the party's constituency. For the 2007 National and Local Elections, the warring factions of Osabel and Marcoleta each filed a separate list of nominees for <i>Alagad</i> at the Commission on Elections (Comelec).<br><br>With <i>Alagad</i> again winning a part-list seat in the House of Representatives, the Marcoleta and Osabel blocs contested the right to represent the party in the 14<sup>th</sup> Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Osabel, purportedly the <i>bona fide</i> president of <i>Alagad,</i> sought the cancellation of the certificates of nomination of the Marcoleta group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>By Omnibus Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of July 18, 2007, <u>the Comelec's <i>First </i>Division, then composed of Commissioners Resurreccion Borra and Romeo Brawner, resolved the dispute in favor of Osabel,</u> disposing as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Commission (First Division) <b>GRANTS</b> the Petition in <b>SPA No. 07-020</b> finding it imbued with merit.  The <b>Certificate of Nomination</b> filed by ALAGAD represented by <b>ALBERTO M. MALVAR</b> on January 15, 2007 and subject of <b>SPA No. 07-020</b> is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>.  <b>The Manifestation of Intent to Participate in the Party-List System of Representation</b> submitted by ALAGAD represented by its legitimate president <b>DIOGENES S. OSABEL</b> on January 25, 2007, and subject of <b>SPP No. 07-023</b> is hereby <b>ADMITTED</b>.  The <b>Manifestation of Intent to Participate in the Party-List System of Representation</b> submitted by ALAGAD represented by <b>ALBERTO M. MALVAR</b> on January 15, 2007 and subject of <b>SPP No. 07-003</b> is <b>DENIED DUE COURSE</b>. (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The controversy was then elevated by the Marcoleta group to the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> which, by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of November 6, 2007, reversed the <i>First </i>Division's Omnibus Resolution and reinstated the certificates of nomination of the Marcoleta group.  In the voting, however, <u>there were only two (2) commissioners who concurred in the Resolution while three (3) commissioners dissented</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>For thus failing to muster the required majority voting, the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>ordered a rehearing of the controversy on November 20, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>From the records,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> it appears that what was taken up during the scheduled November 20, 2007 hearing was the issue of "whether the [Comelec] could hear these cases on the rehearing aspect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The <i>First</i> Division's Omnibus Resolution in favor of Osabel was <u>eventually <i>affirmed</i> by  the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>by Resolution of February 5, 2008</u>, <i>viz</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote><b><u>During said rehearing, both parties agreed to file their simultaneous memoranda and thereafter to submit these cases for resolution.</u>  </b><br><br><b><u>The Commission received their respective memoranda on December 3, 2007.</u></b> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br><center>x x x x.<br></center><br>It appearing that the votes of the members of the Commission are still the same, or the necessary majority cannot be had, pursuant to Sec. 6, Rule 18, Comelec Rules of Procedure which reads:<br><br><center>x x x x.<br></center><br><u>the Resolution of the First Division is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On February 12, 2008, Marcoleta filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion to rectify<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>February 5, 2008 Resolution, contending that it inadvertently therein mentioned that there was a rehearing undertaken on November 20, 2007 when in fact there was none as the matter taken up on said date actually delved on the propriety of a rehearing; and that no memorandum from either of the parties was submitted on December 3, 2007.<br><br>By Order of February 12, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Commissioner Romeo Brawner, acting in his capacity as acting chairman of the Comelec, suspended until further orders the implementation of the Comelec <i>First </i>Division February 5, 2008 Omnibus Resolution.<br><br>Subsequently, by Order of February 26, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <u>the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> acknowledged that no rehearing had yet been undertaken and reiterated the earlier order of suspension of the February 5, 2009 <i>First </i>Division Omnibus Resolution</u>.  The Comelec <i>En Banc</i>, also therein resolving the prejudicial question raised by Osabel on whether there was a necessity of a rehearing, held in the affirmative, reasoning that:<br><blockquote>x x x x. The voting in the resolution disposing of the motion for reconsideration on the July 18, 2007 resolution of the First Division which yielded the 2-3 voting resulted in the failure to obtain the required number of votes for the pronouncement of a decision.  Hence, a rehearing should be conducted x x x x.<br></blockquote>A rehearing of the controversy between the parties was thereupon calendared for March 4, 2008. From the records, it appears that the scheduled rehearing did not push through in view of the filing in the <i>interim </i>of the present petitions by the contending parties.<br><br>In the above-captioned <b>G.R. No. 181377</b> (the petition filed by the Marcoleta group on February 7, 2008), petitioners fault the Comelec <i>En Banc </i>as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>The COMELEC en banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack or excess of jurisdiction when it issued the February 5, 2008
Order without the benefit of a rehearing, in violation of Section 6,
Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure;<br><br></li><li>The COMELEC en banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it affirmed the ruling of its First Division that Private Respondent Osabel did not resign his post as President of Alagad;<br><br></li><li>The COMELEC en banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it gave credence to the Minutes submitted by the Private Respondent, even though it was not approved by the Secretary-General of the Party;<br><br></li><li>The COMELEC en banc committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it did not consider the provision in the Party's Constitution and By-Laws that limits the tenure of officers and members of the Executive Committee to three (3) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Meanwhile,<b> G.R. No. 181726</b> filed on March 4, 2008 by <i>Alagad,</i> represented by Osabel, assails the suspension of the effects of the Comelec <i>First </i>Division February 5, 2008 Resolution as well as the February 26, 2008 Order that called for a rehearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><i>Alagad</i> asserts that the Comelec should not have suspended the effects of the February 5, 2008 Resolution when, on its face, the <i>ex parte</i> motion to rectify filed by Marcoleta suffered from lack of proof of service on the adverse party and the requisite notice of hearing; instead, an order to comment on the motion should have been the proper recourse of the Comelec.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In further arguing against the rehearing order of the Comelec, petitioner <i>Alagad</i> invites the Court's attention to the  earlier mentioned <i>En Banc </i>Resolution of November 6, 2007 (reinstating the certificates of nomination of the Marcoleta group) where it appears that the Osabel group "secured a majority vote of the quorum: three (3) against two (2) in a quorum of five commissioners, in spite the fact that Osabel is not the movant, and hence, not the party required to secure a majority to reverse the <i>First </i>Division Omnibus Resolution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of March 11, 2008, the Court consolidated both petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>G.R. No. 181377 was filed on February 7, 2008 by the Marcoleta group before it filed on February 12, 2008 before the Comelec the <i>ex parte</i> motion to rectify.  In light of the filing of said motion as well as the positive action of the Comelec in its Order of February 26, 2008 for a rehearing of the controversy, the petition had been rendered <b>moot and academic</b>.  More importantly, the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>, cannot be invoked when there is a plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as shown by petitioner's recourse.<br><br>The Court now proceeds to resolve G.R. No. 181726 filed by <i>Alagad</i>.  The twin issues to be determined are whether the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering a rehearing of the controversy; and in suspending the implementation of the Order of February 5, 2008 for lack of rehearing.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>While at first impression, the November 6, 2007 Resolution of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> seems to have affirmed the <i>First</i> Division's ruling, <u>the said Resolution merely reflected the manner of voting of the Comelec members</u>.<br><br>From the 2-3 voting, it is readily discerned that the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> cannot overturn the <i>First</i> Division on mere two assenting votes.  On the other hand, the same situation obtains in the case of <br> the dissenters, there being a shortage of one vote to sustain the <i>First</i> Division's findings.<br><br>To break this legal stalemate, Section 6, Rule 18 of the<i> Comelec Rules of Procedure</i> provides that:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided.--<u><b>When the Commission en banc is equally divided in opinion, <i>or the necessary majority cannot be had</i></b>, <b>the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached, the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed;</b></u> and in all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied.  (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><u>Majority, in this case, means a vote of four members of the Comelec</u>.  The Court in <i>Estrella v. Comelec</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> pronounced that Section 5 (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of Rule 3 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure and Section 7 of Article IX-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the Constitution require that a <b>majority vote of <u>all the members</u></b> of the Comelec, and not only those who participated and took part in the deliberations, is necessary for the pronouncement of a decision, resolution, order or ruling.<br><br><i>Alagad</i>'s reasoning that a rehearing is unnecessary since it garnered "a majority vote of the quorum" does not thus impress.<br><br>The Comelec, despite the obvious inclination of three commissioners to affirm the Resolution of the <i>First</i> Division, cannot do away with a rehearing since its Rules clearly provide for such a proceeding for the body to have a solicitous review of the controversy before it.  A rehearing clearly presupposes the participation of the opposing parties for the purpose of presenting additional evidence, if any, and further clarifying and amplifying their arguments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, neither the assenters nor dissenters can claim a majority in the <i>En Banc </i>Resolution of November 6, 2007.  The Resolution served no more than a record of votes, lacking in legal effect despite its pronouncement of reversal of the <i>First</i> Division Resolution.  Accordingly, the Comelec did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in ordering a rehearing.<br><br>The propriety of a rehearing now resolved, the issue of whether the Comelec committed grave abuse of discretion in suspending the effects of its <i>En Banc </i>Order of February 5, 2008 for lack of a rehearing comes to the fore.<br><br>From the records as well as the admission of inadvertence on the part of the Comelec, there is likewise nothing gravely abusive of the Comelec's assailed action.<br><br>A certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> from the Office of the Clerk of the Commission itself bolsters the assertion that the Comelec committed an evident oversight, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]here is no calendar of hearing with respect to these particular cases between November 21, 2007 and February 5, 2008.<br></blockquote>For the most part, the Comelec was well within its authority to order a re-hearing, it having the inherent power to amend or control its processes and orders before these become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It can even proceed to issue an order <i>motu proprio</i> to reconsider, recall or set aside an earlier resolution which is still under its control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Comelec's own Rules of Procedure authorize the body to "amend and control its processes and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and even to suspend said Rules or any portion thereof "in the interest of justice and in order to obtain speedy disposition of all matters pending before the Commission."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Thus, the supposed lack of proof of service on the adverse party and lack of notice of hearing of Marcoleta's <i>ex parte</i> motion to rectify deserve little consideration in invalidating the Order of February 12, 2008.  Moreover, that <i>Alagad</i> even moved to execute the Comelec's February 5, 2008 Order  on the same day the <i>ex parte</i> motion to rectify was filed (February 12, 2008)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> all the more justified the Comelec's action.<br><br>The Comelec, confronted with a glaring procedural lapse, lost no time in rectifying its action by suspending the effects of an earlier resolution and scheduling a mandatory rehearing.  To be sure, this negates any indication of grave abuse of discretion on its part in order to correct a lapse.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, G.R. No. 181377 is <b>DISMISSED </b>for being moot. G.R. No. 181726 is likewise <b>DISMISSED </b>for lack of merit.<br><br>Let the case be <b>REMANDED </b>to the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> for it to proceed with utmost dispatch with its intended rehearing and render the appropriate decision on the case at the earliest opportunity.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Both factions filed separate Manifestations of Intent to Participate in the Party-list System of Representation (SPP No. 07-003 and SPP No. 07-023).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In SPA No. 07-020.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
