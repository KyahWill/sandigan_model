The CA's reasoning for the modification and the dispositive portion of the CA Decision follow:<br><blockquote>Summing up, in Criminal Case No. 00-179745, the RTC correctly convicted Calimon of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, which is punishable by the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) when the offender is a non-licensee or non-holder of authority to recruit and deploy workers abroad, as in the instant case (<i>Sec. 7, Republic Act No. 8042</i>).&nbsp; Hence, the penalty imposed by the RTC must be modified to life imprisonment and a fine of One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00).<br><br>Comila was likewise correctly convicted by the RTC of the crime of simple Illegal Recruitment.&nbsp; The sentence pronounced by the RTC, was proper.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 00-180519, Grace Calimon was properly found guilty of Estafa through false pretenses. Since the amount defrauded from Fe Magnaye was P35,000.00, the penalty imposed by the RTC was proper.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 00-180520, since the amount defrauded from Lucila Agramon is P17,500.00, the correct penalty that should be imposed upon Calimon and Comila, in the absence of any modifying circumstances, should be the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of <u>prision correccional</u>, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and twenty (20) days of <u>prision mayor</u>, as maximum.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 00-180521, the amount involved is P17,500.00. There being no modifying circumstances, the penalty imposed by the trial court on Calimon is correct.&nbsp; However, it has been duly proven that Comila was a conspirator to the crime subject of this case.&nbsp; In view of her acquittal by the RTC, this matter can no longer be questioned in this appeal on the ground of double jeopardy.&nbsp; However, Comila should be made solidarily liable with Calimon to indemnify P17,500.00 to Daisy Devanadera, since Comila's acquittal on the ground of reasonable doubt did not declare whether the facts from which the civil liability might arise did not exist (<i>Last paragraph, Section 2, Rule 120, Rules of Court</i>).<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the May 21, 2001 Decision<i> </i>of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 35, in Criminal Cases Nos. 00-179745; 00-180519; 00-180520; and 00-180521, is hereby <b>AMENDED </b>to read as follows:<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered:<br><br>A.

In Criminal Cases Nos. 00-180519 and 00-180521, pronouncing accused GRACE CALIMON guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of estafa defined under paragraph 2 (a) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, and (1) sentencing said accused in Criminal Case No. 00-180519 to the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of <u><i>prision correccional</i></u>, as minimum, to nine (9) years of <u><i>prision mayor</i></u> as maximum; and (2) sentencing said accused in Criminal Case No. 00-180521, to the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of <u><i>prision correccional</i></u>, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and twenty (20) days of <u><i>prision mayor</i></u>, as maximum; and to pay the costs for each case.<br><br>C. In Criminal Case No. 00-180520, pronouncing accused GRACE CALIMON and AIDA COMILA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of estafa defined under paragraph 2 (a) Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing each of the said accused to the indeterminate penalty of <u><b>four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and Twenty (20) days of prision mayor</b></u>, as maximum, and to pay the costs in equal shares.<br><br>In the service of her (accused Aida Comila) sentence in Criminal Case No. 00-179745, and the respective sentences of both accused in Criminal Cases Nos. 00-180519, 00-180520 and 00-180521, inclusive, the period during which they have been under preventive imprisonment should be credited in their favor provided that they agreed voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners, otherwise, they should be credited with four-fifths only of the time they have been under preventive imprisonment.<br><br>In Criminal Cases Nos. 00-179745 and 00-180519, accused Grace Calimon is ordered to pay to complainant Fe Magnaye the sum of P35,000.00, as reparations for the damages she caused her.<br><br><b>In Criminal Cases Nos. 00-179745 and 00-180521, accused Grace Calimon is ordered to pay jointly and severally with Aida Comila to complainant Daisy Devanadera the sum of P17,500.00, as reparation for the damages she caused her</b>.<br><br>In Criminal Cases Nos. 00-179745 and 00-180520, accused Grace Calimon and accused Aida Comila are ordered, jointly and severally, to pay offended party Lucila C. Agramon the sum of P10,000.00, as reparation for the damages they caused her.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<br></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal based on the following lone assignment of error:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT&nbsp; GRACE CALIMON FOR ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT IN LARGE SCALE AND THREE (3) COUNTS OF ESTAFA AND AIDA COMILA FOR SIMPLE ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT AND ONE (1) COUNT OF ESTAFA DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br></blockquote>In their brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>, accused-appellants contend that the prosecution witnesses established that only Lo recruited private complainants and promised to deploy them abroad.&nbsp; They deny having collected placement fees, but ironically admitted that the amount collected was for medical examination, visa and passport fees.&nbsp; Further, they insist that they are not guilty of estafa through false pretenses because they did not commit any act of deceit as it was only accused Lo who promised to deploy private complainants to Italy for a fee.<br><br>The people, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), maintains that accused-appellant Calimon committed the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale while accused-appellant Comila committed the crime of simple illegal recruitment.&nbsp; By her conduct, Calimon successfully gave private complainants the impression that she had the ability to send workers abroad although she did not in fact have the authority to do so.&nbsp; She was also able to induce private complainants to tender payment for fees. Since there were three (3) workers involved in the transaction, she committed the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale. As to Comila, the OSG argues that there is clear and convincing evidence that she <u>conspired</u> with Calimon.&nbsp; The OSG, however, points out that conspiracy was not alleged in the Information.&nbsp; Hence, Comila can only be convicted for simple illegal recruitment, not for illegal recruitment in large scale in conspiracy with Calimon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the OSG submits that accused-appellant Calimon committed two counts of estafa through false pretenses while accused-appellant Comila committed one count of estafa through false pretenses. Accused-appellants' acts of deliberately misrepresenting themselves to&nbsp; private complainants as having the necessary authority or license to recruit applicants for overseas employment, and collecting money from them allegedly for processing fees and travel documents, but failing to deploy them and to return the money they had collected despite several demands clearly amount to estafa.<br><br>After a thorough review of the records, we hold that the present appeal is plainly unmeritorious.<br><br>The pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 8042 state:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 6.&nbsp; Definition</b>. - For purposes of this Act, illegal recruitment shall mean any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers and includes referring, contract services, promising or advertising for employment abroad, whether for profit or not, when undertaken by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority contemplated under Article 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the Philippines: Provided, that any such non-licensee or non-holder who, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment abroad to two or more persons shall be deemed so engaged. x x x<br><br>Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring or confederating with one another.&nbsp; It is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group. x x x<br><br><b>Sec. 7.&nbsp; Penalties</b>. -<br><br>(a) Any person found guilty of illegal recruitment shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of not less than six (6) years and one (1) day but not more than twelve (12) years and a fine of not less than Two hundred thousand&nbsp; pesos (P200,000.00) nor more than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>(b) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) nor more than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein.<br><br>Provided, however, That the maximum penalty shall be imposed if the person illegally recruited is less than eighteen (18) years of age or committed by a non-licensee or non-holder of authority.<br></blockquote>In a litany of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we held that to constitute illegal recruitment in large scale three (3) elements must concur: (a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; (b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Art. 13, par. (b), of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Art. 34 of the same Code (now Sec. 6, RA 8042); and, (c) the offender committed the same against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group.<br><br>Corollarily, Article 13, paragraph (b) of the Labor Code enumerates the acts which constitute recruitment and placement:<br><blockquote>(b) `Recruitment and placement' refer to any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, That any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.<br></blockquote>Here, we are convinced that the three elements were sufficiently proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><i>First</i>, accused-appellants, undoubtedly, did not have any license to recruit persons for overseas work.&nbsp; This is substantiated by the POEA, Licensing Branch which issued a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to this effect and the testimony of an employee of the POEA, Corazon Cristobal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, accused-appellants engaged in illegal recruitment activities, offering overseas employment for a fee.&nbsp; This is supported by the testimonies of the private complainants, particularly Devanadera<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> who categorically testified that accused-appellants promised private complainants employment and assured them of placement overseas.<br><br>Magnaye and Agramon also corroborated the testimony of Devanadera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><b>&nbsp; </b>Their narration undoubtedly established that accused-appellants promised them employment in Italy as factory workers and they (accused-appellants) asked money from them (private complainants) to allegedly process their papers and visas.&nbsp; Private complainants were deceived as they relied on accused-appellants' misrepresentation and scheme that caused them to entrust their money to them in exchange of what they later discovered was a vain hope of obtaining employment abroad.<br><br>Accused-appellants' mere denials, as well as their self-serving and uncorroborated testimonies, cannot stand against the straightforward testimonies of private complainants who positively identified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> them in court as the persons who enticed them to part with their money upon their fraudulent representations that they (accused-appellants) would be able to secure for the former employment abroad.&nbsp; In the absence of any evidence that the prosecution witnesses were motivated by improper motives, the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses shall not be interfered with by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, accused-appellant Calimon committed illegal recruitment activities involving at least three persons, <i>i.e., </i>the three private complainants herein.

By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><br>(a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.<br><br>....<br></blockquote>There are three ways of committing estafa under the above-quoted provision: (1) by using a fictitious name; (2) by falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; and (3) by means of other similar deceits.&nbsp; Under this class of estafa, the element of deceit is indispensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the deceit consists of accused-appellants' false statement or fraudulent representation which was made prior to, or at least simultaneously with, the delivery of the money by the complainants.&nbsp; To convict for this type of crime, it is essential that the false statement or fraudulent representation constitutes the very cause or the only motive which induces the complainant to part with the thing of value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants led private complainants to believe that they possessed the power, means and legal qualifications to provide the latter with work in Italy, when in fact they did not.&nbsp; Private complainants parted with their hard-earned money and suffered damage by reason of accused-appellants deceitful and illegal acts.&nbsp; The elements of deceit and damage for this form of estafa are indisputably present, hence their conviction for estafa was proper.&nbsp;<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit and the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
