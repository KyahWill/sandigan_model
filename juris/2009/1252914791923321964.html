				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR.-HC No. 00765 which affirmed an earlier Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Binan City, Branch 25 in Criminal Case No.9440-B, finding accused-appellants Arnold Garchitorena y Gamba, a.k.a. "Junior," Joey Pamplona, a.k.a. "Nato," and Jessie Garcia y Adorino guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of death and to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, P16,700.00 as actual damages, P408,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and to pay the costs of the suit.<br><br>The conviction of accused-appellants stemmed from an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated January 22, 1996, filed with the RTC for the crime of Murder, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about September 22, 1995, in the Municipality of Binan, Province of Laguna, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Arnold Garchitorena y Gamba, alias "Junior", Joey Pamplona alias "Nato" and Jessie Garcia y Adorino, conspiring, confederating together and mutualy helping each other, with intent to kill, while conveniently armed with a deadly bladed weapon, with abuse of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Mauro Biay y Almarinez with the said weapon, thereby inflicting upon him stab wounds on the different parts of his body which directly caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs.<br><br>That the crime was committed with the qualifying aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote><br>When arraigned, accused-appellants, duly assisted by their counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge.  Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented three (3) witnesses; namely, Dulce Borero, elder sister of the victim Mauro Biay and eyewitness to the killing of her brother; Dr. Rolando Poblete, who conducted an autopsy on the body of the victim and prepared the post-mortem report; and Amelia Biay, the victim's widow. The evidence for the prosecution, as culled from the CA Decision under review, is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In the proceedings before the trial court, witness for the prosecution Dulce Borero testified that on September 22, 1995, at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, she was selling "balut" at Sta. Inez, Almeda Subdivision, Brgy. Dela Paz, Binan, Laguna.  Her brother, Mauro Biay, also a "balut" vendor", was also at the area, about seven (7) arms length away from her when she was called by accused Jessie Garcia.  Borero testified that when her brother Mauro approached Jessie, the latter twisted the hand of her brother behind his back and Jessie's companions- accused Arnold Garchitorena and Joey Pamplona - began stabbing her brother Mauro repeatedly with a shiny bladed instrument.  Joey was at the right side of the victim and was strangling Mauro from behind. Witness saw her brother Mauro struggling to free himself while being stabbed by the three (3) accused., until her brother slumped facedown on the ground.  Arnold then instructed his two co-accused to run away.  During cross-examination, Borero claims that she wanted to shout for help but nothing came out from her mouth.  When the accused had left after the stabbing incident, witness claimed that she went home to call her elder brother Teodoro Biay, but when they returned to the scene, the victim was no longer there as he had already been brought to the Perpetual Help Hospital.  They learned from the tricycle driver who brought Mauro top the hospital that their brother was pronounced dead on arrival.<br><br>Dr. Rolando Poblete, the physician who conducted an autopsy on victim Mauro Biay and prepared the post-mortem report, testified that the victim's death was caused by "hypovolemic shock secondary to multiple stab wounds."  Witness specified the eight (8) stab wounds suffered by the victim - one in the neck, two in the chest, one below the armpit, two on the upper abdomen, one at the back and one at the left thigh - and also a laceration at the left forearm of Mauro.  According to the expert witness, the nature of stab wounds indicate that it may have been caused by more than one bladed instrument.<br><br>The victim's widow, Amelia Biay, testified that she incurred burial expenses amounting to P16,700.00 due to the death of her husband.  Also, her husband allegedly earned a minimum of P300.00 a day as a "balut" vendor and P100.00 occasionally as a part-time carpenter.<br></blockquote><br>The accused-appellants denied the charge against them.  Specifically, accused-appellant Joey Pamplona denied that he participated in the stabbing of Mauro Bay, accused-appellant Jessie Garcia interposed the defense of alibi, while accused-appellant Arnold Garchitorena interposed the defense of insanity.  Succinctly, the CA Decision summed up their respective defenses:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, accused Joey Pamplona denied that he participated in the stabbing of Mauro Biay.  Joey Pamplona claims that he was seated on a bench when co-accused Arnold came along.  Then the "balut" vendor arrived and Joey saw Arnold stand up, pull something from the right side of his pocket and stab the "balut" vendor once before running away. Joey Pamplona testified that after the stabbing incident, due to fear that Arnold might also stab him, he also ran away to the store of a certain Mang Tony, a barangay official and related the incident to Aling Bel, the wife of Mang Tony.  Joey Pamplona said that he stayed at Mang Tony's store until his father arrived and told him to go home.<br><br>Danilo Garados testified that on Septemebr 22, 1995, he was at the store of Mang Tony to buy cigarettes and saw Arnold and Joey seated on the bench near the artesian well.  Arnold and Joey allegedly called Mauro Biay and he saw Arnold stabbing Mauro.  Jessie Garcia was not there and Joey allegedly ran away when Arnold stabbed Mauro.<br><br>Clavel Estropegan testified that on September 22, 1995, around 9:00 p.m. Joey Pamplona entered her store and told her that Junior or Arnold Garchitorena was stabbing somebody.  She did not hear any commotion outside her house which is just four houses away from the artesian well.  However, she closed her store for fear that Arnold will enter her house.<br><br>Barangay Captain Alfredo Arcega testified that he investigated the stabbing incident and, although he had no personal knowledge, he found out that it was Arnold Garchitorena who stabbed Mauro Biay. Upon questioning Arnold, the latter admitted that he did stab Mauro.<br><br>Defense witness Miguelito Gonzalgo testified that on September 22, 1995, he was in his shoe factory at his house located at 186 Sta. Teresita Street, Almeda Subdivision, Binan when he heard Mauro Biay shouting, and so he went out of his house.  He allegedly saw two persons "embracing" each other near the artesian well.  He recognized these two persons as Mauro and Arnold.  He saw Arnold pulling out a knife from the body of Mauro and the latter slowly fell down on his side.  After Arnold washed his hands at the artesian well and walked away towards the house of his aunt, this witness approached Mauro and seeing that the victim was still breathing, went to get a tricycle to bring Mauro to the hospital.  When he got back to the area, there were many people who helped board Mauro in the tricycle and they brought him to the Perpetual Help Hospital in Binan.<br><br>The other co-accused Jessie Garcia took the stand and claimed that on September 22, 1995, between 8:00 and 9:00 in the evening, he was still riding a bus from his work in Blumentritt.  He arrived at his home in Binan only at 11:00 p.m.  On September 24, 1995, he was fetched by two (2) policemen and two (2) Barangay Tanods from his house and brought to the Binan Police Station for questioning.  Thereafter, he was put in jail and incarcerated for six (6) months without knowing the charges against him.  He was only informed that he was one of the suspects in the killing of Mauro Biay by his mother.<br><br>With respect to Arnold Garchitorena, Dr. Evelyn Belen, Medical Officer III and resident physician of the National Center for Mental Health, testified that she examined the accused Arnold and based on the history of the patient, it was found that he had been using prohibited drugs like shabu and marijuana for two (2) years prior to the stabbing incident in 1995.  The patient is allegedly suffering from schizophrenia, wherein he was hearing auditory voices, seeing strange things and is delusional.  However, Dr. Belen also testified that the accused Garchitorena had remissions or exaservation and understands what he was doing and was aware of his murder case in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>On May 9, 2001, the trial court rendered a Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court finds accused Arnold Garchitorena y Gamboa alias Junior, Joey Pamplona alias Nato and Jessie Garcia y Adorino <u>GUILTY</u> beyond reasonable of the crime of "MURDER" as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, by Republic Act 7659, (Heinous Crimes).  Accordingly, all of them are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>Furthermore, all of the accused are hereby ordered to pay jointly and severally Amelia Biay, widow of the victim Mauro Biay, the following sums:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)  50,000.00 - as and for civil indemnity<br>b)  50,000.00 - as and for moral damages<br>c)  50,000.00 - as and for exemplary damages<br>d)  16,700.00 - as and for actual damages<br>e)  408,000.00 - as and for loss of the earning capacity of Mauro Biay; and<br>f)  To pay the costs of suit.<br></div><br>Likewise, the Provincial Warden of the Provincial Jail, Sta. Cruz, Laguna, is hereby ordered to transfer/commit the three (3) accused to the New Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City, immediately upon receipt hereof.<br><br>Considering that death penalty was meted against all of the accused, let the entire records of the above-entitled case be forwarded to the Supreme Court for automatic review and judgment pursuant to Rule 122, Sec.10 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Accused-appellants appealed to the CA. Pamplona and Garcia reiterated their denial of the charge against them.  Garchitorena who never denied his participation in the killing, insisted, however, insisted that he is exempt from criminal liability because he was suffering from a mental disorder before, during and after the commission of the crime.<br><br>On May 31, 2006, the CA rendered the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> now under review, affirming RTC's Decision <i>in toto</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, the instant appeal is DISMISSED.  Accordingly, the appealed March 9, 2001 Decuision of the Regional Trial Court of Binan, Laguna, Branch 25, in Criminal Case No. 9440-B finding herein accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder is AFFIRMED in its entirety.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>In arriving at the assailed Decision, the CA ratiocinated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>After studying the records of this case, we do not find any reason to overturn the ruling of the trial court.<br><br>Despite the testimony of defense witnesses that it was only accused-appellant Arnold Garchitorena who stabbed the victim Mauro Biay, we find reason to uphold the trial court's giving credence to prosecution witness Dulce Borero who testified as an eyewitness on the circumstances surrounding the incident and the manner by which the crime committed.<br><br>Defense witness Garados testified that he was at the store and saw both Arnold and Joey at the vicinity where the stabbing incident happened, seated on a bench near the artesian well, when they called the victim Mauro.  Defense witness Gonzalgo was in his house when he heard the commotion and went outside to see Arnold and Mauro "embracing" near the artesian well and the former pulling a knife from the body of the latter.  On the other hand, prosecution witness Borero was merely seven arms length away from the incident and could easily see the victim Mauro overpowered and attacked by his assailants, Arnold Garchitorena, Joey Pamplona and Jessie Garcia.  She witnessed the stabbing incident in its entirely and positively identified the accused and their criminal acts.  It is a well-settled rule that the evaluation of testimonies of witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect because such court has the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and determine if they are telling the truth or not.  (People vs. Cardel, 336 SCRA 144)<br><br>Evidence presented by the prosecution shows that the accused conspired to assault the victim Mauro Biay. Accused Jessie Garcia was the one who called the victim and prompted the latter to approach their group near the artesian well.  When the victim was near enough, accused Jessie Garcia and co-accused Joey Pamplona restrained Mauro Biay and overpowered him.  Witness Borero then saw the two accused, Jessie Garcia and Joey Pamplona, together with their co-accused Arnold Garchitorena instructed his two co-accused to run.  Conspiracy is apparent in the concerted action of the three accused.  There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it (People vs. Pendatun, 434 SCRA 148).  Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated or inferred from the acts of the accused which show a joint or common purpose and design, a concerted action and community of interest among the accused (People vs. Sicad, et al., 391 SCRA 19).<br><br>Likewise, we affirm the trial court's appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength to qualify the crime into murder.  "While it is true that superiority in number does not per se mean superiority in strength, the appellants in this case did not only enjoy superiority in number, but were armed with a weapon, while the victim had no means with which to defend himself.  Thus, there was obvious physical disparity between the protagonists and abuse of superior strength attended the killing when the offenders took advantage of their combined strength in order to consummate the offense." (<i>People of the Phils. vs. Parreno</i>, 433 SCRA 591).  In the case at bar, the victim was rendered helpless when he was assaulted by the three accused.  He was restrained and overpowered by the combined strength and the weapons used by his assailants.<br><br>We do not find improbable Borero's failure to act or shout for help upon witnessing the stabbing of her brother Mauro Biay.  It is an accepted maxim that different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation and there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling experience.  xxx There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident.  The workings of the human mind when placed under emotional stress are unpredictable. (<i>People of the Philippines vs. Aspuria</i>, 391 SCRA 404)<br><br>Accused-appellant Jessie Garcia's denial of any involvement cannot prevail over Borero's positive identification. As ruled by the trial court, allegations that accused Jessie Garcia was somewhere else when the crime was committed is not enough.  He must likewise demonstrate that he could not have been present at the crime scene, or in its vicinity.  He also could have sought the help of his co-worker, employer or anyone in the area to support his defense of alibi.  Indeed, we affirm that accused Jessie Garcia's allegation that he was elsewhere when the crime was committed is not substantiated by evidence.  Alibi can easily be fabricated.  Well-settled is the rule that alibi is an inherently weak defense which cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the victim.  (<i>People of the Phils. vs. Cadampog</i>, 428 SCRA 336)<br><br>Finally, the defense of insanity cannot be given merit when the expert witness herself, Dr. Belen, attested that accused Arnold Garchitorena was experiencing remission and was even aware of his murder case in court.  The trial court had basis to conclude that during the commission of the crime, Arnold was not totally deprived of reason and freedom of will.  In fact, after the stabbing incident, accused Arnold Garchitorena instructed his co-accused to run away from the scene.  We agree that such action demonstrates that Arnold possessed the intelligence to be aware of his and his co-accused's criminal acts.  A defendant in a criminal case who interpose the defense of mental incapacity has the burden of establishing the fact that he was insane at the very moment when the crime was committed.  There must be complete deprivation of reason in the commission of the act, or that the accused acted without discernment, which must be proven by clear and positive evidence.  The mere abnormality of his mental faculties does not preclude imputability.  Indeed, a man may act crazy but it does not necessarily and conclusively prove that he is legally so.  (<i>People of the Philippines vs. Galigao</i>, 395 SCRA 195)<br><br>Having found the court a quo's decision to be supported by the evidence on record, and for being in accord with prevailing jurisprudence, we find no reason to set it aside.<br><br>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing premises, the instant appeal is DISMISSED.  Accordingly, the appealed March 9, 2001 Decision of the  Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna, Branch 25, in Criminal Case No. 9440-B finding herein accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder is AFFIRMED in its entirely.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>The case was elevated to this Court for automatic review.  The People and the accused-appellants opted not to file any supplemental brief.  The respective assignments of errors contained in the briefs that they filed with the CA are set forth hereunder.<br><br>For accused-appellant Pamplona:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL AND TOTAL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS DULCE BORERO<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE APPELLANT<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING APPELLANT WHEN HIS GUILT HAS NOT BEEN DULY PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT<br></blockquote><br>For accused-appellant Garcia:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING UNDUE WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT GIVEN BY DULCE BORERO, ELDER SISTER OF THE VICTIM AND PROSECUTION WITNESS, IN RESPECT OF THE PARTICIPATION OF THE HEREIN ACCUSED DESPITE GLARING INCONSISTENCIES, INHERENT IMPROBABILITIES AND UNRELIABLE DECLARATION ATTENDING THE SAME; AND, ON THE OTHERHAND, IN DISREGARDING THE COHERENT, CONSISTENT AND CREDIBLE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF DEFENSE WITNESSES - ALL IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE RULES GOVERNING QUANTUM OF PROOF IN CRIMINAL CASES AND THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENSE EXISTING IN FAVOR OF ACCUSED GARCIA;<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN COMPLETELY DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI INTERPOSED BY ACCUSED-APPELLANT JESSIE GARCIA WHO WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE AT THE TIME AS TO RENDER IT PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO HAVE BEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AND EVEN IF THE SAME IS SUBSTANTIATED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, THAT IS, THE TESTIMONIES OF OITHER DEFENSE WITNESSES WHO WERE ONE IN SAYING THAT HE WAS NOT PRESENT THEREAT;<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ENTERING A VERDICT OF CONVICTION FOR JESSIE GARCIA INSTEAD OF ACQUITTAL WHEN NONE OF THE OTHER ACCUSED, AFTER HAVING ADMITTED THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME, IMPLICATED HIM;<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED, IN AWARDING MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE THEREFOR.<br></blockquote><br>For accused-appellant Garchitorena:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE OVER THE TESTIMONY OF AN EXPERT WITNESS.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED ARNOLD GARCHITORENA TO HAVE WILLFULLY EXECUTED THE ACTS COMPLAINED OF.<br></blockquote><br>Accused-appellant <b>Pamplona</b> capitalized on Dulce Borero's inaction at the time when she had supposedly witnessed the slaying of her younger brother. He argued that if she really witnessed the crime, she would have had readily helped her brother Mauro instead of fleeing. Accused-appellant <b>Garcia</b> anchored his acquittal on his defense of alibi, while accused-appellant <b>Garchitorena</b> used his alleged mental disorder, specifically, <i>schizophrenia</i>, as a ground to free himself from criminal liability.<br><br>The core issues raised by the both accused-appellants Pamplona and Garcia are factual in nature and delve on the credibility of the witnesses.<br><br>Since the accused-appellants raise factual issues, they must use cogent and convincing arguments to show that the trial court erred in appreciating the evidence.  They, however, have failed to do so.<br><br>Accused-appellant Pamplona contends that the trial court's decision was rendered by a judge other than the one who conducted trial.  Hence, the judge who decided the case failed to observe the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand so as to gauge their credibility.  This argument does not convince the Court for the reason it has consistently maintained, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>We have ruled in <i>People v. Sadiangabay</i> (G.R. No. 87214, March 30, 1993, 220 SCRA 551), that the circumstance alone that the judge who wrote the decision had not heard the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses would not taint his decision.  After all, he had the full record before him, including the transcript of stenographic notes which he could study.  The efficacy of a decision is not necessarily impaired by the fact that its writer only took over from a colleague who had earlier presided at the trial, unless there is a clear showing of a grave abuse of discretion in the factual findings reached by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>A perusal of the trial court's decision readily shows that it was duly based on the evidence presented during the trial.  It is evident that he thoroughly examined the testimonial and documentary evidence before him and carefully assessed the credibility of the witnesses.  This Court finds no plausible ground to set aside the factual findings of the trial court, which were sustained by the CA.<br><br>The eyewitness Dulce Borero's testimony clearly established Pamplona and Garcia's participation and, consequently, their culpability in the appalling murder of Mauro Biay:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"Fiscal Nofuente (To the witness)<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Madam witness, do you know Mauro Biay?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;">xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Do you know likewise the cause of his death?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>What was the cause of his death</b>?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>He was repeatedly stabbed sir</b>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">You said that Mauro Biay was repeatedly stabbed, <b>who stabbed Mauro Biay repeatedly</b>?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Arnold</b><b> Gatchitorena, was stabbing repeatedly the victim sir</b>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was Arnold Gatchitorena alone when he stabbed Mauro Biay?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">They were three (3) who were stabbing Mauro Biay, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You said that they were three who were stabbing Mauro Biay, who are the other two?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Jessie Garcia and Joey Pamplona</b> sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">So that when you said three, you are referring to Arnold Gatchitorena, Joey Pamplona and Jessie Garcia?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now, when [did] this stabbing incident [happen]?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">On September 22, 1995 sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know what was [the] time when this incident happened on September 22, 1995?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">9:00 o'clock in the evening sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Where [did] this stabbing [happen]?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">At Sta.

motive on the part of Borero, we sustain the lower court in giving her testimony full faith and credence.  Moreover, the prosecution's version is supported by the physical evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Borero's testimony that the victim was successively stabbed several times conforms with the autopsy report that the latter suffered multiple stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Pamplona's argument that there were inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses Borero is not convincing.  He specifically points out that in the direct examination of Borero, she stated that it was Jessie Garcia who twisted the hand of Mauro Biay backwards when the latter approached the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  In the cross-examination, she stated that it was Joey Pamplona who strangled the victim when the latter approached Jessie Garcia.<br><br>The seeming inconsistencies between her direct testimony and her cross-examination testimonies are not sufficient ground to disregard them.  In <i>People v. Alberto Restoles y Tuyo, Roldan Noel y Molet and Jimmy Alayon y De la Cruz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>...minor inconsistencies do not affect the credibility of witnesses, as they may even tend to strengthen rather than weaken their credibility. Inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect either the substance of their declaration, their veracity, or the weight of their testimony.  Such minor flaws may even enhance the worth of a testimony, for they guard against memorized falsities.</blockquote><br>Moreover, such inconsistencies did not contradict the credibility of Borero or her narration of the incident. On the contrary, they showed that her account was the <i>entire</i> truth.  In fact, her narration was in harmony with the account of defense witness Gonzalgo.  We note further that both the Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of Borero and her testimony before the lower court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> were in complete congruence.<br><br>Undoubtedly, accused-appellants' identities as the perpetrators were established by the prosecution.  The prosecution witness was able to observe the entire incident, because she was there.  Thus, we find no reason to differ with the trial court's appreciation of her testimony. Positive identification, where categorical and consistent, and not attended by any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitnesses on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Garcia's alibi has no leg to stand on.  In <i>People v. Desalisa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> this Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>...for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place when the crime was committed, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime or its immediate vicinity through clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote><br>Here, the crime was committed at Binan, Laguna.  Although Garcia testified that he was still riding a bus from his work in Blumentritt and arrived in Binan only at 11:00 P.M. or two hours after the killing incident, still, he failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity.  His alibi must fail.<br><br>Accused-appellant Garchitorena's defense of insanity has also no merit.  Unlike other jurisdictions, Philippine courts have established a more stringent criterion for the acceptance of insanity as an exempting circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  As aptly argued by the Solicitor General, insanity is a defense in the nature of confession and avoidance.  As such, it must be adequately proved, and accused-appellant Garchitorena utterly failed to do so.  We agree with both the CA and the trial court that he was not totally deprived of reason and freedom of will during and after the stabbing incident, as he even instructed his co-accused-appellants to run away from the scene of the crime.<br><br>Accused-appellant Garcia also argues that there was no conspiracy, as "there was no evidence whatsoever that he aided the other two accused-appellants or that he participated in their criminal designs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  We are not persuaded.  In <i>People v. Maldo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we stated:<br><br><blockquote>"Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.  <i>Direct proof is not essential, for conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused prior to, during or subsequent to the incident</i>.  Such acts must point to a joint purpose, concert of action or community of interest. <i>Hence, the victim need not be actually hit by each of the conspirators for the act of one of them is deemed the act of all</i>."  (citations omitted, emphasis ours)<br></blockquote><br>In this case, conspiracy was shown because accused-appellants were together in performing the concerted acts in pursuit of their common objective.  Garcia grabbed the victim's hands and twisted his arms; in turn, Pamplona, together with Garchitorena, strangled him and straddled him on the ground, then stabbed him.  The victim was trying to free himself from them, but they were too strong.  All means through which the victim could escape were blocked by them until he fell to the ground and expired.  The three accused-appellants' prior act of waiting for the victim outside affirms the existence of conspiracy, for it speaks of a common design and purpose.<br><br>Where there is conspiracy, as here, evidence as to who among the accused rendered the fatal blow is not necessary.  All conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the intent and the character of their participation, because the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The aggravating circumstance of superior strength should be appreciated against the accused-appellants.  Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, considering that a situation of superiority of strength is notoriously advantageous for the aggressor and is selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  This circumstance was alleged in the Information and was proved during the trial. In the case at bar, the victim certainly could not defend himself in any way.  The accused-appellants, armed with a deadly weapon, immobilized the victim and stabbed him successively using the same deadly weapon.<br><br>All told, the trial court correctly convicted the accused-appellants of murder, considering the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.  Since an aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength attended the commission of the crime, each of the accused-appellants should be sentenced to suffer the penalty of death in accordance with Article 63<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code.  Murder, under Article 248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.  Following Article 63 of the same code, the higher penalty of death shall be applied.<br><br>In view, however, of the passage of <i>R.A. No. 9346</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> otherwise known as the Anti-Death Penalty Law, which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole should instead be imposed.  Accordingly, accused-appellants shall be sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole in lieu of the penalty of death.<br><br>While the new law prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty provided for by law for a heinous offense is still death and the offense is still heinous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Consequently, the civil indemnity for the victim is still P75,000.00.  In <i>People v. Quiachon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we explained that even if the penalty of death was not to be imposed on appellant because of the prohibition in Republic Act No. 9346, the civil indemnity of P75,000.00 was still proper.  Following the ratiocination in <i>People v. Victor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the said award is not dependent on the actual imposition of the death penalty, but on the fact that qualifying circumstances warranting the imposition of the death penalty attended the commission of the crime.<br><br>Hence, we modify the award of civil indemnity by the trial court from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00. Civil indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime.  Likewise the award of P50,000.00 for moral damages is modified and increased to P75,000.00, consistent with recent jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> on heinous crimes where the imposable penalty is death, it is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> pursuant to R.A. 9346.  The award of moral damages does not require allegation and proof of the emotional suffering of the heirs, since the emotional wounds from the vicious killing of the victim cannot be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The trial court's award of exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 shall, however, be reduced to P30,000.00, also pursuant to the latest jurisprudence on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>As to the award of actual damages amounting to P16,700.00, we modify the same.  In <i>People v. Villanueva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this Court declared that "...when actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, as in this case, the award of temperate damages for P25,000.00 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount."  In the light of such ruling, the victim's heirs in the present case should, therefore, be awarded temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<br><br>The award of P408,000.00 for loss of earning capacity is justified.  As a rule, documentary evidence should be presented to substantiate the claim for damages for loss of earning capacity.  By way of exception, damages for loss of earning capacity may be awarded despite the absence of documentary evidence when (1) the deceased is self-employed and earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws, in which case judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in the deceased's line of work no documentary evidence is available; or (2) the deceased is employed as a daily wage worker earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  It cannot be disputed that the victim, at the time of his death, was self-employed and earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws.  The computation arrived at by the trial court was in accordance with the formula for computing the award for loss of earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  Thus,<br><br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%"><div align="justify">Award for <br>lost earnings</div></td> <td width="80%"><div align="justify">= 2/3 [80-age at time of death] x [gross annual income - 50% (GAI)]</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">= 2/3 [80-29] x P24,000.00 - P12,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">= (34) x (P12,000.00)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">= P408,000.00</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the CA in CA-G.R.
