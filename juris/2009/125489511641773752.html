The appellant, Reynilda Naprada (<i>Reynilda</i>), and Arnold Naprada (<i>Arnold</i>) took the witness stand for the defense.<br><br>AAA testified that at around 5:30 a.m. of July 30, 1998, she left her house in Cogeo, Antipolo City and walked towards Bagong Nayon Elementary School to attend her classes. On her way to school, the appellant appeared from behind, went to her right side, and placed his arms over her shoulders. The appellant pointed a sharp object at AAA's neck, and told her not to make a noise. The appellant brought AAA to a nearby garage in Cogeo, and, once inside, started kissing her. AAA resisted but the appellant continued kissing her. The appellant took out his penis and asked AAA to hold it. AAA declined but the appellant threatened to kill her. AAA held the appellant's penis using her right hand; afterwards, the appellant inserted his hand into AAA's shorts and touched her private part.<br><br>Thereafter, the appellant ordered AAA to lie on the hood of the car that was parked inside the garage. The appellant took off AAA's shorts and then inserted his penis inside her vagina. AAA felt pain but did not tell the appellant to stop because she felt scared. Afterwards, the appellant ordered AAA to stand and place his penis inside her mouth. AAA obliged because she was scared.  Immediately after, the appellant told AAA to put back her shorts and pick up her bag. He told AAA to go to school as they went out of the garage.<br><br>AAA arrived in school at around 6:30 a.m., but she went home because her teacher was not yet there. She narrated the rape to her mother, BBB, upon arriving home. BBB immediately reported the incident to the <i>barangay</i> officials, and then accompanied AAA to the garage where the rape took place. The appellant was no longer there. The <i>barangay tanod</i> conducted a search for the appellant, but only located him at around 7:00 a.m. of the next day. The <i>tanod</i> brought the appellant to the <i>barangay</i> hall, where AAA pointed to him as the person who had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, AAA confirmed that she had executed an affidavit at the police station on August 1, 1998 in the presence of BBB. She recalled that the appellant came from behind her, overtook her, covered his face with his t-shirt, came back to her right side and placed his arms around her shoulder. According to her, the appellant was wearing a moss green t-shirt and <i>maong</i> pants; and that his face was still partly visible despite the t-shirt on his face. She further added that the street was quite bright when the appellant approached her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On re-direct, AAA explained that the appellant's face was not anymore covered when he started kissing her. On re-cross, AAA confirmed that the appellant's face was also not covered when he ordered her to lie on the hood of the car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Rufino, the over-all chief <i>tanod</i> of <i>Barangay</i> Bagong Nayon, testified that AAA and BBB arrived at the <i>barangay</i> hall at 7:00 a.m. of July 30, 1998 to report the rape incident. AAA narrated that she had been raped inside a garage located at the corner of Road 3 and Road 4 in Cogeo; she then described the features of the suspect. Immediately after, the <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i> went to the garage but did not find anyone.<br><br>AAA, BBB, and the victim's father, CCC, returned to the <i>barangay</i> hall the next morning and reported that AAA saw the appellant at Phase 2, Road 28. The <i>barangay</i> <i>tanod</i>, AAA and her parents all went to this place; AAA saw the appellant and pointed to him as the person who had raped her. Immediately after, the <i>tanod</i> approached the appellant and invited him to the <i>barangay</i> hall. At the <i>barangay</i> hall, AAA again identified the appellant as the person who had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Rufino testified that the house beside the garage was owned by a certain Colonel Ruiz who was seldom home. He explained that the appellant was delivering water when he (Rufino) approached him and invited him to the <i>barangay</i> hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>BBB stated that AAA was 11 years old on July 30, 1998. She narrated that AAA returned from school at around 7:00 a.m. of July 30, 1998, and told her that she had been raped. She and other <i>barangay </i>officials accompanied AAA to the garage in Cogeo, but the suspect was not there. They went to the house of her friend, Gertrudes Bascal (<i>Gertrudes</i>), where they waited for AAA's father, CCC. When CCC arrived, AAA narrated to him her harrowing experience.  At around 10:00 a.m., AAA and BBB went to Camp Crame, where AAA was interviewed and examined. Afterwards, they went to the Antipolo Police Station to report the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, BBB testified that the house of Gertrudes was near the garage where AAA had been raped. She confirmed that AAA was interviewed at Camp Crame before being examined. She added that AAA executed at the Antipolo Police Station a sworn statement narrating the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>CCC narrated that he went to the Land Transportation Office at around 5:00 a.m. of July 30, 1998 to have the meter of his taxi resealed. He went back to Cogeo at around 10:00 a.m. Upon arrival, his brother-in-law told him that AAA had been raped. AAA confirmed in their talk that she had indeed been raped. He went to the garage together with AAA, BBB and his brother-in-law, but did not see anyone. According to him, the occupants of the house adjacent to the garage refused to talk to them about  the incident.<br><br>CCC further testified that in the early morning of the next day, AAA informed him that she saw the appellant deliver water to a neighbor. AAA answered in the affirmative when asked if the appellant was the person who had raped her. He immediately went to the <i>barangay</i> hall and sought the assistance of the <i>barangay tanod</i>. They proceeded to Road 28 and saw the appellant delivering water to another neighbor. The chief <i>barangay tanod</i> invited the appellant to the <i>barangay</i> hall where they questioned him. There,  AAA identified the appellant as the person who had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, CCC stated that he only saw one car in the garage. He added that he tried to talk to the occupants of the nearby houses but they refused to cooperate. At the <i>barangay</i> hall, the chief <i>tanod</i> took the appellant's clothes. CCC brought these clothes to Camp Crame for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Dr. Suguitan, the Medico-Legal Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, Quezon City, testified that she conducted a medical examination of AAA on July 31, 1998, and made the following findings:<br><br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br><u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</u><br><br>Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female subject. Breasts are conical with pale brown areola and nipples from which secretions could be pressed out. Abdomen is flat and soft.<br><br><u>GENITAL:</u><br><br>There is scanty growth of pubic hair.

At around 5:00 a.m. of July 30, 1998, the appellant reported for work at her house in Cogeo Village, Antipolo City. She woke up her son, Arnold, and told the appellant to wait in the <i>sala</i>. Arnold took a shower, drank coffee and told the appellant to start the truck's engine. Afterwards, Arnold and the appellant proceeded to Buso-Buso to pick up the  water they would deliver. They returned to Reynilda's house at around 10:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The appellant declared on the witness stand that he left his house in Cogeo Village, Antipolo City at around 4:30 a.m. of July 30, 1998 to report for work at the house of his employer, Reynilda. He arrived there in 20 to 30 minutes, and asked Reynilda to call Arnold as he (appellant) was ready for their water delivery. The appellant and Arnold left the house at around 6:00 a.m. and returned there after one delivery. He stayed at Reynilda's house until 3:00 p.m., and then went home.<br><br>The next day, the appellant went to work at 4:30 a.m.; he and Arnold finished delivering water before 7:00 a.m. Arnold parked the delivery truck at Road 28.  At this point, two men approached him and asked about the price of a drum of water. The two men then held his hand and requested him to go with them. They brought him to the <i>barangay</i> hall and placed him in a cell.  They brought him before the <i>barangay</i> captain when he arrived.  While before the <i>barangay</i> captain, a girl arrived and pointed to him as the person who had raped her.  The people inside the room then mauled him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, the appellant testified that he had stayed in Cogeo for only two weeks prior to July 30, 1998. He resides in Olongapo and worked there as a carnival employee. While in Cogeo, he was hired by Reynilda as a truck helper to assist in her water delivery business. He would report for work at around 5:00 a.m., and go with Reynilda's son, Arnold, to Buso-Buso to pick up the water they would deliver. They picked up water four to five times a day, and finish their delivery at around 5:00 p.m.<br><br>He reiterated that he left his house at 4:30 a.m. on July 30, 1998 to report for work, and arrived at Reynilda's house at around 4:45 a.m. In the early morning of the next day, two men approached him while he and Arnold were delivering water at Road 28. One of the men asked about the price of a drum of water, and then told him to go with them to the <i>barangay</i> hall. He went with them and was handcuffed and placed in a cell at the <i>barangay</i> hall. He was in the cell for an hour and was thereafter brought before the <i>barangay</i> chairman. At that point, BBB arrived, slapped him, and accused him of raping her (BBB's) daughter. Thereafter, the men inside the <i>barangay</i> chairman's office punched him.  His wife and mother-in-law arrived soon after. They later brought him in a vehicle to the Antipolo Police Station where they again investigated him and placed him in a cell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Arnold testified that he saw the appellant wiping the delivery truck outside his house at around 5:00 a.m. of July 30, 1998. After his shower, he and the appellant proceeded to <i>Buso Buso</i> to pick the water they would deliver. They delivered water in Cogeo until 12:00 p.m., ate lunch and separated at Road 24. The next day, while he and the appellant were delivering water at Road 28, two men approached the appellant and invited him to come with them to the <i>barangay</i> hall for questioning. The appellant went with the two men and was detained at the <i>barangay</i> hall. A <i>tanod </i>informed him (Arnold)<i> </i>that the appellant was being accused of rape. Arnold thereafter went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In its decision of November 20, 2002, the RTC convicted the appellant of the crime of rape and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> pursuant to Republic Act No. 7610, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.  The RTC likewise ordered him to indemnify the victim the amount of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The records of this case were originally transmitted to this Court on appeal. Pursuant to <i>People v. Mateo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we endorsed the case and the records to the CA for appropriate action and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of November 2, 2005, the CA affirmed the RTC decision with the modification that the appellant be ordered to pay the victim P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The CA held that AAA's testimony was candid, straightforward, and free from inconsistencies. AAA positively identified the appellant as the person who had raped her using force and intimidation, and her testimony was corroborated by the medico-legal report of Dr. Suguitan. According to the CA, when the victim's testimony is corroborated by the physician's finding of penetration, sufficient basis exists to conclude that carnal knowledge took place.<br><br>The CA further ruled that mere carnal knowledge with AAA, even without force and intimidation, already constituted rape as the prosecution proved that AAA was only 11 years old when she was sexually abused.<br><br>As its final point, the CA held that the appellant's denial cannot overcome AAA's positive identification that he was her rapist.<br><br>In his brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the appellant essentially argued that the RTC erred in convicting him because the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b><u><center>THE COURT'S RULING</center></u></b><br><br><b> We resolve to <i>deny</i> the appeal for lack of merit but modify the amount of the awarded indemnities.</b><br><br><b><u>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</u></b><br><br>The Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> defines and penalizes Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>ART.   266-A.  <i>Rape; When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed -<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br>d) When the offended party is <b>under twelve (12) years of age</b> or is demented, <b>even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</b><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div></blockquote><br>Thus, for the charge of rape to prosper, the prosecution must prove that (1) <b>the</b> <b>offender had carnal knowledge of a woman,</b> and (2) he accomplished such act through force, threat, or intimidation, or<b> </b>when she was deprived of reason<b> </b>or otherwise unconscious,<b> </b>or when she was <b>under 12 years of age</b> or was demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Sexual intercourse with a girl below 12 years old is statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>AAA, while recounting her ordeal, positively identified the appellant as the person who had raped her. Her testimony dated October 28, 1998 was clear and straightforward; she was consistent in her recollection of the details of her defloration, and never wavered in pointing to the appellant as her abuser.

credible, considering especially the corroboration it received from the medico-legal report and testimony of Dr. Suguitan. The records do not contain any evidence that would inject doubt into AAA's testimony or give rise to any suspicion that she had any ulterior motive in charging and testifying against the appellant. We have held time and again that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature, as in this case, deserve full credence considering that no young woman, especially one of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts, and subject herself to a public trial if she had not been motivated by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The prosecution positively established the elements of rape under Article 266-A. <i>First</i>, the appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge with the victim. AAA initially testified that the appellant's penis merely touched her vagina, but later clarified that the appellant's penis was <b><i>inserted</i> </b>into her vagina. Whether the appellant's penis merely touched AAA's private part, or fully penetrated it is of no moment. Jurisprudence firmly holds that full penetration of the vaginal orifice is not an essential ingredient, nor is the rupture of the hymen necessary, to conclude that carnal knowledge took place; the <i>mere touching</i> of the external genitalia by a penis that is capable of consummating the sexual act is sufficient to constitute carnal knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Our ruling in <i>People v. Bali-Balita<b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></b></i> is particularly instructive:<br><br>We have said often enough that in concluding that carnal knowledge took place, full penetration of the vaginal orifice is not an essential ingredient, nor is the rupture of the hymen necessary; the mere touching of the external genitalia by the penis capable of consummating the sexual act is sufficient to constitute carnal knowledge. <b>But the act of touching should be understood here as inherently part of the entry of the penis into the <i>labias</i> of the female organ and not mere touching alone of the <i>mons pubis</i> or the pudendum.</b><br><br>x x x x Thus, <b>touching when applied to rape cases does not simply mean mere epidermal contact, stroking or grazing of organs, a slight brush or a scrape of the penis on the external layer of the victim's vagina, or the <i>mons pubis</i>, as in this case. There must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the <i>labias</i> or slid into the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape.</b> As the <i>labias</i>, which are required to be "touched" by the penis, are by their natural <i>situs</i> or location beneath the <i>mons pubis</i> or the vaginal surface, to touch them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the <i>labia majora</i> or the <i>labia minora</i> of the pudendum constitutes consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> [<i>Emphasis and italics supplied</i>]<br><br>There was, at the very least, touching of the <i>labia</i> as AAA testified that <b>the appellant's penis touched her vagina</b>, as a result of which "<b>she felt pain</b>."

AAA's mother, BBB, likewise testified on her age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Hence, when the appellant raped AAA on July 30, 1998, she was only 11 years old. Where the victim is below 12 years of age, violence or intimidation is not required, and the only subject of inquiry is whether "carnal knowledge" took place. Proof of force, intimidation or consent is unnecessary as force is not an element of statutory rape; the law <i>conclusively</i> presumes the absence of consent when the victim is below the age of twelve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, we held in <i>People v. Valenzuela</i>:<br><br><blockquote>What the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve (12) years old. Thus, force, intimidation, and physical evidence of injury are immaterial; the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place. The law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years; the child's consent is immaterial because of her presumed incapacity to discern evil from good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br><b><u>The Appellant's Defenses</u></b><br><br>In his defense, the appellant invoked denial and alibi. He denied raping the victim, and insisted that he went to the house of Reynilda at 5:00 a.m. on July 30, 1998; and thereafter delivered water to customers. He returned to Reynilda's house after one delivery, and stayed there until 3:00 p.m.<br><br>To be believed, denial must be supported by strong evidence of innocence; otherwise it is regarded as a purely self-serving testimony. Alibi, on the other hand, is one of the weakest defenses in a criminal case and is rejected when the prosecution sufficiently establishes the identity of the accused. For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused should prove the physical impossibility of his presence at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.  Physical impossibility refers to distance and the facility of access between the <i>situs criminis</i> and the location of the accused when the crime was committed. He must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the scene of the crime and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the defense completely failed to show the required  physical impossibility.  According to the appellant, he left his house in Agora Complex, Cogeo at 4:30 a.m. and arrived at Reynilda's house in Road 28, Cogeo at around 5:30 a.m. On cross-examination, however, he stated that he arrived at Reynilda's house at 4:45 a.m.<br><br>The appellant tried to explain the discrepancies in time by stating that he was not wearing any watch when he left his house on July 30, 1998; he also admitted that the time of his arrival was a mere estimate. Rather than favor his case, however, his attempt to explain only stressed that he was not certain of the time he left his residence and the time he arrived at Reynilda's house. Considering AAA's undisputed testimony that their house is <i>also located in Road 28</i>, and that her school was a mere five-minute walk from her house, it was not physically impossible for the appellant to have been at Road 28 between 4:45 and 5:30 a.m. on July 30, 1998 to commit the crime charged.<br><br>The fact that Reynilda and Arnold testified that the appellant went to their house at around 5:00 a.m., more or less, did not negate the possibility that the appellant met and raped AAA before he reported for work at Reynilda's place.  We note in this regard that both the appellant and AAA testified that they passed by Road 28 in Cogeo during the early morning of July 30, 1998.<br><br>As aptly explained by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, the victim was raped in the early morning of 30 July 1998 on her way to school which was a five minute walk from where she used to reside at 41, Road 28, Cogeo, Antipolo City. Appellant admitted that on July 30, 1998, he resided at the Agora Complex, Cogeo Village, Antipolo City and went to the house of Mrs. Naprada located at Road 28, leaving his house at 4:30 a.m. to go to work thereat. From appellant's house to the house of Mrs. Naprada, appellant walked and only traversed one road and turned at a church. This admission in fact puts appellant at the crime scene. His denial of the crime cannot overcome the categorical testimony of private complainant and her positive identification of him. Further, appellant's claim that he was delivering water on 30 July 1998 at around 5:20 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. does not constitute evidence of non-culpability because the same does not prove the impossibility for him to be at the crime scene when he raped private complainant at the appointed time. Moreover, as correctly argued by appellee, appellant's witness Reynilda Naprada could not account appellant's actual whereabouts from 5:00 to 10:00 a.m. or a full five (5) hours after appellant and her son Arnold left their house at 5:00 a.m. on July 30, 1998. x x x [<i>sic</i>]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br><b><u>The Proper Penalty</u></b><br><br>The applicable provisions of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 (effective October 22, 1997), covering the crime of Rape are Articles 266-A and 266-B provide:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-A.  <i>Rape; When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed:<br><br>1)  By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>x x x<br><br>d) When the offended party is <b>under twelve (12) years of age</b> or is<br><br>demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Article 266-B.
