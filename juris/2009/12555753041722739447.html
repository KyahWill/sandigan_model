				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The integrity and reliability of our civil service is, perhaps, never more sorely tested than in the impassioned demagoguery of elections. Amidst the struggle of personalities, ideologies, and platforms, the vigor and resilience of a professional civil service can only be preserved where our laws ensure that partisanship plays no part in the appointing process. Consequently, we affirm the validity of a regulation issued by the Civil Service Commission (CSC or the Commission) intended to ensure that appointments and promotions in the civil service are made solely on the basis of qualifications, instead of political loyalties or patronage.<br><br>This Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks to reverse the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals dated August 28, 2007 and its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 11, 2008 in CA-G.R. CEB-SP No. 00665.  The case stemmed from CSC Field Office's invalidation of petitioners' appointments as employees of the City of Dumaguete, which was affirmed by the CSC Regional Office, by the Commission <i>en banc</i> and by the Court of Appeals.<br><br><b>Legal and Factual Backgrounds</b><br><br><br><b><i>Accreditation of Dumaguete<br> City by the Civil Service<br>Commission<br><br></i></b><br>On October 25, 1999, pursuant to the Commission's Accreditation Program, the CSC issued Resolution No. 992411,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which granted the City Government of Dumaguete the authority to take final action on all its appointments, subject to, <i>inter alia,</i> the following conditions:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That the exercise of said authority shall be subject to Civil Service Law, rules and regulations and within the limits and restrictions of the implementing guidelines of the CSC Accreditation Program as amended (MC No. 27, s. 1994);</li></ol><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><ol start="5"><li>That appointments issued under this authority shall be subject to monthly monitoring by the [Civil Service Field Office] CSFO concerned;</li></ol><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><ol start="9"><li>That appointments found in the course of monthly monitoring to have been issued and acted upon in violation of pertinent rules, standards, and regulations shall immediately be invalidated by the Civil Service Regional Office (CSRO), upon recommendation by the CSFO.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br><b><i>Appointments made by<br> outgoing Mayor Remollo <br><br></i></b><br>Then Dumaguete City Mayor Felipe Antonio B.

Thereafter, on June 5, 7, and 11, 2001, outgoing Mayor Remollo promoted 15 city hall employees, and regularized another 74 city hall employees, including the herein 52 petitioners.<br><br>On July 2, 2001, Mayor Perdices publicly announced at the flag raising ceremony at the Dumaguete City Hall grounds that he would not honor the appointments made by former Mayor Remollo.  On the same day, he instructed the City Administrator, respondent Dominador Dumalag, Jr., to direct respondent City Assistant Treasurer Erlinda C. Tumongha (now deceased), to refrain from making any cash disbursements for payments of petitioners' salary differentials based on their new positions.<br><br><br><b><i>The Petition for Mandamus<br> before the Regional Trial<br> Court of Dumaguete City<br><br></i></b><br>Thus, on August 1, 2001, petitioners filed a <i>Petition for Mandamus with Injunction and Damages with Prayer for a Temporary Restraining Order</i> against the City of Dumaguete, represented by respondent city mayor Perdices and city officers Dumalag, Tumongha, Josephine Mae Flores, and Araceli Campos.  The petition was docketed as Civil Case No. 13013, and raffled to Branch 41 of the Regional Trial Court of Dumaguete City. Petitioners sought the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin respondents from taking any action or issuing any orders nullifying their appointments.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated March 27, 2007, the Regional Trial Court dismissed the petition; petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was also denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated April 26, 2007.

The term "mass appointments" refers to those issued in bulk or in large number after the elections by an outgoing local chief executive and there is no apparent need for their immediate issuance.</blockquote><br>On September 4, 2001, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the August 1, 2001 Order before the CSC Region VII Office in Cebu.  The motion was, however, denied on the ground that it should have been filed before the office of Director Abucejo in Dumaguete City.  Thereafter, on October 31, 2001, petitioners asked the CSC Region VII Office in Cebu to treat their previous Motion for Reconsideration as their appeal.<br><br>On February 14, 2002, the CSC Region VII Office affirmed the August 1, 2001 Order.  Subsequently, an Appeal to the Commission <i>en banc </i>was filed through registered mail by 52 of the original 89 appointees, the petitioners herein, namely:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <thead> <tr valign="top"> <td width="23%"><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Name</b></div> </div></td> <td width="28%"> <div align="center"><b>Former Position</b> </div></td> <td width="31%"> <div align="center"><b>New Position</b> </div></td> <td width="18%"> <div align="center"><b>Date of Appointment</b> </div></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">1.

The prohibition is designed to discourage losing candidates from extending appointments to their protégés or from giving their constituents "promised" positions (CSC Resolution No. 97-0317 dated January 17, 1997, Re: Roldan B. Casinillo). Moreover, the same is intended to prevent the outgoing local chief executive from hurriedly issuing appointments which would subvert the policies of the incoming leadership. Thus, any means that would directly or indirectly circumvent the purposes for which said Resolution was promulgated should not be allowed, particularly when the appointments were issued by the appointing authority who lost in said election.</blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied by the Commission on April 11, 2005, through CSC Resolution No. 050473.<br><br>Petitioners then filed a petition for review before the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as CA-G.R. CEB-SP No. 00665.  On August 28, 2007, the Court of Appeals denied the appeal and affirmed CSC Resolution No. 040932 dated August 23, 2004 and CSC Resolution No. 050473 dated April 11, 2005, ratiocinating that:<br><br><blockquote>The spirit behind CSC Resolution No. 010988 is evident from its preamble. It was issued to thwart the nefarious practice by outgoing local chief executives in making appointments before, during, and/or after the regular local elections for ulterior partisan motives. Said practice being analogous to "midnight appointments" by the President or Acting President, the CSC then promulgated Resolution No. 010988, to suppress the mischief and evils attributed to "mass appointments" made by local chief executives.</blockquote><br>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution dated January 11, 2008.<br><br><b>THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS</b><br><br>Before us, petitioners maintain that CSC Resolution No. 010988 is invalid because the Commission is without authority to issue regulations prohibiting mass appointments at the local government level.  Petitioners cite <i>De Rama v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which held that Section 15, Article VII of the Constitution is only applicable to the President or Acting President.  They claim that outgoing or defeated local appointing authorities are authorized to make appointments of qualified individuals until their last day in office, and that not all mass appointments are invalid.  Finally, petitioners claim that because Dumaguete City had been granted authority to take "final action" on all appointments, the Commission did not have any authority to disapprove the appointments made by outgoing mayor Remollo.<br><br>In their Comment dated May 15, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> respondents argue that petitioners' appointments violated civil service rules and regulations other than CSC Resolution No. 010988.  Respondents also assert that the Commission is authorized to invalidate the petitioners' appointments, because the CSC accreditation program carried with it the caveat that "said exercise of authority shall be subject to Civil Service law, rules and regulations."  Finally, respondents claim that petitioners were guilty of forum shopping because the issues in this case and in G.R. No. 177795 are the same.<br><br><b>OUR RULING</b><br><br>We find that the Civil Service Commission has the authority to issue CSC Resolution No. 010988 and that the invalidation of petitioners' appointments was warranted.  Consequently, we affirm the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 28, 2007 and its Resolution dated January 11, 2008 in CA-G.R. CEB-SP No. 00665.<br><br><br><b><i>The CSC has the authority to<br> establish rules to promote<br> efficiency in the civil service<br><br></i></b><br>The Commission, as the central personnel agency of the government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> has statutory authority to establish rules and regulations to promote efficiency and professionalism in the civil service.  Presidential Decree No. 807,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> or the Civil Service Decree of the Philippines, provides for the powers of the Commission, including the power to issue rules and regulations and to review appointments:<br><br><blockquote>Section 9: <i>Powers and functions of the Commission</i> - The Commission shall administer the Civil Service and shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) <b><u>Prescribe, amend, and enforce suitable rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of this Decree</u></b> x x x<br><br>(c) <b><u>Promulgate policies, standards, and guidelines for the Civil Service and adopt plans and programs to promote economical, efficient, and effective personnel administration in the government</u></b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h) Approve all appointments, whether original or promotional, to positions in the civil service, except those of presidential appointees, members of the armed forces of the Philippines, police forces, firemen, and jailguards, and disapprove those where the appointees do not possess the appropriate eligibility or required qualifications; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Executive Order No. 292, or the Administrative Code of 1987, also provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12:  <i>Powers and Functions</i> - The Commission shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) <b><u>prescribe, amend, and enforce rules and regulations</u></b> for carrying into effect the provisions of the Civil Service Law and other pertinent laws;<br><br>(3) <b><u>promulgate policies, standards, and guidelines</u></b> for the Civil Service and adopt plans and programs to <b><u>promote economical, efficient, and effective personnel administration in the government</u></b>;<br><br>(4) take appropriate action on all appointments and other personnel matters in the Civil Service including extension of Service beyond retirement age;<br><br>(5) inspect and audit the personnel actions and programs of the departments, agencies, bureaus, offices, local government units, and other instrumentalities of the government, including government owned and controlled corporations. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Clearly, the above-cited statutory provisions authorize the Commission to "prescribe, amend, and enforce" rules to cover the civil service.  The legislative standards to be observed and respected in the exercise of such delegated authority are set out in the statutes, to wit: to promote "economical, efficient, and effective personnel administration."<br><br><br><b><i>The Reasons behind CSC <br>Resolution No. 010988<br><br></i></b><br>We also find that there was substantial reason behind the issuance of CSC Resolution No. 010988. It is true that there is no constitutional prohibition against the issuance of "mass appointments" by defeated local government officials prior to the expiration of their terms.  Clearly, this is not the same as a "midnight appointment," proscribed by the Constitution, which refers to those appointments made within two months immediately prior to the next presidential election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  As we ruled in <i>De Rama v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The records reveal that when the petitioner brought the matter of recalling the appointments of the fourteen (14) private respondents before the CSC, the only reason he cited to justify his action was that these were <i>midnight appointments</i> that are forbidden under Article VII, Section 15 of the Constitution. However, the CSC ruled, and correctly so, that the said prohibition applies only to presidential appointments. In truth and in fact, there is no law that prohibits local elective officials from making appointments during the last days of his or her tenure.<br></blockquote><br>However, even while affirming <i>De Rama</i>, we explained in <i>Quirog v. Aumentado</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that: <br><br><blockquote>We, however, hasten to add that the aforementioned ruling does not mean that the <i>raison d' etre</i> behind the prohibition against midnight appointments may not be applied to those made by chief executives of local government units, as here. <b><u>Indeed, the prohibition is precisely designed to discourage, nay, even preclude, losing candidates from issuing appointments merely for partisan purposes thereby depriving the incoming administration of the opportunity to make the corresponding appointments in line with its new policies.</u></b>  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><i>Quirog</i> also involved the disapproval of an appointment for non-compliance with CSC Resolution No. 010988. However, we found that Quirog's appointment was made on June 1, 2001, or three days prior to the issuance of CSC Resolution No. 010988.  As such, we ruled that the retroactive application of the law was not warranted.<br><br>In <i>Sales v. Carreon, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> we had occasion to discuss the reasons behind the prohibition by the Commission of mass appointments after the elections.  <i>Sales </i>involved the issuance of 83 appointments made by then Dapitan City Mayor Joseph Cedrick O. Ruiz in his last month of office (on June 1, 18, and 27, 2001), which the newly elected Mayor, Rodolfo H. Carreon, subsequently revoked, on the ground that these violated CSC Resolution No. 010988 in relation to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 7, Series of 2001, imposing a ban on issuing appointments in the civil service during the election period.  In <i>Sales, </i>we declared:<br><br><blockquote>This case is a typical example of the practice of outgoing local chief executives to issue "midnight" appointments, especially after their successors have been proclaimed. It does not only cause animosities between the outgoing and the incoming officials, but also affects efficiency in local governance. Those appointed tend to devote their time and energy in defending their appointments instead of attending to their functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>It is not difficult to see the reasons behind the prohibition on appointments before and after the elections.  Appointments are banned prior to the elections to ensure that partisan loyalties will not be a factor in the appointment process, and to prevent incumbents from gaining any undue advantage during the elections.  To this end, appointments within a certain period of time are proscribed by the Omnibus Election Code and related issuances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> After the elections, appointments by defeated candidates are prohibited, except under the circumstances mentioned in CSC Resolution No. 010988, to avoid animosities between outgoing and incoming officials, to allow the incoming administration a free hand in implementing its policies, and to ensure that appointments and promotions are not used as a tool for political patronage or as a reward for services rendered to the outgoing local officials.<br><br><br><b><i>Not all Mass Appointments<br> are Prohibited<br><br></i></b><br>Indeed, not all appointments issued after the elections by defeated officials are invalid.  CSC Resolution No. 010988 does not purport to nullify all "mass appointments."  However, it must be shown that the appointments have undergone the regular screening process, that the appointee is qualified, that there is a need to fill up the vacancy immediately, and that the appointments are not in bulk.  In <i>Nazareno v. Dumaguete</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we explained:<br><br><blockquote>CSC Resolution No. 010988 does not totally proscribe the local chief executive from making any appointments immediately before and after elections. The same Resolution provides that the validity of an appointment issued immediately before and after elections by an outgoing local chief executive is to be <b><u>determined on the basis of the nature, character, and merit of the individual appointment and the particular circumstances surrounding the same</u>.</b></blockquote><br>Corollarily, we held in <i>Sales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [e]ach appointment must be judged on the basis of the nature, character, and merits of the individual appointment and the circumstances surrounding the same. It is only when the appointments were made <i>en masse</i> by the outgoing administration and shown to have been made through hurried maneuvers and under circumstances departing from good faith, morality, and propriety that this Court has struck down "midnight" appointments.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, Mayor Remollo issued the 89 original and promotional appointments on three separate dates, but within a ten-day period, in the same month that he left office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Further, the Commission's audit found violations of CSC rules and regulations that justified the disapproval of the appointments.  In this regard, CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, otherwise known as the Revised Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1 - Appointments submitted to the CSC office concerned should meet the requirements listed hereunder. Non-compliance with such requirements shall be grounds for disapproval of said appointments:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h) Personnel Selection Board (PSB) Evaluation/Screening. Appointees should be screened and evaluated by the PSB, if applicable. As proof thereof, a certification signed by the Chairman of the Board at the back of the appointment or alternatively, a copy of the proceedings/ minutes of the Board's deliberation shall be submitted together with the appointment. The issuance of the appointment shall not be earlier than the date of the final screening/deliberation of the PSB.</blockquote><br>Here, there was only one<i> en banc </i>meeting of the city PSB to consider the appointments, without any evidence that there were any deliberations on the qualifications of the petitioners, or any indication that there was an urgent need for the immediate issuance of such appointments.  The absence of evidence showing careful consideration of the merits of each appointment, and the timing and the number of appointments, militate against petitioners' cause.  On the contrary, the prevailing circumstances in this case indicate that the appointments were hurriedly issued by the outgoing administration.<br><br><br><b><i>The Accreditation of <br>Dumaguete City did not<br>&nbsp;remove the CSC's authority<br>&nbsp;to review appointments<br><br><br></i></b>We find that the authority granted by CSC Resolution No. 992411 to the City Government of Dumaguete to "take final action" on all its appointments did not deprive the Commission of its authority and duty to review appointments.  Indeed, Resolution No. 992411 states that such exercise of authority shall be "subject to civil service law, rules and regulations" and that appointments in violation of pertinent rules "shall immediately be invalidated."<br><br>Moreover, Section 20, Rule VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 provides that notwithstanding the initial approval of an appointment, the same may be recalled for "[v]iolation of other existing Civil Service laws, rules and regulations."  The CSC<i> </i>is empowered to take appropriate action on all appointments and other personnel actions and that such power "includes the authority to recall an appointment initially approved in disregard of applicable provisions of Civil Service law and regulations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><br><b><i>Petitioners have not engaged<br>&nbsp;in forum shopping<br><br></i></b><br>The essence of forum-shopping is the filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><sup> </sup> Forum-shopping has been defined as the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, seeking and possibly getting a favorable opinion in another forum, other than by appeal or the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>, or the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Although the factual antecedents of the cases brought before this Court are the same, they involve different issues.

The petition only entailed the applications for the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i> and for the award of damages.  The present case docketed as G.R. No. 181559, on the other hand, involves the merits of petitioners' appeal from the invalidation and revocation of their appointments by the CSC-Field Office, which was affirmed by the CSC-Regional Office, CSC <i>en banc</i>, and the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In any event, this issue had already been settled in our Decision of June 19, 2009 in G.R. No. 177795, which found petitioners not guilty of forum shopping, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>True, that the [Petition in G.R. No. 177795] and the one in G.R.
