SP No. 103935.  The CA Decision upheld the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 4, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 28 in Manila, issuing writs of preliminary injunction in Civil Case Nos. 08-119243, 08-119244, 08-119245, 08-119246, 08-119247, 08-119248, 08-119249, 08-119250, 08-119251, and 08-119273, and the Order dated May 21, 2008 that consolidated the civil cases.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>In September of 2007, the Supervision and Examination Department (SED) of the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> (BSP) conducted examinations of the books of the following banks: Rural Bank of Parañaque, Inc. (RBPI), Rural Bank of San Jose (Batangas), Inc., Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., Pilipino Rural Bank, Inc., Philippine Countryside Rural Bank, Inc., Rural Bank of Calatagan (Batangas), Inc. (now Dynamic Rural Bank), Rural Bank of Darbci, Inc., Rural Bank of Kananga (Leyte), Inc. (now First Interstate Rural Bank), Rural Bank de Bisayas Minglanilla (now Bank of East Asia), and San Pablo City Development Bank, Inc.<br><br>After the examinations, exit conferences were held with the officers or representatives of the banks wherein the SED examiners provided them with copies of Lists of Findings/Exceptions containing the deficiencies discovered during the examinations.  These banks were then required to comment and to undertake the remedial measures stated in these lists within 30 days from their receipt of the lists, which remedial measures included the infusion of additional capital.  Though the banks claimed that they made the additional capital infusions, petitioner Chuchi Fonacier, officer-in-charge of the SED, sent separate letters to the Board of Directors of each bank, informing them that the SED found that the banks failed to carry out the required remedial measures.  In response, the banks requested that they be given time to obtain BSP approval to amend their Articles of Incorporation, that they have an opportunity to seek investors.  They requested as well that the basis for the capital infusion figures be disclosed, and noted that none of them had received the Report of Examination (ROE) which finalizes the audit findings.  They also requested meetings with the BSP audit teams to reconcile audit figures. In response, Fonacier reiterated the banks' failure to comply with the directive for additional capital infusions.<br><br>On May 12, 2008, the RBPI filed a complaint for nullification of the BSP ROE with application for a TRO and writ of preliminary injunction before the RTC docketed as Civil Case No. 08-119243 against Fonacier, the BSP, Amado M. Tetangco, Jr., Romulo L. Neri, Vicente B. Valdepenas, Jr., Raul A. Boncan, Juanita D. Amatong, Alfredo C. Antonio, and Nelly F. Villafuerte.  RBPI prayed that Fonacier, her subordinates, agents, or any other person acting in her behalf be enjoined from submitting the ROE or any similar report to the Monetary Board (MB), or if the ROE had already been submitted, the MB be enjoined from acting on the basis of said ROE, on the allegation that the failure to furnish the bank with a copy of the ROE violated its right to due process.<br><br>The Rural Bank of San Jose (Batangas), Inc., Rural Bank of Carmen (Cebu), Inc., Pilipino Rural Bank, Inc., Philippine Countryside Rural Bank, Inc., Rural Bank of Calatagan (Batangas), Inc., Rural Bank of Darbci, Inc., Rural Bank of Kananga (Leyte), Inc., and Rural Bank de Bisayas Minglanilla followed suit, filing complaints with the RTC substantially similar to that of RBPI, including the reliefs prayed for, which were raffled to different branches and docketed as Civil Cases Nos. 08-119244, 08-119245, 08-119246, 08-119247, 08-119248, 08-119249, 08-119250, and 08-119251, respectively.<br><br>On May 13, 2008, the RTC denied the prayer for a TRO of Pilipino Rural Bank, Inc. The bank filed a motion for reconsideration the next day.<br><br>On May 14, 2008, Fonacier and the BSP filed their opposition to the application for a TRO and writ of preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. 08-119243 with the RTC.  Respondent Judge Nina Antonio-Valenzuela of Branch 28 granted RBPI's prayer for the issuance of a TRO.<br><br>The other banks separately filed motions for consolidation of their cases in Branch 28, which motions were granted.  Judge Valenzuela set the complaint of Rural Bank of San Jose (Batangas), Inc. for hearing on May 15, 2008. Petitioners assailed the validity of the consolidation of the nine cases before the RTC, alleging that the court had already prejudged the case by the earlier issuance of a TRO in Civil Case No. 08-119243, and moved for the inhibition of respondent judge. Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the subject cases.<br><br>On May 16, 2008, San Pablo City Development Bank, Inc. filed a similar complaint against the same defendants with the RTC, and this was docketed as Civil Case No. 08-119273 that was later on consolidated with Civil Case No. 08-119243. Petitioners filed an Urgent Motion to Lift/Dissolve the TRO and an Opposition to the earlier motion for reconsideration of Pilipino Rural Bank, Inc.<br><br>On May 19, 2008, Judge Valenzuela issued an Order granting the prayer for the issuance of TROs for the other seven cases consolidated with Civil Case No. 08-119243.  On May 21, 2008, Judge Valenzuela issued an Order denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration regarding the consolidation of cases in Branch 28.  On May 22, 2008, Judge Valenzuela granted the urgent motion for reconsideration of Pilipino Rural Bank, Inc. and issued a TRO similar to the ones earlier issued.<br><br>On May 26, 2008, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss against all the complaints (except that of the San Pablo City Development Bank, Inc.), on the grounds that the complaints stated no cause of action and that a condition precedent for filing the cases had not been complied with.  On May 29, 2008, a hearing was conducted on the application for a TRO and for a writ of preliminary injunction of San Pablo City Development Bank, Inc.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br><br>After the parties filed their respective memoranda, the RTC, on June 4, 2008, ruled that the banks were entitled to the writs of preliminary injunction prayed for.  It held that it had been the practice of the SED to provide the ROEs to the banks before submission to the MB.  It further held that as the banks are the subjects of examinations, they are entitled to copies of the ROEs.  The denial by petitioners of the banks' requests for copies of the ROEs was held to be a denial of the banks' right to due process.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC's order reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court rules as follows:<br><br>1) <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Re: Civil Case No. 08-119243</i>.

Court of Appeals</i> it was stated:<br><br><blockquote>The requisites for preliminary injunctive relief are: (a) the invasion of right sought to be protected is material and substantial; (b) the right of the complainant is clear and unmistakable; and (c) there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.<br><br>As such, a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued only upon clear showing of an actual existing right to be protected during the pendency of the principal action.  The twin requirements of a valid injunction are the existence of a right and its actual or threatened violations.  Thus, to be entitled to an injunctive writ, the right to be protected and the violation against that right must be shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>These requirements are absent in the present case.<br><br>In granting the writs of preliminary injunction, the trial court held that the submission of the ROEs to the MB before the respondent banks would violate the right to due process of said banks.<br><br>This is erroneous.<br><br>The respondent banks have failed to show that they are entitled to copies of the ROEs.  They can point to no provision of law, no section in the procedures of the BSP that shows that the BSP is required to give them copies of the ROEs.  Sec. 28 of RA 7653, or the New Central Bank Act, which governs examinations of banking institutions, provides that the ROE shall be submitted to the MB; the bank examined is not mentioned as a recipient of the ROE.<br><br>The respondent banks cannot claim a violation of their right to due process if they are not provided with copies of the ROEs.  The same ROEs are based on the lists of findings/exceptions containing the deficiencies found by the SED examiners when they examined the books of the respondent banks.  As found by the RTC, these lists of findings/exceptions were furnished to the officers or representatives of the respondent banks, and the respondent banks were required to comment and to undertake remedial measures stated in said lists.  Despite these instructions, respondent banks failed to comply with the SED's directive.<br><br>Respondent banks are already aware of what is required of them by the BSP, and cannot claim violation of their right to due process simply because they are not furnished with copies of the ROEs. Respondent banks were held by the CA to be entitled to copies of the ROEs prior to or simultaneously with their submission to the MB, on the principles of fairness and transparency. Further, the CA held that if the contents of the ROEs are essentially the same as those of the lists of findings/exceptions provided to said banks, there is no reason not to give copies of the ROEs to the banks. This is a flawed conclusion, since if the banks are already aware of the contents of the ROEs, they cannot say that fairness and transparency are not present. If sanctions are to be imposed upon the respondent banks, they are already well aware of the reasons for the sanctions, having been informed via the lists of findings/exceptions, demolishing that particular argument. The ROEs would then be superfluities to the respondent banks, and should not be the basis for a writ of preliminary injunction. Also, the reliance of the RTC on <i>Banco Filipino v. Monetary Board</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is misplaced.  The petitioner in that case was held to be entitled to annexes of the Supervision and Examination Sector's reports, as it already had a copy of the reports themselves. It was not the subject of the case whether or not the petitioner was entitled to a copy of the reports. And the ruling was made after the petitioner bank was ordered closed, and it was allowed to be supplied with annexes of the reports in order to better prepare its defense.  In this instance, at the time the respondent banks requested copies of the ROEs, no action had yet been taken by the MB with regard to imposing sanctions upon said banks.<br><br>The issuance by the RTC of writs of preliminary injunction is an unwarranted interference with the powers of the MB.  Secs. 29 and 30 of RA 7653<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> refer to the appointment of a conservator or a receiver for a bank, which is a power of the MB for which they need the ROEs done by the supervising or examining department.  The writs of preliminary injunction issued by the trial court hinder the MB from fulfilling its function under the law.  The actions of the MB under Secs. 29 and 30 of RA 7653 "may not be restrained or set aside by the court except on petition for <i>certiorari </i>on the ground that the action taken was in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion as to amount to lack or excess of jurisdiction."  The writs of preliminary injunction order are precisely what cannot be done under the law by preventing the MB from taking action under either Sec. 29 or Sec. 30 of RA 7653.<br><br>As to the third requirement, the respondent banks have shown no necessity for the writ of preliminary injunction to prevent serious damage.  The serious damage contemplated by the trial court was the possibility of the imposition of sanctions upon respondent banks, even the sanction of closure. Under the law, the sanction of closure could be imposed upon a bank by the BSP even without notice and hearing.  The apparent lack of procedural due process would not result in the invalidity of action by the MB.  This was the ruling in <i>Central Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  This "close now, hear later" scheme is grounded on practical and legal considerations to prevent unwarranted dissipation of the bank's assets and as a valid exercise of police power to protect the depositors, creditors, stockholders, and the general public.  The writ of preliminary injunction cannot, thus, prevent the MB from taking action, by preventing the submission of the ROEs and worse, by preventing the MB from acting on such ROEs.<br><br>The trial court required the MB to respect the respondent banks' right to due process by allowing the respondent banks to view the ROEs and act upon them to forestall any sanctions the MB might impose. Such procedure has no basis in law and does in fact violate the "close now, hear later" doctrine.  We held in <i>Rural Bank of San Miguel, Inc. v. Monetary Board, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that the closure of a bank may be considered as an exercise of police power. The action of the MB on this matter is final and executory.  Such exercise may nonetheless be subject to judicial inquiry and can be set aside if found to be in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion as to amount to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>The respondent banks cannot--through seeking a writ of preliminary injunction by appealing to lack of due process, in a roundabout manner-- prevent their closure by the MB.  Their remedy, as stated, is a subsequent one, which will determine whether the closure of the bank was attended by grave abuse of discretion. Judicial review enters the picture only after the MB has taken action; it cannot prevent such action by the MB. The threat of the imposition of sanctions, even that of closure, does not violate their right to due process, and cannot be the basis for a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>The "close now, hear later" doctrine has already been justified as a measure for the protection of the public interest.  Swift action is called for on the part of the BSP when it finds that a bank is in dire straits.  Unless adequate and determined efforts are taken by the government against distressed and mismanaged banks, public faith in the banking system is certain to deteriorate to the prejudice of the national economy itself, not to mention the losses suffered by the bank depositors, creditors, and stockholders, who all deserve the protection of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The respondent banks have failed to show their entitlement to the writ of preliminary injunction.  It must be emphasized that an application for injunctive relief is construed strictly against the pleader.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  The respondent banks cannot rely on a simple appeal to procedural due process to prove entitlement. The requirements for the issuance of the writ have not been proved. No invasion of the rights of respondent banks has been shown, nor is their right to copies of the ROEs clear and unmistakable.  There is also no necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.  Indeed the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction tramples upon the powers of the MB and prevents it from fulfilling its functions.  There is no right that the writ of preliminary injunction would protect in this particular case.  In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive writ constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  In the absence of proof of a legal right and the injury sustained by the plaintiff, an order for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction will be nullified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Courts are hereby reminded to take greater care in issuing injunctive relief to litigants, that it would not violate any law.  The grant of a preliminary injunction in a case rests on the sound discretion of the court with the caveat that it should be made with great caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thus, the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction must have basis in and be in accordance with law.  All told, while the grant or denial of an injunction generally rests on the sound discretion of the lower court, this Court may and should intervene in a clear case of abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
