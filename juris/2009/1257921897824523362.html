				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By Decision of March 31, 2003, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) of Occidental Mindoro ordered complainant Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to pay Josefina S. Lubrica (Josefina) P71,634,027.30 as just compensation for the 431.1407-hectare portion of a rice and corn land in Sta. Lucia, Occidental Mindoro.<br><br>On the allegation that the PARAD disregarded the formula in Presidential Decree No. 27 and Executive Order No. 228, series of 1997, LBP filed on March 5, 2004 a petition for fixing of just compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.<br><br>Judge Ernesto P.

Thus respondent, this time, ordered:<br><br><blockquote>x x x that the cash and bond payments <u>be placed <b><i>in the name of Josefina S.

They also prayed for a preliminary mandatory injunction to secure Leticia's release pending resolution of the petition.<br><br>In a related move, Leticia's son filed, on her behalf, on February 27, 2007 <u>a petition for habeas corpus before this Court</u> for her release,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> docketed as G.R.

Respecting the non-payment of docket fee for the indirect contempt petition against Leticia and Teresita, the Office of the Clerk of Court did not require the payment thereof in the honest belief that it was not necessary since the petition was filed in connection with a principal action already being heard in his sala.  He in fact only learned of the non-payment of the docket fee during the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings before this Court and, in any event, complainants are estopped from questioning the court's jurisdiction over the indirect contempt petition.<br><br>Regarding the charge that he violated judicial courtesy, respondent cited the <u>amendment</u> introduced by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC <u>to Section 7 of Rule 65</u> of the Rules of Court requiring a public respondent to proceed with the principal case within ten days from the filing of a petition for certiorari with a higher court or tribunal in the absence of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, or upon its expiration.<br><br>Finally, respondent maintained that the detention of Leticia was not unlawful.<br><br>In his <u>Comment</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <u>on Leticia's complaint</u>, respondent, raising substantially the same arguments as those he raised in his Comment on LBP's complaint, added that the raffle of the petition for indirect contempt was not necessary considering that there are only three <i>salas</i> in the Occidental Mindoro RTC of which only Branch 46 over which he presides was designated as a Special Agrarian Court.<br><br>Respondent posited that Leticia is engaged in forum shopping given the pendency before this Court of G.R. No. 180488, "<i>Land Bank of the Philippines, Leticia Camara and Teresita Tengco v. Josefina Lubrica,</i>" which sought the resolution of the issue of whether respondent's Order citing Leticia for contempt is valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Finally, respondent contended that with these twin administrative complaints, he is being placed in jeopardy of being punished twice for the same offense.<br><br>On the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), Leticia's complaint was <u>consolidated</u> with that of the LBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In a Memorandum dated October 4, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the OCA found that respondent validly issued the March 4, 2005 Order as it was based on this Court's ruling in <i>Lubrica v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> involving another property of Josefina, which reinstated an order directing LBP to deposit the just compensation provisionally determined by PARAD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>With respect to the other charges, the OCA found respondent liable for <u>Gross Ignorance of the Law <b>and</b> Gross Misconduct</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> albeit it, in its recommendation, faulted him only for Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Noting that respondent had, in the meantime, retired on December 31, 2007, the OCA recommended that he be fined P40,000, to be charged to his retirement benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>It bears emphasis that a respondent's retirement during the pendency of the proceedings against him/her does not preclude the finding of any administrative liability and the imposition of a penalty therefor to which he/she may be answerable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that, indeed, respondent's March 4, 2005 Order had ample legal basis.  In <i>Lubrica v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court reinstated an order directing LBP to deposit the just compensation determined by the PARAD, pending computation of the final valuation of the subject properties based on the formula declared by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>With respect to the other charges, however, the Court finds that, as did the OCA, respondent is guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure for taking cognizance of the petition for indirect contempt, despite the non-payment of docket fees.  Rule 71, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides that an indirect contempt proceeding, which is not initiated <i>motu proprio</i> by the court, shall be commenced by a verified petition that <u>fully complies with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings</u> for civil actions, including the payment of docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  That Rule being so elementary, not to be aware of it constitutes Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The payment or non-payment of docket fees is reflected in the records of a case. Respondent's claim that he only learned of the non-payment of the docket fees during the proceedings for <i>habeas corpus </i>before this Court does not thus impress.  Neither does respondent's assertion that the Clerk of Court did not require the payment of the docket fees under an honest belief that it was not necessary.  A judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency of court personnel since they are not responsible for his judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As for respondent's obstinate refusal to release Leticia despite compliance by LBP with the March 4, 2005 Order, the Court finds that the same constitutes Gross Misconduct <i>vis a vis</i> Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which states that "A judge should administer justice impartially and without delay."  The following pertinent portion of this Court's Resolution in the <i>habeas corpus</i> case relative to respondent's contempt powers bears reiterating:<br><br><blockquote>This is grave abuse of respondent judge's contempt powers, amounting to lack or excess of his jurisdiction.<br><br>Nothing in the 4 March 2005 Order requires that the deposit be "placed in the name of Josefina S. Lubrica as payee, in a form that is readily withdrawable."  What respondent judge ordered LBP to do, which LBP did, was to "deposit the preliminary compensation as determined by the PARAD in cash and bonds[,] in the total amount of Php71,634,027.30 with the Land Bank of the Philippines, Manila."  <u>That the cash deposit was made under its account in trust for, and the bond made payable to, respondent judge's clerk of court is not a contumacious disregard of the 4 March 2005 Order</u> not only because that Order is silent in whose name the deposit should be made but also because the branch clerk of court is under respondent judge's control.  If LBP's supposed transgression is in not placing the cash deposit under the account of, and the bond made payable to, Lubrica, <u>respondent judge could have readily remedied the problem by directing LBP to turn over the manager's check and LBP bond to the branch clerk of court</u> for disposal of the check's proceeds and the bond to Lubrica, subject to Lubrica's compliance with the regulations of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) on the release of payment to claimants under Republic Act No. 6657.<br><br>Indeed, <u>LBP went out of its way to further accommodate respondent judge</u> when, following the latter's suggestion during the hearing of 19 February 2007, <u>LBP changed the account name for the cash deposit and the payee's name for the bond deposit</u> to "Office of Clerk of Court, RTC San Jose Occidental Mindoro, for the account of Josefina S. Lubrica, as assignee of Federico Suntay, in the matter of Agrarian Case No. 1390." Significantly, during the oral arguments, Lubrica's counsel admitted that even if the deposit was made under the name of Lubrica, the latter is still bound by, and willing to comply with, the DAR regulations on the release of payment.<br><br><b>The facts of this case highlight <u>respondent judge's failure to appreciate, in full measure, the nature of his power to cite litigants in contempt of court</u></b>. It is a drastic and extraordinary attribute of courts, to be exercised in the interest of justice and only when there is clear and contumacious refusal to obey orders.  If a <i>bona fide</i> misunderstanding of the terms of an order does not justify the immediate institution of contempt proceedings, with more reason that it should not serve as basis to prolong a litigant's detention under a prior contempt citation when, as here, there has been an attempt to comply with the order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The partiality of respondent was highlighted when, out of his selective invocation of judicial courtesy, he refused to resolve Leticia and Teresita's February 14, 2007  Urgent Manifestation of Compliance and Motion and other pending incidents in view of the pendency before the appellate court of the LBP's Omnibus Motion praying for, among other things, the quashal of the warrant of arrest, <i>whereas</i> he had earlier found Leticia and Teresita guilty of contempt despite the pendency before the appellate court of LBP's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the petition in CA-G.R.
