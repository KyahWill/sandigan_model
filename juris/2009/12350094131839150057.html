Ong issued Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 15-91 classifying the pawnshop business as akin to the lending investor's business activity "which is broad enough to encompass the business of lending money at interest by any person whether natural or juridical" and imposing on both a 5% lending investor's tax based on their gross income, pursuant to then Section 116 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended.&nbsp; The RMO reads:<br><blockquote>A restudy of P.D. [No.] 114 shows that the principal activity of pawnshops is lending money at interest and incidentally accepting a "pawn" of personal property delivered by the pawner to the pawnee as security for the loan.(Sec. 3, Ibid). Clearly, this makes pawnshop business akin to lending investor's business activity which is broad enough to encompass the business of lending money at interest by any person whether natural or juridical. Such being the case, pawnshops shall be subject to the 5% lending investor's tax based on their gross income pursuant to Section 116 of the Tax Code, as amended.<br></blockquote>The RMO was later clarified by Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 43-91 dated May 27, 1991, which reads:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; RM[O] 15-91 dated March 11, 1991.<br><br>This Circular subjects to the 5% lending investor's tax the gross income of pawnshops pursuant to Section 116 of the Tax Code, and it thus revokes BIR Ruling No. 6-90, and VAT Ruling Nos. 22-90 and 67-90. In order to have a uniform cut-off date, avoid unfairness on the part of taxpayers if they are required to pay the tax on past transactions, and so as to give meaning to the express provisions of Section 246 of the Tax Code, pawnshop owners or operators shall become liable to the lending investor's tax on their gross income beginning January 1, 1991. Since the deadline for the filing of percentage tax return (BIR Form No. 2529A-0) and the payment of the tax on lending investors covering the first calendar quarter of 1991 has already lapsed, taxpayers are given up to June 30, 1991 within which to pay the said tax without penalty. If the tax is paid after June 30, 1991, the corresponding penalties shall be assessed and computed from April 21, 1991.<br><br>Since pawnshops are considered as lending investors effective January 1, 1991, they also become subject to documentary stamp taxes prescribed in Title VII of the Tax Code. BIR Ruling No. 325-88 dated July 13, 1988 is hereby revoked.<br></blockquote>Pursuant to these issuances, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued Assessment Notice No. 84-PT-13-95-98-5-0-63, dated April 20, 1998, against Agencia Exquisite of Bohol, Inc. (AEBI) demanding payment in the sum of P106,538.59 representing the 5% lending investors' tax for 1995, plus interest and charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 1998, AEBI filed its Administrative Protest which the BIR Revenue Regional Director denied in a Letter-Decision dated February 3, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Consequently, AEBI filed with the CTA a Petition for Review, docketed as CTA Case No. 5774.&nbsp; On June 7, 2000, the CTA rendered its Decision in favor of AEBI cancelling Assessment Notice No. 84-PT-13-95-98-5-0-63 and declaring RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91, in so far as they classify pawnshops as lending investors subject to 5% lending investors' tax, null and void.<br><br>The BIR then sought recourse before the CA in a Petition for Review, docketed as CA-G.R.

No. 150141 G.R. No. 157359 and G.R. No. 158644 were consolidated.<br><br>The sole issue for the Court's determination is whether or not pawnshops are liable for the payment of the 5% lending investor's tax.<br><br>AEBI and EPJI argue that there are no specific provisions in the Tax Code that subject pawnshops to 5% lending investor's tax. They claim that there is a big difference between the nature of a pawnshop business and that of a lending investor. They also contend that RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91 violate the Constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws and that they are unconstitutional as they encroached on the legislative prerogative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Moreover, AEBI and EPJI argue that applying the principles of <i>stare decisis</i>, this Court in the case of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Lhuillier</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> has already held that pawnshops are not considered lending investors for the purpose of imposing the 5% percentage tax. Pursuant to the ruling in the <i>Lhuillier </i>case, the BIR through the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has issued RMC No. 36-2004 ordering the cancellation of all lending investor's tax assessments on pawnshops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the contentions of AEBI and EPJI, the issue herein not being a novel one.<br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i> <i>v. Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop</i>, <i>Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> this Court held that pawnshops are not included in the term <i>lending investors</i> for the purpose of imposing the 5% percentage tax under then Section 116 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, as amended by Executive Order No. 273. Thus, while pawnshops are indeed engaged in the business of lending money, they cannot be deemed "lending investors" for the purpose of imposing the 5% lending investor's tax.<br><br>Again, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i> <i>v. Trustworthy Pawnshop, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> this Court reiterated its ruling in <i>Lhuillier </i>that pawnshops are not included in the term <i>lending investors</i> for the purpose of imposing the 5% percentage tax.<br><br>The rulings are buttressed by the following reasons:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>. Under Section 192, paragraph 3, sub-paragraphs (dd) and (ff) of the NIRC of 1997, prior to its amendment by E.O. No. 273, as well as Section 161, paragraph 2, sub-paragraphs (dd) and (ff) of the NIRC of 1986, <b>pawnshops and lending investors were subjected to different tax treatments, thus</b>:<br><blockquote>(3)<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>Other Fixed Taxes</i>. - The following fixed taxes shall be collected as follows, the amount stated being for the whole year, when not otherwise specified:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>(dd)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>Lending Investors</b> -<br><ol><li>In chartered cities and first class municipalities, one thousand pesos;<br><br></li><li>In second and third class municipalities, five hundred pesos;<br><br></li><li>In fourth and fifth class municipalities and municipal districts, two hundred fifty pesos: <i>Provided</i>, That lending investors who do business as such in more than one province shall pay a tax of one thousand pesos.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>(ff)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>Pawnshops</b>, one thousand pesos.<br></blockquote><i> Second</i>. <b>Congress never intended pawnshops to be treated in the same way as lending investors.</b>&nbsp; Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, as renumbered and rearranged by E.O. No. 273, was basically lifted from Section 175 (formerly Sec. 209, NIRC of 1977, as amended by P.D. 1739, Sept. 17, 1980) of the NIRC of 1986, <b>which treated both tax subjects differently</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 175 of the latter Code reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 175. <i>Percentage tax on dealers in securities, <b>lending investors</b>.</i> - Dealers in securities shall pay a tax equivalent to six percent (6%) of their gross income.&nbsp; <b>Lending investors</b> shall pay a tax equivalent to five percent (5%) of their gross income. (As amended by P.D. No. 1739, P.D. No. 1959, and P.D. No. 1994).<br></blockquote><b>We note that the definition of <i>lending investors</i> found in Section 157 (u) of the NIRC of 1986 is not found in the NIRC of 1977, as amended by E.O. No. 273, where Section 116 invoked by the CIR is found.&nbsp; However, as emphasized earlier, both the NIRC of 1986 and NIRC of 1977 dealt with pawnshops and lending investors differently. Verily then, it was the intent of Congress to deal with both subjects differently.&nbsp; Hence, we must likewise interpret the statute to conform to such legislative intent. </b><br><br><i> Third</i>. <b>Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended by E.O. No. 273, subjects to percentage tax dealers in securities and lending investors only.&nbsp; There is no mention of pawnshops.&nbsp; Under the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another thing not mentioned.&nbsp; Thus, if a statute enumerates the things upon which it is to operate, everything else must necessarily and by implication be excluded from its operation and effect</b> (<i>Vera v. Fernandez,</i> L-31364, March 30, 1979, 89 SCRA 199, 203).&nbsp; <b>This rule, as a guide to probable legislative intent, is based upon the rules of logic and natural workings of the human mind</b> (<i>Republic v. Estenzo, </i>L-35376, September 11, 1980, 99 SCRA 651, 656).<br><br><i> Fourth</i>. <b>The BIR had ruled several times prior to the issuance of RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91 that pawnshops were not subject to the 5% percentage tax imposed by Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended by E.O. No. 273.&nbsp; This was even admitted by the CIR in RMO No. 15-91 itself. Considering that Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, was practically lifted from Section 175 of the NIRC of 1986, as amended, and there being no change in the law, the interpretation thereof should not have been altered.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><b>R.A. No. 7716</b> (<i>An Act Restructuring the Value-added Tax (VAT) System, Widening Its Tax Base and Enhancing Its Administrative, and for These Purposes Amending and Repealing the Relevant Provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and for Other Purposes.</i>) <b>repealed Section 116 of NIRC of 1977, as amended, which was the basis of RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91</b>, thus:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><b>Since Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, which breathed life on the questioned administrative issuances, had already been repealed, RMO 15-91 and RMC 43-91, which depended upon it, are deemed automatically repealed.&nbsp; Hence, even granting that pawnshops are included within the term <i>lending investors</i>, the assessment from May 27, 1994 onward would have no leg to stand on.</b><br><br><b>Adding to the invalidity of RMC No. 43-91 and RMO No. 15-91 is the absence of publication.</b> While the rule-making authority of the CIR is not doubted, like any other government agency, the CIR may not disregard legal requirements or applicable principles in the exercise of quasi-legislative powers.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91 cannot be viewed simply as implementing rules or corrective measures revoking in the process the previous rulings of past Commissioners.&nbsp; Specifically, they would have been amendatory provisions applicable to pawnshops. xxx.
