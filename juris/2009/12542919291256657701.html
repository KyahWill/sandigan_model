Before proceeding to the house of their neighbor, they decided to pass by the house of AAA.  There, they noticed that the door of the house was already open, so they decided to go inside thinking that AAA's older sister was there.  AAA, however, noticed that one sack of rice was missing.  She tried to look for it thinking that her sister might have kept the same, but to no avail.  AAA and BBB were about to go out of the house when they saw Arcosiba in the yard.  Out of fear, AAA and BBB retreated to the kitchen.  At a distance of four meters, Arcosiba asked AAA of her father's whereabouts.  AAA replied that her father was not around.  Arcosiba then asked her to go outside.  AAA drew nearer to Arcosiba but remained inside the house.  At that instance, Arcosiba uttered, "<i>Your father owes a big amount of money and I am the one who is supporting your studies</i>."  He then commanded AAA to get out of the house because they have something to talk about. AAA did as ordered while BBB stayed in the kitchen crying.<br><br>While at the yard, Arcosiba embraced and kissed AAA. He likewise ordered her to sit on a sack of charcoal.  At first, AAA tried to evade Arcosiba's kisses but the latter threatened her. Arcosiba then undressed AAA and instructed her to lie down on the ground.  He was about to rape AAA when he suddenly changed his mind.  Instead, he told AAA to proceed to the back of the house. AAA resisted, but Arcosiba dragged her. As ordered, AAA proceeded to the back of the house while being followed by Arcosiba.  AAA walked totally naked while Arcosiba had her dress on his face and held her shorts in his hand.<br><br>Upon reaching the back portion of the house, Arcosiba ordered AAA to lie down, to which she acceded.  Arcosiba then took off his clothes and directed AAA to hold his penis.  He ordered her to masturbate his penis.  AAA tried to refuse, but Arcosiba threatened to shoot her.  After a while, Arcosiba ordered her to stop.  He then inserted his penis into her vagina.  However, Arcosiba was not able to ejaculate because of the timely arrival of AAA's neighbors who were called by BBB.  Arcosiba then tried to bring AAA to the nearby river. AAA resisted but Arcosiba threatened her, saying, "<i>Hurry because if you will not go with me I will kill you</i>."<br><br>While on their way to the river, a neighbor saw them and shouted at Arcosiba, prompting the latter to release AAA and flee. AAA, on the other hand, ran towards the house of her neighbor.  They reported the incident the following day and she underwent a medical check-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The medical certificate issued by Dr. Maribeth R.

At about 3:00 p.m. of said day, he went to the crossing of Brgy. Lemon in order to engage in a drinking spree with his friend, Jun-Jun Pigar, a certain Molo, Edwin and Boy.  At around 6:00 p.m., he went back to the house of his live-in partner's parents in order to eat some snacks, after which he went back to his friends and they resumed their drinking spree.  The drinking spree went on until 9:00 p.m.  Thereafter, he went back to the house of his live-in partner's parents, ate and slept thereat together with Analyn, Julita, his nephew and Analyn's mother.  The following morning, he went to Calubian, Leyte, on an errand.  He was arrested on his way to said place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered judgment convicting Arcosiba of the crime of rape under Articles 266-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and 266-B<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The trial court gave credence to AAA's testimony.  It ruled that no woman who is of tender age, would concoct a tale of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts, and undergo the expense, trouble, inconvenience not to mention the trauma of a public trial, if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.  It also ruled that in light of the positive identification of the accused, his defense of denial and alibi cannot be sustained.  The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads,<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, applying Article 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended, and the amendatory provisions of R.A. 8353, (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997), in relation to Section 11 of R.A. 7659 (The Death Penalty Law), the Court found accused, <b>ROLDAN</b> <b>ARCOSIBA</b> <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <b>RAPE</b> charged under the information and sentenced [him to] suffer the maximum penalty of <b>RECLUSION</b> <b>PERPETUA</b> and to pay civil indemnity in the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos and moral damages in the amount of Twenty[-]Five (P25,000.00) Thousand Pesos to the victim, [AAA]; and<br><br>Pay the Cost.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's ruling but modified the award of damages by including an award of exemplary damages.  The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision of the Regional Trial Court finding the accused, ROLDAN ARCOSIBA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE and [sentencing him to] suffer the maximum penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay civil indemnity in the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos, moral damages in the amount of Twenty[-]Five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos and pay the cost to [AAA] is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the private complainant is also entitled to the award of exemplary damages in the amount of Twenty[-]Five Thousand [P]esos (P25,000.00).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>The case is now before us for final disposition.  In his brief, appellant faults the trial court, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Simply, the issue before us is whether appellant's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In his brief, appellant assails the credibility of the victim.  He claims that the victim's testimony is inconsistent.<br><br>For the State, the Office of the Solicitor General contends that the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, including that of the victim, are credible and worthy of faith and belief.<br><br>We affirm appellant's conviction.<br><br>This Court has held in the case of <i>People v. Baligod</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that rape is generally unwitnessed and oftentimes, the victim is left to testify for herself.  Thus, in resolving rape cases, the victim's credibility becomes the primordial consideration.  If a victim's testimony is straightforward, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency, it passes the test of credibility and the accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.  To ensure that justice is meted out, extreme care and caution is required in weighing the conflicting testimonies of the complainant and the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

Despite being merely 14 years old she subjected herself to the glare of public prosecution for rape, positively identified appellant as her rapist and candidly revealed the ugly details of the deplorable violation of her person. Her testimony appears straightforward and clear.  It is thus correct that both the trial and appellate courts gave credence to her testimony and they both regarded her as a credible witness.  Absent any showing that the lower courts had overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered might affect the result of the case, we find no basis to doubt or dispute, much less overturn, the findings of credibility by both courts.<br><br>Compared to the evidence presented by the prosecution consisting notably of the positive identification of the appellant not only by AAA herself but by two other witnesses, the appellant's defense of denial is inherently weak and dubious.  As often stressed, a mere denial constitutes negative evidence and warrants the least credibility or none at all absent any strong evidence of non-culpability.  It cannot prevail over the positive and credible declarations of the victim and her witnesses testifying on affirmative matters.<br><br>As to the award of damages, both courts are consistent with the prevailing jurisprudence on simple rape and correctly imposed P50,000 as civil indemnity.  Conformably too, the Court of Appeals correctly modified the award by including an award for exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000 in conformity with Article 2230 of the Civil Code which provides that in criminal offenses, exemplary damages as part of the civil liability may be imposed when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances which in this case is AAA's minority. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision dated May 9, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CEB-CR.-H.C. No. 00094 is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.  This Court finds appellant Roldan Arcosiba guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to indemnify the victim the sums of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P25,000 as exemplary damages.
