It is a means for the correction of social imbalances that may often lead to injustice, for which reason, it is a public responsibility of the Bar. The spirit of public service should therefore unde[r]ly all legal aid offices. The same should be so administered as to give maximum possible assistance to indigent and deserving members of the community in all cases, matters and situations in which legal aid may be necessary to forestall injustice.</i><br><br>WHEREAS, Section 2 of the same provides: <i>In order to attain the objectives of legal aid, legal aid office should be as close as possible to those who are in need thereof - the masses.

Its Resolution No. 24, series of 2008 in fact echoes one of the noteworthy recommendations during the <i>Forum on Increasing Access to Justice</i> spearheaded by the Court last year. In promulgating Resolution No. 24, the Misamis Oriental Chapter of the IBP has effectively performed its duty to "participate in the development of the legal system by initiating or supporting efforts in law reform and in the administration of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>We now move on to determine the merits of the request.<br><br><b>Access to Justice: </b><br><b>Making an Ideal a Reality</b><br><br>Access to justice by all, especially by the poor, is not simply an ideal in our society. Its existence is essential in a democracy and in the rule of law. As such, it is guaranteed by no less than the fundamental law:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 11. <b>Free access to the courts</b> and quasi-judicial bodies <b>and adequate legal assistance</b> <b>shall not be denied to any person by reason of poverty</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court recognizes the right of access to justice as the most important pillar of legal empowerment of the marginalized sectors of our society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Among others, it has exercised its power to "promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to open the doors of justice to the underprivileged and to allow them to step inside the courts to be heard of their plaints. In particular, indigent litigants are permitted under Section 21, Rule 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and Section 19, Rule 141<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Rules of Court to bring suits <i>in forma pauperis</i>.<br><br>The IBP, pursuant to its general objectives to "improve the administration of justice and enable the Bar to discharge its public responsibility more effectively,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> assists the Court in providing the poor access to justice. In particular, it renders free legal aid under the supervision of the NCLA.<br><br><b>A New Rule, a New Tool</b><br><b>for Access to Justice </b><br><br>Under the IBP's Guidelines Governing the Establishment and Operation of Legal Aid Offices in All Chapters of the IBP (Guidelines on Legal Aid), the combined "means and merit tests" shall be used to determine the eligibility of an applicant for legal aid:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE VIII<br>TESTS<br></center><br>SEC. 19. <i>Combined tests</i>. - The Chapter Legal Aid Committee or the [NCLA], as the case may be, shall pass upon the request for legal aid by the combined application of the means test and merit test, and the consideration of other factors adverted to in the following sections.<br><br>SEC. 20. <i>Means test</i>. - The means test aims at determining whether the applicant has no visible means of support or his income is otherwise insufficient to provide the financial resources necessary to engage competent private counsel owing to the demands for subsistence of his family, considering the number of his dependents and the conditions prevailing in the locality.<br><br>The means test shall not be applicable to applicants who fall under the Developmental Legal Aid Program such as Overseas Filipino Workers, fishermen, farmers, women and children and other disadvantaged groups.<br><br>SEC. 21. <i>Merit test</i>. - The merit test seeks to ascertain whether or not the applicant's cause of action or his defense is valid and chances of establishing the same appear reasonable.<br><br>SEC. 22. <i>Other factors</i>. - The effect of the Legal Aid Service or of the failure to render the same upon the Rule of Law, the proper administration of justice, the public interest involved in given cases and the practice of law in the locality shall likewise be considered.<br><br>SEC. 23. <i>Private practice</i>. - Care shall be taken that the Legal aid is not availed of to the detriment of the private practice of law, or taken advantage of by anyone for personal ends.<br><br>SEC. 24. <i>Denial</i>. - Legal aid may be denied to an applicant already receiving adequate assistance from any source other than the Integrated Bar.</blockquote><br>The "means and merit tests" appear to be reasonable determinants of eligibility for coverage under the legal aid program of the IBP. Nonetheless, they may be improved to ensure that any exemption from the payment of legal fees that may be granted to clients of the NCLA and the legal aid offices of the various IBP chapters will really further the right of access to justice by the poor. This will guarantee that the exemption will neither be abused nor trivialized.

College of Law for the Alphan Lecture Series entitled <i>Emancipation From Poverty Through Legal Empowerment </i>sponsored by the Alpha Phi Beta Fraternity of the College of Law of the University of the Philippines.

The amount of the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from paying shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent, unless the court otherwise provides.<br><br>Any adverse party may contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered by the trial court. If the court should determine after hearing that the party declared as an indigent is in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be assessed and collected by the clerk of court. If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court, execution shall issue for the payment thereof, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court may impose.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Section 19. <i>Indigent-litigants exempt from payment of legal fees</i>. - Indigent litigant (a) whose gross income and that of their immediate family do not exceed an amount double the monthly minimum wage of an employee and (b) who do not own real property with a fair market value as stated in the current tax declaration of more than Three Hundred Thousand (P300,000.00) Pesos shall be exempt from the payment of legal fees.<br><br>The legal fees shall be a lien on any judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent unless the court otherwise provides.<br><br>To be entitled to the exemption herein provided, the litigant shall execute an affidavit that he and his immediate family do not earn a gross income abovementioned, nor own any real property with the fair value aforementioned, supported by a an affidavit of a disinterested person attesting to the truth of the litigant's affidavit.

It is a means for the correction of social imbalances that may and often do lead to injustice, for which reason it is a public responsibility of the bar. The spirit of public service should, therefore, underlie all legal aid offices. The same should be so administered as to give maximum possible assistance to indigent and deserving members of the community in all cases, matters and situations in which legal aid may be necessary to forestall an injustice (Section 1, Article I, Guidelines on Legal Aid). The aforementioned principle is likewise a primary basis of the Rule on Mandatory Legal Aid Service.</div>
