The doctrine of <b><i>primary jurisdiction </i></b>dictates that prior recourse to the House is necessary before she may bring her petition to court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Senator Villar's invocation of said doctrine is thus well-taken, as is the following observation of Speaker Nograles, citing <i>Sen. Pimentel, Jr. v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In order that the remedies of Prohibition and Mandamus may be availed of, there must be "no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law".<br><br>It is worth recalling that, in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress, Senator Aquilino Pimentel advocated the allocation of a position in the Commission on Appointments for the Party-List Representatives.  Just like the Petitioner in the instant case, Senator Pimentel first wrote to the Senate President, requesting that the Commission on Appointments be restructured to conform to the constitutional provision on proportional representation.  xxx Without awaiting final determination of the question xxx, Pimentel filed a Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus with the Supreme Court.  In the said case, the Honorable Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote><i>"The Constitution expressly grants to the House of Representatives the prerogative, within constitutionally defined limits, to choose from among its district and party-list representatives those who may occupy the seats allotted to the House in the HRET and the CA. Section 18, Article VI of the Constitution explicitly confers on the Senate and on the House the authority to elect among their members those who would fill the 12 seats for Senators and 12 seats for House members in the Commission on Appointments.  Under Section 17, Article VI of the Constitution, each chamber exercises the power to choose, within constitutionally defined limits, who among their members would occupy the allotted 6 seats of each chamber's respective electoral tribunal.</i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>x x xx</i><br></div><br><i>Thus, <b><u>even assuming that party-list representatives comprise a sufficient number and have agreed to designate common nominees to the HRET and the CA, their primary recourse clearly rests with the House of Representatives and not this Court</u>.  </b>Under Sections 17 and 18, Article VI of the Constitution, party-list representatives must first show to the House that they possess the required strength to be entitled to seats in the HRET and the CA. Only if the House fails to comply with the directive of the Constitution on proportional representation of political parties in the HRET and the CA can the party-list representatives seek recourse to this Court under its power of judicial review.  <b><u>Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, prior recourse to the House is necessary before petitioners may bring the instant case to the court.  Consequently, petitioner's direct recourse to this Court is premature</u>.</b> </i></blockquote><br>Following the ruling in <i>Pimentel</i>, it cannot be said that recourse was already had in the House of Representatives.  Furnishing a copy of Petitioner's letter to the Senate President and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives does not constitute the primary recourse required prior to the invocation of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Further, it is the Members of the House who claim to have been deprived of a seat in the Commission on Appointments that must first show to the House that they possess the required numerical strength to be entitled to seats in the Commission on Appointments.  Just like Senator Pimentel, demanding seats in the Commission on Appointments for Congressmen, who have not even raised the issue of its present composition in the House, is not Senator Madrigal's affair.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  (Italics, underscoring, and emphasis supplied by Representative Nograles)</blockquote><br>It bears noting that Senator Villar had already transmitted original copies of Senator Madrigal's letters to the Senate Secretary for inclusion in the Order of Business of the Session of the Senate to address her concerns.  Senator Madrigal's filing of the <i>second</i> petition is thus premature.<br><br>Senator Madrigal's suggestion - that Senators Pilar Juliana Cayetano and Richard Gordon be considered independent senators such that the latter should not be allowed to be a member of the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and that Senator Alan Peter Cayetano be considered a member of the NP such that he may sit in the CA as his inclusion in NP will entitle his party to one seat - involves a determination of party affiliations, a question of fact which the Court does not resolve.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Motion with Leave of Court to Withdraw the Petition in G.R.
