It was held by the DAR Provincial Legal Officer that Francisco Landicho is the legal and <i>bona fide</i> tenant of the parcels of land but he cannot be awarded disturbance compensation because he voluntarily surrendered his tenancy rights over the said properties twice, through the 1976 and the 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i>. In the case of Buenaventura and Federico Landicho, it was found that they are merely farm helpers of Francisco Landicho and are not entitled to disturbance compensation.<br><br>Dissatisfied with the ruling of the DAR PARO of Lucena City, petitioners Buenaventura and Federico Landicho filed another Protest before the DAR Legal Division, Region IV, Pasig, Metro Manila.

It was likewise found that Federico and Buenaventura are not tenants of the land in question but are merely farm helpers of the legitimate tenant, Francisco Landicho, who surrendered his tenancy rights to the former owner, the Aragons. During an interview with Buenaventura Landicho conducted by Legal Officer II Dandumum Sultan, Jr. it was affirmed by Buenaventura that it was only Francisco Landicho, his father, who was allowed and permitted to work on the subject land and that both he and Federico had not secured the permission of the landowner to farm the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In response to the complaint of BARC Chairman Rosalio Cabuyao, DAR Region IV Director Percival C. Dalugdug wrote a letter, dated April 25, 1994, stating that the results of an investigation conducted by their representatives revealed that Buenaventura Landicho and Federico Landicho are not tenants of the subject land and are thus not entitled to disturbance compensation. It was also stated in the letter that it is only Francisco Landicho who is the legitimate tenant of the land owned by the Aragons. However, he surrendered his tenancy rights by virtue of the 1976 and 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> states:<br><div style="margin-left: 440px;"><i>Ika-25 ng Abril 1994</i><br></div><blockquote>G.

The petitioners allege that they are tenants of the subject land since January 31, 1976 and that they were unlawfully ejected from the subject land by virtue of the 1976 and 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>which they allege to be invalid, since they were executed by Francisco through the insidious words, undue influence and strategy employed by the Aragons, in connivance with respondent Sia.<br><br>In their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated July 7, 1994, the Aragons recognized only Francisco as their former tenant until he surrendered his tenancy rights through the 1976 <i>Kasulatan </i>and finally surrendered the land upon the execution of the 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i>. They assert that there was no undue advantage exerted over petitioner Francisco Landicho since the 1976 and the 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>were written in Tagalog, a language understood by Francisco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> They raised the defense that the petitioners have no cause of action on the grounds of prescription, laches, and estoppel, that the claim is barred by prior judgment, and that the claim has been abandoned or otherwise extinguished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  On the other hand, respondent Felix Sia, in his Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated July 11, 1994, alleged that when he bought the subject parcels of land, they were free from tenants since Francisco had already relinquished his tenancy rights therein through the execution of public documents.<br><br>After the filing of the parties' respective position papers, the DAR Provincial Adjudicator of Region IV rendered a decision in PARAD Case No. IV-QUI-0343-94,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated October 24, 1995, in favor of the petitioners. Provincial Adjudicator Oscar C. Dimacali ruled that against their will, the petitioners were dispossessed of the land that they have been cultivating. He also ruled that it is not necessary to decide on the issue of whether Federico and Buenaventura are merely farm helpers of Francisco, nor is it essential to determine whether the 1976 and 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>are valid. The dispositive portion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the following are hereby ordered:<br><ol><li>defendant Felix Sia to pay each of the plaintiffs a disturbance compensation equivalent to five (5) years based from the average normal harvest to be determined by the MARO concerned who is hereby required to make a report to this Office within one (1) month from receipt hereof;<br></li><li>defendant Felix Sia to provide each plaintiff a homelot [sic] of 200 square meters in the subject landholdings; and,<br></li><li>defendants to pay the plaintiffs jointly and severally the sum of P10,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br></li></ol>No pronounce [sic] as to cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>The Aragons and respondent Sia appealed the foregoing decision to the DARAB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which issued a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> on September 18, 2000 that affirmed in part the decision of the Provincial Adjudicator, and deleted the award of disturbance compensation on the basis of the finding that the petitioners are still <i>bona fide </i>tenants in their respective landholdings. The DARAB did not give credit to the report and recommendation of Legal Officer III Ernesto M. Arro and Legal Officer II Dandumum D. Sultan, Jr. that Francisco Landicho voluntarily surrendered his tenancy rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The DARAB found that a tenancy relationship exists between the petitioners and the Aragons and that when Felix Sia became the owner of the subject land, he assumed to exercise the rights and obligations that pertain to the previous owners.

The Court of Appeals found that the essential requisites are not present to establish a tenancy relationship between petitioners Buenaventura and Federico Landicho and the Aragons, and that the tenant-landlord relationship between Francisco Landicho and the Aragons also ended upon the surrender of his tenancy rights through the 1976 and 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i>; consequently, no tenancy relationship also exists between the petitioners and respondent Felix Sia. The Court of Appeals also ruled that even assuming that the petitioners have a cause of action, the same had already prescribed since the complaint was only filed seven years from the time the cause of action accrued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On March 22, 2005, the petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the Court of Appeals decision.

The DARAB found that a landlord-tenant relationship exists between the petitioners and the respondent and ruled in this wise:<br><blockquote>However, We find it hard to believe that plaintiffs-appellees who have been tilling the land in question for so long a time, would suddenly lose interest in it for good time [sic] when they know that full ownership over the same would soon be in their hands.

The Court of Appeals also agreed with the PARO and the Region IV DAR that Federico and Buenaventura Landicho were merely farm helpers of Francisco, ruling that they were considered as part of the <i>bona fide </i>tenant's immediate farm household and for this reason, the Aragons cannot be faulted for not questioning their possession and cultivation of the subject landholdings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals and give credence to the findings of the DAR PARO and Region IV DAR.<br><br>A tenant is defined under Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 1199, otherwise known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the Philippines, as:<br><blockquote>x x x a person who, himself and with the aid available from within his immediate farm household, cultivates the land belonging to, or possessed by, another, with the latter's consent for purposes of production, sharing the produce with the landholder under the share tenancy system, or paying to the landholder a price certain or ascertainable in produce or in money or both, under the leasehold tenancy system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>A tenancy relationship arises between a landholder and a tenant once they agree, expressly or impliedly, to undertake jointly the cultivation of a land belonging to the landholder, as a result of which relationship the tenant acquires the right to continue working on and cultivating the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The existence of a tenancy relationship cannot be presumed and claims that one is a tenant do not automatically give rise to security of tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> For a tenancy relationship to exist, all of the following essential requisites must be present: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject matter is agricultural land; (3) there is consent between the parties; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation by the tenant; and, (6) there is sharing of the harvests between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Not all of these requisites obtain in the case at bar.<br><br>The essential element of consent is absent because the landowners never recognized petitioners Federico and Buenaventura Landicho as legitimate tenants of the subject land. And, although Federico and Buenaventura claim that they are tenants of "Lot No. 9896 and Lot No. 9897,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> respectively, simply because they continuously cultivated and openly occupied the subject land; there was no evidence presented to establish the presence of the essential requisites of a tenancy relationship other than the self-serving statements of the petitioners. Furthermore, both the 1976 and the 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>only mentioned Francisco as the tenant of the subject parcels of land, and there was no mention of petitioners Federico and Buenaventura.<br><br>The petitioners cannot rely on their self-serving statements to prove the existence of a tenancy relationship because independent and concrete evidence, aside from self-serving statements, is needed to prove personal cultivation, sharing of harvests, or consent of the landowner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> A tiller or a farmworker does not automatically become an agricultural tenant recognized under agrarian laws by mere occupation or cultivation of an agricultural land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The DARAB did not cite any evidence to show the existence of the requisites of a tenancy relationship and merely based the conclusion that the petitioners are tenants of the Aragons on the weak reasoning that filing a complaint is inconsistent with the voluntary surrender of the landholdings and that it is unlikely that petitioners would suddenly lose interest in the subject land when they know that ownership would soon be transferred to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The DARAB's inferences are without basis and are purely speculative, and except for its sweeping conclusion, there is no other independent and concrete evidence in the record of the case that would sustain the finding that Federico and Buenaventura are tenants of the Aragons.<br><br>It was not shown that Federico and Buenaventura cultivated the land with the consent of the landowners. The Court of Appeals correctly held that only Francisco was the <i>bona fide </i>tenant of the land in question and that Federico and Buenaventura were just farm helpers of Francisco, as part of his immediate farm household.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This is supported by the evidence on record where, in the Memorandum of DAR Region IV Legal Officer II Dandumum Sultan, Jr., it is stated that during an interview conducted with Buenaventura Landicho, he disclosed that it was only Francisco Landicho, his father, who was allowed and permitted to work on the subject land and that both he and Federico had not secured the permission of the landowner to farm the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>There was also no evidence presented to show that Federico and Buenaventura gave a share of their harvest to the Aragons. Independent evidence, such as receipts, must be presented to show that there was a sharing of the harvest between the landowner and the tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> And, assuming the landowners received a share of the harvest, it was held in the case of <b>Cornelio de Jesus, et al. v. Moldex Realty, Inc.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> that "[t]he fact of receipt, without an agreed system of sharing, does not ipso facto create a tenancy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>There is no tenancy relationship between the Aragons and petitioners Federico and Buenaventura without the essential elements of consent and sharing of agricultural produce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Neither can we give any weight to the petitioners' contention that there was an implied tenancy by reason alone of their continuous cultivation of the land. Acquiescence by the landowner of their cultivation of the land does not create an implied tenancy if the landowners have never considered petitioners Federico and Buenaventura as tenants of the land and if the essential requisites of a tenancy relationship are lacking. There was no intention to institute the petitioners as agricultural tenants. In the case of <b>Epitacio Sialana v. Mary Y. Avila, et al.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> it was held that "x x x for an implied tenancy to come about, the actuations of the parties taken in their entirety must be demonstrative of an intent to continue a prior lease established by the landholder x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>With respect to petitioner Francisco Landicho, the Court of Appeals also correctly held that although Francisco was the legal tenant of the subject land, he voluntarily surrendered his tenancy rights when he knowingly and freely executed the 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This conclusion finds basis in the investigation conducted by the PARO, where during the mediation conference, petitioner Francisco Landicho admitted that he voluntarily surrendered his tenancy rights over the subject parcels of land in consideration of PhP3,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The tenancy relationship was validly extinguished through the execution of the 1987 <i>Kasulatan</i> and upon the voluntary surrender of the landholdings pursuant to Section 8 of Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8.   Extinguishment of Agricultural Leasehold Relation. -- The agricultural leasehold relation established under this Code shall be extinguished by:<br><br>(1) Abandonment of the landholding without the knowledge of the agricultural lessor;<br><br>(2) Voluntary surrender of the landholding by the agricultural lessee, written notice of which shall be served three months in advance; or<br><br>(3) Absence of the persons under Section nine to succeed to the lessee, in the event of death or permanent incapacity of the lessee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners also failed to support their claim that the Aragons took advantage of Francisco's old age and illiteracy and employed fraudulent schemes in order to deceive him into signing the <i>Kasulatan</i>. It has been held that "[a] person is not incapacitated to contract merely because of advanced years or by reason of physical infirmities. It is only when such age or infirmities impair the mental faculties to such extent as to prevent one from properly, intelligently, and fairly protecting her property rights, is she considered incapacitated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The petitioners' contention that the Aragons employed fraud, aside from being unsubstantiated, is also contrary to the records of the case. Both the 1976 and the 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>were also written in Tagalog, which is the language understood by Francisco Landicho. They were written in an uncomplicated manner and clearly stated that he is returning the land that he has been cultivating to the landowners because he is already old and could no longer work on the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>also states that the contents of the document were read to him and that he understands the same.<br><br>It is also important to note that both the 1976 and 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>are duly notarized and are considered as public documents evidencing the surrender of Francisco's tenancy rights over the subject landholdings. They were executed with all the legal formalities of a public document and thus the legal presumption of the regularity and validity of the <i>Kasulatan </i>are retained in the absence of full, clear and convincing evidence to overcome such presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Strong evidence is required to prove a defect of a public instrument,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and since such strong and convincing evidence was not presented in the instant case, the 1976 and the 1987 <i>Kasulatan </i>are presumed valid.<br><br>Coming now to the second issue of prescription, the petitioners argue that they did not sleep on their rights because although the Complaint with the DARAB was filed on June 10, 1994, they already filed a protest before the DAR Legal Division of Lucena prior to their Complaint before the DARAB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>This contention cannot be sustained.<br><br>An action to enforce rights as an agricultural tenant is barred by prescription if not filed within three (3) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Section 38 of Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, specifically provides that:<br><blockquote>SECTION 38. Statute of Limitations. -- An action to enforce any cause of action under this Code shall be barred if not commenced within three years after such cause of action accrued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote>The records of the case show that the protest before the DAR Legal Division of Lucena was filed sometime in 1992 when the case was set for a mediation conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Even assuming that they have a cause of action, this arose in 1987 when they were ejected from the landholdings they were cultivating which means that it took them about five (5) years to file a protest before the DAR Legal Division of Lucena, and it took them seven (7) years to file a Complaint before the DARAB. Clearly, their cause of action has already prescribed.<br><br>Accordingly, the petitioners' complaint against the respondent is dismissible on the ground of prescription and for lack of cause of action.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals under review are hereby AFFIRMED without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED. </b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, Corona, Azcuna </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo, </i>pp. 73-80.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at pp. 81-83.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> There appears to be a discrepancy in the Records of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board, pp. 7-8.
