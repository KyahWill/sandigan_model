Bautista who conducted the autopsy opined that the injuries on the victim's head were caused by the employment of a hard object while the wound on the chest was caused by a sharp instrument.<br><br>The Dagupan City police recovered the sidecar attached to the motorcycle a kilometer away from the crime scene at a roadside corner.<br><br>From information gathered from bystanders, the police learned that de la Cruz, a notorious thief who had previously been convicted for theft, and an unidentified man were seen riding on a red Yamaha motorcycle on June 4, 2001; that from a surveillance conducted, de la Cruz was not in his Dagupan residence; and that his&nbsp; mother Maria Rosario (Maria) is living in the municipality of San Quintin.<br><br>On June 8, 2001, the San Quintin police reported to the Dagupan City police that a red motorcycle was recovered from de la Cruz's mother Maria's house in San Quintin, and that Melecio was apprehended, while de la Cruz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and Obello escaped.&nbsp; De la Cruz's friends Angelica Perez (Angelica) and Anna Datlag (Anna), who were at the time staying at Maria's house, were invited for questioning.<br><br>Anna related to the police, which she echoed&nbsp; at the witness stand, as follows:&nbsp; On June 2, 2001, while she, Angelica, de la Cruz, and Obello were on vacation in Lupao, Nueva Ecija, de la Cruz left for Dagupan City and returned on June 4, 2001 on board a red motorcycle together with Melecio.&nbsp; When she asked where he got the motorcycle, de la Cruz replied that it came from his uncle. Also on June 4, 2001, the group proceeded to de la Cruz's mother Maria's house in San Quintin, with de la Cruz and Angelica on board the motorcycle, while the rest boarded a bus.&nbsp; The group stayed in Maria's house for four days.<br><br>Anna further related: On June 6, 2001, she asked de la Cruz who owns the red motorcycle to which he replied that he took it from an old man who was sleeping after he hit the old man with a stone and Melecio stabbed him at the right side of his body, following which they took the money of the old man.<br><br>As a result of follow-up investigations, the police invited Reyes for custodial investigation.&nbsp; The police later returned the motorcycle to the victim's wife Julita after she identified it as the one attached to the sidecar of the victim.<br><br>Upon the other hand, de la Cruz put up alibi,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> claiming that he was asleep in his house at Callejon Extension, Dagupan City on the night of January 3, 2001; that on waking up the following day, January 4, 2001, Obello and Melecio arrived and invited him to, as he did join them to San Quintin on board a motorcycle which the two claimed belongs to their uncle; that the group went first to Lupao, Nueva Ecija where they met Anna and Angelica who, on his invitation, joined them in San Quintin where they stayed for a few days.<br><br>De la Cruz went on to claim as follows: While they were in San Quintin, Melecio and Obello asked him to look for a buyer of the motorcycle, drawing him and his mother Rosario to scold the two and ask them to go home.&nbsp; The two insisted on staying in San Quintin, however, until they could find a buyer of the motorcycle.&nbsp; The two eventually admitted that they took the motorcycle from an old man whom they had hit. His mother thereupon asked him to send his friends away, which he did, but they refused to leave.&nbsp; Not wanting to be implicated in a crime, he went home to Dagupan on June 7, 2001.<br><br>After trial, Branch 43 of the Dagupan City RTC convicted dela Cruz of both charges. As reflected early on, it acquitted Reyes.&nbsp; The trial court disposed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds accused MARLON DELA CRUZ alias "Dagul" GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for the felonies of robbery with Homicide AND Violation of R.A. No. 6539 (An act preventing and penalizing carnapping) and in conformity with law, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA in each case.<br><br>Accused JESSIE REYES is ordered acquitted on ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>Further, accused is ordered to pay the victim's wife the following to wit:<br><ol><li>P50,000.00 as indemnity;<br></li><li>P50,000.00 as moral damages;<br></li><li>P30,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br></li><li>P31,234.00 representing funeral/burial miscellaneous expenses;<br></li><li>P17,000.00 representing victim's money intended to pay two (2) months installment of his new motorized tricycle;<br></li></ol>Be it stressed that victim's carnapped motorized tricycle was recovered.<br><br>The BJMP of Dagupan City is ordered to commit the person of the accused to the National Penitentiary immediately and without unnecessary delay.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal before the Court of Appeals, de la Cruz faulted the trial court<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>X X X IN <u>RELYING HEAVILY ON SUPPOSITIONS AND PRESUMPTIONS</u> TO JUSTIFY THE CONVICTION OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT MARLON DELA CRUZ SINCE THERE WAS NO EYEWITNESS TO THE CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST THE PERSON OF TEOFILO TAMIN, SR.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>X X X IN <u>BELIEVING THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS ANNA DATLAG</u> DESPITE THE REMARKABLE MOTIVE BEHIND HER ACT OF PINNING DOWN ACCUSED-APPELLANT MARLON DELA CRUZ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]<br><br></sup><center>III<br></center><br>XXX IN <u>IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA FOR EACH CASE</u>.<br><center><br>IV<br></center><br>XXX IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE COMPLEX CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE <u>SANS EVIDENCE TO PROVE THE SAME</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals affirmed de la Cruz's conviction, but modified the penalty in light of the following observations:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he trial court erred in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua in both cases, for the crime of carnapping, considering that <u>the information only alleged that DELA CRUZ committed the crime by means of violence or intimidation against persons and did not allege that the victim was killed in the course of the commission of the carnapping or on occasion thereof</u>.&nbsp; In the same way that <u>recidivism cannot be appreciated</u> against DELA CRUZ notwithstanding his admission in court that he was priorly convicted of theft, a crime punished under the same title of the Code as the crime of robbery with homicide, and was just released from Muntinlupa at the time of the trial of the second case.&nbsp; Said aggravating circumstances were <u>not alleged in the information</u> in consonance with the requirement of Section 9, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br></blockquote>Also, while the Court acknowledges that certain losses and expenses were actually incurred by the wife of the victim and her family, the Court notes that <u>except for the amount of P13,000.00 representing the payment made to Funeraria Dagupan, the other expenses for funeral/burial of the victim were not properly substantiated by receipts</u>.&nbsp; For which reason, We cannot grant the same.&nbsp; The allegation also that <u>the earnings of the day, taken by DELA CRUZ and MELECIO from TEOFILO, SR., amounted to P10,000.00 [<i>sic</i>] was not sufficiently proven</u>.&nbsp; It is so exuberant [<i>sic</i>] considering the nature of the business of the victim at the time the incident occurred.&nbsp; The grant of <u>exemplary damages is also deleted</u> in the absence of aggravating circumstances attending the commission of the crime as alleged in the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp;

This Court is not persuaded.&nbsp; Section 33 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides that "[t]he declaration of an accused acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, or of any offense necessarily included therein, may be given in evidence against him."&nbsp; <i>People v.
