				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By Information filed on May 28, 2003 before the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, docketed as Criminal Case No. 21514-R, Illustre Llagas (appellant) was charged with rape as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 16<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2003, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and by means of violence and intimidation, have carnal knowledge of the said complainant [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against her will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The prosecution gave the following version of the incident:<br><br>AAA worked as a waitress at a restaurant and karaoke bar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Her work schedule was from 5:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. of the next day.  As she was residing in La Trinidad, she often slept at the house of her co-worker, BBB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in Baguio City.<br><br>On February 24, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> appellant, BBB's cousin, whose wife was an overseas worker in Hongkong, met AAA in BBB's house.  From then on, appellant would sometimes bring food to BBB's house where the three of them would take lunch and watch television (TV) together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On April 16, 2003, as previously agreed, appellant and AAA met at 2:00 p.m. in front of McDonald's, Center Mall, Baguio City as she was going to buy his cellphone.  Appellant, having told AAA that he left the  phone charger at his house at Km. 4, Asin Road, Baguio City, suggested that they go there to get it.  AAA demurred, saying she would go somewhere and he could just give it to her the following day.  He persisted, however, assuring her that they would not be alone since his mother and sister were there.  With that assurance, AAA relented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Via a taxi, appellant and AAA repaired to appellant's house.  On finding that they were alone in the house, AAA tried to leave but appellant quickly locked the door.  When she insisted to leave, he boxed her twice on the stomach causing her to sit.  She begged for mercy, but he would hear none of it.  When she struggled to leave, he strangled her on the neck, threatening her not to shout or else he would kill her.  He then took a knife from a table and aimed it at her chest.  He pulled her inside a room but she struggled, so he boxed her again on the stomach, rendering her weak.  He finally succeeded in pulling her inside the room and putting her on the bed.  She tried to push him away but failed as he was still holding a knife.  He kissed her, removed her T-shirt, pants, and panties.  He then removed his shirt and pants, went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina while she was crying helplessly.  After ejaculating, he stood up and sneered at her, saying she would not be able to go out of the house anymore.  While she was crying, his cellphone rang.  It was a call from his wife.  While he was talking with his wife, she swiftly took the opportunity to escape.<br><br>AAA went home to Sison, Pangasinan.  Still shocked and not knowing what to do, she went to San Fabian of the same province and related the incident to her uncle, a policeman.  With the assistance of her uncle, she filed a complaint against appellant for rape before the police authorities in Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Lorelle Coquia, a physician of the Baguio City General Hospital, found AAA to be coherent and oriented as to date, time, and place.  Since it was already more than a week from the occurrence of the incident, the doctor found no evident injury on AAA's body, but discovered a healed laceration in her hymen at 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions, which could have been caused by a penetrating trauma like that of an erect male organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Appellant, denying the accusation that he raped AAA on April 16, 2003, claimed that he had had sexual intercourse with her, but on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">February 28 or 29, 2003</span> while they were watching TV at BBB's house; and that it happened by mutual consent.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of March 26, 2005, the trial court (Branch 6) found appellant guilty of rape, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused Illustre Llagas also known as Nonoy Llagas guilty of Rape as defined and penalized under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B Chapter 3 Title 8 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Sec. 2 of Republic Act 8353 and sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, to indemnify the offended party x x x the sum of P50,000.00 as Civil Indemnity and the sum of P100,000.00 as Moral Damages for the pain and anguish suffered by her, both without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused Illustre Llagas being a detention prisoner is entitled to be credited 4/5 of his preventive imprisonment in the service of his sentence in accordance with Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>Before the Court of Appeals to which appellant appealed his conviction, he faulted the trial court<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>... IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT USED FORCE AND INTIMIDATION WHEN IN FACT THE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WAS WITH THE MUTUAL CONSENT OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AND THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>... IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE WEAK EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION AGAINST HIM.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>... IN AWARDING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00) AS MORAL DAMAGES FOR BEING NOT IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE  PREVAILING  JURISPRUDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The <i>People</i>, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG),<i> </i>maintained that, except for the award of moral damages which should be reduced to P50,000, the appealed decision, being in conformity with the law and evidence, should be affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The appellate court, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of April 13, 2007 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01407, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affirmed</span> the factual findings of the trial court, but modified the award of moral damages by reducing it from P100,000 to P50,000, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The appellate court thus disposed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision of the RTC, Branch 6, Baguio City, in Criminal Case No. 21514-R appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the amount of moral damages is reduced to P50,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, appellant's present appeal.  In separate Manifestations, appellant  and the OSG found it no longer necessary to file their respective supplemental briefs.<br><br>In the main, appellant submits in his Appellant's Brief filed before the appellate court that his act of answering a phone call from his wife "on the very <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same date</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time</span> that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he was allegedly raping</span> [AAA] is more of an evidence of consensual sexual intercourse and not of forced carnal knowledge"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied).<br><br>Such change of theory on appeal can only be construed against his innocence, however.  For while before the trial court appellant denied having had sexual intercourse with AAA on April 16, 2003, he admitted having done so but on February 28 or 29, 2003 and with AAA's consent.<br><br>But even if the Court were to credit appellant's change of position when the case reached the appellate court, his citation of his having received his wife's phone call as negating the use of force or intimidation is illogical, to say the least.  For it was, in fact, on account of his talking to his wife on the phone that AAA found the opportunity to escape.<br><br>AAA's following vivid account, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quoted </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">verbatim</i>, which was punctuated with her crying, of how she was sexually assaulted by appellant clearly shows the total absence of consensual sex as claimed by him:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You said earlier that the accused mentioned his mother and a sister in the house.

found AAA's straightforward, candid, and spontaneous testimony credible as it bears the hallmarks of a truthful witness, unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions.

On the contrary, the records depict her as a decent, resourceful, and hardworking Filipina trying to earn a living while waiting for a job abroad.<br><br>As for AAA's one week delay in reporting the rape, she did not know what to do as she feared appellant's threat that he would kill her if she told anybody of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It has been held that delay or vacillation in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily weaken the credibility of a witness where, as here, such delay is satisfactorily explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respecting the civil aspect of the case, the Court finds that AAA is also entitled to an award of exemplary damages which jurisprudence pegs at P25,000 as it was proven, although not alleged in the information, during the trial that the use of deadly weapon attended the commission of the crime. It bears stating that while such circumstance cannot be appreciated for the purpose of fixing a heavier penalty, it can be considered as basis for an award of exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
