Romeo G. Roxas, after her lot was sold by the latter to Carmelita Cruz (Cruz) on 12 September 2001. Also impleaded as respondents were the Register of Deeds of Antipolo City, Earthland, and Insular Savings Bank, to whom Cruz mortgaged the lot as security for a loan of P6,000,000.<br><br>On 21 February 2002, Arbiter Balasolla rendered a Decision in HLURB Case No. REM-051702-11905 (21 February 2002 Decision), the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Declaring the sale of Lot 1, Block 43, Annex II of Penafrancia Hills to Carmelita Cruz null and void;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondent Register of Deeds of Antipolo City to cancel TCT No. R-2591 in the name of Carmelita Cruz, and reinstate TCT No. 35528, free from all liens and encumbrances and to annotate thereon the Contract to Sell of Patricia Caceres and the Transfer of Rights in favor of the complainant;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondent Carmelita Cruz, Romeo Roxas, NBC Agro Industrial and Development Corporation and Earthland Developers Corporation to immediately restore complainant to the peaceful and undisturbed possession of the subject lot;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondent Carmelita Cruz, Romeo Roxas and NBC Agro Industrial and Development Corporation to jointly and severally pay complainant the following:<br><br>a)  Moral Damages of P100,000.00;<br>b)  Exemplary Damages of P100,000.00; and<br>c) Attorney's Fees of P50,000.00.<br></li></ol><br>All other claims and counterclaims are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br>NBC-Agro, Insular, and Cruz filed separate petitions for review of the 21 February 2002 Decision of Arbiter Balasolla.

SP No. 80036 (the subject of the present petition), assailing the 24 September 2003 Decision of the HLURB Board of Commissioners for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Meanwhile, Cruz, Mayon, Earthland, and NBC-Agro moved for reconsideration of the 24 September 2003 Decision of the HLURB Board of Commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 24 June 2004, the HLURB Board of Commissioners issued a Resolution dismissing the joint motion for reconsideration of Mayon, Earthland, and NBC-Agro while partially granting the motion for reconsideration of Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Cruz, on one hand, and Mayon, Earthland, NBC-Agro, and Atty. Romeo G. Roxas, on the other, filed separate appeals to the Office of the President, which consolidated the appeals and docketed them as O.P. Case No. 04-G-326.  The appeals essentially challenged the 24 September 2003 Decision  and 24 June 2004 Resolution of the HLURB Board of Commissioners.<br><br>While the appeals of Cruz, Mayon, Earthland, NBC-Agro, and Atty. Romeo G. Roxas were pending before the Office of the President, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 80036, which is the subject of the instant petition for review.<br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 80036, the Court of Appeals held that petitioners violated the rule on the execution of the certificate against forum shopping, resulting in the non-perfection of the appeal. Consequently, the duty to elevate the records to the HLURB Board of Commissioners on the part of Arbiter Balasolla did not arise. The Court of Appeals ruled that since the appeal with the HLURB Board of Commissioners was not perfected in the manner and within the period prescribed by law, the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla became final.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ANNULLING the order dated February 28, 2003 and the decision dated September 24, 2003 issued by the respondent HLURB Board of Commissioners; and DECLARING that there is now no legal obstacle to the execution of the final and executory decision dated January 25, 2002 in HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 (REM-A-021122-0268) and the decision dated February 21, 2002 in HLURB Case No. REM-051702-11905 (REM-A-030428-0104).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Relying on the Court of Appeals' Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 80036, the Office of the President set aside the 24 September 2003 Decision and 24 June 2004 Resolution of the  HLURB Board of Commissioners. The Office of the President reasoned that the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 80036 had already declared final and executory the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla. Hence, the Office of the President was left with no other recourse but to reiterate the finality of the assailed decisions of Arbiter Balasolla.<br><br>In its Resolution of 28 January 2005, the Office of the President disposed of the appeals, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeals are hereby DISMISSED.  <b>The Decision and Resolution of the HLURB Board of Commissioners dated September 24, 2003 and June 24, 2004, respectively, are SET ASIDE and the Decisions of the Housing Arbiter dated January 25, 2002 and February 21, 2002 are REINSTATED and declared final and executory</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The Office of the President denied with finality the motion for reconsideration jointly filed by Mayon, Earthland, Atty.

In its Decision of  20 April 2007, the Court of Appeals affirmed the 28 January 2005 Resolution of the Office of the President.<br><br>Undaunted, Cruz filed a petition for review with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 177543.  In a Resolution dated 9 July 2007, the Court's Third Division denied the petition for failure to sufficiently show that the Court of Appeals committed any reversible error warranting the exercise by this Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction.<br><br><b><u><center>The Issue<br></center></u></b><br>The issue in this case is whether the 25 January 2002 Decision of the HLURB Arbiter in HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 and the 21 February 2002 Decision in HLURB Case No. REM-051702 are already final and executory.<br><br><b><u><center>The Ruling of this Court<br></center></u></b><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>In HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831, petitioners failed to perfect the appeal from the 25 January 2002 Decision of Arbiter Balasolla in the manner prescribed by the HLURB 1996 Rules of Procedure (HLURB Rules).  Petitioners admittedly failed to comply with Section 3(b), Rule XII<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the HLURB Rules, which specifically requires the attachment to the petition for review of <b>a verified certification against forum shopping jointly executed by the petitioner <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> his counsel.</b>  <b> The absence of such joint verified certification shall result in the dismissal of the petition for review, pursuant to Section 1, Rule XIV of the HLURB Rules.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><b>  </b>Considering that the petition for review filed by petitioners lacks the required verified certification against forum shopping, the petition for review was correctly dismissed for failure to comply with the requirements of the HLURB Rules.  Hence, the  25 January 2002 Decision of Arbiter Balasolla became final for non-perfection of the appeal.<br><br>At any rate, the Court notes that while the present petition for review was pending, Cruz filed with this Court a petition for review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> docketed as  G.R. No. 177543.  In the minute Resolution of 9 July 2007, the Court's Third Division denied the petition for lack of any reversible error in the challenged decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The Resolution in G.R. No. 177543 became final and executory on 3 January 2008.<br><br>Essentially, the Court's Third Division agreed with the Court of Appeals' finding that the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla are already final and executory.  This Court, in effect, upheld the following conclusions of the Court of Appeals:<br><br><blockquote> It must be remembered that the thrust of the Decision of September 24, 2003 which was rendered in HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 entitled <i>"Lualhati Beltran vs. Mayon Estate and Earthland Developers Corp."</i> is for Mayon Estate and Earthland Developers to complete the development of Peñafrancia Hills Subdivision and to surrender the possession of Lot 1, Block 43 and Lot 27 Block 49 to LUALHATI.  This decision had been declared final and executory by the Court of Appeals because the petition for review filed by the respondents in that case, Mayon Estate and Earthland Developers, failed to comply with the requirement of Section 1, Rule XII of the HLURB Revised Rules of Procedure.  Hence, the filing of the petition for review did not perfect their appeal.  This means that the decision of the Housing Arbiter in favor of LUALHATI had thereby become final and executory.<br><br>Undoubtedly, CARMELITA was not a party to this case. However, this does not mean that she can now ask the Court to set aside the said decision via the present petition, moreso that the said decision had long become final and executory and declared to be so by the Court of Appeals.  The records disclose that in fact on November 19, 2002 the HLURB had already issued a writ of execution to implement its decisions of January 25, 2002. For this reason, the Office of the President has no authority to modify, annul, or set aside such final order, and had correctly relied on the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals.  To ask this Court to set aside the September 24, 2003 of the HLURB Board will in effect, task the Court not only to set aside the decision dated July 22, 2004 rendered by this same Court, but to set aside the already final order dated January 25, 2002.  This cannot be done. Judgments of the courts must become final at some definite time.  To allow CARMELITA to be exempted from the legal effects of a final judgment just because she was not a party to the case in which it was rendered will result in endless litigation.  Neither appeal nor this petition for review may relieve CARMELITA of the effects of the January 25, 2002 judgment.<br><br>x x x x<b>  </b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Clearly, the Court of Appeals passed upon the issue of whether the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla were already final and executory, which is the sole issue in this case. Indisputably, G.R. No. 177543 is intimately related to the present case.  Hence, when the Court's Third Division affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 88815, this Court in effect ruled on the issue of the finality of the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla.  Since the Resolution in G.R. No. 177543, affirming the finality of the 25 January 2002 and 21 February 2002 Decisions of Arbiter Balasolla, has long become final and executory, the present petition is already moot.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY </b>the petition.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>, Brion, Del Castillo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Abad, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated additional member per Special Order No. 776.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><i> Rollo</i>, pp. 30-42.
