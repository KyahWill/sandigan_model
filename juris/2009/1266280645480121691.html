				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Juanito Tabigue and his 19 co-petitioners, all employees of respondent International Copra Export Corp-oration (INTERCO), filed a Notice of Preventive Mediation with the Department of Labor and Employment - National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB), Regional Branch No. XI, Davao City against respondent, for <i>violation of Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and failure to sit on the grievance conference/meeting</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>As the parties failed to reach a settlement before the NCMB, petitioners requested to elevate the case to voluntary arbitration.  The NCMB thus set a date for the parties to agree on a Voluntary Arbitrator.<br><br>Before the parties could finally meet, respondent presented before the NCMB a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of Genaro Tan (Tan), president of the INTERCO Employees/Laborers' Union (the union) of which petitioners are members, addressed to respondent's plant manager Engr. Paterno C. Tangente (Tangente), stating that petitioners "<u>are not duly authorized by [the] board or the officers to represent the union</u>,  [hence] . . . all actions, representations or agreements made by these people with the management will not be honored or recognized by the union."  Respondent thus moved to dismiss petitioners' complaint for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Petitioners soon sent union president Tan and respondent's plant manager Tangente a Notice to Arbitrate, citing the "Revised Guidelines" in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Procedure <i>vis a vis</i> Section 3, Article XII of the CBA, furnishing the NCMB with a copy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> thereof, which notice respondent opposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The parties having failed to arrive at a settlement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> NCMB Director Teodorico O. Yosores wrote petitioner Alex Bibat and respondent's plant manager Tangente of the lack of willingness of both parties to submit to voluntary arbitration, which willingness is a <u>pre-requisite to submit the case thereto</u>;  and that under the CBA forged by the parties, the union is an indispensable party to a voluntary arbitration but that since Tan informed respondent that the union had not authorized petitioners to represent it, it would be absurd to bring the case to voluntary arbitration.<br><br>The NCMB Director thus concluded that "the demand of [petitioners] to submit the issues . . .  to voluntary arbitration CAN NOT BE GRANTED." He thus advised petitioners to avail of the compulsory arbitration process to enforce their rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the NCMB Director, by letter of April 11, 2007 to petitioners' counsel, stated that the NCMB "has no rule-making power to decide on issues [as it] only facilitates settlement among the parties to . . . labor disputes."<br><br>Petitioners thus assailed the NCMB Director's decision via Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which dismissed it by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of October 24, 2007 in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Considering that NCMB is <u><b>not</b> a quasi-judicial agency exercising quasi-judicial functions</u> but merely a conciliatory body for the purpose of facilitating settlement of disputes between parties, <u>its decisions or that of its authorized officer cannot be appealed</u> either through a petition for review under Rule 43 or under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>Further perusal of the petition reveals the following infirmities:<br><br><ol><li>Payment of the <u>docket fees and other legal fees</u> is <u>short</u> by One Thousand Pesos (Php 1,000.00);<br><br></li><li>Copy of the assailed "Decision" of the Regional Director of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board has <u>not been properly certified</u> as the name and designation of the certifying officer thereto are not indicated; and<br><br></li><li><u>Not all</u> of the petitioners named in the petition <u>signed the verification</u> and non-forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> petitioners filed the present Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> raising the following arguments:<br><br><blockquote>THIS PARTICULAR <u>CASE XXX FALLS SQUARELY</u> WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF S<u>ECTION 6, RULE IV, IN RELATION TO PARAGRAPH 3, SUB-PARAGRAPH 3.2, SECTION 4, RULE IV, ALL OF THE REVISED PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES IN THE CONDUCT</u> OF VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>THE NCMB, <u>WHEN EXERCISING ADJUDICATIVE POWERS, ACTS AS A QUASI-JUDICIAL AGENCY</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>FINAL JUDGMENTS, DECISIONS, RESOLUTIONS, ORDERS, OR AWARDS OF REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS AND <b>QUASI-JUDICIAL BOARDS</b>, LIKE THE NCMB, COMMISSIONS, AGENCIES, INSTRUMENTALITIES, ARE <b>APPEALABLE</b> BY PETITION FOR REVIEW TO THE <b>COURT OF APPEALS</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (emphasis in the original)<br><br>LABOR CASES, AS A GENERAL RULE, ARE <u>NEVER RESOLVED ON THE BASIS OF TECHNICALITY</u> ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES ARE AFFECTED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The petition fails.<br><br>Section 7 of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court provides that<br><br><blockquote>[t]he failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements <u>regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees</u>, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and <u>the contents of and the documents which should accompany the petition <b>shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof</b></u>. (underscoring and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioners claim that they had completed the payment of the appellate docket fee and other legal fees when they filed their motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  While the Court has, in the interest of justice, given due course to appeals despite the belated payment of those fees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> petitioners have not proffered any reason to call for a relaxation of the above-quoted rule.  On this score alone, the dismissal by the appellate court of petitioners' petition is in order.<br><br>But even if the above-quoted rule were relaxed, the appellate court's dismissal would just the same be sustained.  Under Section 9 (3) of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court of Appeals exercises exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and <i>quasi-judicial</i> agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions.<br><br>Rule 43 of the Rules of Court under which petitioners filed their petition before the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> applies to awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any <i>quasi-judicial</i> agency in the exercise of its <i>quasi-judicial functions</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A[n agency] is said to be exercising <u>judicial function where [it] has the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties</u> are, and then undertakes to <u>determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties</u>.

The pertinent portion of the CBA reads:<br><br><blockquote>In case of any dispute arising from the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement or any matter affecting the relations of Labor and Management, the <u>UNION</u> and the COMPANY agree to exhaust all possibilities of conciliation through the grievance machinery.  The committee shall resolve all problems submitted to it within fifteen (15) days after the problems ha[ve] been discussed by the members. If the dispute or grievance cannot be settled by the Committee, or if the committee failed to act on the matter within the period of fifteen (15) days herein stipulated, the <u>UNION</u> and the COMPANY agree to submit the issue to Voluntary Arbitration. Selection of the arbitrator shall be made within seven (7) days from the date of notification by the aggrieved party.  The Arbitrator shall be selected by lottery from four (4) qualified individuals nominated by in equal numbers by both parties taken from the list of Arbitrators prepared by the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB).  If the Company and the Union representatives within ten (10) days fail to agree on the Arbitrator, the NCMB shall name the Arbitrator.  The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.  However, the Arbitrator shall not have the authority to change any provisions of the Agreement.  The cost of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (capitalization in the original, underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioners have not, however, been duly authorized to represent the union.  <i>Apropos </i>is this Court's pronouncement in <i>Atlas Farms, Inc. v.
