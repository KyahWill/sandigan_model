The 12 May 2005 Resolution denied the motion for reconsideration of petitioner Republic of the Philippines (Republic).<br><center><br><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></center><br>On 3 December 1996, respondent filed an application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for the confirmation and registration of the subject property under Presidential Decree No. 1529 (PD 1529).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent alleged that she is the owner of the subject property and the improvements thereon. Respondent stated that on 31 May 1993, she purchased the subject property from Manolita Gonzales Vda. de Carungcong (Carungcong), through Wendy Mitsuko Sato, Carungcong's daughter and attorney in fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Respondent declared that she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the subject property for more than 30 years.<br><br>Except for the Republic, there were no other oppositors to the application. The Republic opposed respondent's application on the following grounds: (1) that respondent and her predecessors-in-interest failed to present sufficient evidence to show that they have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the subject property since 12 June 1945 or earlier as required by Section 48(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (CA 141),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1073 (PD 1073);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (2) that the tax declarations and tax receipt payments attached to the application do not constitute competent and sufficient evidence of a <i>bona fide</i> acquisition of the land applied for or of respondent's open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the subject property in the concept of an owner since 12 June 1945 or earlier; and (3) that the subject property forms part of the public domain and is not subject to private appropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After establishing the jurisdictional facts, respondent presented the following documents to support her application:<br><ol><li>Deed of Absolute Sale dated 31 May 1993 between respondent and Carungcong;<br><br></li><li>Tax Declarations corresponding to different years showing that the subject property has been declared under the name of Carungcong for tax purposes: Tax Declaration No. 02226-A for the year 1948, Tax Declaration No. 010158-A for the year 1960, Tax Declaration No. 013976-A for the year 1965, Tax Declaration No. 07209-B for the year 1974, Tax Declaration No. 016-0635 for the year 1980, Tax Declaration No. GR-016-0735 for the year 1985 and Tax Declaration No. GR-016-1610 for the year 1992;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br></li><li>Tax Declaration Nos.

The dispositive portion states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this court hereby approves this application for registration and thus places under the operation of Act 141, Act 496 and/or P.D. 1529, otherwise known as Property Registration Law, the land, Lot 7062 described in plan Ap-04-010084, Cad-355, Tagaytay Cadastre, situated in the Brgy. of San Jose, City of Tagaytay, containing an area of Eight Hundred Eighty Eight (888) Square Meters in the name of RUBY LEE TSAI, married to Tsai Yu Lung, both of legal age and residents of Sun Valley Subdivision, Sta.

According to the Republic, it is not sufficient that respondent proved possession of the subject property for more than 30 years.<br><br>In the assailed 30 January 2004 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.<br><br>The Republic filed a motion for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals denied Republic's motion.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><center><br><u><b>The Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</b></u><br></center><br>According to the trial court, respondent was able to establish her title and interest over the subject property. The trial court found that respondent and her predecessors-in-interest have been in actual possession of the subject property for more than 30 years. The trial court also declared that the subject property was residential and not within any forest zone or the public domain.<br><center><br><u><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></center><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's finding that respondent and her predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject property in the concept of an owner for more than 30 years. According to the Court of Appeals, respondent need not prove that she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the subject property since 12 June 1945 or earlier because Section 48(b) of CA 141 was already superseded by Republic Act No. 1942 (RA 1942),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which provides for a simple 30 year prescriptive period of occupation by an applicant for judicial confirmation of title.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issue</b></u><br></center><br>The Republic raises the sole issue of whether the trial court can grant the application for registration despite the lack of proof of respondent's open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject property since 12 June 1945 or earlier.<br><center><br><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>The Republic argues that respondent failed to present sufficient evidence to show that she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject property in the concept of an owner since 12 June 1945 or earlier. According to the Republic, respondent only proved possession since 1948, which is in violation of Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended by PD 1073.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent insists that it is sufficient that she proved that she and her predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the subject property under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership for more than 30 years.<br><br>The Court notes that in respondent's original application before the trial court, she claimed that she was entitled to the confirmation and registration of her title to the subject property under PD 1529. However, respondent did not specify under what paragraph of Section 14 of PD 1529 she was filing the application. But going over respondent's application and the evidence she presented before the trial court, it appears that respondent filed her application under Section 14(1) of PD 1529, which states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 14. <i>Who may apply</i>. - The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership <b>since June 12, 1945, or earlier</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, there are three requisites for the filing of an application for registration of title under Section 14(1) of PD 1529: (1) that the property in question is alienable and disposable land of the public domain; (2) that the applicant by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation; and (3) <b>that such possession is under a <i>bona fide </i>claim of ownership since 12 June 1945 or earlier</b>. The right to file the application for registration derives from a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership going back to 12 June 1945 or earlier, by reason of the claimant's open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of alienable and disposable land of the public domain.<br><br>A similar right is given under Section 48(b) of CA 141, as amended by PD 1073, which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 48. The following described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such land or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land Registration Act, to wit:<br><br>x x x<br><br> (b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition of ownership, <b>since June 12, 1945, or earlier</b>, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure</i>. These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>According to the Court of Appeals, respondent need not prove possession of the subject property since 12 June 1945 or earlier because Section 48(b) of CA 141 was amended by RA 1942, which provided for a simple 30-year prescriptive period. The Court of Appeals appears to have an erroneous interpretation of Section 48(b) of CA 141.<br><br>Through the years, Section 48(b) of the CA 141 has been amended several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Court of Appeals failed to consider the amendment introduced by PD 1073. In <i>Republic v. Doldol</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court provided a summary of these amendments:<br><blockquote>The original Section 48(b) of C.A. No.141 provided for possession and occupation of lands of the public domain <b>since July 26, 1894</b>. This was superseded by R.A. No. 1942, which provided for a <b>simple thirty-year prescriptive period</b> of occupation by an applicant for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. The same, however, has already been amended by Presidential Decree No. 1073, approved on January 25, 1977. As amended, Section 48(b) now reads:<br><blockquote>(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of acquisition of ownership, <b>since June 12, 1945, or earlier</b>, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure</i>. These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>As the law now stands, a mere showing of possession and occupation for 30 years or more is not sufficient. Therefore, since the effectivity of PD 1073 on 25 January 1977, it must now be shown that possession and occupation of the piece of land by the applicant, by himself or through his predecessors-in-interest, started on <b>12</b> <b>June 1945 or earlier</b>. This provision is in total conformity with Section 14(1) of PD 1529.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondent failed to comply with the period of possession and occupation of the subject property, as required by both PD 1529 and CA 141. We agree with the Republic that respondent's evidence was not enough to prove that her possession of the subject property started since 12 June 1945 or earlier because respondent's earliest evidence can be traced back to a tax declaration issued in the name of her predecessors-in-interest only in the year 1948. In view of the lack of sufficient showing that respondent and her predecessors-in-interest possessed the subject property under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since 12 June 1945 or earlier, respondent's application for confirmation and registration of the subject property under PD 1529 and CA 141 should be denied.<br><br>Finally, we note that respondent also failed to prove that the subject property has been declared alienable and disposable by the President or the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. In <i>Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court said:<br><blockquote>[T]he applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. In addition, the applicant for land registration must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records. These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition. We <b>SET ASIDE</b> the 30 January 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.
