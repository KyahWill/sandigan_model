In said protest, petitioner contested the basis of the assessment of deficiency documentary stamp tax on its SSDs in the following manner, to wit:<br><blockquote>x  x  x  x<br><br>B. On the Special Savings Account:<br><br>With respect to the Savings Plus Deposit transactions, the latter is also not subject to documentary stamp tax because by the very nature of the transaction which is just a variation of the regular savings account, the same is not taxable under the aforequoted Section 180. Let us consider some salient features of the product that differentiates it from a Time Deposit Account:<br><br>1. The terms and conditions of the Savings Plus Deposit are provided for in the traditional passbook form as distinguished from a Time Deposit Account which is evidenced by a certificate of deposit.<br><br>2. In a time deposit, there is no partial withdrawal. The term is preterminated and the certificate of deposit is cancelled and surrendered and the entire amount is paid to the depositor. In the case of Savings Plus Deposit, however, there is partial withdrawal, which is posted in the passbook. The amount withdrawn is paid to the depositor and the passbook is returned to the depositor. In other words, the Savings Plus Deposit, contrary to the basis for assessment, represents a continuing fund which is open to deposits and withdrawals anytime, and therefore, falls under the category of certificates of deposit at sight or on demand which is exempt from documentary stamp tax.<br><br>3. When fifty percent (50%) of the term of a Time Deposit had lapsed, interest to be paid is fifty percent (50%) of the agreed rate. When less than fifty percent (50%) of the term had lapsed, interest to be paid is twenty- five percent (25%) of the agreed rate. In the case of a Savings Plus Deposit, however, amount withdrawn earns only the regular fixed savings rate of three percent (3%).<br><br>4. The features of the product in no way resemble that of a promissory note or a certificate of indebtedness, and<br><br>5. The intention, not any occasional error in the implementation of the product, should be the basis of taxation. A correctible error in the implementation does not convert a non-taxable product into a taxable one.<br><br>In view of all the foregoing reasons and considerations, we hereby request that subject assessment notice be recalled and/or reconsidered, the same not being due and demandable from China Bank, under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>On December 20, 1999, petitioner received a Preliminary Agreement Notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>dated December 17, 1999, assessing petitioner's deficiency documentary stamp taxes on its RRAs and SSDs covering the taxable years 1996 and 1997.

Promissory Notes, whether negotiable or non-negotiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>From said enumeration, the CTA <i>en banc</i> held that petitioner's SSDs fall under the category of "certificates of deposit drawing interest."<br><br>In <i>Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Querimit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court defined a certificate of deposit as "a written acknowledgment by a bank or banker of the receipt of a sum of money on deposit which the bank or banker promises to pay to the depositor, to the order of the depositor, or to some other person or his order, whereby the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the depositor is created." A certificate of deposit is also defined as "a receipt issued by a bank for an interest-bearing time deposit coming due at a specified future date."<br><br>In its Decision, the CTA <i>en banc</i> held that certificates of time deposit are subject to documentary stamp tax and that the same are but a type of a certificate of deposit drawing interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Hence, whether or not SSDs are subject to documentary stamp tax is dependent on the nature and specific features thereof. It is thus conceded that if the SSDs are more akin to a time deposit account then the same would be subject to documentary stamp tax. However, if the SSDs are more akin to a regular savings deposit account then the same would not be subject to documentary stamp tax.<br><br>Petitioner argues that its SSDs have the same distinctive features of a regular savings deposit account. Particularly, petitioner asserts that its SSDs are not "certificates of deposits drawing interest" as held by the CTA <i>en banc. </i>Petitioner thus explains:<br><blockquote>Firstly, the law, as it may in pertinence, be scrutinized, specifically mentioned "certificates of deposits drawing interest" as subject to the documentary stamp tax. In the special savings deposit of petitioner, what is issued to a depositor is a passbook just like in regular savings deposit. The reason for this is that, as appreciated by the Honorable Court a <i>quo</i> itself --- the amount deposited in the special savings deposit is withdrawable any time. Partial or full withdrawal may be done by the depositor from this deposit. Not only this, the depositor may likewise deposit any amount he pleases anytime he wants. Hence, the fund in a special savings deposit is a continuing fund, just like regular savings account. The passbook then would be suitable and proper record of all the transactions made and to be made on the special savings deposit.<br><br>Certificates of deposit, on the other hand, are issued to evidence a time deposit placement. Time deposits, to a tee, are certificates of indebtedness issued by a bank for fixed amounts which earn interest at fixed rates and payable at a fixed future date. These features do not attend foursquare on the special savings deposit. In the latter, just like in ordinary savings deposit, there is a minimum amount of deposit required, but it is never fixed or stipulated upon; the interest is assured at savings deposit rate but if the balance required is maintained for a certain period, the depositor is entitled to a prevailing market rate; and, special savings deposit has no maturity date and is a continuing concern. With the withdrawability of the amount deposited herein at any time, as the depositor may please, special savings deposit just like an ordinary savings account includes itself under the category of deposit payable at sight or on demand, read as "orders for the payment of any sum of money [otherwise] at sight or on demand" which is exempt from documentary stamp tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court does not agree. Contrary to the claim of petitioner, the SSDs are in fact "certificates of deposits drawing interest" subject to documentary stamp tax as provided for in Section 180 of the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>In <i>PBC</i>, this Court distinguished a regular savings account, a time deposit account and the Special/Super Savings Deposit Account (SSDA) in the following manner, to wit:<br><br><table width="100%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="15%"> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="20%"> <div align="justify">Savings Account </div></td> <td width="25%"> <div align="justify">Time Deposit </div></td> <td width="40%"> <div align="justify">SSDA </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Interest rate </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Regular savings interest </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Higher interest rate </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Higher interest rate </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Period </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Fixed Term </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Fixed Term </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Evidenced by: </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Passbook </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Certificate <br>of Time Deposit </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Passbook </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Pre-termination </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">With penalty </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">With penalty </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Holding Period </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">Withdrawal </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Allowed </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Withdrawal amounts <br>to pre- termination </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Allowed provided the minimum amount to earn the higher interest rate is maintained, otherwise, the regular savings interest rate will apply. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Based on the foregoing comparison, the Court in <i>PBC</i> ruled that a "Special/Super Savings Deposit Account" has all the distinct features of a certificate of deposit, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Based on the definition and comparison, it is clear that a certificate of deposit drawing interest as used in Section 180 of the 1977 NIRC refers to a time deposit account. As the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) explained in Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 16-2003, the distinct features of a certificate of deposit from a technical point of view are as follows:<br><blockquote>a. Minimum deposit requirement;<br>b. Stated maturity period;<br>c. Interest rate is higher than the ordinary savings account;<br>d. Not payable on sight or demand, but upon maturity or in case of pre-termination, prior notice is required; and<br>e. Early withdrawal penalty in the form of partial loss or total loss of interest in case of pre-termination.<br></blockquote>The SSDA is for depositors who maintain savings deposits with substantial average daily balance and which earn higher interest rates. The holding period of an SSDA floats at the option of the depositor at 30, 60, 90, 120 days or more and for maintaining a longer holding period, the depositor earns higher interest rates. There is no pre-termination of accounts in an SSDA because the account is simply reverted to an ordinary savings status in case of early or partial withdrawal or if the required holding period is not met.  Based on the foregoing, the SSDA has all of the distinct features of a certificate of deposit.</blockquote><br>In <i>International,</i> this Court held that a "Savings Account-Fixed Savings Deposit" is likewise subject to documentary stamp tax, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The FSD, like a time deposit, provides for a higher interest rate when the deposit is not withdrawn within the required fixed period; otherwise, it earns interest pertaining to a regular savings deposit.  Having a fixed term and the reduction of interest rates in case of pre-termination are essential features of a time deposit.  Thus, explains the CTA <i>En Banc</i>:<br><blockquote>It is well-settled that certificates of time deposit are subject to the DST and that a certificate of time deposit is but a type of a certificate of deposit drawing interest.  Thus, in resolving the issue before Us, it is necessary to determine whether petitioner's Savings Account-Fixed Savings Deposit (SA-FSD) has the same nature and characteristics as a time deposit.  In this regard, the findings of fact stated in the assailed Decision [of the CTA Division] are as follows:<br><br>"In this case, <u>a depositor of a savings deposit-FSD is required to keep the money with the bank for at least thirty (30) days in order to yield a higher interest rate.  Otherwise, the deposit earns interest pertaining only to a regular savings deposit</u>.<br><br>"<i>The same feature is present in a time deposit.  A depositor is allowed to withdraw his time deposit even before its maturity subject to bank charges on its pre[-]termination and the depositor loses his entitlement to earn the interest rate corresponding to the time deposit.</i>  Instead, he earns interest pertaining only to a regular savings deposit.  Thus, petitioner's argument that the savings deposit-FSD is withdrawable anytime as opposed to a time deposit which has a maturity date, is not tenable.  In both cases, the deposit may be withdrawn anytime but the depositor gets to earn a lower rate of interest.  <i>The only difference lies on the evidence of deposit</i>, a savings deposit-FSD is evidenced by a passbook, while a time deposit is evidenced by a certificate of time deposit."<br></blockquote>In order for a depositor to earn the agreed higher interest rate in a SA-FSD, the amount of deposit must be maintained for a fixed period.  Such being the case, <i>We agree with the finding that the SA-FSD is a deposit account with a fixed term.  Withdrawal before the expiration of said fixed term results in the reduction of the interest rate.  Having a fixed term and reduction of interest rate in case of pre-termination are <u>essentially</u> the features of a time deposit</i>. Hence, this Court concurs with the conclusion reached in the assailed Decision that petitioner's SA-FSD and time deposit are substantially the same. . . . (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)<br><br>The findings and conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its function, is dedicated exclusively to the consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject, and unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority, and none has been shown in the present case, deserves respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>In herein petition, petitioner's version of the special savings deposit is called the "Savings Plus Deposit Accounts." Said accounts have the following features as can be gathered from the petition:<br><blockquote>1. Amount deposited is withdrawable anytime<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>2. The same is evidenced by a passbook<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>3. The rate of interest offered is the prevailing market rate, provided the depositor would maintain his minimum balance in thirty (30) days at the minimum, and should he withdraw before the period, his deposit would earn the regular savings deposit rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, the conclusion is certain in that petitioner's SSDs are "certificates of deposits drawing interest" as contemplated in Section 180 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code. Petitioner's "Savings Plus Deposit" is essentially the same as the "Savings Account-Fixed Savings Deposit" in <i>International</i>, as well as the "Special/Super Savings Account" in <i>PBC</i> wherein this Court ruled that said accounts are subject to documentary stamp tax.<br><br>Petitioner, however, insists that its SSDs are evidenced by a passbook and thus it claims that the same should bolster its position that said accounts are more akin to a regular savings deposit account.<br><br>This Court does not agree. In <i>International</i>, this Court held that a passbook representing an interest-earning deposit account issued by a bank qualifies as a certificate of deposit drawing interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>A document to be deemed a certificate of deposit requires no specific form as long as there is some written memorandum that the bank accepted a deposit of a sum of money from a depositor. What is important and controlling is the nature or meaning conveyed by the passbook and not the particular label or nomenclature attached to it, inasmuch as substance, not form, is paramount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Anent the second error raised, the same deserves scant consideration. Petitioner cites Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9243<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (approved on February 17, 2004), whereby Section 180 of the 1997 NIRC was amended, to<i> wit:</i><br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5. Section 180 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby renumbered as Section 179 and further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 179.  Stamp Tax on All Debt Instruments. - On every original issue of debt instruments, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of One peso (P1.00) on each Two hundred pesos (P200), or fractional part thereof, of the issue price of any such debt instruments: <i>Provided,</i> That for such debt instruments with terms of less than one (1) year, the documentary stamp tax to be collected shall be of a proportional amount in accordance with the ratio of its term in number of days to three hundred sixty-five (365) days: <i>Provided, further</i>, That only one documentary stamp tax shall be imposed on either loan agreement, or promissory notes issued to secure such loan.</blockquote>For purposes of this section, the term debt instrument shall mean instruments representing borrowing and lending transactions including but not limited to debentures, certificates of indebtedness, due bills, bonds, loan agreements, including those signed abroad wherein the object of contract is located or used in the Philippines, instruments and securities issued by the government of any of its instrumentalities, deposit substitute debt instruments, <u>certificates or other evidences of deposits that are either drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit taking into consideration the size of the deposit and the risks involved or drawing interest and having a specific maturity date</u>, orders for payment of any sum of money otherwise than at sight or on demand, promissory notes, whether negotiable or non-negotiable, except bank notes issued for circulation."  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioner asserts that the amendment of Section 180 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 only shows ostensibly that the old Section 180 was not applicable to special savings deposit, which by then cannot be slapped with the imposition of documentary stamp tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Simply put, at the time material to this case, when R.A. No. 9243 was yet to be enacted, petitioner contends there was no law that clearly subjected its special savings deposits to documentary stamp tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br> This Court does not agree. In <i>International, </i>the Court held that the further amendment was intended to eliminate the scheme used by banks of issuing passbooks to "cloak" its time deposits as regular savings deposits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> More importantly, the Court held that the amendment to include "<i>other evidences of deposits that are drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit</i>" was merely intended to eliminate the ambiguity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as reflected in the exchanges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> between Mr. Miguel Andaya of the Bankers Association of the Philippines and Senator Ralph Recto, Senate Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, during the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 2518 which eventually became R.A. No. 9243. Contrary therefore to petitioner's position,  <i>International</i> is categorical in that the said amendment did not signify that time deposits evidenced by a passbook were exempt from documentary stamp tax under Section 180 of the 1997 NIRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> but that it merely served to eliminate the ambiguity in the law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
