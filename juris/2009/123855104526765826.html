This leaves it unnecessary for the Court to still dwell on petitioner's argument that it was not, under its By-Laws, empowered to mortgage its properties to secure the obligation of a third party.  In any event, the Court finds well-taken the appellate court's following disposition of such argument:<br><blockquote>We do agree that the Petitioner, under its <b><u>"By-Laws,"</u></b> is not empowered to mortgage its properties as a security for the payment of the obligations of third parties. This is on the general premise that the properties of a corporation are regarded as held in trust for the payment of corporate creditors and not for the creditors of third parties.  However, the Petitioner is not proscribed from mortgaging its properties as security for the payment of obligations of third parties.  In an opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, dated April 15, 1987, it declared that a private corporation, by way of exceptions, may give a third party mortgage:<br><blockquote>"1. When the mortgage of corporate assets/properties shall be done in the furtherance of the interest of the corporation and in the usual and regular course of its business; and<br><br>2.  To secure the debt of a subsidiary."<br></blockquote>While admittedly, the <b><u>"Opinion"</u></b> of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission may not be conclusive on the Respondent Court, however, admittedly the same is of persuasive effect.<br><br>In the present recourse, the Respondent Court found that not only is Prime Aggregates a subsidiary of the Petitioenr <b><u>but that the Petitioner appeared to be a "family" corporation</u></b>:<br><blockquote>"a. <u>The plaintiff appears to be a family corporation</u>.  The incorporators and stockholders and the membership of the board of directors are Zosa family. x x x<br><br>b. Francis and Rolando Zosa are directors of [Prime Aggregates] and of plaintiff corporation x x x<br><br>c. The REM was executed by Amparo Zosa who was the treasurer of plaintiff and Manuel Zosa, the General Manager, both are directors/stockholders of the plaintiff.  Amparo Zosa is the biggest stockholder and is the mother of practically all the other stockholders of plaintiff.  Manuel Zosa, Jr. is the General Manager and a son of Amparo.<br><br>d.  The Corporate Secretary of plaintiff and [Prime Aggregates] are members of the Zosa family.  The Corporate Secretary of [Prime Aggregates] is also the daughter of Francis Zosa, president of plaintiff.<br><br>e. The President of plaintiff corporation, Francis Zosa and the president of [Prime Aggregates], Rolando Zosa, are brothers (aside from being common directors of both corporations.)<br></blockquote>We agree with the Respondent Court.<br><br>The Petitioner's shrill incantations that the <b><u>"Resolution",</u> </b>approved by its Board of Directors, authorizing its Treasurer and General Manager to execute a <b><u>"Real Estate Mortgage"</u></b> as security for the payment of the account of Prime Aggregates, a sister corporation, is not for its best interest, is a "puzzlement" xxx.  Since when is a private corporation, going to the aid of a sister corporation, not for the best interest of both corporation?  For in doing so, the two (2) corporations are enhancing, boosting and promoting a common interest, the interest of "<b><u>family</u></b>" having ownership of both corporations.  In the second place, Courts are loathe to overturn decisions of the management of a corporation in the conduct of its business via its Board of Directors x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>There is no evidence on record that the "<b><u>Real Estate Mortgage</u></b>" was executed by the Petitioner and the Private Respondent to prejudice corporate creditors of the Petitioner or will result in the infringement of the trust fund doctrine or hamper the continuous business operation of the Petitioner or that the Prime Aggregates was insolvent or incapable of paying the Private Respondent.  Indeed, the latter approved Prime Aggregates' loan availments and credit facilities after its investigation of the financial capability of Prime Aggregates and its capacity to pay its account to the Private respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>[U]nder the "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>" of the Board of Directors, it authorized its Treasurer and General Manager to execute a "<b><u>Real Estate Mortgage</u></b>" over its properties as security for the "<b><u>term loan and credit facility</u></b>" of Prime Aggregates.  The maximum amounts of such term loan and credit facility were not fixed in the "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>".  The term "credit facility" is a broad term in credit business transactions to denote loans, pledges, mortgages, trust receipt transactions and credit agreements.  And then, again, such term loan and/or credit facility may be granted, by the Private Respondent, in favor of Prime Aggregates, in trenches or in staggered basis, each disbursement evidenced by separate agreements depending upon the needs of Prime Aggregates for the establishment of its sand and gravel plant and port facilities and the purchase of equipments and machinery for said project.  Hence, the "<b><u>Long Term Agreements</u></b>" and "<b><u>Credit Agreements</u></b>" executed by Prime Aggregates and the Private Respondent, with the Petitioner's properties, as collateral therefore, were envisaged in the terms "term loan and credit facility" in the "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>" of the Board of Directors of the Petitioner.<br><br>The intention of the Members of the Board of Directors of the Petitioner, in approving the "<b><u>Resolution</u>,</b>" may be ascertained xxx also from the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the Petitioner, the Private Respondent and Prime Aggregates.  Given the factual milieu in the present recourse, as found and declared by the Respondent Court, there can be no equivocation that, indeed the Petitioner conformed to and ratified, and hence, is bound by the execution, by its Treasurer and General Manager, of the "<b><u>Real Estate Mortgage</u></b>" in favor of the Private respondent, with its properties used as securities for the payment of the credit and loan availments of Prime Aggregates from the Private Respondent on the basis of the "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>" approved by its Board of Directors. As our Supreme Court declared, ratification and/or approval by the corporation of the acts of its agents/officers may be ascertained through x x x <u>the acquiescence in his acts of a particular nature, with actual or constructive thereof, whether within or beyond the scope of his ordinary powers.</u><br><br>As it was, the Petitioner finally awoke from its slumber when the Private Respondent filed its "<b><u>Petition</u></b>" for the extra-judicial foreclosure of the "<b><u>Real Estate Mortgage</u></b>", with the Sheriff, and assailed the authority of its Board of Directors to approve the said "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>" and of its Treasurer and General Manager to execute the deed and brand the said "<b><u>Resolution</u></b>" and the said deed as "<b><i><u>ultra vires</u></i></b>" and hence, not binding on the Petitioner, and hurried off to the Respondent Court and prayed for injunctive relief. Before then, the Petitioner maintained a stoic silence and adopted a "hands off" stance.  We find the Petitioner's stance grossly inequitable. We must take heed and pay obeisance to the equity rule that if one maintains silence when, in conscience he ought to speak, equity will debar him from speaking when, in conscience, he ought to remain silent.  He who remains silent when he ought to speak cannot be heard to speak when he ought to be silent.  More, the transactions between the Petitioner and the Private Respondent over its properties are neither <b><i><u>malum in se</u></i></b> or <b><i><u>malum prohibitum.</u></i></b>  Hence, the Petitioner cannot hide behind the cloak of "<b><i><u>ultra vires</u></i></b>" for a defense.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The plea of "<b><i><u>ultra vires</u></i></b>" will not be allowed to prevail, whether interposed for or against a corporation, when it will not advance justice but, on the contrary, will accomplish a legal wrong to the prejudice of another who acted in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Underscoring and emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, Tinga, Velasco, Jr.</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit "B," records, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit "3," id. at  103-105.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit "C," id. at 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, pp. 105-159.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibit "62," <i>rollo, </i>p. 255.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Exhibit "A," id. at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 1-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 348-357.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 361-374.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 378-385.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 425-435.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 418-421.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, pp. 2-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Records, pp. 505-510.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Penned by then-Court of Appeals Associate Justice Romeo J.
