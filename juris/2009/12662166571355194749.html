				<H3>PURISIMO BUYCO, PETITIONER, VS. NELSON BARAQUIA, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Nelson Baraquia (respondent) filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against Dominico Buyco and Clemente Buyco (Buycos), <i>for the establishment of a permanent right of way, injunction and damages</i> with preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order, to enjoin the Buycos from closing off a private road within their property which he has been using to go to and from the public highway to access his poultry farm.<br><br>The Buycos died during the pendency of the case, and were substituted by Purisimo Buyco (petitioner) and his brother Gonzalo.<br><br>Branch 39 of the Iloilo RTC granted respondent's application for preliminary injunction.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of February 14, 2007, the trial court dismissed respondent's complaint for failure to establish the concurrence of the essential requisites for the establishment of an easement of right of way under Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  It accordingly lifted the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Respondent filed a notice of appeal of the trial court's decision.  Petitioner filed too a notice of partial appeal bearing on to the non-award of prayer for damages.<br><br>Respondent later filed with the trial court a motion to cite petitioner and his brother Gonzalo in contempt, alleging that they had closed off the subject road, thus violating the writ of preliminary injunction. The trial court, by Resolution of March 13, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> noting that respondent received on March 5, 2007 his copy of its decision while petitioner received his on February 21, 2007, held that the February 14, 2007 decision had not yet become final and executory, hence, the writ of preliminary injunction remained to be valid, efficacious and obligatory, rendering petitioner's act of closing the road on March 1, 2007 an indirect contempt of court.  It thus declared petitioner and his brother in contempt of court.<br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the trial court's March 13, 2007 Resolution, contending that a preliminary injunction, once quashed, ceases to exist, and that he and his brother cannot be held guilty of indirect contempt by mere motion.<br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of April 18, 2007, the trial court  <u>set aside</u> the March 13, 2007 Resolution and <u>granted</u> petitioner's motion for reconsideration, ruling that petitioner and his brother cannot be held in contempt of court by mere motion and not by verified petition.<br><br>On the lifetime of the writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court held that it is its "illumined opinion that the matter of whether a writ of preliminary injunction remains valid until the decision annulling the same attains finality is <b>not firmly entrenched in jurisprudence</b>, contrary to the position of the defendants." It thereupon quoted a portion of the ruling in the 2006 case of <i>Lee v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Furthermore, notwithstanding the stand of both parties, the fact remains that the Decision of the Court of Appeals annulling the grant of preliminary injunction in favor of petitioners has not yet become final on 14 December 2000.  In fact, such Decision has not yet become final and executory even on the very date of this Decision, in view of petitioners' appeal with us under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.  <u>The preliminary injunction, therefore, issued by the trial court remains valid until the Decision of the Court of Appeals annulling the same attains finality, and violation thereof constitutes indirect contempt which, however, requires either a formal charge or a verified petition</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (underscoring in the original decision)</blockquote><br>Hence, this petition for review, raising a question of law - whether  the lifting of a writ of preliminary injunction due to the dismissal of the complaint is immediately executory, even if the dismissal of the complaint is pending appeal.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>A writ of preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  It is merely a provisional remedy, adjunct to the main case subject to the latter's outcome.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  It is not a cause of action in itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  Being an ancillary or auxiliary remedy, it is available during the pendency of the action which may be resorted to by a litigant to preserve and protect certain rights and interests therein pending rendition, and for purposes of the ultimate effects, of a final judgment in the case.<br><br>The writ is provisional because it constitutes a temporary measure availed of during the pendency of the action and it is ancillary because it is a mere incident in and is dependent upon the result of the main action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>It is well-settled that the sole object of a preliminary injunction, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is <b>to preserve the <i>status quo</i> </b><b><u>until the merits of the case can be heard</u></b>.  It is usually granted when it is made to appear that there is a substantial controversy between the parties and one of them is committing an act or threatening the immediate commission of an act that will cause irreparable injury or destroy the <i>status quo</i> of the controversy <b>before a full hearing can be had on the merits of the case</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Indubitably, in the case at bar, the writ of preliminary injunction was granted by the lower court upon respondent's showing that he and his poultry business would be injured by the closure of the subject road. After trial, however, the lower court found that respondent was not entitled to the easement of right of way prayed for, having failed to prove the essential requisites for such entitlement, hence, the writ was lifted.<br><br>The present case having been heard and found dismissible as it was in fact dismissed, the writ of preliminary injunction is deemed lifted, its purpose as a <i>provisional</i> remedy having been served, the appeal therefrom notwithstanding.<br><br><i>Unionbank v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> enlightens:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x <b>a dismissal, </b>discontinuance or non-suit of an action<b> in which a restraining order or temporary injunction has been granted <u>operates as a dissolution of the restraining order or temporary injunction</u>," regardless of whether the period for filing a motion for reconsideration of the order dismissing the case or appeal therefrom has expired</b>. The rationale therefor is that<b> even in cases where an appeal is taken from a judgment dismissing an action on the merits, <u>the appeal does not suspend the judgment, hence the general rule applies that a temporary injunction terminates automatically on the <i>dismissal </i>of the action</u></b>." (italics, emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The lower court's citation of <i>Lee v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> is misplaced.  In <i>Lee, </i>unlike in the present case, the original complaint for specific performance and cancellation of real estate mortgage was <u>not yet decided on the merits</u> by the lower court.  Thus, the preliminary injunction therein issued subsisted pending appeal of an incident.<br><br>There being no indication that the appellate court issued an injunction in respondent's favor, the writ of preliminary injunction issued on December 1, 1999 by the trial court was automatically dissolved upon the dismissal of Civil Case No. 26015.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Resolution dated April 18, 2007 of the trial court is <b>REVERSED</b>.  The writ of preliminary injunction which Branch 39 of the Iloilo Regional Trial Court issued on December 1, 1999 was automatically dissolved upon its dismissal by Decision of February 14, 2007 of Civil Case No. 26015.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson),  Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Annex "D" of Petition;  <i>rollo</i>, pp. 45- 49.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Records, pp. 411-419.
