				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On April 1, 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> at around 12:00 noon, the JC Liner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> driven by petitioner Sonny Romero and the Apego Taxi<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> driven by Jimmy Padua figured in a head-on collision along Governor Jose Fuentebella Highway at Barangay Hibago, Ocampo, Camarines Sur. The bus was bound for Naga City while the taxi was going in the opposite direction of Partido Area.  The collision resulted in the death of Gerardo Breis, Sr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Arnaldo Breis,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Gerardo Breis, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rene Montes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Erwin Breis<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and Jimmy Padua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Luckily, Edwin Breis and his son Edmund Breis survived although they sustained serious injuries.<br><br>As a consequence, petitioner was charged with the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and multiple serious physical injuries with damage to property in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Ocampo, Camarines Sur.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the MTC acquitted petitioner of the crime charged in a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated November 9, 2000. Petitioner was, however, held civilly liable and was ordered to pay the heirs of the victims the total amount of P3,541,900 by way of actual damages, civil indemnity for death, moral damages, temperate damages and loss of earning capacity.<br><br>Petitioner appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pili, Camarines Sur, claiming that the MTC erred in holding him civilly liable in view of his acquittal. On July 17, 2001, the RTC affirmed the MTC judgment <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Refusing to give up, petitioner appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the Court of Appeals (CA). On March 3, 2005, the CA rendered the assailed decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> affirming the RTC.<br><br>Left with no other recourse, petitioner now argues<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that his acquittal should have freed him from payment of civil liability. He also claims that he should be totally exonerated from any liability because it was Gerardo Breis, Sr., not the regular driver, Jimmy Padua, who was actually driving the taxi at the time of the accident, which was clearly in violation of insurance and transportation laws.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>The rule is that every person criminally liable is also civilly liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Criminal liability will give rise to civil liability only if the felonious act or omission results in damage or injury to another and is the direct and proximate cause thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Every crime gives rise to (1) a criminal action for the punishment of the guilty party and (2) a civil action for the restitution of the thing, repair of the damage, and indemnification for the losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>However, the reverse is not always true. In this connection, the relevant portions of Section 2, Rule 111 and Section 2, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>When separate civil action is suspended</i>.--xxx<br><br>The <b>extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil action</b>. However, <b>the civil action based on delict shall be deemed extinguished if there is a finding in a final judgment in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist</b>. (emphasis supplied)<br><br>Sec. 2. <i>Contents of the judgment</i>.--xxx<br><br><b>In case the judgment is of acquittal, it shall state whether the evidence of the prosecution</b> absolutely failed to prove the guilt of the accused or merely <b>failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. </b>In either case,<b> the judgment shall determine if the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist</b>. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, the rule is that the acquittal of an accused of the crime charged will not necessarily extinguish his civil liability, unless the court declares in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil liability might arise did not exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Courts can acquit an accused on reasonable doubt but still order payment of civil damages in the same case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  It is not even necessary that a separate civil action be instituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In this case, the MTC held that it could not ascertain with moral certainty the wanton and reckless manner by which petitioner drove the bus in view of the condition of the highway where the accident occurred and the short distance between the bus and the taxi before the collision. However, it categorically stated that while petitioner may be acquitted based on reasonable doubt, he may nonetheless be held civilly liable. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The RTC added that there was <i>no</i> finding by the MTC that the act from which petitioner's civil liability may arise did not exist. Therefore, the MTC was correct in holding petitioner civilly liable to the heirs of the victims of the collision for the tragedy, mental anguish and trauma they suffered plus expenses they incurred during the wake and interment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In view of the pronouncements of the MTC and the RTC, we agree with the conclusion of the CA that petitioner was acquitted not because he did not commit the crime charged but because the RTC and the MTC could not ascertain with moral conviction the wanton and reckless manner by which petitioner drove the bus at the time of the accident. Put differently, petitioner was acquitted because the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. However, his civil liability for the death, injuries and damages arising from the collision is another matter.<br><br>While petitioner was absolved from criminal liability because his negligence was not proven beyond reasonable doubt, he can still be held civilly liable if his negligence was established by preponderance of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In other words, the failure of the evidence to prove negligence with moral certainty does not negate (and is in fact compatible with) a ruling that there was preponderant evidence of such negligence. And that is sufficient to hold him civilly liable.<br><br>Thus, the MTC (as affirmed by the RTC and the CA) correctly imposed civil liability on petitioner despite his acquittal. Simple logic also dictates that petitioner would not have been held civilly liable if his<b> </b>act from which the civil liability had arisen did not in fact exist.<br><br>Anent the second issue, it would be well to remind petitioner of the time-honored doctrine that this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The rule finds greater relevance in this case because the MTC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> uniformly held that it was Jimmy Padua, and not Gerardo Breis, Sr., who was driving the taxi at the time of the accident.<br><br>There are of course instances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> when this Court can embark on a re-examination of the evidence adduced by the parties during trial. Sad to say, none of those instances is present here.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED. </b><br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Carpio, Leonardo-De Castro</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bersamin, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The surnames of respondents Regina Breis and Ofelia Belando Breis were erroneously stated as "Bries" in the caption of the petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Erroneously indicated as April 21, 1999 by the Court of Appeals.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> With Plate No. EAW-533 and Body No. 1019.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> With Plate No. PVZ-345.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 36 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 13 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 9 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 14 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 7 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 41 years old.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Penned by Judge Manuel E.

Underlying the principle that every person criminally liable is also civilly liable is the view that from the standpoint of its effects, a crime has dual character: (1) as an offense against the State because of the disturbance of the social order; and (2) as an offense against the private person injured by the crime unless it involves the crime of treason, rebellion, espionage, contempt and others where no civil liability arises on the part of the offender either because there are no damages to be compensated or there is no private person injured by the crime. <i>Occena v. Icamina</i>, G.R. No. 82146, 22 January 1990, 181 SCRA 328, 333, citing H. Jarencio, Torts and Damages, 1983 ed., p. 237. In the ultimate analysis, what gives rise to the civil liability is really the obligation of everyone to repair or to make whole the damage caused by another by reason of his act or omission, whether done intentionally or negligently and whether or not punishable by law.

"There appear to be no sound reasons to require a separate civil action to still be filed considering that the facts to be proved in the civil case have already been established in the criminal proceedings where the accused was acquitted. xxx To require a civil action simply because the accused was acquitted would mean clogging of court dockets and unnecessary duplication of litigation with all its attendant loss of time, effort, and money on the part of all concerned." <i>See</i> also <i>People v.

However, the Court had recognized several exceptions to this rule, to wit: (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant  facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. <i>Sampayan</i> <i>v.
