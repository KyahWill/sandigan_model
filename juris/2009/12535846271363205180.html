				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a democratic system of government, the people's voice is sovereign. Corollarily, choosing through the ballots the men and women who are to govern the country is perhaps the highest exercise of democracy.  It is thus the interest of the state to insure honest, credible and peaceful elections, where the sanctity of the votes and the secrecy of the ballots are safeguarded, where the will of the electorate is not frustrated or undermined. For when the popular will itself is subverted by election irregularities, then the insidious seeds of doubt are sown and the ideal of a peaceful and smooth transition of power is placed in jeopardy. To automate, thus breaking away from a manual system of election, has been viewed as a significant step towards clean and credible elections, unfettered by the travails of the long wait and cheating that have marked many of our electoral exercises.<br><br>The Commission on Elections (Comelec), private respondents, the National Computer Center and other computer wizards are confident that nationwide automated elections can be successfully implemented. Petitioners and some skeptics in the information technology (IT) industry have, however, their reservations, which is quite understandable. To them, the automated election system and the untested technology Comelec has chosen and set in motion are pregnant with risks and could lead to a disastrous failure of elections. Comelec, they allege, would not be up to the challenge. Cheating on a massive scale, but this time facilitated by a machine, is perceived to be a real possibility.<br><br>In this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and mandamus with prayer for a restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, petitioners H. Harry L. Roque, Jr., <i>et al</i>., suing as taxpayers and concerned citizens, seek to nullify respondent Comelec's award of the 2010 Elections Automation Project (automation project) to the joint venture of Total Information Management Corporation (TIM) and Smartmatic International Corporation (Smartmatic)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and to permanently prohibit the Comelec, TIM and Smartmatic from signing and/or implementing the corresponding contract-award.<br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of July 14, 2009, the Court directed the respondents as well as the University of the Philippines (UP) Computer Center, National Computer Center (NCC) and Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines (Infotech, hereinafter) to submit their collective or separate comments to the petition on or before July 24, 2009.  Before any of the comments could actually be filed, Atty. Pete Quirino-Quadra sought leave to intervene. In another resolution, the Court allowed the intervention and admitted the corresponding petition-in-intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On July 29, 2009, the Court heard the principal parties in oral arguments which was followed by the submission of their and the resource persons' instructive, albeit clashing, memoranda. The Senate, through the Senate President, would later join the fray <i>via</i> a Motion for Leave to Intervene. In a Resolution of August 25, 2009, the Court admitted the Senate's comment-in-intervention.<br><br>From the petition, the separate comments thereon, with their respective annexes, and other pleadings, as well as from admissions during the oral arguments, the Court gathers the following facts:<br><br>On December 22, 1997, Congress enacted Republic Act No. (RA) 8436 authorizing the adoption of an automated election system (<b>AES</b>) in the May 11, 1998 national and local elections and onwards. The 1998, 2001, and 2004 national and local polls, however, came and went but purely manual elections were still the order of the day. On January 23, 2007, the amendatory RA 9369<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was passed authorizing anew the Comelec to use an AES. Of particular relevance are Sections 6 and 10 of RA 9369--originally Secs. 5 and 8, respectively of RA 8436, as amended--each defining Comelec's specific mandates insofar as automated elections are concerned. The AES was not utilized in the May 10, 2000 elections, as funds were not appropriated for that purpose by Congress and due to time constraints.<br><br>RA 9369 calls for the creation of the Comelec Advisory Council<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (CAC). CAC is to recommend, among other functions, the most appropriate, applicable and cost-effective technology to be applied to the AES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> To be created by Comelec too is the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which is tasked to certify, through an established international certification committee, not later than three months before the elections, by categorically stating that the AES, inclusive of its hardware and software components, is operating properly and accurately based on defined and documented standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In August 2008, Comelec managed to automate the regional polls in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (ARMM), using direct recording electronics (DRE) technology<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in the province of Maguindanao; and the optical mark reader/recording (OMR) system, particularly the Central Count Optical Scan (CCOS),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in the rest of ARMM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> What scores hailed as successful automated ARMM 2008 elections paved the way for Comelec, with some prodding from senators,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to prepare for a nationwide computerized run for the 2010 national/local polls, with the many lessons learned from the ARMM experience influencing, according to the NCC, the technology selection for the 2010 automated elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, in early March 2009, the Comelec released the <i>Request for Proposal</i> (<b>RFP),</b> also known as <i>Terms of Reference</i> (TOR), for the nationwide automation of the voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes for the May 10, 2010 Synchronized National and Local Elections. What is referred to also in the RFP and other contract documents as the 2010 Elections Automation Project (Automation Project) consists of three elaborate components, as follows:<br><br><b>    Component 1</b>: Paper-Based AES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 1-A. Election Management System (EMS); 1-B Precinct-Count Optic Scan <b>(PCOS)</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> System and 1-C. Consolidation/Canvassing System (CCS);<br><br><b>Component 2:</b> Provision for Electronic Transmission of Election Results using Public Telecommunications Network; and<br><br><b>Component 3: </b>Overall Project Management <br><br>And obviously to address the possibility of systems failure, the RFP required interested bidders to submit, among other things<i>:</i>  a continuity plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and a back-up plan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Under the two-envelope system designed under the RFP,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> each participating bidder shall submit, as part of its bid, an <i>Eligibility Envelope</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> that should <i>inter alia</i> establish the bidder's eligibility to bid. On the other hand, the second envelope, or the <i>Bid Envelope</i> itself, shall contain two envelopes that, in turn, shall contain the technical proposal and the financial proposal, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Comelec Special Bids and Awards Committee (SBAC), earlier constituted purposely for the aforesaid project, caused the publication in different newspapers of the <i>Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for the procurement of goods and services to be used in the automation project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  Meanwhile, Congress enacted RA 9525 appropriating some PhP 11.3 billion as supplemental budget for the May 10, 2010 automated national and local elections.<br><br>Of the ten (10) invitation-responding consortia which obtained the bid documents, only seven (7) submitted sealed applications for eligibility and bids<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which, per Bid Bulletin No. 24, were to be opened on a pre-set date, following the convening of the pre-bid conference. Under the RFP, among those eligible to participate in the bidding are manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture. A <i>joint venture</i> is defined <i>as a group of two or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or liable for a particular contract</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Among the submitted bids was that of the joint venture (JV) of TIM and Smartmatic, the former incorporated under the Corporation Code of the Philippines. Smartmatic, on the other hand, was organized under the laws of Barbados.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> For a stated amount, said JV proposed to undertake the whole automation project, inclusive of the delivery of 82,200 PCOS machines. After the conclusion of the eligibility evaluation process, only three consortia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> were found and thus declared as eligible. Further on, following the opening of the passing bidders' <i>Bid Envelope</i> and evaluating the technical and financial proposals therein contained, the SBAC, per its Res. No. 09-001, s.-2009, declared the above-stated bid of the JV of TIM-Smartmatic as the <i>single complying calculated bid</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  As required by the RFP, the bid envelope contained an outline of the joint venture's back-up and continuity or contingency plans,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in case of a systems breakdown or any such eventuality which shall result in the delay, obstruction or nonperformance of the electoral process.<br><br>After declaring TIM-Smartmatic as the best complying bidder, the SBAC then directed the joint venture to undertake post-qualification screening, and its PCOS prototype machines--the Smarmatic Auditable Electronic System (<b>SAES</b>) 1800--to undergo end-to-end<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> testing to determine compliance with the pre-set criteria.<br><br>In its Memorandum of June 01, 2009, on the Subject: <i>Systems Evaluation Consolidated Report and Status Report on the Post-Qualification Evaluation Procedures</i>, the SBAC Technical Working Group (TWG) stated that it was undertaking a 4-day (May 27 to May 30, 2009) test evaluation of TIM and Smartmatic's proposed PCOS project machines. Its conclusion: "The demo systems presented <b>PASSED</b> all tests as required in the 26-item criteria specified in the [RFP]" with 100% accuracy rating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The TWG also validated the eligibility, and technical and financial qualifications of the TIM-Smartmatic joint venture.<br><br>On June 9, 2009, Comelec, upon the recommendation of its SBAC, the CAC and other stakeholders, issued Resolution No. (Res.) 8608<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> authorizing the SBAC to issue, subject to well-defined conditions, the notice of award and notice to proceed in favor of the winning joint venture.<br><br>Soon after, TIM wrote Comelec expressing its desire to quit the JV partnership.  In time, however, the parties were able to patch up what TIM earlier described as irreconcilable differences between partners.<br><br>What followed was that TIM and Smartmatic, pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> caused the incorporation of a joint venture corporation (JVC) that would enter into a contract with the Comelec. On July 8, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a certificate of incorporation in favor of Smartmatic TIM Corporation. Two days after, or on July 10, 2009, Comelec and Smartmatic TIM Corporation, as provider, executed a contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> for the lease of goods and services under the contract for the contract amount of PhP 7,191,484,739.48, payable as the "Goods and Services are delivered and/or progress is made in accordance [with pre-set] Schedule of Payments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> On the same date, a <i>Notice to Proceed</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> was sent to, and received by, Smartmatic TIM Corporation.<br><br>Meanwhile, or on July 9, 2009, petitioners interposed the instant recourse which, for all intents and purposes, impugns the validity and seeks to nullify the July 10, 2009 Comelec-Smartmatic-TIM Corporation automation contract adverted to. Among others, petitioners pray that respondents be permanently enjoined from implementing the automation project on the submission that:<br><br><blockquote> PUBLIC RESPONDENTS COMELEC AND COMELEC-SBAC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN AWARDING THE 2010 ELECTIONS AUTOMATION PROJECT TO PRIVATE RESPONDENTS TIM AND SMARTMATIC FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:<br><br><blockquote>x x x COMELEC DID NOT CONDUCT ANY PILOT TESTING OF THE x x x PCOS MACHINES OFFERED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENTS SMARTMATIC AND TIM, IN VIOLATION OF [RA] 8436 (AS AMENDED BY [RA] 9369)<br><br>THE [PCOS] MACHINES [THUS] OFFERED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENTS x x x DO NOT SATISFY THE <i>MINIMUM SYSTEM CAPABILITIES</i> SET BY [RA] NO. 8436 (AS AMENDED BY [RA] 9369).<br><br>PRIVATE RESPONDENTS x x x DID NOT SUBMIT THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS DURING THE BIDDING PROCESS THAT SHOULD ESTABLISH THE DUE EXISTENCE, COMPOSITION, AND SCOPE OF THEIR JOINT VENTURE, IN VIOLATION OF THE SUPREME COURT'S HOLDING IN <i>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATION OF THE PHILIPPINES, vs. COMELEC (G.R.

Hence, it may be relaxed, as the Court has often relaxed the rule for non-traditional plaintiffs, like ordinary citizens and taxpayers, when the public interest so requires, such as when the matter is of transcendental importance, of overarching significance to society, or of paramount public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  As we wrote in <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> where issues of public importance are presented, there is no necessity to show that the suitor has experienced or is in actual danger of suffering direct and personal injury as the requisite injury is assumed.<br><br>Petitioners' counsel, when queried, hedged on what specific constitutional proscriptions or concepts had been infringed by the award of the subject automation project to Smartmatic TIM Corporation, although he was heard to say that "<i>our objection to the system is anchored on the Constitution itself a violation </i>[sic]<i> of secrecy of voting and the sanctity of the ballot</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  Petitioners also depicted the covering automation contract as constituting an abdication by the Comelec of its election-related mandate under the Constitution, which is to enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections. Worse still, according to the petitioners, the abdication, with its anti-dummy dimension, is in favor of a foreign corporation that will be providing the hardware and software requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> And when pressed further, petitioners came out with the observation that, owing in part to the sheer length of the ballot, the PCOS would not comply with Art. V, Sec. 2 of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> prescribing secrecy of voting and sanctity of the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>There is no doubt in our mind, however, about the compelling significance and the transcending public importance of the one issue underpinning this petition: the success--and the far-reaching grim implications of the failure--of the nationwide automation project that will be implemented <i>via</i> the challenged automation contract.<br><br>The doctrinal formulation may vary, but the bottom line is that the Court may except a particular case from the operations of its rules when the demands of justice so require.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Put a bit differently, rules of procedure are merely tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Accordingly, technicalities and procedural barriers should not be allowed to stand in the way, if the ends of justice would not be subserved by a rigid adherence to the rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  This postulate on procedural technicalities applies to matters of <i>locus standi</i> and the presently invoked principle of hierarchy of courts, which discourages direct resort to the Court if the desired redress is within the competence of lower courts to grant. The policy on the hierarchy of courts, which petitioners indeed failed to observe, is not an iron-clad rule. For indeed the Court has full discretionary power to take cognizance and assume jurisdiction of special civil actions for <i>certiorari</i> and mandamus filed directly with it for exceptionally compelling reasons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> or if warranted by the nature of the issues clearly and specifically raised in the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The exceptions that justify a deviation from the policy on hierarchy appear to obtain under the premises. The Court will for the nonce thus turn a blind eye to the judicial structure intended, first and foremost, to provide an orderly dispensation of justice.<br><br><b>Hierarchy of Courts</b><br><br>At this stage, we shall dispose of another peripheral issue before plunging into the core substantive issues tendered in this petition.<br><br>Respondents contend that petitioners should have availed themselves of the otherwise mandatory protest mechanism set forth in Sections 55 and 58 of the procurement law (RA 9184) and the counterpart provisions found in its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR)-A before seeking judicial remedy.  Insofar as relevant, Sec. 55 of RA 9184 provides that decisions of the bids and awards committee (BAC) in all stages of procurement may be protested, via a "<i>verified position paper</i>," to the head of the procuring agency. On the other hand, the succeeding Sec. 58 states that court action may be resorted to only after the protest contemplated in Sec. 55 shall have been completed. Petitioners except. As argued, the requirement to comply with the protest mechanism, contrary to what may have been suggested in <i>Infotech</i>, is imposed on the bidders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' position is correct. As a matter of common sense, only a  bidder is entitled to receive a notice of the protested BAC action. Only a losing bidder would be aggrieved by, and <i>ergo</i> would have the personality to challenge, such action. This conclusion finds adequate support from the ensuing provisions of the aforesaid IRR-A:<br><br><blockquote>55.2. The verified position paper shall contain the following documents:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) The name of bidder;<br>b) The office address of the bidder x x x.<br></div></blockquote><br><center><b>SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES</b></center><br><br>We now turn to the central issues tendered in the petition which, in terms of subject matter, revolved around two concerns, viz: (1) the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) of Smartmatic and TIM; and (2) the PCOS machines to be used. Petitioners veritably introduced another issue during the oral arguments, as amplified in their memorandum, <i>i.e</i>. the constitutionality and statutory flaw of the automation contract itself.  The petition-in-intervention confined itself to certain features of the PCOS machines.<br><br><b>The Joint Venture Agreement: Its Existence and Submission </b><br><br>The issue respecting the existence and submission of the TIM-Smartmatic JVA does not require an extended disquisition, as repairing to the records would readily provide a satisfactory answer. We note in fact that the petitioners do not appear to be earnestly pressing the said issue anymore, as demonstrated by their counsel's practically cavalier discussion thereof during the oral argument. When reminded, for instance, of private respondents' insistence on having in fact submitted their JVA dated April 23, 2009, petitioners' counsel responded as follows: "<i>We knew your honor that there was, in fact, a joint venture agreement filed. However, because of the belated discovery that [there] were irreconcilable differences, we then made</i> <i>a view that this joint venture agreement was a sham, at best pro forma because it did not contain all the required stipulations in order to evidence unity of interest </i>x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the records belie petitioners' initial posture that TIM and Smartmatic, as joint venture partners, did not include in their submitted eligibility envelope a copy of their JVA. The SBAC's <i>Post Qualification Evaluation Report (Eligibility) </i>on TIM-Smartmatic, on page 10, shows the following entry: "<i>Valid Joint Venture Agreement, stating among things, that the members are jointly and severally liable for the whole obligation, in case of joint venture - Documents verified compliance</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Contrary to what the petitioners posit, the duly notarized JVA, as couched, explained the nature and the limited purpose<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the joint venture and expressly defined, among other things, the composition, scope, and the 60-40 capital structure of the aggroupment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The JVA also contains provisions on the management<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and division of profits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Article 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the JVA delineates the respective participations and responsibilities of the joint venture partners in the automation project.<br><br>Given the foregoing perspective, the Court is at a loss to understand how petitioners can assert that the Smartmatic-TIM consortium has failed to prove its joint venture existence and/or to submit evidence as would enable the Comelec to know such items as who it is dealing with, which between the partners has control over the decision-making process, the amount of investment to be contributed by each partner, the parties' shares in the profits and like details. Had petitioners only bothered to undertake the usual due diligence that comes with good judgment and examined the eligibility envelope of the Smartmatic-TIM joint venture, they would have discovered that their challenge to and arguments against the joint venture and its JVA have really no factual basis.<br><br>It may be, as petitioners observed, that the TIM-Smartmatic joint venture remained an unincorporated aggroupment during the bid-opening and evaluation stages. It ought to be stressed, however, that the fact of non-incorporation was without a vitiating effect on the validity of the tender offers. For the bidding ground rules, as spelled out primarily in the RFP and the clarificatory bid bulletins, does not require, for bidding purposes, that there be an incorporation of the bidding joint ventures or consortiums. In fact, Bid Bulletin Nos. 19 and 20 recognize the existence and the acceptability of proposals of unincorporated joint ventures. In response to a poser, for example, regarding the 60% Filipino ownership requirement in a joint venture arrangement, the SBAC, in its Bid Bulletin No. 22, stated: "<i>In an </i><b><i>unincorporated joint venture</i></b><i>, determination of the required Filipino participation may be made by examining the terms and conditions of the  [JVA] and other supporting financial documents submitted by the joint venture</i>." (Emphasis ours.)<i>  </i>Petitioners, to be sure, have not shown that incorporation is part of the pass/fail criteria used in determining eligibility<i>.</i><br><br>Petitioners have made much of the Court's ruling in <i>Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines [Infotech] v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> arguing in relation thereto that the partnership of Smartmatic and TIM does not meet the Court's definition of a <i>joint venture</i> which requires "<i>community of interest in the performance of the subject matter."  </i><br><br>Petitioners' invocation of <i>Infotech</i> is utterly misplaced. Albeit <i>Infotech</i> and this case are both about modernizing the election process and bidding joint ventures, the relevant parallelism ends there. Cast as they are against dissimilar factual milieu, one cannot plausibly set <i>Infotech</i> side with and contextually apply to this case the <i>ratio</i> of <i>Infotech</i>. Suffice it to delve on the most glaring of differences. In <i>Infotech</i>, the winning bid pertained to the consortium of Mega Pacific, a purported joint venture. Extant records, however, do not show the formation of such joint venture, let alone its composition. To borrow from the <i>ponencia </i>of then Justice, later Chief Justice, Artemio Panganiban, "<i>there is no sign whatsoever of any [JVA], consortium agreement [or] memorandum agreement </i>x x x<i> executed among the members of the purported consortium</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> There was in fine no evidence to show that the alleged joint venture partners agreed to constitute themselves into a single entity solidarily responsible for the entirety of the automation contract. Unlike the purported Mega Pacific consortium in <i>Infotech</i>, the existence in this case of the bidding joint venture of Smarmatic and TIM is properly documented and spread all over the bid documents. And to stress, TIM and Smartmatic, in their JVA, unequivocally agreed between themselves to perform their respective undertakings. And over and beyond their commitments to each other, they undertook to incorporate, if called for by the bidding results, a JVC that shall be solidarily liable with them for any actionable breach of the automation contract.<br><br>In <i>Infotech</i>, the Court chastised the Comelec for dealing with an entity, the full identity of which the poll body knew nothing about. Taking a cue from this holding, petitioners tag the TIM-Smartmatic JVA as flawed and as one that would leave the Comelec "hanging" for the non-inclusion, as members of the joint venture, of three IT providers. The three referred to are Jarltech International, Inc. (Jarltech), a subsidiary of Smartmatic that manufactures the Smartmatic voting machines; Dominion Voting Systems (Domino), the inventor of said PCOS machines; and 2GO Transportation System Corporation (2GO), the subcontractor responsible for the distribution of the PCOS machines throughout the country.<br><br>Petitioners' beef against the TIM-Smartmatic JVA is untenable. First off, the Comelec knows the very entities whom they are dealing with, which it can hold solidary liable under the automation contract, should there be contract violation. Secondly, there is no requirement under either RA 8436, as amended, or the RFP, that all the suppliers, manufacturers or distributors involved in the transaction should be part of the joint venture. On the contrary, the Instruction to Bidders--as petitioners themselves admit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>--allows the bidder to subcontract portions of the goods or services under the automation project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>To digress a bit, petitioners have insisted on the non-existence of a <i>bona fide</i> JVA between TIM and Smarmatic. Failing to gain traction for their indefensible posture, they would thrust on the Court the notion of an invalid joint venture due to the non-inclusion of more companies in the existing TIM-Smartmatic joint venture. The irony is not lost on the Court.<br><br>This brings us to the twin technical issues tendered herein bearing on the PCOS machines of Smartmatic.<br><br>At its most basic, the petition ascribes grave abuse of discretion to the Comelec for, among other things, awarding the automation project in violation of RA 8436, as amended. Following their line, no pilot test of the PCOS technology Smartmatic-TIM offered has been undertaken; hence, the Comelec cannot conduct a nationwide automation of the 2010 polls using the machines thus offered. Hence, the contract award to Smartmatic-TIM with their untested PCOS machines violated RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, which mandates that with respect to the May 2010 elections and onwards, the system procured must have been piloted in at least 12 areas referred to in Sec. 6 of RA 8436, as amended.  What is more, petitioners assert, private respondents' PCOS machines do not satisfy the minimum system capabilities set by the same law envisaged to ensure transparent and credible voting, counting and canvassing of votes. And as earlier narrated, petitioners would subsequently add the abdication angle in their bid to nullify the automation contract.<br><br><b>Pilot Testing Not Necessary</b><br><br>Disagreeing, as to be expected, private respondents maintain that there is nothing in the applicable law requiring, as a pre-requisite for the 2010 election automation project award, that the prevailing bidder's automation system, the PCOS in this case, be subjected to pilot testing.  Comelec echoes its co-respondents' stance on pilot testing, with the added observation that nowhere in the statutory provision relied upon are the words "pilot testing" used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The Senate's position and its supporting arguments match those of private respondents.<br><br>The respondents' thesis on pilot testing and the logic holding it together are well taken. There can be no argument about the phrase "pilot test" not being found in the law. But does it necessarily follow that a pilot test is absolutely not contemplated in the law? We repair to the statutory provision petitioners cited as requiring a pilot run, referring to Sec. 6 of RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, reading as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5.<i> Authority to use an Automated Election System</i>.- To carry out the above stated-policy, the [Comelec], x x x is hereby authorized to use an automated election system or systems in the same election in different provinces, whether paper-based or a direct recording electronic election system as it may deem appropriate and practical for the process of voting, counting of votes and canvassing/consolidation and transmittal of results of electoral exercises: <i>Provided</i>, <b>that for the regular national and local elections, which shall be held immediately after the <u>effectivity of this Act</u>, the AES shall be used in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao</b> <b>to be chosen by the [Comelec]</b>: <i>Provided</i>, <i>further</i>, That local government units whose officials have been the subject of administrative charges within sixteen (16) month prior to the May 14, 2007 elections shall not be chosen. <i>Provided, finally</i>, That no area shall be chosen without the consent of the Sanggunian of the local government unit concerned. The term local government unit as used in this provision shall refer to a highly urbanized city or province. In succeeding regular national or local elections, the AES shall be implemented. (Emphasis and underscoring added.)</blockquote><br>RA 9369, which envisages an AES, be it paper-based or direct-recording electronic, took effect in the second week of February 2007 or thereabout.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The "<i>regular national and local elections"</i> referred to after the "<i>effectivity of this Act</i>" can be no other than the May 2007 regular elections, during which time the AES shall, as the law is worded, be used in at least two highly urbanized cities and provinces in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The Court takes judicial notice that the May 2007 elections did not deploy AES, evidently due to the mix of time and funding constraints.<br><br>To the petitioners, the underscored portion of the aforequoted Sec. 6 of RA 8436 is the pilot-testing provision that Comelec failed to observe.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>From the practical viewpoint, the pilot testing of the technology in question in an actual, scheduled electoral exercise under harsh conditions would have been the ideal norm in computerized system implementation. The underscored proviso of Sec. 6 of RA 8436 is not, however, an authority for the proposition that the pilot testing of the PCOS in the 2007 national elections in the areas thus specified is an absolute must for the machines' use in the 2010 national/local elections. The Court can concede that said proviso, with respect to the May 2007 elections, commands the Comelec to automate in at least 12 defined areas of the country. But the bottom line is that the required 2007 automation, be it viewed in the concept of a pilot test or not, is not a mandatory requirement for the choice of system in, or a prerequisite for, the full automation of the May 2010 elections.<br><br>As may be noted, Sec. 6 of RA 8436 may be broken into three essential parts, the first partaking of the nature of a general policy declaration: that Comelec is authorized to automate the entire elections. The second part states that for the regular national and local elections that shall be held in May 2007, Comelec shall use the AES, with an option, however, to undertake automation, regardless of the technology to be selected, in a limited area or, to be more precise, in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao to be chosen by the Comelec. On the other hand, the last part, phrased <i>sans</i> reference to the May 2007 elections, commands thus:  "<i>[I</i><i>]n succeeding regular national or local elections, the [automated election system</i><i>] </i><i>shall be implemented</i>." Taken in its proper context, the last part is indicative of the legislative intent for the May 2010 electoral exercise to be fully automated, regardless of whether or not pilot testing was run in the 2007 polls.<br><br>To argue that pilot testing is a condition precedent to a full automation in 2010 would doubtless undermine the purpose of RA 9369.  For, as aptly observed during the oral arguments, if there was no political exercise in May 2007, the country would theoretically be barred forever from having full automation.<br><br>Sec. 6 of the amended RA 8436, as couched, therefore, unmistakably conveys the idea of unconditional full automation in the 2010 elections. A construal making pilot testing of the AES a prerequisite or condition <i>sine qua non</i> to putting the system in operation in the 2010 elections is tantamount to reading into said section something beyond the clear intention of Congress, as expressed in the provision itself. We reproduce with approval the following excerpts from the comment of the Senate itself:<br><br><blockquote>The plain wordings of RA 9369 (that amended RA 8436) commands that the 2010 elections shall be fully automated, and such full automation is not conditioned on "pilot testing" in the May 2007 elections. Congress merely gave COMELEC the flexibility to partially use the AES in some parts of the country for the May 2007 elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>Lest it be overlooked, an AES is not synonymous to and ought not to be confused with the PCOS. Sec. 2(a) of RA 8436, as amended, defines an AES as "<i>a system using appropriate technology which has been demonstrated in the voting, counting, consolidating, canvassing and transmission of election results, and other electoral processes</i>." On the other hand, PCOS refers to a technology wherein an optical ballot scanner, into which optical scan paper ballots marked by hand by the voter are inserted to be counted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> What may reasonably be deduced from these definitions is that PCOS is merely one of several automated voting, counting or canvassing technologies coming within the term AES, implying in turn that the automated election system or technology that the Comelec shall adopt in future elections need not, as a matter of mandatory arrangement, be piloted in the adverted two highly urbanized cities and provinces.<br><br>In perspective, what may be taken as mandatory prerequisite for the full automation of the 2010 regular national/ local elections is that the system to be procured for that exercise be a technology tested either here or abroad. The ensuing Section 8 of RA 8436, as amended, says so.<br><br><blockquote>SEC 12. <i>Procurement of Equipment and Materials</i>.- To achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is authorized to procure, xxx, by purchase, lease, rent or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities, and other services, from local or foreign sources xxx. <b>With respect to the May 10, 2010</b> <b>elections and succeeding electoral exercises</b>, <b>the system procured must have demonstrated capability and been successfully used in prior electoral exercise here or abroad</b>. <b>Participation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness. </b> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>While the underscored portion makes reference to a "2007 pilot exercise," what it really exacts is that, for the automation of the May 2010 and subsequent elections, the PCOS or any AES to be procured must have demonstrated its capability and success in either a local or a foreign electoral exercise. And as expressly declared by the provision, participation in the 2007 electoral exercise is not a guarantee nor is it conclusive of the system's fitness.  In this regard, the Court is inclined to agree with private respondents' interpretation of the underscored portion in question:  "The provision clearly conveys that the [AES] to be used in the 2010 elections need not have been used in the 2007 elections, and that the demonstration of its capability need not be in a previous Philippine election. Demonstration of the success and capability of the PCOS may be in an electoral exercise in a foreign jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As determined by the Comelec, the PCOS system had been successfully deployed in previous electoral exercises in foreign countries, such as Ontario, Canada; and New York, USA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> albeit Smartmatic was not necessarily the system provider. But then, RA 9369 does not call for the winning bidder of the 2010 automation project and the deploying entity/provider in the foreign electoral exercise to be one and the same entity. Neither does the law incidentally require that the system be first used in an archipelagic country or with a topography or a voting population similar to or approximating that of the Philippines.<br><br>At any event, any lingering doubt on the issue of whether or not full automation of the 2010 regular elections can validly proceed without a pilot run of the AES should be put to rest with the enactment in March 2009 of RA 9525,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in which Congress appropriated PhP 11.301 billion to automate the 2010 elections, subject to compliance with the transparency and accuracy requirements in selecting the relevant technology of the machines, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Use of Funds</i>.- x x x <i>Provided, however</i>, That disbursement of the amounts herein appropriated or any part thereof shall be authorized only in strict compliance with the Constitution, the provisions of [<b>RA] No. 9369</b> and other election laws incorporated in said Act as to ensure the conduct of a free, orderly, clean, honest and credible election and shall adopt such measures that will guaranty transparency and accuracy in the selection of the relevant technology of the machines to be used on May 10, 2010 automated national and local elections. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>It may safely be assumed that Congress approved the bill that eventually became RA 9525, fully aware that the system using the PCOS machines were not piloted in the 2007 electoral exercise. The enactment of RA 9525 is to us a compelling indication that it was never Congress' intent to make the pilot testing of a particular automated election system in the 2007 elections a condition precedent to its use or award of the 2010 Automation Project. The comment-in-intervention of the Senate says as much.<br><br>Further, the highly charged issue of whether or not the 2008 ARMM elections--covering, as NCC observed, three conflict-ridden island provinces--may be treated as substantial compliance with the "pilot test" requirement must be answered in the affirmative. No less than Senator Richard J. Gordon himself, the author of the law, said that "the system has been tried and tested in the ARMM elections last year, so we have to proceed with the total implementation of the law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>We note, though, the conflicting views of the NCC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and ITFP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> on the matter. Suffice it to state at this juncture that the system used in the 2008 ARMM election exercise bears, as petitioners to an extent grudgingly admit, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> a similarity with the PCOS. The following, lifted from the Comelec's comment, is to us a fair description of how the two systems (PCOS and CCOS) work and where the difference lies:<br><br><blockquote>xxx the elections in the [ARMM] utilized the Counting Center Optical Scan (CCOS), a system which uses the Optical Mark Reader (OMR), the same technology as the PCOS.<br><br>Under the CCOS, the voters cast their votes by shading or marking the circles in the paper ballots which corresponded to the names of their chosen candidates [like in PCOS]. Thereafter, the ballot boxes were brought to the counting centers where they were scanned, counted and canvassed.<br><br>xxx Under the PCOS, the counting, consolidation and canvassing of the votes are done at the precinct level.  The election results at the precincts are then electronically transmitted to the next level, and so on. xxx PCOS dispenses with the physical transportation of ballot boxes from the precincts to the counting centers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, it has been proposed that a partial automation be implemented for the May 2010 elections in accordance with Section 5 of RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369 instead of full automation.  The Court cannot agree as such proposition has no basis in law. Section 5, as worded, does not allow for partial automation. In fact, Section 5 clearly states that "the AES <b>shall</b> be implemented nationwide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It behooves this Court to follow the letter and intent of the law for full automation in the May 2010 elections.<br><br><b>PCOS Meets Minimum Capabilities Standards</b><br><br>As another ground for the nullification of the automation contract, petitioners posit the view that the PCOS machines do not satisfy the minimum system capabilities prescribed by RA 8436, as amended. To a specific point, they suggest that the PCOS system offered and accepted lacks the features that would assure accuracy in the recording and reading of votes, as well as in the tabulation, consolidation/canvassing, electronic transmission, storage results and accurate ballot counting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In this particular regard, petitioners allege that, based on Smartmatic's website, the PCOS has a margin of error of from 2% to 10%, way beyond that of the required 99.99% accuracy in the counting of votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The minimum system capabilities provision cited is Sec. 7 of RA 8436, as amended, and the missing features referred to by petitioners are pars.

After resumption of regular power supply, the PCOS machine was able to restart  successfully with notification to the operator that there were two (2) ballots already cast in the machine. The "hanging" 3<sup>rd</sup> ballot was returned to the operator and was able to be re-fed into the PCOS machine.

Yet the same page discloses that the SAES has "100%" accuracy. Clearly, the alleged 2% to 10% failing rate is now irrelevant and the Court need not belabor this and the equally irrelevant estoppel principle petitioners impose on us.<br><br>Intervenor Cuadra's concern relates to the auditability of the election results. In this regard, it may suffice to point out that PCOS, being a paper-based technology, affords audit since the voter would be able, if need be, to verify if the machine had scanned, recorded and counted his vote properly. Moreover, it should also be noted that the PCOS machine contains an LCD screen, one that can be programmed or configured to display to the voter his votes as read by the machine. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><b>No Abdication of Comelec's Mandate and Responsibilty</b><br><br>As a final main point, petitioners would have the Comelec-Smartmatic-TIM Corporation automation contract nullified since, in violation of the Constitution, it constitutes a wholesale abdication of the poll body's constitutional mandate for election law enforcement. On top of this perceived aberration, the mechanism of the PCOS machines would infringe the constitutional right of the people to the secrecy of the ballot which, according to the petitioners, is provided in Sec. 2, Art. V of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>The above contention is not well taken.<br><br>The first function of the Comelec under the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>--and the Omnibus Election Code for that matter--relates to the enforcement and administration of all laws and regulations relating to the conduct of elections to public office to ensure a free, orderly and honest electoral exercise. And how did petitioners come to their conclusion about their abdication theory? By acceding to Art. 3.3 of the automation contract, Comelec relinquished, so petitioners claim, supervision and control of the system to be used for the automated elections. To a more specific point, the loss of control, as may be deduced from the ensuing exchanges, arose from the fact that Comelec would not be holding possession of what in IT jargon are the public and private keys pair.<br><br><blockquote>CHIEF JUSTICE: Well, more specifically are you saying that the main course of this lost of control is the fact that SMARTMATIC holds the public and private keys to the sanctity of this system?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: Yes, Your Honor, as well as the fact that they control the program embedded in the key cost that will read their votes by which the electorate may verify that their votes were counted.<br><br>CHIEF JUSTICE: You are saying that SMARTMATIC and not its partner TIM who hold these public and private keys?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: Yes, Your Honor.<br></blockquote><br>The Court is not convinced. There is to us nothing in Art 3.3 of the automation contract, even if read separately from other stipulations and the provisions of the bid documents and the Constitution itself, to support the simplistic conclusion of abdication of control pressed on the Court. Insofar as pertinent, Art 3.3 reads:<br><br><blockquote>3.3 The PROVIDER shall be liable for all its obligations under this Project and the performance of portions thereof by other persons or entities not parties to this Contract shall not relieve the PROVIDER of said obligations and concomitant liabilities.<br><br><b>SMARTMATIC, as the joint venture partner with the greater track record in automated elections, shall be in charge of the technical aspects of the counting and canvassing software and hardware</b>, including transmission configuration and system integration. SMARTMATIC shall also be primarily responsible for preventing and troubleshooting technical problems that may arise during the elections. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>The proviso designating Smartmatic as the joint venture partner in charge of the technical aspect of the counting and canvassing wares does not to us translate, without more, to ceding control of the electoral process to Smartmatic. It bears to stress that the aforesaid designation of Smartmatic was not plucked from thin air, as it was in fact an eligibility requirement imposed, should the bidder be a joint venture. Part 5, par. 5.4 (e) of the <i>Instruction to Bidders</i> on the subject <b>Eligible Bidders</b>, whence the second paragraph of aforequoted Art. 3.3 came from, reads:<br><br><blockquote>5.4 A JV of two or more firms as partners shall comply with the following requirements.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) The JV member with a greater track record in automated elections, shall be in-charge of the technical aspects of the counting and canvassing software and hardware, including transmission configuration and system integration</blockquote><br>And lest it be overlooked, the RFP, which forms an integral part of the automation contract,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> has put all prospective bidders on notice of Comelec's intent to automate and to accept bids that would meet several needs, among which is "a complete solutions provider... which can provide... effective overall nationwide project management service...<b> under COMELEC supervision and control</b>, to ensure effective and successful implementation of the [automation] Project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Complementing this RFP advisory as to control of the election process is Art. 6.7 of the automation contract, providing:<br><br><blockquote>6.7 Subject to the provisions of the General Instructions to be issued by the Commission En Banc, <b>the entire processes of voting</b>, <b>counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes shall be conducted by COMELEC's personnel and officials</b>, and their performance, completion and final results according to specifications and within the specified periods shall be the shared responsibility of COMELEC and the PROVIDER. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>But not one to let an opportunity to score points pass by, petitioners rhetorically ask: "Where does Public Respondent Comelec intend to get this large number of professionals, many of whom are already gainfully employed abroad?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The Comelec, citing Sec. 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and Sec. 5 of RA 8436,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> as amended, aptly answered this poser in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [P]ublic respondent COMELEC, in the implementation of the automated project, will forge partnerships with various entities in different fields to bring about the success of the 2010 automated elections.<br><br>Public respondent COMELEC will partner with Smartmatic TIM Corporation for the training and hiring of the IT personnel as well as for the massive voter-education campaign.

The petitioners, to stress, are strangers to the automation contract. Not one participated in the bidding conference or the bidding proper or even perhaps examined the bidding documents and, therefore, none really knows the real intention of the parties.  As case law tells us, the court has to ferret out the real intent of the parties.  What is fairly clear in this case, however, is that petitioners who are not even privy to the bidding process foist upon the Court their own view on the stipulations of the automation contract and present to the Court what they think are the parties' true intention. It is a study of outsiders appearing to know more than the parties do, but actually speculating what the parties intended.  The following is self-explanatory:<br><br><blockquote>CHIEF JUSTICE: Why did you say that it did not, did you talk with the Chairman and Commissioners of COMELEC that they failed to perform this duty, they did not exercise this power of control?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE : Your Honor, I based it on the fact that it was the COMELEC in fact that entered into this contract ....<br><br>CHIEF JUSTICE : Yes, but my question is - did you confront the COMELEC officials that they forfeited their power of control in over our election process?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE : We did not confront, your Honor. We impugned their acts, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup></blockquote><br>Just as they do on the issue of control over the electoral process, petitioners also anchor on speculative reasoning their claim that Smartmatic has possession and control over the public and private keys pair that will operate the PCOS machines. Consider:  Petitioners' counsel was at the start cocksure about Smartmatic's control of these keys and, with its control, of the electoral process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Several questions later, his answers had a qualifying tone:<br><br><blockquote>JUSTICE NACHURA: And can COMELEC under the contract not demand that it have access, that it be given access to and in fact generate its own keys independently with SMARTMATIC so that it would be COMELEC and not SMARTMATIC that would have full control of the technology insofar as the keys are concerned xxx?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: I do not know if COMELEC will be in a position to generate these keys, xxx. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></blockquote><br>And subsequently, the speculative nature of petitioners' position as to who would have possession and control of the keys became apparent.<br><br><blockquote>CHIEF JUSTICE: Yes, but did you check with the COMELEC who will be holding these two keys x x x did you check with COMELEC whether this system is correct?<br><br>ATTY.ROQUE: We have not had occasion to do so, x x x Your Honor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>CHIEF JUSTICE: Why do you make that poor conclusion against the COMELEC x x x May not the COMELEC hire the services of experts in order for the institution to be able to discharge its constitutional functions?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: That is true, but x x x there is too much reliance on individuals who do not have the same kind of accountability as public officers x x x<br><br>CHIEF JUSTICE: Are you saying that the COMELEC did not consult with available I.T. experts in the country before it made the bidding rules before it conducted the bidding and make the other policy judgments?<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: Your Honor, what I am sure is that they did not confer with the I.T. Foundation x x x.<br><br>CHIEF JUSTICE: But is that foundation the only expert, does it have a monopoly of knowledge?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court, to be sure, recognizes the importance of the vote-security issue revolving around the issuance of the public and private keys pair to the Board of Election Inspectors, including the digital signatures. The NCC comment on the matter deserves mention, appearing to hew as it does to what appear on the records. The NCC wrote:<br><br><blockquote>The RFP/TOR used in the recent bidding for the AES to be used in the 2010 elections specifically mandated the use of public key cryptography. However, it was left to the discretion of the bidder to propose an acceptable manner of utilization for approval/acceptance of the Comelec. Nowhere in the RFP/TOR was it indicated that COMELEC would delegate to the winning bidder the full discretion, supervision and control over the manner of PKI [Public Key Infrastructure] utilization.</blockquote><br>With the view we take of the automation contract, the role of Smartmatic TIM Corporation is basically to supply the goods necessary for the automation project, such as but not limited to the PCOS machines, PCs, electronic transmission devices and related equipment, both hardware and software, and the technical services pertaining to their  operation. As lessees of the goods and the back-up equipment, the corporation and its operators would provide assistance with respect to the machines to be used by the Comelec which, at the end of the day, will be conducting the election thru its personnel and whoever it deputizes.<br><br>And if only to emphasize a point, Comelec's contract is with Smartmatic TIM Corporation of which Smartmatic is a 40% minority owner, per the JVA of TIM and Smartmatic and the Articles of Incorporation of Smartmatic TIM Corporation. Accordingly, any decision on the part or on behalf of Smartmatic will not be binding on Comelec. As a necessary corollary, the board room voting arrangement that Smartmatic and TIM may have agreed upon as joint venture partners, inclusive of the veto vote that one may have power over the other, should really be the least concern of the Comelec.<br><br>Parenthetically, the contention that the PCOS would infringe on the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot because, as petitioners would put it, the voter would be confronted with a "three feet" long ballot,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> does not commend itself for concurrence. Surely, the Comelec can put up such infrastructure as to insure that the voter can write his preference in relative privacy. And as demonstrated during the oral arguments, the voter himself will personally feed the ballot into the machine. A voter, if so minded to preserve the secrecy of his ballot, will always devise a way to do so. By the same token, one with least regard for secrecy will likewise have a way to make his vote known.<br><br>During the oral arguments, the notion of a possible violation of the Anti-Dummy Law cropped up, given the RFP requirement of a joint venture bidder to be at least be 60% Filipino. On the other hand, the winning bidder, TIM-Smartmatic joint venture, has Smartmatic, a foreign corporation, owning 40% of the equity in, first, the joint venture partnership, and then in Smartmatic TIM Corporation.<br><br>The Anti-Dummy Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> pertinently states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.  <i>Penalty.</i> <b>In all cases in which any constitutional or legal provision requires Philippine or any other specific citizenship as a requisite for the exercise or enjoyment of a right, franchise or privilege, </b>any citizen of the Philippines or of any other specific country who allows his name or citizenship to be used for the purpose of evading such provision, and any alien or foreigner profiting thereby, shall be punished by imprisonment xxx and by a fine xxx.<br><br>SECTION 2. <i>Simulation of minimum capital</i> <i>stock</i> - <b>In all cases in which a constitutional or legal provision requires that</b> a corporation or association may exercise or enjoy  a right, franchise or privilege<b>, not </b>less than a certain per centum of its capital must be owned by  citizens of the Philippines or  any other specific country, <b>it shall be unlawful to falsely simulate the existence of such minimum stock or capital as owned by such citizen for the purpose of evading such provision</b>. xxx<br><br>SECTION 2-A. <i>Unlawful use, Exploitation or Enjoyment</i>.

For liability for violation of the law to attach, it must be established that there is a law limiting or reserving the enjoyment or exercise of a right, franchise, privilege, or business to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at least 60 per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens. In the case at bench, the Court is not aware of any constitutional or statutory provision classifying as a nationalized activity the lease or provision of goods and technical services for the automation of an election. In fact, Sec. 8 of RA 8436, as amended, vests the Comelec with specific authority to acquire AES from foreign sources, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC 12. <i>Procurement of Equipment and Materials</i>.- To achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is authorized <b>to</b> procure, xxx, by <b>purchase, lease</b>, rent or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, <b>software, facilities</b>, and other services, from local or <b>foreign  sources </b>xxx. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Petitioners cite Executive Order No. (EO) 584,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Series of 2006, purportedly limiting "contracts for the supply of materials, goods and commodities to government-owned or controlled corporation, company, agency or municipal corporation" to corporations that are 60% Filipino. We do not quite see the governing relevance of EO 584. For let alone the fact that RA 9369 is, in relation to EO 584, a subsequent enactment and, therefore, enjoys primacy over the executive issuance, the Comelec does fall under the category of a government-owned and controlled corporation, an agency or a municipal corporation contemplated in the executive order.<br><br>A view has been advanced regarding the susceptibility of the AES to hacking, just like the voting machines used in certain precincts in Florida, USA in the Gore-Bush presidential contests. However, an analysis of post-election reports on the voting system thus used in the US during the period material and the AES to be utilized in the 2010 automation project seems to suggest stark differences between the two systems. The first relates to the Source Code, defined in RA 9369 as "human readable instructions that define what the computer equipment will do."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> The Source Code for the 2010 AES shall be available and opened for review by political parties, candidates and the citizens' arms or their representatives;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> whereas in the US precincts aforementioned, the Source Code was alleged to have been kept secret by the machine manufacture company, thus keeping the American public in the dark as to how exactly the machines counted their votes. And secondly, in the AES, the PCOS machines found in the precincts will also be the same device that would tabulate and canvass the votes; whereas in the US, the machines in the precincts did not count the votes. Instead the votes cast appeared to have been stored in a memory card that was brought to a counting center at the end of the day. As a result, the hacking and cheating may have possibly occurred at the counting center.<br><br>Additionally, with the AES, the possibility of system hacking is very slim. The PCOS machines are only online when they transmit the results, which would only take around one to two minutes. In order to hack the system during this tiny span of vulnerability, a super computer would be required. Noteworthy also is the fact that the memory card to be used during the elections is encrypted and read-only--meaning no illicit program can be executed or introduced into the memory card.<br><br>Therefore, even though the AES has its flaws, Comelec and Smartmatic have seen to it that the system is well-protected with sufficient security measures in order to ensure honest elections.<br><br>And as indicated earlier, the joint venture provider has formulated and put in place a continuity and back-up plans that would address the understandable apprehension of a failure of elections in case the machines falter during the actual election. This over-all fall-back strategy includes the provisions for 2,000 spare PCOS machines on top of the 80,000 units assigned to an equal number precincts throughout the country.  The continuity and back-up plans seek to address the following eventualities: <b>(1)</b> The PCOS fails to scan ballots; <b>(2) </b>The PCOS scans the ballots, but fails to print election returns (ERs); and/or <b>(3)</b> The PCOS prints but fails to transmit the ERs. In the event item #1 occurs, a spare PCOS, if available, will be brought in or, if not available, the PCOS of another precinct (PCOS 2 for clarity), after observing certain defined requirements,[101] shall be used. Should all the PCOS machines in the entire municipality/city fail, <b>manual counting</b> of the paper ballots and the <b>manual accomplishment </b>of ERs shall be resorted to in accordance with Comelec promulgated rules on appreciation of automated ballots.[102] In the event item #2 occurs where the PCOS machines fail to print ERs, the use of spare PCOS and the transfer of PCOS-2 shall be effected.  <b>Manual counting</b> of ERs shall be resorted to also if all PCOS fails in the entire municipality. And should eventuality #3 transpire, the following back-up options, among others, may be availed of:  bringing PCOS-1 to the nearest precinct or polling center which has a functioning transmission facility; inserting transmission cable of functioning transmission line to PCOS-1 and transmitting stored data from PCOS-1 using functioning transmission facility.<br><br>The disruption of the election process due to machine breakdown or malfunction may be limited to a precinct only or could affect an entire municipal/city. The worst case scenario of course would be the wholesale breakdown of the 82,000 PCOS machines. Nonetheless, even in this most extreme case, failure of all the machines would not necessarily translate into failure of elections. Manual count tabulation and transmission, as earlier stated, can be done, PCOS being a paper-ballot technology. If the machine fails for whatever reason, the paper ballots would still be there for the hand counting of the votes, manual tabulation and transmission of the ERs. Failure of elections consequent to voting machines failure would, in fine, be a very remote possibility.<br><br>A final consideration.<br><br>The first step is always difficult. Hardly anything works, let alone ends up perfectly the first time around. As has often been said, if one looks hard enough, he will in all likelihood find a glitch in any new system. It is no wonder some IT specialists and practitioners have considered the PCOS as unsafe, not the most appropriate technology for Philippine elections, and "easily hackable," even. And the worst fear expressed is that disaster is just waiting to happen, that PCOS would not work on election day.<br><br>Congress has chosen the May 2010 elections to be the maiden run for full automation. And judging from what the Court has heard and read in the course of these proceedings, the choice of PCOS by Comelec was not a spur-of-moment affair, but the product of honest-to-goodness studies, consultations with CAC, and lessons learned from the ARMM 2008 automated elections.  With the backing of Congress by way of budgetary support, the poll body has taken this historic, if not ambitious, first step. It started with the preparation of the RFP/TOR, with a list of voluminous annexes embodying in specific detail the bidding rules and expectations from the bidders. And after a hotly contested and, by most accounts, a highly transparent public bidding exercise, the joint venture of a Filipino and foreign corporation won and, after its machine hurdled the end-to-end demonstration test, was eventually awarded the contract to undertake the automation project. Not one of the losing or disqualified bidders questioned, at least not before the courts, the <i>bona fides</i> of the bidding procedures and the outcome of the bidding itself.<br><br>Assayed against the provisions of the Constitution, the enabling automation law, RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, the RFP and even the Anti-Dummy Law, which petitioners invoked as an afterthought, the Court finds the project award to have complied with legal prescriptions, and the terms and conditions of the corresponding automation contract in question to be valid. No grave abuse of discretion, therefore, can be laid on the doorsteps of respondent Comelec. And surely, the winning joint venture should not be faulted for having a foreign company as partner.<br><br>The Comelec is an independent constitutional body with a distinct and pivotal role in our scheme of government. In the discharge of its awesome functions as overseer of fair elections, administrator and lead implementor of laws relative to the conduct of elections, it should not be stymied with restrictions that would perhaps be justified in the case of an organization of lesser responsibility.[103] It should be afforded ample elbow room and enough wherewithal in devising means and initiatives that would enable it to accomplish the great objective for which it was created--to promote free, orderly, honest and peaceful elections. This is as it should be for, too often, Comelec has to make decisions under difficult conditions to address unforeseen events to preserve the integrity of the election and in the process the voice of the people.  Thus, in the past, the Court has steered away from interfering with the Comelec's exercise of its power which, by law and by the nature of its office properly pertain to it. Absent, therefore, a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion on Comelec's part, as here, the Court should refrain from utilizing the corrective hand of <i>certiorari</i> to review, let alone nullify, the acts of that body. This gem, while not on all fours with, is lifted from, the Court's holding in an old but oft-cited case:<br><br><blockquote>x x x We may not agree fully with [the Comelec's] choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion, this court should not interfere.  Politics is a practical matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically--not from the standpoint of pure theory [or speculation]. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>There are no ready-made formulas for solving public problems. Time and experience are necessary to evolve patterns that will serve the ends of good government. In the matter of the administration of the laws relative to the conduct of elections, x x x we must not by any excessive zeal take away from the [Comelec] the initiative which by constitutional and legal mandates properly belongs to it. Due regard to the independent character of the Commission x x x requires that the power of this court to review the acts of that body should, as a general proposition, be used sparingly, but firmly in appropriate cases.[104] x x x</blockquote><br>The Court, however, will not indulge in the presumption that nothing would go wrong, that a successful automation election unmarred by fraud, violence, and like irregularities would be the order of the moment on May 10, 2010.  Neither will it guarantee, as it cannot guarantee, the effectiveness of the voting machines and the integrity of the counting and consolidation software embedded in them. That task belongs at the first instance to Comelec, as part of its mandate to ensure clean and peaceful elections. This independent constitutional commission, it is true, possesses extraordinary powers and enjoys a considerable latitude in the discharge of its functions. The road, however, towards successful 2010 automation elections would certainly be rough and bumpy. The Comelec is laboring under very tight timelines. It would accordingly need the help of all advocates of orderly and honest elections, of all men and women of goodwill, to smoothen the way and assist Comelec personnel address the fears expressed about the integrity of the system.

The COMELEC awarded Phase II for the provision of the ACMs to the Mega Pacific Consortium (MP Consortium).

Discussion</b></center><br><br>A touchstone of our Constitution is that critical public policy judgments belong to the legislative branch, and the Court must not unduly intrude into this exclusive domain.<br><br>In enacting RA 8436 (Election Modernization Act) on December 22, 1997, the legislature has clearly chosen the policy that an AES shall be used by the COMELEC for the process of voting, counting of votes and canvassing/consolidation of results of the national and local elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  It decided to put an end to the manual conduct of our elections that has frustrated the honest casting of votes by our sovereign people.<br><br>In the pursuit of its objective, the legislature defined what it considered an AES and provided the standards for its implementation. It further determined the minimum functional capabilities of the system and delegated to the COMELEC the development and adoption of a system of evaluation to ascertain that the minimum system capabilities would be met.<br><br>The policy decision of Congress to adopt an AES is not under question. It is the manner the COMELEC is implementing the AES that is assailed by the petitioners.  The <b>first issue</b> is whether the conduct of an AES in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao is a condition precedent to the nationwide implementation of the AES.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 160px;"><b>c.1  The conduct of the pilot exercise of the </b><br><b>AES is a condition precedent to its </b><br><b>   nationwide implementation</b><br></div><br>Whether the conduct of the pilot exercise of the AES is a condition precedent to its nationwide implementation involves the correct interpretation of Section 5 of RA 8436.  The interpretation of Section 5, RA 8436, as amended, is nothing less than a brain twister.  It appears like a Rorschach inkblot test, in which petitioners and respondents assign meaning to certain words as though they were deciphering images formed by inkblots.  Using the same word of the law, they arrive at different conclusions.<br><br>Thus, the petitioners interpret the word <b>shall</b> in the first proviso of Section 5, RA 8436, as amended, to support their thesis that the pilot exercise of the AES is a condition precedent prior to its full implementation. The proviso states that "the [automated election system] <b>shall</b> be used in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the respondents interpret the word <b>shall </b>in the last sentence of the provision, which states that "in succeeding regular national or local elections, the [automated election system] <b>shall</b> be implemented nationwide,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and submit that the pilot exercise of the AES is not a condition precedent.  Further, they contend that the use of the AES in at least two provinces and two highly urbanized cities each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao <b>refers only</b> to the national and local elections immediately following the passage of RA 9369, <i>i.e.</i>, the May 2007 national and local elections. They argue that this was just an acknowledgment by Congress that there was not enough time or funds to conduct a full nationwide automation of the May 2007 election.<br><br>The respondents' reading of Section 5 disregards the tenor of the entire provision. A rational reading of the entire provision will show that the different parts isolated and then interpreted by the respondents are connected by the conjunctions <b>provided, that</b> and <b>provided, further that</b> and <b>provided, finally that. </b>These conjunctions signify that the clauses that follow the conjunction are a pre-requisite or a condition to the fulfillment of the previous clause. The words <b>provided, that</b> mean the same as "as long as," "in order that," and "if only." Thus, the provision should be read and understood as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Part 1: </b>To carry out the above-stated policy, <b>the Commission on Elections</b>, herein referred to as the Commission, <b>is hereby authorized to use an automated election system</b> or systems in the same election in different provinces, whether paper-based or a direct recording electronic election system as it may deem appropriate and practical for the process of voting, counting of votes and canvassing/consolidation and transmittal of results of electoral exercises:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b>Provided, That</b><br></center><br><b>Part 2: </b>for the regular national and local elections, which shall be held immediately after the effectivity of this Act, <b>the AES shall be used in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao</b>, to be chosen by the Commission:<br><br><center><b>Provided, further,</b><br></center><br><b>Part 3:</b> That <b>local government units</b> whose <b>officials have been the subject of administrative charges </b>within sixteen (16) months prior to the May 14, 2007 elections shall <b>not be chosen</b>:<br><br><center><b>Provided finally,</b><br></center><br><b>Part 4: </b>That <b>no area</b> shall be <b>chosen without the consent of the Sanggunian</b> of the local government unit concerned. The term local government unit as used in this provision shall refer to a highly urbanized city or province.<br><br><b>Part 5: In succeeding regular national or local elections, the AES shall be implemented nationwide</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In this light, Section 5 should be interpreted to mean that the COMELEC is authorized to use an AES as long as the following requisites are complied with: (1) for the regular national and local elections, which shall be held immediately after the effectivity of the Act, the AES shall be used in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao; (2) that local government units whose officials have been the subject of administrative charges within sixteen months prior to the May 14, 2007 elections shall not be chosen; and (3)  that no area shall be chosen without the consent of the Sanggunian of the local government unit concerned. And, when the above conditions are complied with, the AES shall be implemented nationwide in succeeding regular national and local elections.<br><br>The last sentence of the provision which provides that "[i]n succeeding regular national or local elections, the AES shall be implemented nationwide" may appear as not connected to the enumeration of requirements for the use of an AES.  But this does not mean that it can be read in isolation and independently from the rest of the provision. Section 5 expressly declares that the COMELEC's authority to use the AES on a nationwide scale is contingent on the prior conduct of partial automation in two provinces and two highly urbanized cities each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.<br><br>Likewise, the word "pilot testing" may not have been used in the provision, but the intent to test the use of an AES is evident in its text. The mandatory nature of the initial conduct of an automated election in two provinces and two highly urbanized cities each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao is highlighted by the use of the word <b>shall</b>. That this is a condition precedent before a full nationwide automated election can be used in the succeeding elections is buttressed by the use of the words <b>provided, that</b>. Thus, the COMELEC is authorized to use an AES, provided that the AES is first used in two provinces and two highly urbanized cities each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, after which, in the following regular national and local elections, the AES shall be implemented nationwide.<br><br>Pushing to the limit their argument that pilot testing is not a condition precedent to the conduct of an AES, the respondents rely on Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended, which provides thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12. Procurement of Equipment and Materials. - To achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is authorized to procure, in accordance with existing laws, by purchase, lease, rent or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities and other services, from local or foreign sources free from taxes and import duties, subject to accounting and auditing rules and regulations. <b>With respect to the May 10, 2010 elections and succeeding electoral exercises, the system procured must have demonstrated capability and been successfully used in a prior electoral exercise here or abroad. Participation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness. </b>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The respondents press the point that Section 12, <i>supra</i>, indicates that pilot testing in the May 2007 elections is not a mandatory requirement for the choice of an AES to be used in the May 2010 elections, nor is it a prerequisite for the full automation of the May 2010 elections, since the system's capability may have been used in an electoral exercise abroad.  Respondents also contend that since participation in the 2007 pilot exercise is expressly declared as inconclusive of the system's fitness, then the non-use of the PCOS machines in the 2007 electoral exercise is not a bar to the implementation of a full nationwide automation in the 2010 elections.<br><br>With due respect, the respondents have a murky understanding of the last sentence of Section 12.  It merely states that "[p]articipation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness."  It does not say that participation of the procured system in the 2007 pilot exercise is not a condition precedent to the full nationwide implementation of the AES. The section says in unadorned language that as long as the system procured -presumably for the May 2007 elections - has been shown to have demonstrated capability and has been successfully used in a prior electoral exercise here in the Philippines or abroad, the system may also be used in the May 2010 and succeeding elections. In fine, the subject of the section is the fitness of the system procured for the May 2007 automated pilot exercise; it has no relation to the issue of whether the pilot exercise is a condition precedent to the implementation of full nationwide automated elections.<br><br>The deliberations of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee on [the] Automated Election System (Joint Committee on AES)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> should further enlighten us on the purpose of the last sentence in Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended: that "[p]articipation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness." <b>They reveal that the purpose is simply to avoid a situation in which the choices of machines and the kind of AES to be used in the 2010 elections would be limited to those that were piloted in the 2007 elections. </b><br><br>Thus, Senator <b>Richard Gordon</b> explained that the purpose behind the statement that participation in the 2007 pilot exercises was not conclusive of the system's fitness was <b>to ensure that newly developed technology may still be considered for the 2010 elections, even though it was not tested in the 2007 pilot exercise.</b> Representative <b>Teodoro Locsin</b> concurred in the same view.  Thus:<br><br><blockquote>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. GORDON).  Precisely <b>that was placed there so that you can get newly discovered machines or newly invented machines that can be utilized so that in the 2010 elections</b> it would have been tried in an example here in our country.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN (REP. LOCSIN).  I think <b>the purpose of this was any bidder who can prove and who has already carried out an electoral exercise- sure, of course, he has a leg up of all other but that's not conclusive</b> which assumes that others who have not the same experience will be allowed to also bid. (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Representative Locsin elucidated that participation in the pilot-exercise was not conclusive of the system's fitness, because pilots were easier to do than national exercises. This was also to emphasize that those who participated in the pilot exercise were not to be preferred over those who were not able to participate in the pilot exercise. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>THE CHAIRMAN (REP. LOCSIN).  Although this is a detail, if I may `no, I think you are just doing your best that you just read what it says. It simply says that, I think, everyone is entitled to put their bid. Your <i>(sic)</i> have the discretion to decide whether or not they have the capability. A company may have had many exercises in Latin America but for this particular exercise they may not be prepared to deploy the best then we just forget it. But <b>when it says "participation in 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive," that does not mean to exclude anyone who did not participate in 2007. It was only meant to say our fear is that somebody may be so good in the pilot but then he'll say, "Hey, I won the pilot therefore you have to give me the national election."</b> That's all it meant because <b>pilots are always easier to do than national exercises. </b>(Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The respondents also have an erroneous reading of the use of the word "pilot exercise" instead of "pilot testing." They claim that the use of the word "pilot exercise" instead of "pilot testing" is indicative of the intention to only initially use or employ the AES in the 2007 elections rather than make it a condition precedent.  Again, this submission is not sustained by the deliberations of the Senate. "Pilot-exercise" was used in the law instead of "pilot-test" to avoid the notion that a test must first be passed in the 2007 elections in order to continue with the use of the AES as a mode of conducting the succeeding elections. The lawmakers wanted to avoid the use of the word "test," so that in case the AES to be used in the 2007 elections did not well perform as planned, still, the automation of the elections in the next elections would proceed.  This intent is reflected in the debate between Senator Richard J. Gordon (Senator Gordon) and Senator Manuel A. Roxas II (Senator Roxas) over an amendment to Section 5 of RA 8436, proposed by the latter.  Senator Roxas proposed to add the words "on a test basis" to refer to the use of an AES. The amendment is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. Authority to Use an Automated Election System. - To carry out the above-stated policy, the Commission on Elections, herein referred to as the COMELEC is hereby authorized to use ON A TEST BASIS AN automated election system x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (capitalization in the original.)</blockquote><br>Senator Roxas wanted to use the word "test," so that after a "test" of the AES in the 2007 elections, Congress would know whether the implementation of the 2007 national and local AES was successful.  Thereafter, Congress would decide whether the AES - as a mode of conducting elections - should still be used for the successive elections. This is clear from the following exchange of remarks between Senator Roxas and Senator Gordon:<br><br><blockquote>SENATOR ROXAS. In any event, Mr. President, I would like now to go to line 18 and read into the <i>Record </i>the proposed amendment. Again, as I said earlier, so as not to confuse those who are following the language, I will deliberately not read the word "test" subject to whatever happens to that word in subsequent debate and dialogue.<br><br>The proposed amendment reads:<br><br>THE FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AES OR AES TECHNOLOGY SHALL BE DECIDED UPON BY CONGRESS, THROUGH A JOINT RESOLOUTION, UPON RECOMMENDATION OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SHALL CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION PERFORMANCE OF SAID AES OR AES TECHNOLOGY DURING INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF RESULTS WITH MANUAL TABULATION. IT SHALL THEN MAKE APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS ON WHETHER ANY FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED OR OTHERWISE. IN CASE OF FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION AND THE INCREMENTAL COVERAGE BY ALL AES SHALL NOT BE MORE THAN TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE TOTAL COVERAGE IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF DISTRICTS.<br><br>That is the proposed amendment, Mr. President. The proposed amendment, first, from a comprehensive perspective seeks to revert back to Congress the judgment whether the implementation of the AES in 2007 national and local elections was successful or not.<br><br>As envisaged in the bill, Mr. President, we are leaving to the Comelec the decision to choose the appropriate technology that will be implemented. There will be a series of advisory or a number of advisory and TAHEC bodies that will hopefully inform that decision.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>SENATOR GORDON.  I thank the distinguished gentleman from Capiz, Mr. President. I know he tried to amend this with sincerity, but I also would like to maintain that this is not a test, first and foremost, because he speaks of a test, and I know he has already stated what word to use. As I pointed out, the words to be used should be: The Automated Election System will be implemented in the province he has already spoken about.<br><br>But, upon the other hand, I am concerned about "shall be decided upon by Congress through a joint resolution," referring to line 18,--before the implementation of an AES. I am removing the word "test", --"before the implementation of AES technology shall be decided upon by Congress."<br><br>Mr. President, that line speaks volumes. The mother bill that we are amending which is enacted in 1987 decided a policy that we are going to go on an automated election. In other words, if we follow the logic here, we are practically saying: "Well, we may be changing our mind. Maybe we are not in automation mode again." This very line suggests and clearly states that: "Hey, it is going to go back to Congress." And, in fact, through a joint resolution, which I think cannot even be done because Congress amends even without this suggestion. It can amend even without these lines. It can amend the law if it chooses to do so. Which means that after the Automated Election System, if we feel that we no longer want to have an automated election system, Congress cannot at anytime say: "No, we are no longer in that mode."<br><br>What our bill provides is that we are already on this heuristic notion, if I may use a word I learned in school a long time ago, which is a trajectory that is headed towards a particular direction aimed at modernizing the election by way of AES. And we have put in the safeguards the minimum requirements and by so doing, after the election has been conducted, the Comelec which is the agency, whether we like it or not, that has been mandated by the Constitution to run our elections simply goes on and says: "All right, we will expand upon the recommendation of the AES, along with the oversight committee."<br><br>Now, if that is the case, Mr. President, there is no need to go back to Congress. But if Congress sees it fit, as I pointed out, we are not obviating that possibility. If Congress sees it fit, they can amend it.<br><br>But as far as I am concerned, I think the rule should be that we are on an automated rule should be that we are on an automated election mode and we should not say continue on with it.<br><br>But as far as I am concerned, <b>I think the rule should be that we are on an automated election mode and we are on an automated election more and we should continue on with it. But we should not say after the exercise, parang lumalabas na test, we will now go back and decide whether we are still on an automated election mode and say we might be going back to manual.</b> x x x We have debated on the automated, we passed this on the past period of debate and we have already decided that we are continuing with the trajectory of automated election. I would not want to go back again to a situation where Congress will say, "We are changing his <i>(sic)</i> mind." Although, it is within its prerogative anyway at any time. (Emphasis supplied; capitalization in the original.) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Senator Roxas' amendment which contained the word "test," was rejected. The reason is not because the partial use of the AES in the 2007 election was not considered as a condition precedent to its full implementation in the 2010 elections. Rather, it was because the use of the word "test" would have implied that Congress would still have to decide whether the conduct of the AES had passed its requirements; whether an AES should still be continued in the succeeding elections; or whether, based on the "test," the conduct of the elections should revert to manual.<br><br>Senator Gordon further made it clear that the reason why the AES should first be implemented in certain parts of the country - and not immediately throughout the entire country - was that "a big bite must not be taken right away."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The implementation of the system must be done in phases: first, it must be piloted in parts of the Philippines, and only then can it be implemented nationwide.

They proffer the view that RA 9525,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> appropriating P11,301,790,000.00 for the conduct of an AES  in the May 10, 2010, is for the <b>full </b>implementation of automated elections in 2010. They argue that when RA 9525 was enacted on March 5, 2009, Congress was aware that there was no pilot exercise conducted in two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao; and despite this failure, Congress still appropriated the entire amount of P11,301,790,000.00 for the full nationwide implementation of the AES in the May 2010 elections.  By the enactment of the P11,301,790,000.00 supplemental appropriation, the respondents claim that Congress conveyed the intention to proceed with full nationwide automation and do away with the requirement of conducting a pilot exercise. The respondents also rely on the deliberations of the Senate and the House of Representatives to support their thesis.<br><br>On the other hand, the petitioners counter that there was no implied repeal of the requirement of pilot testing of the AES in two provinces and two highly urbanized cities each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.  They cite Section 2 of RA 9525, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Use of Funds</i>. - <b>The amounts herein appropriated shall be used for the purposes indicated and subject to</b>: (i) the relevant special and general provisions of Republic Act No. 9498, or the FY 2008 General Appropriations Act, as reenacted, and subsequent General Appropriations Acts, and (ii) the <b>applicable provisions of </b><b>Republic Act No. 8436</b><b>,</b> entitled: "An Act Authorizing the Commission on Elections to Use an Automated Election System in the May 11, 1998 National or Local Elections and in subsequent National and Local Electoral Exercises, Providing Funds Therefor and for Other Purposes", <b>as amended by Republic Act No. 9369:</b> <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That <b>disbursement of the amounts herein appropriated or any part thereof shall be authorized only in strict compliance with the Constitution, the provisions of Republic Act No. 9369 and other election laws incorporated in said Act</b> so as to ensure the conduct of a free, orderly, clean, honest and credible election and shall adopt such measures that will guaranty transparency and accuracy in the selection of the relevant technology of the machines to be used on May 10, 2010 automated national and local election.

They further emphasize that Section 2 states that the disbursement of the amount appropriated or any part thereof shall be done only in <b>strict compliance</b> with the Constitution, and the provisions of RA 9369 and other election laws. Thus, the petitioners conclude that the mandatory requirement of pilot testing was not repealed but reiterated by Congress in said section.<br><br>The petitioners further argue that implied repeals are not favored, and two laws must be absolutely incompatible before an inference of implied repeal may be drawn.  They contend that RA 9525 is not totally inconsistent with the requirement of pilot testing in Section 5 of RA 8436, as amended, such that the provisions of RA 9525 must be interpreted and brought into accord with the old law.<br><br>To resolve this issue of implied repeal, the Court must first determine whether it was the intent of Congress to push through with full nationwide automation of the elections in May 2010. RA 9525 is unclear whether Congress appropriated P11,301,790,000.00 for the conduct of full or partial automated elections, or whether it intended the automated elections to be conducted nationwide or only in the pilot areas.  To clear this uncertainty, the Court should resort to the deliberations of the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as the hearings of the Joint Committee on AES.<br><br>Let us first look at the deliberations of the <b>House of Representatives</b> when it considered House Bill 5715 (HB 5715), entitled "An Act Appropriating the Sum of Eleven Billion, Three Hundred One Million, Seven Hundred Ninety Thousand Pesos as Supplemental Appropriations for an Automated Election System and for Other Purposes.

And I would suggest very strongly that the advisory committee sit down with potential bidders and really go over every single figure in that costing because it's going to be unfortunate that this will not push through. Automation will not push through simply because it's so expensive that there'll be such a huge public outcry against it. Whereas, you and I know that this may be one good way to have clean elections and speedier results announced in our country. That's why I think it's very important that you bargain hard and I hope that the suppliers will see also the public service element in this experiment; that I hope they won't even cut a profit out of this transaction because if you are successful, I think this will be one of the biggest use of their technology at 45 million or 35 million voters. I don't know if there's any other country who has that number of voters using this particular technology.<br><br>So, in terms of selling point, this will be one of their strongest selling points.

Section 2.2.4 of Part IX (B) of the TOR/RFP declares "[m]anufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture [...]" as eligible to participate in the bidding for the 2010 Automation Project, without any incorporated <i>vs</i>. unincorporated dichotomy.

It has no precise legal definition, but it has been generally understood to mean an organization formed for some temporary purpose. It is hardly distinguishable from the partnership, since their elements are similar - community of interest in the business, sharing of profits and losses, and a mutual right of control. The main distinction cited by most opinions in common law jurisdiction is that the partnership contemplates a general business with some degree of continuity, while the joint venture is formed for the execution of a single transaction, and is thus of a temporary nature. This observation is not entirely accurate in this jurisdiction, since under the Civil Code, a partnership may be particular or universal, and a particular partnership may have for its object a specific undertaking. It would seem therefore that under Philippine law, a joint venture is a form of partnership and should thus be governed by the law of partnerships. The Supreme Court has however recognized a distinction between these two business forms, and has held that although a corporation cannot enter into a partnership contract, it may however engage in a joint venture with others.

The facts of that case are entirely different.  In the main, no JVA or document of similar import was submitted <b>during the bidding process</b> to the COMELEC in <b>Information Technology</b>. The only "evidence" as to the existence of the alleged joint venture was a self-serving letter expressing that Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc., Election.com, Ltd., WeSolv Open Computing, Inc., SK C&amp;C, and ePLDT and Oracle System (Philippines), Inc. had agreed to form a consortium to bid for the Automation Project. This notwithstanding, the COMELEC awarded the contract to the "consortium." And the Court pointedly ruled:<br><br><blockquote>The March 7, 2003 letter, signed by only one signatory - "Willy U. Yu, President, Mega Pacific eSolutions, Inc., (Lead Company/Proponent) For: Mega Pacific Consortium" - and without any further proof, does not by itself prove the existence of the consortium. It does not show that MPEI or its president have been duly pre-authorized by the other members of the putative consortium to represent them, to bid on their collective behalf and, more important, to commit them jointly and severally to the bid undertakings. The letter is purely self-serving and uncorroborated.<br><br>To assure itself properly of the due existence (as well as eligibility and qualification) of the putative consortium, Comelec's BAC should have examined the bidding documents submitted on behalf of MPC. They would have easily discovered the following fatal flaws.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>In the case of a consortium or joint venture desirous of participating in the bidding, it goes without saying that the Eligibility Envelope would necessarily have to include a copy of the joint venture agreement, the consortium agreement or memorandum of agreement - or a business plan or some other instrument of similar import - establishing the due existence, composition and scope of such aggrupation. Otherwise, how would Comelec know who it was dealing with, and whether these parties are qualified and capable of delivering the products and services being offered for bidding?<br><br><b>In the instant case, no such instrument was submitted to Comelec during the bidding process</b><i>.</i> This fact can be conclusively ascertained by scrutinizing the two-inch thick "Eligibility Requirements" file submitted by Comelec last October 9, 2003, in partial compliance with this Court's instructions given during the Oral Argument. This file purports to replicate the eligibility documents originally submitted to Comelec by MPEI allegedly on behalf of MPC, in connection with the bidding conducted in March 2003. Included in the file are the incorporation papers and financial statements of the members of the supposed consortium and certain certificates, licenses and permits issued to them.<br><br>However, there is no sign whatsoever of any joint venture agreement, consortium agreement, memorandum of agreement, or business plan executed among the members of the purported consortium.<br><br><b>The only logical conclusion is that no such agreement was ever submitted to the Comelec for its consideration, as part of the bidding process.</b><br><br><b>It thus follows that, prior the award of the Contract, there was no documentary or other basis for Comelec to conclude that a consortium had actually been formed amongst MPEI, SK C&amp;C and WeSolv, along with Election.com and ePLDT. Neither was there anything to indicate the exact relationships between and among these firms; their diverse roles, undertakings and prestations, if any, relative to the prosecution of the project, the extent of their respective investments (if any) in the supposed consortium or in the project; and the precise nature and extent of their respective liabilities with respect to the contract being offered for bidding. And apart from the self-serving letter of March 7, 2003, there was not even any indication that MPEI was the lead company duly authorized to act on behalf of the others.</b><br><br>So, it necessarily follows that, during the bidding process, Comelec had no basis at all for determining that the alleged consortium really existed and was eligible and qualified; and that the arrangements among the members were satisfactory and sufficient to ensure delivery on the Contract and to protect the government's interest.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>At this juncture, one might ask: What, then, if there are four MOAs instead of one or none at all? Isn't it enough that there are these corporations coming together to carry out the automation project? Isn't it true, as respondent aver, that nowhere in the RFP issued by Comelec is it required that the members of the joint venture execute a single written agreement to prove the existence of a joint venture. Indeed, the intention to be jointly and severally liable may be evidenced not only by a single joint venture agreement, but also by supplementary documents executed by the parties signifying such intention. What then is the big deal?<br><br><b>The problem is not that there are four agreements instead of only one. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The problem is that Comelec never bothered to check</span>. It never based its decision on documents or other proof that would concretely establish the existence of the claimed consortium or joint venture or agglomeration. It relied merely on the self-serving representation in an uncorroborated letter signed by only one individual, claiming that his company represented a "consortium" of several different corporations</b>. It concluded forthwith that a consortium indeed existed, composed of such and such members, and thereafter declared that the entity was eligible to bid.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>In brief, despite the absence of competent proof as to the existence and eligibility of the alleged consortium (MPC), its capacity to deliver on the Contract, and the members' joint and several liability therefor, <b>Comelec nevertheless assumed that such consortium existed and was eligible. It then went ahead and considered the bid of MPC, to which the Contract was eventually awarded, in gross violation of the former's own bidding rules and procedures contained in its RFP. Therein lies Comelec's grave abuse of discretion</b>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>To make matters worse, the COMELEC in <b>Information Technology</b> awarded the bid to the "consortium" despite some failed marks during the technical evaluation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In the case at bar, the Smartmatic-TIM Consortium passed the technical evaluation.<br><br>It is thus readily apparent that the joint venture of Smartmatic and TIM is not attended by any of the deficiencies of the MP "consortium," as the agreement in the instant case states with precision the "exact nature and scope of the parties' respective undertakings, commitments, deliverables and covenants."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The petitioners' repeated recourse to <b>Information Technology</b> betrays a highly myopic and constricted view.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>c.5 No nationality requirement is violated</b><br></div><br>Petitioners also contend that the joint venture agreement of TIM and Smartmatic violates the Filipino-foreign equity ceiling, the Anti-Dummy Law and COMELEC's own bidding requirements.<br><br>I concur fully with the <i>ponencia</i> of Mr. Justice Velasco on this point. There is no constitutional or statutory provision classifying the lease or provision of goods and technical services for the automation of an election as a nationalized activity. To be sure, Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, explicitly authorizes the COMELEC to procure supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities, and other services from foreign sources, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12. Procurement of Equipment and Materials. - To achieve the purpose of this Act, the Commission is <b>authorized to procure</b>, in accordance with existing laws, by <b>purchase, lease, rent or other forms of acquisition, supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities and other services</b>, from local or <b>foreign sources</b> free from taxes and import duties, subject to accounting and auditing rules and regulations. With respect to the May 10, 2010 elections and succeeding electoral exercises, the system procured must have demonstrated capability and been successfully used in a prior electoral exercise here or abroad. Participation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioners cannot rely on Executive Order No. 584 (EO 584), containing the Seventh Regular Foreign Investment Negative List, which cites "contracts for the supply of materials, goods and commodities to [a] government-owned or controlled corporation, company, agency or municipal corporation" as limited to forty percent (40%) foreign equity. The reliance cannot be countenanced in light of two basic principles of statutory construction.<br><br>First, <i>leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant</i>. In case of an irreconcilable conflict between two laws of different vintages, the later enactment prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The rationale is simple: a later law repeals an earlier one because it is the later legislative will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> RA 9369, which allows the COMELEC to procure AES supplies and equipment from foreign sources, became law in 2007, whereas EO 584 is an executive issuance in 2006.<br><br>Second, <i>lex specialis derogat generali. </i>General legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, and generally is so interpreted as to embrace only cases in which the special provisions are not applicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In other words, where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one specially designed therefor should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> RA 9369 specifically covers a well-defined subject (<i>i.e.</i>, procurement for election automation), whereas EO 584 has a more universal scope.<br><br>In sum, there is no constitutional or statutory Filipino-foreign equity ceiling to speak of, and the Anti-Dummy Law does not find application to the case at bar.<br><br>Nonetheless, I wish to clarify certain matters.<br><br>It appears that in preparing the bidder eligibility requirements, the COMELEC, exercising the discretion granted by Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, adopted the guidelines that were set forth in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184 (The Government Procurement Reform Act). Thus, in Sections 2.2.1 to 2.2.4 of Part IX (B) of the TOR/RFP, the COMELEC invited the following to bid for the Automation Project:<br><br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Duly licensed Filipino citizens/proprietorships;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Partnerships duly organized under the laws of the Philippines and of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the interest belongs to citizens of the Philippines;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Corporations duly organized under the laws of the Philippines, and of which at least sixty percent (60%) of the outstanding capital stock belongs to citizens of the Philippines;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors forming themselves into a joint venture, i.e., a group of two (2) or more manufacturers, suppliers and/or distributors, that intend to be jointly and severally responsible or liable for a particular contract, provided that Filipino ownership thereof shall be at least sixty percent (60%); and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Cooperatives duly registered with the Cooperatives Development Authority.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>But for a few innocuous stylistic changes, this enumeration is an exact reproduction of Section 23.11.1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9184.<br><br>Per Smartmatic TIM Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, there is no question that the JVC complied with the 60-40 equity ceiling provided under the TOR/RFP. Out of a total paid-up capital of P1,130,000,000.00, TIM contributed sixty percent (60%) thereof (equivalent to P678,000,000.00), while Smartmatic paid the remaining forty percent (40%) (equivalent to P452,000,000.00).<br><br>The petitioners, however, allege that the sixty percent (60%) interest of TIM in the JVC was merely simulated. They point to certain provisions in the JVA as denoting that effective control over Smartmatic TIM Corporation was given to Smartmatic. Specifically, petitioners assail the following:<br><br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">The mandatory presence of at least one of the nominated Directors of Smartmatic to establish a quorum of the Board of Directors, pursuant to Article 4.3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of the JVA;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The veto power in the Board of Directors granted by TIM to Smartmatic to authorize certain important financial and technical actions, pursuant to Article 4.5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of the JVA;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The mandatory presence of the Director representing Smartmatic to establish a quorum of the Executive Committee (EXECOM), pursuant to Article 4.7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of the JVA; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The sole right of Smartmatic to nominate the (a) Chairman of the Board, (b) the Treasurer, and (c) the Corporate Secretary, and TIM's corresponding duty to elect said nominees, pursuant to Articles 4.10<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and 4.11<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the JVA.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>But far from establishing the tyranny of the minority, these provisions may be viewed as <b>legitimate minority protection devices</b>. Through them, Smartmatic sought to protect its huge investment in the Automation Project. Without these protective provisions, Smartmatic would be helplessly exposed to the risk of being outvoted on significant corporate activities and decisions - including decisions on technical matters falling within its field of expertise, for which it is primarily responsible (as against TIM) under the express terms of the COMELEC's bidding rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and the Automation Contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> itself. If that would come to pass, Smartmatic could not perform its part of the Contract and the end result would be the ruin of its investment.<br><br>To be sure, our lawmakers wanted the foreign joint venture to be autonomous in carrying out its technical functions, and intended to protect it from the whims and caprices of the non-expert majority.

In my view, however, this is but a fair and reasonable check against possible abuses by the majority stockholder. As Smartmatic is the joint venture partner having the greater experience in automated elections, it deemed it necessary to reserve to itself the veto power on these important financial matters so as not to compromise the technical aspects of the Automation Project. As far as matters <b>other than those</b> provided in Article 4.5 are concerned, Smartmatic does <b>not</b> have any veto right. This is clear from Article 4.4, which provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>4.4 Resolution on matters other than those set forth in Article 4.5 below shall be adopted by the vote of the majority of the Directors present and constituting a quorum, except as otherwise provided by law.<br></blockquote><br>The same conclusion may be obtained from the deliberations of the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments, Revision of Codes and Laws.

My question is, under your JVA[,] it says no resolution shall be passed unless TIM with three votes, presumably majority already, can secure the vote of Smartmatic, vice versa. But vice versa is expected because you only have two votes. If TIM needs to secure one more vote from you before they can do anything, number one, there is a potential for a deadlock. Number two, is that not effective control or veto power over the company that essentially overrides or circumvents the 60-40 requirement?<br><br>MR. FLORES. <b>No, sir.

We may not agree fully with the choices and decisions that the COMELEC makes, but absent any constitutional assault, statutory breach or grave abuse of discretion, we should never substitute our judgment for its own.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>c.8 No abdication by the COMELEC</b><br><b> of its duty to enforce election laws<br><br></b></div><br>The petitioners assert that the COMELEC abdicated its constitutional duty to enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections, and to decide all questions affecting elections when it entered into the Automation Contract with Smartmatic TIM Corporation.<br><br>Article 3.3 of the contract for the 2010 Elections Automation Project provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 3.3   The PROVIDER shall be liable for all its obligations under this Project, and the performance of portions thereof by other persons or entities not parties to this Contract shall not relieve the PROVIDER of said obligations and concomitant liabilities.<br><br><b>SMARTMATIC,</b> as the joint venture partner with the greater track record in automated elections, <b>shall be in charge of the technical aspects of the counting and canvassing software and hardware, including transmission configuration and system integration.</b> SMARTMATIC shall also be primarily responsible for preventing and troubleshooting technical problems that may arise during the election.<br><br>The PROVIDER must provide to SMARTMATIC at all times the support required to perform the above responsibilities. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Petitioners claim that under this Article 3.3, the COMELEC has surrendered to Smartmatic the supervision and control of the system to be used for the AES in violation of section 26 of RA 8436.<br><br>The petitioners also refer to COMELEC Bid Bulletin No. 10,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107] </sup>which was made an integral part of the Automation Contract by virtue of Articles 21.1 and 21.4 of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Bid Bulletin No. 10 provides that the "digital signature shall be assigned by the winning bidder to all members of the Board of Election Inspectors (BOI) and the city, municipal, provincial or district Board of Canvassers (BOC)." Since Smartmatic would have access to the <b>digital signatures</b> and would have the authority to assign the access keys to the BEI and BOC, the petitioners readily conclude that the COMELEC has abdicated its constitutional mandate to enforce election laws. What the petitioners failed to consider is that, although the digital signature shall be assigned by the winning bidder, Bid Bulletin No. 10 further provides that the certificate of authority for the digital signatures must still be approved by the COMELEC. <b>Thus, the COMELEC retains control over the process of generation and distribution of the digital signatures.</b><br><br>Abdication denotes a relinquishment or surrender of authority, which has not been done by the COMELEC.  Part II of the TOR/RFP provides:<br><br><blockquote>The Commission on Elections (COMELEC), through its Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), is currently accepting bids for the lease, with an option to purchase, of an automated election system (AES) that will meet the following needs:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>6. A complete solutions provider, and not just a vendor, which can provide experienced and effective overall nationwide project management service and total customer support (covering all areas of project implementation including technical support, training, information campaign support, civil and electrical works service, warehousing, deployment, installation and pullout, contingency planning, etc.), <b>under COMELEC supervision and control, </b>to ensure effective and successful implementation of the Project. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The COMELEC identified the type of technology, specifications and capabilities of the system to be used in the 2010 elections; and the bidders were required to submit their bids in accordance with the COMELEC's stipulations.  All the choices made by the winning bidder were to be subject to approval by the COMELEC, and "the final design and functionality of the system shall still be subject to [its] final customization requirements."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>It is clear that the COMELEC has not abdicated its constitutional and legal mandate to control and supervise the elections. Smartmatic and TIM are merely service providers or lessors of goods and services to the Commission.  Indeed, Article 6.7 of the Automation Contract, provides that "the entire process of voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes shall be conducted by COMELEC's personnel and officials."<br><br>This control and supervision by the COMELEC was assured in the June 23, 2009 hearing of the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments and Revision of Codes and Laws. This is reflected in the following exchange between Senator Francis Escudero and COMELEC Executive Director Jose Tolentino, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"THE CHAIRMAN. Will you deputize the workforce of the winning bidder? Or are you going to deputize by way of additional technological support the students?<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. It would be the students, Mr. Chairman, whom we will deputize.<br><br>With respect to the providers <i>(sic) </i>technical support, we consider them as partners. So, there is really no need for us to deputize them because the supervision and control over the counting center would be solely on the part of the Comelec.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Pero pwede ho nilang pakialaman `yung makina, hindi po ba? Puwede nilang kalikutin `yon, galawin `yon, kasi nga - kung may palpak, di ba?<br><br>So they're employees of Smartmatic without any counterpart authorization or deputization from Comelec. So, anyone can just walk in [and] say, "I am an employee of Smartmatic. Something is wrong with the machine. I'll check it."<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. No. It doesn't work that way, Mr. Chairman.<br><br>First of all, aside from our EO who would be going around all over the municipality to check on the polling centers, Comelec aside from our Information Technology Department personnel, would also be going around to determine the status of the machines on election day.<br><br>And I am even sure that the watchers of the political parties and the candidates will [not] allow anyone to touch a machine if he is not a member of the Board of Election Inspector <i>(sic).</i><br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. But sir, the workforce of on-site technicians are not allowed to touch the machines? Something is wrong with the machine, who is authorized to...<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. Yes, sir. Only when there is a problem with the machine.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Precisely my point, sir. So, then these people be at least known to Comelec.<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. Yes, Mr. Chairman. In fact, they'll be given appropriate identification cards...<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. From Comelec.<br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. Yes, Mr. Chairman.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. That was my question, sir. Because you said a while ago, they're employees only of Smartmatic and you have BEI, anyway.<br><br><b>So, ... under the control and supervision din sila ng Comelec.</b><br><br>MR. TOLENTINO. <b>Yes, Mr. Chairman.</b><br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Yes." (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup></blockquote><br>Finally, the power and duty of the COMELEC to administer election laws and to have control and supervision over the automated elections is not incompatible with the decision to subcontract services that may be better performed by those who are well-equipped to handle complex technological matters with respect to the implementation of the AES.  The subcontractor cannot act independently of the COMELEC.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>D.  Conclusion</b><br></div><br>We are not unaware of the many doomsday scenarios peddled by doubting Thomases if the coming May 2010 elections will be fully automated.  To downgrade these scenarios, let it be emphasized that the PCOS System procured by COMELEC is a paper-based system. It has a provision for system auditability and a voter-verified paper trail. The official ballots may be compared with their digital images stored in the memory cards. All actions done on the machine are stored and can be printed out by the BEI chairperson as an audit log, which includes time stamps. And in the event of problems arising from non-functioning PCOS machines, the official ballots cast in the precincts, which have previously been fed into the locked ballot box, could be used for a manual recount. With these safeguards, the fear of automation failure should not overwhelm us.<br><br>We have been bedevilled in the past by elections that are not free, fair and honest.  These elections have made a mockery of our democracy for they frustrated the sovereign right of the people to choose who ought to rule them.  These elections have also resulted in instability of governments whose legitimacy has been placed in doubt.  All these elections were conducted manually. For the first time, we shall be conducting our May 2010 elections through full automation.  To be sure, full automation will not completely cleanse the dirt in our electoral system.  But it is a big forward step which can lead us to the gateway of real democracy where the vote of the people is sacred and supreme.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to DISMISS the petition.<br><br><b></b><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> CONSTITUTION, Art.

The same legislative scheme was adopted by Congress in RA 8436, although the controlled variable in the first phase of RA 8436 was not the scope of the electoral area but the positions included in the automated tallying. Thus, instead of limiting the use of an automation system in highly urbanized areas and provinces in the first phase, RA 8436 mandated the use of an automated system in the 11 May 1998 elections to canvass the votes cast "only for the positions of president, vice-president, senators, and parties, organizations or coalitions participating under the party-list system."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>One need not search far and wide to see the wisdom, logic and practicality for this legislative insistence on transforming our electoral processes from manual to automated <b>gradually in phases</b>.

The following observations on the laboratory tests by <i>amicus</i> Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines (ITFP), are enlightening:<br><br><blockquote>The demonstration of PCOS only showed that the machine can scan accurately.  Just like any computerized system, designing an Automated Election System (AES) should not only consider hardware that works.  It should also ensure that all the other elements of an automated system such as the communication and transmission devices and networks, the servers, the end-to-end software system, the "peopleware" (project managers, system designers, development, maintenance personnel, operators, trainers, etc.), and the users (voters) mesh together smoothly.  The scanning capability of the hardware has been demonstrated.  The other equally important elements have not. It is these other elements that should now be considered and focused on and be the concentration of the pilot run. <b>The framers of the law (RA 9369), who were assisted by a Technical Working Group (TWG), appreciate[d] the complexities of an automated election system and for that reason included the requirement of a pilot run</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The COMELEC, dangerously parroting the line of the party which stands to profit from the Contract, justifies non-compliance with the partial automation mandated in Section 5, as amended, by treating such partial automation as limited to the 2007 elections. Continuing with their line of reasoning and thus, ignoring the compelling reason behind such partial automation, respondents conclude that if Section 5, as amended, is interpreted as requiring an initial partial use of the automated system before its full deployment nationwide, then "Philippine elections will never be automated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>It may be that, Section 5, as amended, needs statutory interpretation whether a partial automation is a condition precedent to a full national automation.

However, RA 8436 does not bifurcate control and supervision along technical and non-technical lines. On the contrary, Section 26 treated the entire automated system wholistically by mandating that "<b>[t]he System</b> shall be under the exclusive supervision and control of the Commission." Section 26 requires no less than <b>complete</b> and exclusive control and supervision by the COMELEC over the automated system. The regime of partial, non-exclusive COMELEC control over the automated system under the Contract falls short of Section 26's stringent standard.<br><br>A vital policy consideration lies behind the blanket mandate of Section 26.

The ballot, one of the most significant means through which the people directly participate in governance by periodically choosing their representatives, is evolving from purely paper-based to computer-readable and the elections are progressing from manual to automated. Indeed, the means by which popular sovereignty may be exercised through suffrage is about to change considerably. The tsunami of change in our electoral system encourages us to adopt the words of the renowned futurist Alvin Toffler as our own: "We are the children of the new transformation, the Third Wave."<br><br>Back then, there was the <i>papeleta oficial</i>.  It was barely the size of this paper and only one side was written with the titles of seven elective offices. On the space corresponding to each office, a voter wrote the name of the chosen candidate. The voter would then deposit the <i>papeleta</i> in a ballot box and, at the closing of the polls, the votes would be publicly counted and tallied, with a copy of the statement of the results sent by registered mail or special messenger to the provincial treasurer. If heaven cooperated, the election results were known within two months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Through the years, the <i>papeleta</i> evolved into the official ballot, commonly known as the <i>balota</i>. The <i>balota</i> was of uniform size and provided by the Commission on Elections (Comelec). It was printed in black ink on white security paper with distinctive, clear and legible water marks that readily distinguished it from ordinary paper. Each <i>balota</i> was in the shape of a strip with stub and detachable coupon containing the ballot's serial number and a space for the thumbmark of the voter on the detachable coupon. It contained all the names of all the offices to be voted for in the election, allowing opposite the name of each office sufficient space or spaces with horizontal lines where the voter wrote the name or names of individual candidates voted for by him. The voter, after affixing his thumbmark on the detachable coupon in the presence of the board of election inspectors, deposited his <i>balota</i> and the coupon in the respective compartments of the ballot box.  As soon as the voting was finished, the ballots were counted publicly and the totals of votes recorded in the tally board and election returns. The returns were then submitted to the various boards of canvassers (municipal or city, provincial and national) for canvassing.

The provisos of Section 5 merely prescribe the minimum scope of, as well as the conditions for, the implementation of an AES by the Comelec in the 2007 elections. On the other hand, Section 12 simply regulates the capability of the supplies, equipment, materials, software, facilities and other services which the Comelec can procure. <b>Neither provision, however, removes or constrains the mandate of the Comelec to implement an AES nationwide beginning the 2010 elections.</b><br><br>A review of the evolution of Section 5 of RA 8436, as amended, will shed light on the matter.<br><br>Prior to its amendment by RA 9369, Section 5 was numbered Section 6 of RA 8436. It provided that "for the May 11, 1998 elections" the Comelec could use an AES which "shall be applicable in all areas within the country <b>only for </b>the positions of president, vice-president, senators and parties, organizations or coalitions participating under the party-list."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> If by February 9, 1998 it would have become evident that the AES could not be implemented<b> </b>for national positions in the 1998 elections, the provision stated that elections for both national and local positions would be done manually except in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao where the automated election system would be used for all positions. The then Section 6 of RA 8436, therefore, contained the specific limitation or restriction that, while the Comelec may implement an AES nationwide in the 1998 elections, it could do so only for certain national positions. However, it did not provide that if no AES would have been implemented in the 1998 elections, the Comelec would forfeit its mandate to implement an AES nationwide in the succeeding elections.<br><br>As amended and renumbered by RA 9369, (the former Section 6) Section 5 of RA 8436 contains a proviso which provides that "for the regular national and local election, which shall be<b> held immediately after effectivity of this Act</b>," the Comelec shall implement an AES "in<b> at least</b> two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao." The preceding clause is significant in two aspects.<br><br><i>First</i>, it refers solely to the May 14, 2007 synchronized national and local elections because <b>the 2007 elections were the only regular and local elections held immediately after the effectivity of RA 9369.  </b>It was held<b> </b>on<b> </b>February 10, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, by ordinary definition, the phrase "at least" sets a minimum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> scope but does not bar attempts or efforts to exceed or surpass it. The clause in Section 5 deliberately employs the phrase "at least" rather than "not more than" or the word "only" (as in the original text of Section 5). As qualified, the clause means that, in the 2007 elections the Comelec had the discretion to implement an AES within the minimum scope of "two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao," or within the maximum scope of all areas in the country. It did not proscribe the nationwide implementation of an AES in the 2007 elections. Nor does it forbid one in the 2010 and succeeding elections.<br><br>In sum, the aforementioned proviso of Section 5 of RA 8436, as amended, merely delineates the minimum scope of implementation of the AES for the 2007 elections.<br><br>More significantly, in the event that no AES was implemented in the 2007 elections, Section 5 does not prohibit the Comelec from implementing an AES nationwide starting in the 2010 elections. Rather, the last clause of Section 5 is categorical that "<b>in succeeding regular national or local elections, an AES shall be implemented nationwide</b>." And the 2010 elections were the elections that immediately followed the 2007 elections, the regular elections "held immediately after effectivity of [RA 9369]." In other words, the directive of the law itself is clear: <b>the nationwide implementation of the AES commences in the 2010 elections</b>.<br><br>Laws are to be interpreted in a way that will render them effective, not in a manner that will make them inoperative. To insist, as petitioners do, that no nationwide AES can be implemented in the 2010 elections because no AES was implemented in the 2007 elections is to disregard the categorical language of the law. It frustrates and defeats the legislative intent to fully automate the 2010 elections. Indeed, if petitioners' argument were to be pursued to its (not-so-) logical conclusion, RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, would be a dead law. Under petitioners' theory, no AES can be implemented in any future election unless Congress enacts another law. This is so because, according to petitioners themselves, the "condition precedent" for any nationwide implementation of the AES - the implementation of the AES in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao in the 2007 elections - was not complied with.<br><br>Moreover, considering that RA 9369 took effect only on February 10, 2007, it was almost impossible to utilize an AES even in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao during the May 14, 2007 elections. Considering that, from the effectivity date of RA 9369, there was only a little over three months left before the 2007 elections, the additional burden (on the preparations for the 2007 elections) of the procurement process for and implementation of even a partial AES of the said elections would have been a superhuman task. More significantly, the 2007 appropriations for the Comelec did not include a budget for AES. The convergence of time and funding constraints made the implementation of any AES in the 2007 elections impossible for the Comelec to conduct. <i>Nemo tenetur ad impossibile.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The law obliges no one to perform an impossibility. Laws and rules must be interpreted in a way that they are in accordance with logic, common sense, reason and practicality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended, relevantly states that "[p]articipation in the 2007 pilot exercise shall not be conclusive of the system's fitness." This has a two-fold implication on petitioners' position. <i>One</i>, since participation in the intended automation of the 2007 elections was not a conclusive determinant of the system's fitness, partial automation of the 2007 elections pursuant to the proviso of Section 5 (assuming it was a condition for the full/nationwide automation of elections starting 2010) was merely preferable, not indispensable. <i>Two</i>, the fact that the PCOS machines were not pilot-tested in the 2007 elections has no significant bearing on the fitness and suitability of those machines for the elections to be held subsequent to the 2007 polls.<br><br>The Senate proceedings invoked by petitioners do not at all indicate that partial implementation of the AES in the 2007 elections is a condition<i> sine qua non</i> to its full implementation in the 2010 elections. A close reading of the transcript of the proceedings reveals that, in urging his colleagues to approve the proviso in Section 5 (that AES be implemented in at least two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao), Sen. Richard Gordon, the principal sponsor of Senate Bill No. 2231, was merely underscoring the need to demonstrate the possibility and viability of poll automation even in the 2007 elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Nowhere in the transcript cited by petitioners did the Senate proscribe the nationwide implementation of the AES beginning the 2010 elections if no partial AES was implemented in the 2007 elections.<br><br>In addition to the clarity of the language of RA 8436, as amended by RA 9369, as well as the legislative intent to have the nationwide implementation of the AES starting the 2010 elections, the intent of the lawmakers can furthermore be seen from the passage of RA 9525 on March 23, 2009. With this law, an P11,301,790,000 supplemental appropriations was specifically made for the automation of the 2010 elections. When Congress passed RA 9525, it was well aware that there was no pilot-testing of the PCOS in any previous Philippine electoral exercise. Nonetheless, Section 2 of the law states that the sum should be disbursed to ensure the "transparency and accuracy in the selection of the relevant technology of the machines to be used on <b>May 10, 2010 automated national and local election[s]</b>."<br><br>In fine, under Section 5 in relation to Section 1 of RA 8436, as amended, the mandate of the Comelec to prescribe the adoption and use of an AES is complete. It can determine which suitable technology of demonstrated capability to adopt for an AES. It can determine which, between a paper-based or a direct recording electronic election system, is more appropriate and practical. More notably, in the 2007 elections, it could decide whether to implement an AES within a maximum scope of all areas in the country or within the minimum scope of two highly urbanized cities and two provinces each in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.  And in the 2010 and succeeding elections, its <b>unqualified mandate</b> is to implement an AES nationwide.<br><br>Therefore, when it issued the notice of award to and executed the contract with Smartmatic-TIM for the nationwide implementation of an AES in the 2010 elections, the Comelec acted pursuant to its mandate and did not violate Section 5 of RA 8436 as amended by RA 9369.<br><br>Neither did the Comelec violate Section 12 of RA 8436, as amended. The provision merely requires that, to implement a nationwide AES starting from the 2010 elections, the Comelec must procure a system that has a demonstrated capability and has been successfully used in a prior electoral exercise here or <b>abroad</b>, though application of the system in the 2007 elections would not have been conclusive evidence of its fitness. Clearly, it is not imperative that the system was successfully applied in the 2007 elections; it suffices that the system can be shown to have been viable in an election abroad. As the Comelec averred, the system it procured for the 2010 elections was successfully employed in prior electoral exercises in New Brunswick and New York in 2008 and in Ontario in 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b>DID THE JUNE 10, 2009 NOTICE OF AWARD<br>AND THE JULY 10, 2009 CONTRACT COMPLY<br>WITH REQUIREMENTS ON BIDDING ELIGIBILITY? </b><b></b><br><br>Petitioners impugn the notice of award and contract in favor of Smartmatic TIM on the ground that the latter violated the RFP when it failed to submit a valid joint venture agreement (JVA), a copy of its single largest contract for the last three years, an ISO 9001 certificate and an environmental protection agency certification.<br><br>Petitioners are wrong.<br><br><b>Validity of the JVA</b><br><br><b>    </b>Under RA 9184,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to be eligible to bid for a project involving the procurement of goods, a joint venture must submit a valid JVA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which must be duly notarized and under oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><sup> </sup>It is further required by Section 8 of RA 7042 in relation to EO 584 that Filipino ownership or interest in the joint venture be at least 60%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><sup>  </sup><br><br><sup>    </sup>The foregoing requirements were reiterated under Items 2.2.4 and 2.2.6.2.1 of the RFP.<br><br>On April 23, 2009 Smartmatic and TIM constituted themselves into an unincorporated joint venture under a JVA.

Their lack of community of interest surfaced in late June 2009 when the two entities publicly bickered over their rights and obligations. Moreover, petitioners claim that the JVA is defective because it left out key parties to the automation project, namely, Jarltech from which Smartmatic will procure the PCOS machines, Dominion which owns the copyright to the software for the PCOS machines and 2Go which will be responsible for transporting/distributing PCOS machines throughout the country. Petitioners insist that the inclusion of Jarltech, Dominion and 2Go in the joint venture is indispensable to hold them solidarily liable with Smartmatic-TIM for any problem that may arise from the use of their automation system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><sup>  </sup><br><br>Petitioners exaggerate the eligibility requirements of the law.<br><br>RA 9184 and its implementing rules only require that the JVA be valid and notarized.

So long as it meets the essential requisites of a contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and is embodied in a public document, a JVA is valid regardless of its incorporation through registration with the SEC. Where the law makes no distinction, no distinction need be made.<br><br>Since the validity of the JVA is separate and distinct from its incorporation, I cannot subscribe to petitioners' position that the incorporation of the Smartmatic and TIM JVA must also be required for purposes of the bidding.  To hold that the JVA ought to be accompanied by articles of incorporation is to unduly add to the requirement of the law and its implementing regulations, in the guise of interpretation or construction.<br><br><i>    </i>Even without an accompanying incorporation paper, a JVA is considered valid if notarized and under oath.

Further, it is advised that the JVAs should specifically state the name of the person who is appointed as the lawful attorney-in-fact of the JV to sign the contract, if awarded, and the member who is the lead representative of the concerned JV.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>It would likewise be an unreasonable imposition not only on Smartmatic-TIM to absorb into their joint venture each and every entity they do business with, but also on the Comelec to transact directly with all these other entities. Aware of this, the Comelec's Instruction to Bidders allowed the bidders to subcontract portions of the goods or services under the automation project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>RA 9184 provides under Article XVI for direct contracting as one of the alternative methods of procurement. Direct contracting or single source procurement does not require elaborate bidding because all the supplier needs to do is submit a price quotation, which offer may then be accepted immediately, but only under the following conditions: (a) when the goods may be obtained only from the proprietary source because patents, trade secrets and copyrights prohibit others from manufacturing the same item; (b) when procurement of critical components from a specific manufacturer, supplier or distributor is a condition precedent to hold a contractor to guarantee its project performance and (c) those sold by an exclusive dealer or manufacturer, which does not have a sub-dealer selling. Clearly then, the intention of RA 9184 is not to compel government agencies to deal with every copyright-holder, exclusive manufacturer and exclusive distributor; otherwise, it will restrict the mode of procurement to direct contracting only. Thus, there is no compulsion under the law for the Comelec to contract with Dominion as the holder of the copyright to the PCOS machine or with Jarltech as the manufacturer thereof or 2Go as the transporter/distributor of the PCOS machines. What is crucial is that Smartmatic-TIM assumes solidary liability for the principal prestation of the July 10, 2009 contract and the RFP, and that it stipulates (under Article 3.3 of the contract) that "the performance of portions thereof by other persons or entities not parties to this Contract shall not relieve [it] of said obligations and concomitant liabilities."<br><br><b>Compliance with the Nationality Requirement</b><br><br>Regarding the ownership requirement under RA 7042 and the RFP, the JVA and articles of incorporation of Smartmatic-TIM categorically state that 60% of the shares of the joint venture shall be held by TIM itself or its subsidiary while 40% shall be held by Smartmatic itself or its subsidiary, but each shall be jointly and severally liable to the Comelec for the obligations of the other under the RFP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>However, notwithstanding the clarity of the provisions of the JVA and the articles of incorporation, petitioners argue that the 60-40% control of the joint venture by TIM and Smartmatic, respectively, is merely on paper and that, in reality, Smartmatic has control equal to or greater than TIM.  According to petitioners, Smartmatic's nominated director can determine the quorum in the board of directors and the executive committee, and approve or veto the acts of the board or executive committee. Smartmatic alone can nominate the chairman of the board, the treasurer and the corporate secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>But then, it is not the management but the ownership of the joint venture Smartmatic-TIM which is required to be at least 60% Filipino.

The certification further indicates "the name of the vendor Smartmatic Group, the name of procuring entity CNE, the period of the contract -- between 01 June 2008 to 28 February 2009 and the description of goods and services provided -- to provide voting machines and supplies for the elections in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><sup> </sup>Thus, the Comelec-SBAC recommended that this certification be admitted under Section 19, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court as it was issued by a government of another country and duly authenticated by the officials of the Philippine embassy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Comelec-SBAC's recommendation was approved by the Comelec <i>en banc</i> in Resolution No. 8608 dated June 9, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>There is no cogent reason to overturn the resolution of the Comelec <i>en banc</i> approving the recommendation of the Comelec-SBAC on this matter. It should be borne in mind that, as expressly stated in Section 23.11.1.1, Rule VIII of the implementing rules of RA 9184, the purpose of the requirement is to establish the track record of the prospective bidder of having completed within the last three years a single contract similar to the contract to be bidded out.  This purpose was served when CNE certified that Smartmatic had implemented in Venezuela a $141 Million project similar to the one it was bidding for. With such authenticated information made available to it, the Comelec correctly dispensed with a copy of the contract itself.<br><br>The Comelec also did not err in accepting the ISO 9000 and EPA certifications submitted by Smartmatic-TIM. Though not required under RA 9184, ISO 9000 and EPA certificates are required under the RFP. An ISO certificate is intended to assure the Comelec "that the manufacturing process of the solution provider complies with international standards."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  This purpose is nevertheless still achieved if the PCOS machines are produced by a facility that has an ISO 9000 certification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><sup> </sup>It is of record that the PCOS machines to be procured by the Comelec are manufactured for Smartmatic by its subsidiary Jarltech. Thus, the ISO certification of Jarltech provides sufficient assurance that the PCOS machines are manufactured according to international standards.<br><br>The same principle applies to the EPA certificate. Its purpose is to establish that the product to be procured meets the environmental standards of the country of origin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The EPA certificate submitted by Smartmatic-TIM serves that purpose even though it is in the name of Kenmec Mechanical Engineering Company (Kenmec). As found by the Comelec-SBAC, Kenmec has an outsourcing manufacturing contract with Jarltech under which Kenmec will provide a space within its facility where Smartmatic, through Jarltech, will assemble and manufacture the PCOS machines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> It is logical for the EPA certificate to be issued to Kenmec's facility.<br><br>In sum, Smartmatic-TIM substantially complied with the technical requirements for eligibility. Accordingly, no bidding requirement under the law and the RFP was violated by the notice of award and the contract issued to Smartmatic-TIM.<br><br><b>DOES THE JULY 10, 2009 CONTRACT<br>DIMINISH THE COMELEC'S<br>CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE?</b><br><br>The Constitution appointed the Comelec as the sole authority to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum and recall,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and to decide all questions affecting elections, except those involving the right to vote,.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Petitioners deplore what they claim to be a denigration of the mandate of the Comelec through the following provisions in its contract with Smartmatic-TIM:<br><br><blockquote>3.3   The PROVIDER<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> shall be liable for all its obligations under this Project, and the performance of portions thereof by other persons or entities not parties to this Contract shall not relieve the PROVIDER of said obligations and concomitant liabilities.<br><br>SMARTMATIC, as the joint venture partner with the greater track record in automated elections, shall be in charge of the technical aspects of the counting and canvassing software and hardware, including transmission configuration and system integration.

Article 3.3 of the contract authorizes Smartmatic to supervise and control the technical aspect of the AES, whereas under Section 26 of RA 8436, it is the Comelec information technology department (Comelec-ITD) which should be given such control. On the other hand, Articles 6.7 and 7.4 of the contract assign to Smartmatic-TIM portions of the electoral responsibilities of the Comelec, whereas the Constitution mandates the authority of the Comelec to be exclusive.<br></blockquote><br>Moreover, by virtue of Articles 21.1 and 21.4 of the contract, bid document no. 10 is deemed part thereof.  According to the bid document, it is Smartmatic-TIM which shall generate the digital signature and assign the same to all the members of the board of inspectors, the board of canvassers, the Comelec, the Senate President and the House Speaker. To petitioners' mind, since Smartmatic-TIM has custody of the digital signature, it has virtual control of the election result as it is the digital signature which authenticates the election returns for the canvassing of votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' fears are unfounded.<br><br><sup>    </sup>We expect that, with the advent of electronic voting, procurement contracts will be accompanied by concerns about their tendency to obscure traditional lines of responsibility. Nonetheless, well-designed and carefully-crafted contracts will represent neither an abdication of the Comelec's mandate nor a restraint on the Comelec's oversight powers, but rather a valid reconfiguration much needed in election administration.<br><br>The Comelec took pains to draft a contract that preserves its constitutional and statutory responsibilities and at the same time meets the novel contingencies resulting from the automation of elections.<br><br>For the 2010 automated elections, the Comelec exercises not only exclusive supervision and control of the electoral process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><sup> </sup>including the discretion over which suitable technology to adopt and use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Article 6.7 of the contract reiterates the authority of the Comelec over the purely electoral component of the process, thus:<br><br><blockquote>6.7   Subject to the provisions of the General Instructions to be issued by the Commission En Banc, the entire processes of voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes shall be conducted by Comelec's personnel and officials x x x.<br></blockquote><br>With respect to the technical component of the Comelec's authority in the automation of elections, several specialized units have been created under RA 8436 and RA 9369 to support the Commission: (1) an Information Technology Department tasked to carry out the full administration and implementation of the AES;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (2) an Advisory Council on Information and Communication and Technology,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> headed by the Chairman of the Commission, tasked to recommend the technology to be applied in the AES and to advise and assist in the review of its system's planning, inception, development, testing, operationalization and evaluation stages and in the identification, assessment and resolution of systems problems or inadequacies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and (3) a Technical Evaluation Committee tasked to certify that, based on documented evaluation, the hardware and software components of the chosen AES are operating properly, securely, and accurately, in accordance with the provisions of RA 9369.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Moreover, under the contract, the Comelec committed to create a project management office (PMO) that will oversee the execution and implementation of the automation project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Thus, both under the law and the contract, it is clear that each of the foregoing units of the Comelec is assigned specific technical functions in support of the AES.<br><br>On the other hand, Smartmatic is given a specific and limited technical task to assist the Comelec in implementing the AES. The highly specialized language of the contract circumscribes the role of Smartmatic.<br><br>For instance, while, under Article 6.7, the counting and canvassing of votes are the responsibilities of the Comelec, under Article 3.3, the technical aspects of the "counting and canvassing software and hardware, including transmission configuration and system integration," and the "[prevention] and troubleshooting [of] technical problems that may arise during the election" are the responsibilities of Smartmatic. The delineation of roles is clear and the tasks assigned to Smartmatic are specific. By no stretch of interpretation can Article 3.3 be deemed to mean that Smartmatic shall count and canvass the votes.<br><br>Still under Article 6.7, it is the Comelec through its personnel and officials that shall conduct the entire processes of voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes. The Comelec, jointly with Smartmatic, will ensure that the performance, completion and final results of these processes meet the stipulated specifications and schedules. This a reasonable assignment of role to Smartmatic, considering that, under Articles 3.1.a, 3.1.b and 3.2 of the contract, Smartmatic-TIM undertakes to ensure the proper, satisfactory and timely execution and completion of the entire scope of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> There is no reason to view it as a diminution of the exclusive mandate of the Comelec to control the conduct of the elections.<br><br>It has likewise not been established that, under Article 7.4 of the contract, the Comelec abnegated its mandate. It must be borne in mind that the contract entered into by the Comelec is a mere lease with option to purchase. Hence, it will be grossly disadvantageous to the Comelec if, upon delivery of the goods by Smartmatic-TIM, custody thereof will be immediately transferred to it, for then liability for damage to or loss of the goods while in storage will be borne by it. It is bad enough that Filipino taxpayers are footing the bill for the continued storage of machines in the scrapped Mega Pacific consortium automation deal. It will be worse if they should likewise be answerable for any PCOS machine that is damaged or lost during storage.<br><br><b>Are the Sanctity of the Ballot and the<br> Integrity of the Automated Electoral <br>Process Compromised By the July 10, <br>2009 Contract? </b><br><br>The more serious argument raised by petitioners has to do with the sanctity of the ballot and the integrity of the AES.<br><br>Petitioners argue that the constitutional right of the people to the secrecy and sanctity of their ballot is compromised by the requirement under the contract and the RFP that the ballot be approximately three-feet long and pre-printed with the names of at least 600 candidates and that it be manually fed into the PCOS machine with the assistance of a Smartmatic-TIM employee, when needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Under Section 2, Article V of the Constitution, it is Congress which is primarily tasked with the duty to provide a system of securing the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot. In fulfillment of its duty, Congress adopted the following provisions in RA 9369, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 13. Section 11 of Republic Act No. 8436 is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec.15. <i>Official Ballot</i>. -- <b>The Commission shall prescribe the format of the electronic display and/or the size and form of the official ballot, which shall contain the titles of the position to be filled and/or the proposition to be voted upon in an initiative, referendum or plebiscite</b>. <b>Where practicable, electronic displays must be constructed to present the names of all candidates for the same position in the same page or screen, otherwise, the electronic displays must be constructed to present the entire ballot to the voter, in a series of sequential pages, and to ensure that the voter sees all of the ballot options on all pages before completing his or her vote and to allow the voter to review and change all ballot choices prior to completing and casting his or her ballot. Under each position to be filled, the names of candidates shall be arranged alphabetically by surname and uniformly indicated using the same type size</b>. The maiden or married name shall be listed in the official ballot, as preferred by the female candidate. Under each proposition to be vote upon, the choices should be uniformly indicated using the same font and size.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;            x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;            x x x<br></div><br>Sec. 18. <i>Procedure in voting</i>. -- The Commission shall prescribe the manner and procedure of voting, which can be easily understood and followed by the voters, taking into consideration, among other things, the secrecy of the voting.<br></blockquote><br>While delegating to the Comelec the determination of the size and form of the ballot, Congress prescribed the following minimum requirements of its content: (1) that it shall contain the titles of the position to be filled and/or the proposition to be voted upon in an initiative, referendum or plebiscite; (2) that  under each position to be filled, the names of candidates shall be arranged alphabetically by surname and uniformly indicated using the same type size and (3) that the voter must see all of the ballot options on all pages before completing his or her vote and to allow the voter to review and change all ballot choices prior to completing and casting his or her ballot.<br><br>In effect, the basic contents of the ballot as required by Congress dictate the size and form of the ballot that the Comelec shall prescribe. For as long as the requirements are met, the system of secrecy and sanctity of the ballot adopted by Congress under RA 9369 is deemed observed by the Comelec.<br><br>There is no showing that the size and form of the PCOS ballot as prescribed by the Comelec do not fulfill the minimum contents required by Congress. In fact, the three-foot, two-page ballot filled with 600 entries in font 10 was deliberately adopted by the Comelec to conform to the requirements of existing laws on the number of elective positions, and in anticipation of the possible number of candidates vying for these positions.<br><br>Moreover, there is no inherent flaw in the voting procedure adopted by the Comelec whereby each voter must manually feed the ballot into the PCOS machine. There are sufficient safeguards to the secrecy of the voting process in that the voter alone will hold the ballot and feed it to the PCOS machine. It is all up to the voter whether to discard caution and disclose the contents of the ballot. The law can only do so much in protecting its sanctity. Besides, assuming that the requirement under the contract between the Comelec and Smartmatic-TIM as to the size of the ballot poses concerns in connection with the secrecy of the ballot, the Comelec is not without power to issue the necessary rules and regulations that will effectively address them. Such rules and regulations may include the specific manner on how assistance on feeding the ballot to a PCOS machine may be rendered to a voter to avoid compromising the secrecy of the ballot.<br><br>Finally, petitioners are alarmed that the digital signature, security keys, source code and removable memory card are at the disposal of Smarmatic-TIM. They argue that all this puts Smartmatic-TIM in control not only of the process but also the outcome of the election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>There are highly technical, specialized interstitial matters that Congress does not decide itself but delegates to specialized agencies to decide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In RA 9369, Congress delegated to not just one but four specialized bodies the duty to ensure that the AES to be adopted for the 2010 elections will be the most appropriate and secure. These are the Comelec itself, the Comelec-ITD, the Advisory Council and the Technical Evaluation Committee. I am not prepared to say that we should doubt their ability and their dedication to ensure compliance with the minimum capabilities and features of the AES, as prescribed under Sections 6 and 7 of RA 9369.<br><br>It is significant that among the functions of the Advisory Council is to "provide advice and/or assistance in the identification, assessment and resolution of systems problems or inadequacies as may surface or resurface in the course of the bidding, acquisition, testing, operationalization, re-use, storage or disposition of the AES equipment and/or resources as the case may be."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  Furthermore, the Technical Evaluation Committee is assigned these functions:<br><br>Sec. 9. New sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 are hereby provided to read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 11. <i>Functions of the Technical Evaluation Committee</i>.-- <b>The Committee shall certify, through an established international certification entity to be chosen by the Commission from the recommendations of the Advisory Council, not later than three months before the date of the electoral exercises, categorically stating that the AES, including its hardware and software components, is operating properly, securely, and accurately, in accordance with the provisions of this Act based, among others, on the following documented results:</b><br><br>1. The successful conduct of a field testing process followed by a mock election event in one or more cities/municipalities;<br><br>2. The successful completion of audit on the accuracy, functionally and security controls of the AES software;<br><br>3. The successful completion of a source code review;<br><br>4.

A certification that the source code reviewed is one and the same as that used by the equipment; and<br><br>6. The development, provisioning, and operationalization of a continuity plan to cover risks to the AES at all points in the process such that a failure of elections, whether at voting, counting or consolidation, may be avoided. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>It has not been satisfactorily shown that the Advisory Council and the Technical Evaluation Committee have shirked their duties.  They have not even been given the chance to perform them yet they are already being torpedoed. At this point, the Court should not even attempt to interfere in the work of these specialized bodies and arrogate their functions by deciding highly technical issues that are within their expertise and knowledge, and which the law itself has assigned to them for determination. The Court has to exercise judicial restraint and not pretend to be an expert in something it is not really familiar with. Our function is merely to decide if automation and its implementing contract(s) are legal or not. It is not to find fault in it and certainly, not to determine to what extent the law should be or should not be implemented. After a half century of electoral debacle, there looms in the horizon the dawn of a truly honest, systematic and modern electoral system. But we have to cast our fears and insecurities aside, and take the first step -- unsure as it may be -- to witness its coming.<br><br>Fifteen years ago, the government launched the first on-line lottery ("lotto") system in the country.  Back then, brickbats flew thick and fast -- that it was nothing but a government racket on a grand scale, that it had a built-in capability to cheat people of their hard-earned money, that government was abdicating a big part of its finances to the Malaysians, that its computers were going to be used to cheat in the elections and a slew of pseudo-intellectual arguments <i>ad nauseam</i>.  But what has lotto become today?  It has become one of the most successful government projects ever, heralded as one of the better lottery systems in any developing country. Practically the entire nation has been "wired together" under one efficient computer system. It has brought in billions to the government coffers and has helped millions of poor beneficiaries of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. What could have come out of it if the correct first step had never been boldly taken?<br><br><b>A Final Word</b><br><br>We are the final generation of an old civilization and the first generation of a new one. Much of our personal confusion, anguish and disorientation can be traced directly to the conflict within us and within our political institutions, between the dying Second Wave civilization and the emergent Third Wave civilization that is thundering in to take its place.  Toffler's words fittingly describe the state of our electoral system.<br><br>Congress has vested the Comelec with the authority to modernize the Philippine electoral system through the adoption of an AES. In the exercise of the said authority and considering the nature of the office of the Comelec as an independent constitutional body specifically tasked to enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections, the Comelec enjoys wide latitude in carrying out its mandate. No worst-case scenarios painted by doomsayers, no speculative political catastrophe should be the basis of invalidating the Comelec's official acts. Only when the exercise by the Comelec of its discretion is done with grave abuse will this Court nullify the challenged discretionary act. Otherwise, the institutional independence of the Comelec will be unduly restricted and eroded, and its constitutional and statutory prerogatives encroached upon. This Court should not allow that in any situation.  This Court should not allow that in this case.<br><br>Let us welcome the significant change in our electoral system that is the automated election system. The future is upon us. It beckons as it poses the challenge of spurring technological innovation and safeguarding values like accuracy and transparency in our electoral system.  Let us not turn our backs on it simply out of speculation and fear.

Roxas') amendment will take acts of Congress to continue AES.<br><br>In other words, Congress has to act to continue the automated election system. <b>In our proposal, it will take an act of Congress to stop AES.

Automated election, first tested in the ARMM election on August 11, 2008, shall sooner or later be applied at the national level.  The development, to be sure, is a change that we should welcome for the promises it brings - a peaceful, clean, orderly, fair, honest, efficient, and credible election. The fulfillment of this promise, however, is not a result that we can simply wish into our national life.  Nor is it something we can attain in a hurry. Fulfillment is a result that the whole country must plan, work, and sacrifice for.<br><br><b>Interface of Powers: COMELEC and the Supreme Court</b><br><br>At the forefront in the national effort to achieve a computerized election system is, of course, the Commission on Elections (<i>COMELEC</i>) - the independent constitutional body tasked with the enforcement and administration of all election laws and regulations. The Supreme Court, as the court of last resort tasked to guard the Constitution and our laws through interpretation and adjudication of judiciable controversies, is an indispensable partner and participant in this endeavor, as the Constitution itself safeguards and regulates our electoral processes and policies, which are expressed through laws and COMELEC regulations.  In fact, about five years ago, this Court decisively spoke on the matter of automation when we invalidated the "Mega Pacific Contract" between the COMELEC and Mega Pacific Consortium for the automation of the May 10, 2004 elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Once again, we are called upon today with the daunting task of passing upon the validity of another election automation contract, this time between the COMELEC and Smartmatic International Corporation - Total Information Management Corporation (<i>SMARTMATIC-TIM</i>) for the coming May 10, 2010 elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  In undertaking this task, I duly acknowledge that the COMELEC exercises considerable latitude and the widest discretion in adopting its chosen means and methods of discharging its tasks, particularly in its broad power "to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum and recall."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Court has interpreted this provision to mean the grant to "COMELEC [of] all the necessary and incidental powers for it to achieve the objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> - an  expansive view of COMELEC powers that is not at all novel.  For, as early as 1941 under the 1935 Constitution, the Court already emphasized in <i>Sumulong v. COMELEC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>The Commission on Elections is a constitutional body. It is intended to play a distinct and important part in our scheme of government. In the discharge of its functions, it should not be hampered with restrictions that would be fully warranted in the case of a less responsible organization. The Commission may err, so may this court also. <b>It should be allowed considerable latitude in devising means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created-free, orderly and honest elections. We may not agree fully with its choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion, this court should not interfere.</b><br><br>Politics is a practical matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically not from the standpoint of pure theory. The Commission on Elections, because of its fact-finding facilities, its contacts with political strategists, and its knowledge derived from actual experience in dealing with political controversies, is in a peculiarly advantageous position to decide complex political questions. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote><br>The automation question now before us, like any other COMELEC administration and enforcement matter, is a concern that COMELEC is entitled by law to handle on its own without any interference from any outside agency, not even from this Court, except pursuant to the allocation of powers that the Constitution has mandated. In other words, the COMELEC reigns supreme in determining how automation shall be phased in, how it shall affect all aspects of our electoral exercise, and how it shall operate, subject only to our intervention when our own constitutional duty calls for enforcement. Specifically, we cannot close our eyes when a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction has been committed, such as when the COMELEC acts outside the contemplation of the Constitution and of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Consistent with this view, I do not aim to question the bidding the COMELEC undertook and its compliance with our automation laws - Republic Act (<i>RA</i>) Nos. 8436<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and 9369<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> - in the absence of any violation sufficiently gross to amount to the proscribed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  My focus, rather, is on the gut issues that really strike at the heart of the right of suffrage and place the integrity of our electoral process at risk.<br><br><b><u>The Pilot Testing Issue</u></b><br><br>For one, I do not question the COMELEC's present automation moves for lack of prior pilot testing - a point that has generated a lot of comment from both the <i>ponencia</i> and the separate opinions.  I believe that raising a question on this point is misplaced because the disputed provision - Section 5 of RA No. 8436 as amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> - does not <i>categorically and expressly</i> demand a pilot test and, in fact, does not even mention the term "pilot test."  As worded, this provision should be read in the context of its title "<i>Authority to Use an Automated Election System.</i>" Thus, the provision is essentially a grant of authority to automate, with the automation being a limited one in the election immediately following the law's passage and only going nationwide in the "succeeding regular national or local elections."  A pilot test is not an absolute necessity because it was never imposed as a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to a nationwide automation; Section 5 merely expressed a limit on the extent of automation that could take place in the election following the passage of RA No. 9369; the automated election must be partial and local.  The COMELEC first exercised its authority to partially automate in the ARMM election held on August 11, 2008, so that this automated electoral exercise was effectively the "pilot exercise" the country embarked on in electoral automation.  It can very well be, as the COMELC posits, the pilot test that Section 5, RA No. 8436, as amended, mentioned.<br><br>Strictly speaking, the use of automation for the first time in the ARMM election was not a violation of the limitation that Section 5 imposed, because the automation was properly local and partial.  If there had been a violation at all, the violation was in the failure to use automation in the next following election after the passage of RA No. 9369 (in the 2007 national and local elections) and in the failure to strictly follow the terms of Section 5 in the first automated election, because the automated election took place only in portions of Mindanao. These violations, however, pertained to that first use of automation in the ARMM election, or, if at all, to the failure to use automation in the 2007 elections.  They need not affect the automation for the May 10, 2010 election, whose budget for a nationally-implemented automated election Congress specifically provided for despite knowledge that no automation took place in the 2007 election as originally envisioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  From this perspective, pilot testing is an issue that does not need to trigger the Court's <i>certiorari</i> powers invoked in the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Abdication Issue</b><br><br>Despite the above conclusion, I still take exception to the present implementation of election automation, as it involves another more fundamental violation: the COMELEC, contrary to the Constitution and the law, now shares automation responsibilities with SMARTMATIC-TIM under their Automation Contract.  In my view, this is a violation that transgresses the Constitution, at the same time that it is an action plainly outside the contemplation of the law.  Based on this characterization, this sharing of responsibility over automation is a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC that calls for the active intervention of this Court, pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>I take this view in light of Section 2, Article IX-C of the Constitution that commands the "COMELEC to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election" and thereby gives the COMELEC <i>sole authority</i> to undertake enforcement and administrative actions in the conduct of elections.  In the context of the present case, this constitutional mandate necessarily extends to the enforcement of Section 26 of RA No. 8436<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which states in full:  <b>    </b><br><br><blockquote>Section 26. Supervision and control. - The System shall be under the <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive</span> supervision and control of the Commission</b>.  For this purpose, there is hereby created an <b style="text-decoration: underline;">information technology department</b> in the Commission to carry out the <b>full administration and implementation of the System</b>.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Commission shall take immediate steps as may be necessary for the acquisition, installation, administration, storage and maintenance of equipment and devices</b>, and to promulgate the necessary rules and regulations for the effective implementation of this Act. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote><br>Rather than the exclusive supervision and control that this provision envisions, the COMELEC effectively shares responsibilities with SMARTMATIC-TIM in the automated May 10, 2010 elections by giving complete control of the technical aspects of this election to a private entity - SMARTMATIC-TIM. In the words of the petition, this was an <b>"abdication"</b> of the COMELEC's constitutional mandate, evidenced by the terms of Articles 3.3, 6.7 and 7.4 of the Automation Contract and by the grant to SMARTMATIC-TIM of the public and private keys to the voting equipment.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The<i> Ponencia</i> and the Issue of Abdication   </b><br><br>In addressing the issue, the <i>ponencia</i> strangely uses the same Articles cited above in arguing that COMELEC did not relinquish its control over the technical aspect of the Automated Election System (<i>AES</i>). It asserts that Article 3.3 of the Automation Contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (which designates SMARTMATIC-TIM as the joint venture partner in charge of the technical aspect of the counting and canvassing software and hardware including transmission configuration and system integration) does not translate to ceding control of the electoral process to SMARTMATIC-TIM. To the <i>ponencia, </i>SMARTMATIC-TIM's designated role is simply an eligibility requirement imposed on bidders operating under a joint venture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  The <i>ponencia </i>also supports this view by referring to the Request for Proposals <i>(RFP)</i> whose notice is for bids from a "complete solutions provider which can provide experienced and effective overall nationwide project management service and total customer support under COMELEC supervision and control to ensure the effective and successful implementation of the Project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> further points to Article 6.7 of the Automation Contract which provides:<br><br><blockquote>6.7 Subject to the provisions of the General Instructions to be issued by the Commission En Banc, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the entire processes</span> of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes shall be conducted by COMELEC's personnel and officials</span>, </b>and their <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">performance, completion and final results</span> according to specifications and within the specified periods <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall be the shared responsibility</span> of COMELEC and PROVIDER</b>. [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote><br>To the <i>ponencia, </i>this provision apparently speaks for itself as it requires action by COMELEC's own personnel.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>also found the petitioners' allegation that SMARTMATIC-TIM has control over the public and private keys necessary to operate the Precinct Count Optical Scan (<i>PCOS</i>) machines to be speculative and without factual basis. Instead, it agreed with the opinion of the National Computer Center that the "nowhere in the RFP/TOR was it indicated that the COMELEC would delegate to [SMARTMATIC-TIM] full discretion, supervision and control over the [public and private keys]."<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Refutation of the <i>Ponencia's</i> Positions</b><br><br><b>a. </b><b>Effect of Automation</b><br><br>In my view, the <i>ponencia</i> has taken the above positions because it viewed the cited Articles in isolation and really did not take into account the whole election process and the effect of automation on this process.  Be it remembered that an election entails an extended process that starts even before actual voting begins when voters register. Voting itself is only a part of the process, as this is followed by the counting of the votes by the Board of Election Inspectors (<i>BEI</i>), the canvassing of the tallied votes by the Board of Canvassers (<i>BOC</i>), the transmission and consolidation of the canvassed results to the municipal, provincial and a national BOC, and finally the announcement and proclamation of the winners. True enough, the people undertaking all these activities, particularly in the <i>traditional</i> voting process, have been COMELEC officials, employees, and duly deputized government personnel. This consideration, however, is not enough in passing upon the COMELEC-SMARTMATIC-TIM arrangement under the Automation Contract.<br><br><b>b. </b><b>The <i>Ponencia's</i> Omissions</b><br><br>What the <i>ponencia</i> did not sufficiently explain is the COMELEC's intent to introduce a new way of voting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that affects. not only on the act of casting votes, but also the whole manner by which the counting and canvassing of votes, the transmission and collation of results, and the proclamation of winners are to be undertaken.  All these are reflected in detail in the RFP, heretofore mentioned, whose call was for a <i>"complete systems provider, and not just a vendor, which can provide experienced and effective overall nationwide project management service and total customer support (covering all areas of project implementation including technical support, training, information, campaign support, civil and electrical works service, warehousing, deployment, installation and pullout, contingency planning, etc.) under COMELEC supervision and control..."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  All these automation activities are intrusions into the traditional COMELEC domain and cannot be simply glossed over.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> likewise failed to mention that Section 26 of RA No. 8436 categorically required that the AES to be installed shall be under COMELEC's <b style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">supervision and control</b>; for this purpose, the law created an <b>Information Technology Department </b>(<i>ITD</i>) within the COMELEC to carry out the <b>full administration and implementation of the system</b>.  Underlying the COMELEC's mandate of exclusive supervision and control over the AES in Section 26 is the adoption of measures for the "acquisition, <b>installation</b>, <b>administration</b>, <b>storage</b> and <b>maintenance</b> of equipment and devices and the promulgation of the necessary rules and regulations for the effective implementation of RA No. 8436."<br><br><b>c. </b><b>Section 26 of RA No. 8436</b><br><br>Under Section 26, the mandate of the law is clear - the operative word used is "<b>exclusive," </b>which means that the automation responsibility given to the COMELEC cannot be shared with any other entity. Specifically, it means that the COMELEC, through its ITD, shall have full and exclusive control over the entire process of voting, counting, transmission, consolidation and canvassing of votes, including their performance and completion and the final results.  No special interpretative skill is necessary to appreciate the meaning of "exclusive." "Supervision and control," on the other hand, are terms that have practically attained technical legal meaning from jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  "Control" as the established cases signify means to exercise restraining or directing influence over; to dominate, regulate; hence, to hold from action; to curb; to subject; also to overpower.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In any interpretation of Section 26, these are key terms and the standards that should predominate in determining whether this Section has been complied with. The <i>ponencia</i>, unfortunately does not appear to have considered this Section at all.<br><br><b>d. </b><b>The Information Technology Department </b><br><br>Given the bidding terms and the qualification imposed on the "complete systems provider," what the ITD remained to do after the systems provider is in place becomes a puzzle whose elusive answer is nowhere to be found in the laws and the regulations in place.  Presumably, the ITD can still couch its functions in terms of the "supervision and control" that Section 26 commands and which the COMELEC specified in the RFP. This intent, however, cannot be simply manifested in the law and parroted in the RFP as proof that there had been compliance; such compliance must be shown and must stand the test of overt acts, particularly contemporaneous acts the COMELEC and its systems provider undertake in furtherance of the intended automation.  The best evidence of this intent, of course, is the contract that defines the parties' respective roles in the automation.  The contractual terms are likewise the best evidence of whether the responsibility for automation is exclusive, as the cited Section 26 requires.<br><br><b>e. </b><b>The Automation Contract Examined</b><br><br>The Automation Contract between the COMELEC and SMARTMATIC-TIM, executed on July 10, 2009, fully defines the automation "project" to be undertaken.

The Project Management Office (<i>PMO</i>) is specifically mentioned, but only for the purpose of overseeing the project's execution and implementation; it is not considered as an office with authority to speak on technical matters.  On technical matters, SMARTMATIC-TIM reigns supreme and the ITD is not even mentioned. Under this situation, the PMO cannot but merely be a monitoring or liaison office, rather than an office supervising or controlling the project for COMELEC. It cannot supervise and control if SMARTMATIC-TIM has the last say on technical matters.  In fact, the COMELEC itself, under Article 6.3.2, only plays an assisting role to SMARTMATIC-TIM, thus raising the direct implication that the latter has the lead role in all technical activities this Article mentions.  Thus viewed, can the PMO raise any higher than the COMELEC?<br><br><b>f. </b><b>The Shared Responsibility</b><br><br>Based on all these considerations drawn from the RFP and the Automation Contract, I cannot escape the conclusion that what exists is not the exclusive supervision and control of the automation process by the COMLEC, but a shared responsibility between the contracting parties to achieve this end.  To point out the obvious, SMARTMATIC-TIM takes care of project management, with the PMO relegated to the blurry role of "overseeing the Project's execution and implementation" and with no other clearly defined role in the automation project. ITD does not even exist insofar as the project documents are concerned. Thus, while the COMELEC retains its traditional role with respect to the running of the election itself, a new election process is in place that is substantially affected by automation. Stated otherwise, while the COMELEC truly controls the BEI, the BOC, and the administrative and adjudicative staff attending to the election process, the voters themselves, and even the BEI and the BOC, must yield to the process that automation calls for, which process is essentially technical and is in the hands of SMARTMATIC-TIM, the provider who wholly supplies the hardware and the software that controls the voting, counting, canvassing, consolidation and transmission of results, and who expressly has control and custody over the election equipment to be used in the voting, with no reserve power whatsoever on the part of the COMELEC in this regard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  Not to be forgotten is that SMARTMATIC-TIM also provides the necessary services that run across voting, counting, canvassing, consolidation and transmission activities.<br><br>These arrangements, viewed from all sides, does not indicate an exclusive supervision and control situation over the automation process.  To be exact, they involve shared responsibilities that, however practical they may be from the business and technical perspectives, are arrangements that Philippine law does not allow.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Access Keys and Digital Signatures</b><br><br>Separately from all these considerations is the matter of the access keys and digital signatures that are objectionable, not merely because of the intrusion in the technical end of automation, but because they effectively hand over control of the election process to SMARTMATIC-TIM.<br><br>Contrary to the <i>ponencia's </i>findings, a close perusal of the automation contract's supporting documents indicate that the COMELEC has in fact effectively handed over to SMARTMATIC control over the AES, particularly with respect to the following quoted technical aspects:<br><br><blockquote>a. <b>Generate and distribute the access keys</b> for the canvassing equipment and 82,200 optical scanners to be used on election day;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>b.

Maintain 100% electronic transmission capability on election day  (SMARTMATIC-TIM to fill the 25% gap of the country's current 75% network coverage) [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote><br>The access keys are significant because control and possession of these keys translate to the capacity to change election results in any precinct in the country.  This conclusion can be drawn from the following exchanges during the oral arguments:<br><br><blockquote>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CARPIO:  Now what is the first function of the Commission on Elections under the Constitution?<br><br>ATTY.

This Bulletin states, among others, that the "digital signature shall be assigned by the winning bidder [SMARTMATIC-TIM in the present case] to all members of the BEI and BOC.  It further states that "for [National Board of Canvassers or <i>NBOC</i>], the digital signatures shall be assigned to all members of the Commission and to the Senate President and the House Speaker." These terms are all consistent with Article 3.3 of the Automation Contract, heretofore mentioned, which allows SMARTMATIC-TIM to be "in charge of the technical aspects of the counting and canvassing software and hardware, including transmission configuration and system integration."  On this point, the following oral argument exchanges are illuminating, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CARPIO: Are you familiar with Bid Bulletin No. 10 issued on April 15, 2009 of the COMELEC's BAC Committee?<br><br>ATTY.

The digital signature shall be issued by a Certificate Authority nominated by the winning bidder and approved by the COMELEC."  In other words, SMARTMATIC, the winning bidder, will nominate DERISIGN to be the Certification Authority, just ask COMELEC for approval and COMELEC will say "approved."  <b>From then on, it is SMARTMATIC that will deal with DERISGIN on the generation of the public and private keys</b>.<br><br>ATTY. ROQUE: <b>That is correct, Your Honor.</b><br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CARPIO: <b>So, control of the public and private keys are in the hands of SMARTMATIC.

ROQUE:  <b>That is possible, Your Honor.  Yes.  In fact, that is what COMELEC should do.</b><br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CARPIO:  <b>So, it is not enough that COMELEC should have co-possession of the keys.

Unfortunately, the private key is not private at all.  <b>After collation of votes, the BEI seals its tally with a digital signature using private keys before transmitting the results</b>.  <b>These digital signatures would be generated and assigned by SMARTMATIC and or groups authorized by it.  SMARTMATIC would have possession of the secret and the public keys of all BEI personnel</b>.  <b style="text-decoration: underline;">The person in possession of the secret key can change the vote of the precinct.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The digital signatures are crucial since Section 22 of the RA No. 8436 as amended provides that "<i>the election returns transmitted electronically and <b>digitally signed</b> shall be considered <b>as official election results</b> and shall be used as the <b>basis for the canvassing of votes </b>and the <b>proclamation of a candidate</b></i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><i>  </i>Thus, by placing solely in the hands of SMARTMATIC-TIM the discretion to assign the "digital signatures," the COMELEC has effectively surrendered control of the May 10, 2010 elections and violated its constitutional mandate to administer the conduct of elections in the country. Significantly, even the counsel for SMARTMATIC-TIM admitted during the oral arguments that the COMELEC should not have given to SMARTMATIC-TIM the possession and control of the public and private keys, thus:<br><br><blockquote>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE CARPIO:  Okay, let us go [to] the public and private public keys, you were saying that COMELEC if it wants can have exclusive possession and control of the public and private keys, is that right?<br><br>ATTY.

To fully implement this statutory requirement, the COMELEC should have stipulated in the automation contract that it is the ITD, and not SMARTMATIC-TIM, that should be made in charge of the technical aspects of the automated May 10, 2010 elections, consistent with its constitutional mandate as well as Section 26 of RA No. 8436.  Under the present contract, the exclusive supervision and control over the AES that the law in its wisdom has put in place, has simply been negated.<br><br>To be wary of giving control of the critical elements of our election process to an entity other than the COMELEC cannot and should not be regarded as an unhealthy skepticism that we should shy away from.  On the contrary, wariness should be our mindset, particularly on legal matters bearing on elections and their automation, given the constitutional and legal guidelines that foist on us the standard of a fair, clean, honest and credible election.  We must be wary, too, because we are not wanting in warnings from those who have waded ahead of us into the waters of automation.  As observed in foreign jurisdictions with previous experience in the use of automated systems:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The particular danger in computer-controlled voting machines was said to lie in the fact that elections could be much more effectively influenced via manipulation of the software by the device manufacturer than in ballot box elections. For instance, it was said to be possible for faulty software to allot a certain share of the votes cast to a certain party regardless of the election decision by the respective voter or for the total votes cast to be divided among the parties standing for election according to a set proportion. Manipulations were said to be possible both by politically or financially motivated "insiders", in particular employees of the manufacturer, and by external third parties who gained access to the computers used by the manufacturer (for instance via viruses or trojans); they were said with regard to the complexity of the software used not always to be discovered even in careful quality control effected by the manufacturer. Although it was said to be necessary to prevent unauthorised access to the devices between the elections through suitable security measures, no such monitoring was said to take place in Germany; there were also said to be no suitable regulations in force that were able to guarantee protected storage of the voting machines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Broad as the power of the COMELEC may be as the independent constitutional body tasked to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections, it has no competence to act outside the Constitution and its supporting statutes;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the scope of its activities is circumscribed by our election laws and by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Thus, while we accord the greatest respect to the means adopted by the COMELEC to resolve policy questions on the conduct and regulation of elections and give its actions the greatest presumption of regularity,<b> </b>we must not hesitate to declare its actions grossly abusive of its constitutionally-granted discretion when it acts outside the contemplation of the Constitution and of our laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  In saying this, I have to hark back to where I started in this Dissent.
