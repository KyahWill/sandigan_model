				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For final review by the Court is the trial court's conviction of appellant Abdulah for murder.  In the July 17, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00023, the appellate court, on intermediate review, affirmed <i>in toto</i> the August 24, 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 158 of Pasig City in Criminal Cases Nos. 98124, 98125 and 98126.<br><br>It was six in the evening more than a decade and a half ago, or on November 6, 1992, when the events leading to this case began to unfold. One of the victims, Evelyn Aguirre, was then visiting in the house of the other victim, her daughter Romelyn Diolago, at Victoria St., Intramuros, Manila.  With her in the house were her other daughters, Leny and Jovy Aguirre (another victim), and her granddaughter, Cristy-Lyn.  At that time, Romelyn was at a night club working.  Appellant Mohamad "Bong" Abdulah, Romelyn's brother-in-law<b>,</b> and a companion, entered the house and asked for the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Informed of Romelyn's whereabouts, Bong decided to fetch Romelyn at the club.  He dragged Evelyn from the house, out of the alley leading to the house, and to a black car.  His companion, Latip Mangsungayan, poked a .38 caliber gun at Jovy, dragged her and pushed her inside the car.  Three other companions of Bong were already in the car, a certain Racid alias Lumang Kulog, Bagyo alias Muhammad, and Dhats Kamama.  Bong then belted out to the neighbors who got curious over the commotion, "Kung ano'ng nakikita ninyo, walang magsasalita, totodasin ko lahat, walang makikialam, totodasin ko kayong lahat!" (You must not interfere with us, and keep silent over what you are witnessing right now; otherwise, I will kill all of you!).  Bong then drove the car and sped off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Evelyn and Jovy never returned to the house.  That was the last time they were seen alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The following day, November 7, 1992, three female dead bodies were found by the police at the grassy area of the apartment road in Maharlika Village, Taguig, Metro Manila [now, the City of Taguig]. The bodies had stab wounds, and the necks had ligature marks.  The cadavers were then brought to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory for autopsy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  On November 15, 1992, prompted by a news report, the relatives of the victims went to Taguig, and there identified the dead bodies as those of Evelyn, Romelyn and Jovy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The police theorized that appellant killed the victims to avenge the death of his brother Rex, Romelyn's live-in partner. The police further believed that appellant must have been convinced of the family's  involvement in the death of Rex, considering that Rex's killer was the former boyfriend of Romelyn and hailed from the same hometown as the family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On March 24, 1993, three separate Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for murder were filed against appellant with the RTC of Pasig City.  The accusatory portions thereof read:<br><blockquote><u>Criminal Case No. 98124</u><br><br>The undersigned Assistant Prosecutor accuses BONG ABDULAH @ BONG HASAN ZAMAN of the crime of Murder, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of November 1992, in the Municipality of Tagig (sic), Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a deadly weapon, with intent to kill, by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Jovy Aguirre on her body, thereby inflicting upon the latter stab wounds which directly caused her death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><u>Criminal Case No. 98125</u><br><br>The undersigned Assistant Prosecutor accuses BONG ABDULAH @ BONG HASAN ZAMAN of the crime of Murder, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of November 1992, in the Municipality of Tagig (sic), Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a deadly weapon, with intent to kill, by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Romelyn D. Diolago on her body, thereby inflicting upon the latter stab wounds which directly caused her death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><u><br>Criminal Case No. 98126</u><br><br>The undersigned Assistant Prosecutor accuses BONG ABDULAH @ BONG HASAN ZAMAN of the crime of Murder, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of November 1992, in the Municipality of Tagig (sic), Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a deadly weapon, with intent to kill, by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Evelyn Aguirre on her body, thereby inflicting upon the latter stab wounds which directly caused her death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant and his cohorts remained at large for several years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  In 1998, appellamt was finally brought to trial in these murder cases, following his apprehension and detention for violation of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1866, of the elections gun ban, and of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6425.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  On arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the murder charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his defense, appellant asserted that he was mistakenly identified as "Muhammad Abdulah," because he is "Musa Dalamban."  He was arrested not for the murder of the victims but for violation of special laws. He further denied knowing any of the victims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> claiming that, at the time the murder happened, he was in Cotabato City working as a helper of Guapal Saliling in the latter's wood business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On August 24, 2000, the trial court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of murder.  The dispositive portion thereof reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, accused Muhammad Abdulah, also known as "Bong Abdullah", "Bong Hasan Zaman" is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed three (3) counts of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Cases Nos. 98124, 98125 and 98126 and is sentence (sic) to suffer in prison the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua for each count.<br><br>He is also ordered to indemnify the private complainant Romeo Dindero the amount of (sic) P150,000.00 and to pay another P150,000.00 as moral damages plus the cost of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>On direct appeal to this Court in G.R. Nos. 145306-08, we referred the cases to the appellate court for intermediate review following the doctrine in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In its July 17, 2007 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the CA, as aforesaid, affirmed in <i>toto</i> the decision of the trial court.  Thus, we now finally review the trial and the appellate courts' uniform findings.<br><br>We affirm with modifications.  The Court notes that the basis of the trial and the appellate courts in convicting the appellant of three counts of murder is circumstantial evidence, given the absence of any direct evidence as to who actually killed the victims.  Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides that, for the same to be sufficient for conviction, there must be more than one circumstance; the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and the combination of all circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  A judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence can be upheld only if the circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain leading to one fair and reasonable conclusion that the defendants are guilty, to the exclusion of any other conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The circumstances proved must be concordant with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty and, at the same time, inconsistent with any hypothesis other than that of guilt.  As a corollary to the constitutional precept that the accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, a conviction based on circumstantial evidence must exclude each and every hypothesis consistent with his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Here, the circumstances proven during the trial are that (1) appellant and several companions went to the house of Romelyn in Intramuros, Manila; (2) on arrival, appellant asked for the whereabouts of Romelyn; (3) appellant then forcibly dragged the victims Evelyn and Jovy from Romelyn's house to the alley leading to the house and pushed them inside a parked black car; (4) one of appellant's companions poked a gun at Jovy; (5) appellant then warned the onlookers to not interfere with them and to be silent over what was happening; (6) appellant drove the car and sped off; (7) the day after Evelyn and Jovy were taken, their dead bodies, together with that of Romelyn, were recovered in Taguig, Metro Manila; and (8) their  bodies had stab wounds, and the necks had ligature marks.<br><br>Appellant was also positively identified by the prosecution witnesses, Leny Aguirre, Evelyn's daughter, who was in the house when appellant arrived, and Sabina Badilla, a neighbor, who saw the commotion.

Treachery and evident premeditation, the circumstances alleged in the informations, cannot be appreciated to qualify the killing to murder, considering that these were not proven during the trial.
