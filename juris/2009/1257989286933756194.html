The Buenaventura heirs claimed that they were rightful owners of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 14729.  The Buenaventura heirs caused the annotation of a Notice of Lis Pendens on TCT No. 14729. This notice of Lis Pendens was carried over to the subdivided lots covered by TCT Nos. 133988, 133990 and 133991.<br><br>On 06 November 1998, AMVEL submitted to the TRB what it claimed to be a Decision dated 29 October 1998 of the Court of Appeals First Division in CA-G.R. No. 54402, which supposedly affirmed the Decision of the RTC-Paranaque dismissing the case filed by the Buenaventura heirs.  The purported Court of Appeals Decision was signed by Associate Justices Oswaldo Agcaoili, Fidel Purisima and Corona Ibay-Somera.<br><br>The complainant alleges that the supposed 28 October 1998 Decision was falsified and non-existent.  In fact, the records of the Court of Appeals show that, on 22 February 1999, "its Docket was instructed to (a)wait result of the investigation of NBI as per instructions of J. Valdez."  However, based on the same records, nothing was heard or mentioned again about the result of the said NBI investigation.<br><br>Notwithstanding the attempt to defraud the government with the submission of the falsified and non- existent Court of Appeals Decision, TRB did not charge AMVEL and, instead, proceeded with the execution of the Deeds of Sale on 30 March 1999.<br><br>The complainant further alleges that the original projected cost of the right-of-way for the MCTE Project at the time the Toll Operation Agreement between the government and the foreign investor, Renong Berhad, was being deliberated in late 1995, was P900 million only.  However, by the time the Toll Operation Agreement was approved by the Office of the President on 26 July 1996, the cost of the right-of-way acquisition had already risen to P1.7 billion.<br><br>The Toll Operation Agreement dated 26 July 1996 itself, in paragraph 5.04 thereof, likewise provides that "the Grantee (PEA) shall advance the funds necessary for the acquisition of the Right of Way except land to be reclaimed subject to a limit of [P1.7 million] and such funds shall be reimbursed by the Grantor to the Grantee."<br><br>As late as October 1998, UEM-MARA Philippines Corporation ("UMPC"), the local subsidiary of UEM Berhad and a signatory to the Toll Operation Agreement, in a report to the Board of Investments entitled "Manila Cavite Toll Expressway Project-Project Description October 1998," reported in its Summary of Project Costs that the total right-of-way cost is only P1.7 billion. This is broken down as follows: C-5 Link Expressway, P1.356 billion; and R-1 Extension Expressway, P344 million. UMPC further reported that "TRB on the other hand will be responsible for the acquisition of the right-of-way which will be financed by PEA in accordance to the terms and conditions of NEDA as stipulated in the TOA."<br><br>Also, under the aforesaid NEDA Board Resolution No. 2, the Malaysian government agency, Majilis Amanah Rakyat ("MARA") and Renong Berhad's construction affiliate, United Engineers Berhad (UEB), were supposed to advance P900 million of the P1.7 billion cost of right-of-way acquisition to be guaranteed by the national government.  Further, MARA and UEB would secure foreign currency denominated loans for the P900 million that they were willing to advance.<br><br>It appears that the project proponents did not even comply with the aforesaid condition for NEDA's approval of the project.  The Malaysian firms were no longer made to advance the sum of P900 million.<br><br>Instead, on 5 December 1997, a Loan Agreement was executed among PEA, as borrower, the Republic of the Philippines, as guarantor, and a syndicate of local and foreign banks, namely, Solidbank Corporation, Far East Bank and Trust Company (now part of the Bank of the Philippine Islands), Asianbank Corporation, Chinatrust (Phils.) Commercial Bank Corporation, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Standard Chartered Bank, The Bank of Nova Scotia (Manila Offshore Branch), The Development [Bank] of Singapore Ltd., and Bank of America (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "lender banks").<br><br>The Lead Arranger for the loan was Exchange Capital Corporation, which is majority-owned by respondents Luis J. L. Virata and Manuel B. Zamora, Jr. [The] Co-Lead Arrangers were FEB Investments, Inc. and SolidBank.<br><br>As earlier mentioned, TRB sent notices of acquisition to the landowners of the parcels of land that would be affected by the C-5 Link sometime in 1997.  Thereafter, the TRB Officer-in-Charge requested the Paranaque City Appraisal Committee to appraise the said parcels of land.  Thus, the City Appraisal Committee came out with Resolution No. 98-5 dated 21 April 1998 with bloated appraisals of said properties.<br><br>Complainant asseverates that in what appears to be an attempt to "legitimize" the bloated appraisal made by the Parañaque City Appraisal Committee on 21 April 1998, on 7 May 1998, TRB and PEA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement which, among others, explicitly provides that TRB shall "identify and locate the lots of land sought to be acquired for the right-of-way" and "negotiate with the individual owners of the land the purchase price in accordance with Executive Order No. 329 dated July 11, 1998, Executive Order No. 368 dated August 24, 1989 and Executive Order NO. 269 dated September 4, 1989." These Executive Orders were even made part of the Memorandum of Agreement.<br><br>The complainant points out that seven (7) months after respondent Mike Velarde got his P1,222,841,490.00, on 23 November 1999, respondent Estrada, together with respondents Ronaldo B. Zamora, then Executive Secretary, Gregorio R. Vigilar, then Public Works and Highways Secretary, and Frisco San Juan, then PEA Chairman, gave his imprimatur and approval to the proposal of a four (4) month-old, P15 million company, the Coastal Road Corporation ("CRC"), to take over UMPC and the P7.73 billion MCTE Project (including the 800-hectare reclamation project along Manila Bay going towards Cavite).  This is now the subject of a separate case before the Ombudsman entitled "Ernesto B. Francisco, Jr. vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, et al.," docketed as OMB Case NO. 0-00-1758.<br><br>Complainant Francisco further points out that the beneficial owners of CRC are respondents Luis J. L. Virata and Manuel B. Zamora, Jr. Respondent Luis J. L. Virata is also CRC's President and Chief Executive Officer, while respondent Cesar E.A. Virata is CRC's Chairman of the Board and is also a beneficial owner of CRC to the extent of ten (10%) [percent] of its equity.<br><br>Also, on 23 November 1999, respondent Estrada, in the presence of respondents Ronaldo B. Zamora, Gregorio R. Vigilar and Frisco San Juan, gave his imprimatur and approval to CRC's proposal to de-prioritize the construction of the C-5 Link Expressway, on the one hand, and to prioritize the R-1 Expressway Extension, on the other.  This was done despite the lack of the requisite evaluation and approval of the TRB Board and the fact that CRC does not have the requisite financial and technical capability and track record to take over the MCTE Project.  Worse, the de-prioritization of the C-5 Link despite the P1.85 billion already spent for right-of-way acquisitions caused the government tremendous losses in terms of the interest on the dollar-denominated loan used to fund the said acquisitions.</blockquote><br>Respondents LUIS J. L. VIRATA and MANUEL B. ZAMORA, JR. had another reason for pushing the prioritization of the R-1 Expressway Extension. Respondents wanted to expedite the development of the Caylabne Bay Resort in Ternate, Cavite.  In the words of respondent Luis J. L. Virata, the Caylabne Bay Resort will be developed into a "top-quality resort . . . with a whole bunch of a Mediterranean-looking buildings" and with "a first-class resort operation."  In an interview with Mr. Philip Cu-Unjieng, which appeared in the 7 February 1999 issue of the Philippine Star, respondent Virata himself had categorically admitted how critical is the R-1 Expressway Extension to the development of the Caylabne Bay Resort.<br><br>The real problem is that under UMPC's project timetable, the construction schedule of the C-5 Link Expressway was set from March 1997 to September 1999, while that of the R-1 Extension was set almost near the same period, from October 1997 to September 1999.  Thus, the idea is for both expressways to be constructed and finished almost at the same time.  However, by October 1998, both were already delayed by eighteen (18) months and fourteen (14) months, respectively.  Instead of correcting the problem, the government allowed respondent Luis J. L. Virata and Manuel B. Zamora, J. to take over the project despite their lack of financial and technical capability to do so.  They even tried to borrow from public funds from the Development Bank of the Philippines to finance their acquisition of UEM Berhad's share in UMPC.<br><br>Respondents Mariano Z. Velarde, Franklin M. Velarde, Luis Juan L. Virata, Cesar E.A. Virata, Manuel Zamora, Jr., Ronaldo Zamora, Mariano E. Benedicto II, Frisco F. San Juan, Ruben A. de Ocampo, and Ramon V.

Instead, TRB conducted a series of appraisals of the subject property.<br><br>As of December 9, 1998, Amvel wrote to the DPWH Secretary,  asking that it be paid the purchase price set by the PCAC as directed by TRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  In a letter dated January 20, 1999, TRB informed Amvel that it was willing to purchase the latter's properties at a price arrived at by adopting a formula close to averaging all four (4) appraisals obtained from the PCAC, as well as the three (3) private appraisal companies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  Thereafter, TRB issued Resolution No. 99-02 on January 15, 1999 approving the purchase of the subject properties in the aggregate amount of P1,221,799,804.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>On April 22, 1999, Amvel was able to receive full payment of the agreed purchase price, but the amount received was P1,221,766,640.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Private respondents argue that the subject properties were not overpriced.

Massive development and improvement works were immediately carried out and introduced after these properties were acquired by Amvel through purchase or joint venture agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Private respondents cited several factors why a higher appraisal value than the one eventually used should be adopted, and these are:<br><br><ol type="a"><li> The PCAC, as early as April 21, 1998 (way before the election of respondent Estrada to the presidency in the May 10, 1998 elections), had already fixed the price of the properties on the site, along with those found in the area: between P20,000.00 and P25,000.00 per sq. m.<br><br></li><li>In 1997, the site was appraised at P18,000.00 per sq. m., and a portion of the same with an area of 49,316 sq. m. covered by TCT No. 133550 was given a development loan accommodation by Metrobank in the amount of P550,000,000.00.<br><br></li><li>The current Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) zonal valuation appraised the vicinity at P25,000.00 per sq. m.<br></li></ol><br>Private respondents claim that the other properties affected by the C-5 Link Project adjacent to and near the vicinity of the site were acquired and paid for by the government at P25,000.00 per sq. m. in accordance with the MMDA appraisal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>  For the subject properties, the government was able to save P4,645.00 per sq. m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The private appraisal companies were engaged by TRB and not Amvel.  The final purchase price was imposed upon Amvel by the government, and respondents Velarde had no hand in fixing the said amount. Private respondents Velarde merely acted within the bounds of their duties and powers as officers of Amvel. It was only natural that they would negotiate for an amount most advantageous to the said company.  The fact that the purchase price of the subject properties considerably plummeted would certainly negate the allegation that respondent Mariano Z. Velarde exerted influence on respondent Estrada or any other public officer for that matter.<br><br>Furthermore, private respondents aver that, except for a small portion, Amvel acquired the properties at prices ranging from not less than P7,500.00 per sq. m. to as high as P9,000.00 per sq. m.  Petitioner thus failed to take into consideration the significant incidental expenses for the acquisition, consolidation, improvement and development of the subject properties.<br><br>Private respondents claim that the re-alignment of the C-5 Link Project has actually resulted in the significant reduction and decrease of the affected areas, that is, from the original 12 hectares to 7.9 hectares.  Hence, petitioner completely erred in claiming that the realignment had actually resulted in a greater profit to Amvel. The subject property, measuring 79,568 sq. m., was just 34.28% of the total area of the site, which was 232,078 sq. m.<br><br>To provide a background of the transactions leading to the purchase by the government of the subject properties, private respondents gave its version of the antecedent facts, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li> As early as June 1994, a company by the name of "ADV Realty" had set its sights in developing [a] large expanse of undeveloped parcels of raw lands around the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and in Barangay San Dionisio, Parañaque City into a commercial and business park by entering into various joint venture agreements with several landowners, particularly the Medina- Tirona family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br></li><li>A large amphitheater would also be constructed to serve as a multi-purpose complex that would principally serve as the venue for the weekly prayer meetings and healing sessions of the members of the El Shaddai Movement of which herein respondent Mariano Z. Velarde is the Servant Leader.<br><br></li><li>In order to consolidate the whole area, joint ventures were likewise forged with the other landowners of the adjacent properties who were all prominent families of Parañaque City (<i>e.g.,</i> Medina-Evangelista, Balinghasay and Santos).  More importantly, for those properties that were not available for joint venture, ADV Realty acquired them by purchase.<br><br></li><li>In 1996, development efforts were immediately poured and instituted into the properties in accordance with the master plan and the business development concepts for the area.  In 1997, ADV Realty was able to consolidate a 23-hectare property and pre-development operations thereon were in full blast.  ADV Realty's name was then changed into Amvel Land Development Corporation.<br><br></li><li> However, Amvel was notified by the government, through the TRB, in the last quarter of 1997 that the site will be affected by the C-5 Link Project. Ex-president Fidel V. Ramos was still the incumbent president at that time.<br><br></li><li>Upon examining the proposed alignment of the aforesaid project, Amvel was surprised to find out that it would cut across right at the center of the site.  This would render the whole property unattractive to prospective investors as the C-5 Link Project would block all possible ingress to and egress from the property, making accessibility a major concern.<br><br></li><li> This would entail a re-evaluation and a radical change in the master plan of the commercial and business park.  Once the C-5 Link Project would be constructed, the remaining property of Amvel would be divided into two (2) portions.  Both portions would be enclosed by the proposed C-5 Link Project and the rivers found on the north and west side of the property.<br><br></li><li>Even other property owners in the area, most notably the SM Holdings Property and ADELFA Property, Inc., also raised objections to the C-5 link Project as the original plan of the said Project posed serious threat to their respective developmental plans for their properties.<br><br></li><li>As a result, Amvel, along with SM Holdings Property and ADELFA Property, Inc., negotiated for the re- alignment of the C-5 Link Project.<br><br></li><li>As a consequence thereof, Amvel was constrained to construct another bridge as a passageway for the portion located at the southern side of the property.  To accomplish such a task, Amvel was forced to purchase the property where the bridge would be constructed.<br><br></li><li>The final re-alignment plan that was jointly prepared by Amvel, SM Prime Holdings and ADELFA Properties, Inc. and duly approved by the TRB, had actually and in reality resulted in the substantial reduction of the portion of the site that would be affected by the C-5 Link Project.  From the original area of TWELVE (12) hectares, it was reduced to only 7.9 hectares.<br><br></li><li> Had Amvel really intended to capitalize on the business opportunity brought about by the C-5 Link Project, as wrongfully alleged by petitioner, it could have proposed a re-alignment plan that would consume a larger portion of the site.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Private respondents argue that the subject properties were not bought by Amvel for the purpose of selling them to the government, in the light of the proposed construction of the C-5 Link Project.  After Amvel and TRB finally agreed on the terms of the sale, all the portions of the site that were caught along the path of the C-5 Link Project were sold to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  These properties are described in the following table:<br><br><blockquote><table width="80%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="center"><b>TCT No.</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="center"><b>Original Size  (sq m) </b> </div></td> <td> <div align="center"><b>Previous owner</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="center"><b>Date of JVA/ <br> Purchase</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="center"><b>Size sold to gov't.</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify">140397 140396 </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">122,694 <br> 10,099 </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Emmanuel Tirona, Ma.

More than one (1) million cubic meters of soil were deposited on the site to raise its elevation above the highest flood level recorded in the area, appropriately compacted with the use of heavy equipment as required in a business/commercial land use.<br><br>If Amvel had an advance information that the C-5 Link Project would traverse a portion of the site way back in 1996, then it should have only focused its sight and poured its resources on the 79,568 sq. m. of land affected by the said Project by simply purchasing only to the extent of the same.  Because of the intrusion of the C-5 Link Project into its property, Amvel had to re-evaluate and change the master plan to conform to the significant changes in the shape and configuration of the site, which was destructively broken into two parts by the C-5 Link Project.  That the C-5 Link Project greatly reduced the viability and marketability of the intended commercial and business park is beyond cavil, as the construction of the C-5 Link Project would leave Amvel with a property enclosed or bounded by a highway and rivers without any access, thereby forcing it to incur major additional costs and expenses to build the necessary bridges and access roads to connect the remaining portions to the Ninoy Aquino Avenue.<br><br>Amvel, as a consequence of the Project, likewise incurred delays in introducing the needed developments it undertook to infuse into the property, subject of the Land Development Agreement it entered into with the Medina family.

After receiving the same, Amvel immediately furnished a copy to the TRB and the Register of Deeds of Parañaque City, to have the same annotated on the Transfer Certificates of Title covering the parcels of land subject of the aforesaid case.  When Amvel tried to secure a certified true copy of the said decision from the CA, as required by the Register of Deeds and the TRB, it discovered that the case was still pending for resolution and no such decision had been promulgated.

Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> to support this averment.<br><br>He asserts that as early as May 7, 1998, the TRB had already approved the properties to be affected by the C-5 Link based on the PCAC recommendation of P20,000 per sq. m., and such approval was made in accordance with Executive Order No. 132, the law then prevailing.  Unfortunately, the TRB had limited funds, so, hoping for a lower price, it started negotiations with the property owners, including AMVEL.  The TRB and AMVEL agreed subsequently that the price should be adjusted by hiring independent appraisers and getting the average of the values to be determined by these independent appraisers and the values stated in the PCAC resolutions.  Later, on January 15, 1999, in keeping with that agreement, the TRB approved the new, substantially reduced purchase price of P15,350.00 per sq. m. More than a month later, on February 17, 1999, Administrative Order No. 50 was promulgated setting new standards for the determination of the fair and reasonable value of private lands that would be expropriated for government infrastructure projects. This Administrative Order was intended to supplant Executive Order No. 132.<br><br>Private respondent alleges that it is a basic fact that a "contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price" (Article 1475 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, Civil Code). Therefore, at the time TRB and AMVEL agreed as to the process for determining the purchase price, the contract of sale was already perfected.<br><br>The requisites for a valid price in a contract of sale are: (1) it must be real; (2) it must be in money or its equivalent; and (3) it must be certain or ascertainable at the time of the perfection of the contract (Articles 1471, 1458, 1468, 1469 and 1473, Civil Code).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>  Under Article 1469, price is considered certain if "it be so with reference to another thing certain, or that the determination thereof be left to the judgment of a specified person or persons."  Said article further provides: "Even before the fixing of the price by the designated third party, a contract of sale is deemed to be perfected and existing."<br><br>Private respondent Vigilar avers that from the time AMVEL agreed sometime in the middle of 1998 that the price would be the average of the values stated in the independent appraisers' reports and the PCAC resolutions, the government could no longer re-negotiate for a lower price.  Thus, even before the TRB approved the price at P15,350.00 per sq.m. on January 15, 1999, the price had already become certain.  It was immaterial that the Deeds of Sale were signed later.  The execution of these Deeds of Sale was a mere formality; it was meant to document a contract that had been perfected earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Private respondent claims that applying Administrative Order No. 50 retroactively to the contract between the TRB and AMVEL violates Article 4 of the Civil Code, which provides that "[l]aws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided."  Administrative Order No. 50 does not state that it is exempt from this rule; it does not provide for retroactive effect.<br><br>Petitioner has not shown that private respondent Vigilar, as Secretary of the DPWH and concurrent TRB chairman, amassed any ill-gotten wealth to warrant a charge of plunder.  Petitioner does not allege that private respondent Vigilar received any money or derived any benefit, of any kind, from the right-of-way acquisition of the affected lands.<br><br>Regarding the allegation that he violated Sec. 3 (a) of R.A.

Petitioner likewise failed to prove that the elements of violation of Section 3 (a), (e), (g) and (j) of Rep. Act No. 3019 have been committed by private respondent Vigilar.

Private respondent avers that the "photo-op" was staged by Cavite government officials to show their constituents that the MCTE Project was being fast-tracked.  Respondents merely graced the occasion in response to requests made by these local officials.

Public respondent alleges:<br><blockquote>Significantly, the purchase transactions over the subject properties are negotiated ones. On 9 August 1997, notices of acquisition were sent by TRB to the affected landowners. In view of the acceptance by AMVEL of the amount offered by the government during the negotiation process, no expropriation proceeding was initiated in court.  Upon appraisal by the [PCAC], the parties successfully arrived into an agreement as to the value or purchase price of the affected properties on or before 08 May 1998, as evidenced by a letter sent by respondent Ramon V.

TRB's act of subjecting the properties to another round of appraisal by independent appraisal companies was but a manifestation that it was protecting the government's interests by ensuring that it would not be put to a disadvantageous position by the appraisal recommended by PCAC.  The result of the appraisals conducted by the three independent appraisal companies led TRB to come up with an average appraisal in the amount of P15,355.00 per sq. m. in purchasing AMVEL's properties.

Thus, in <i>certiorari</i> proceedings under Rule 45, the findings of fact below as well as the conclusions on the credibility of witnesses are generally not disturbed, the question before the court being limited to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>According to San Juan, Rule 45 likewise provides that for the petitions to be filed under it to be allowed, there must be special and important reasons therefor, as when the court <i>a quo</i> has decided a question of substance not heretofore determined by the Honorable Court, or has decided it in any way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions thereof; or when the court <i>a quo</i> has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by a lower court as to call for the exercise of the power of supervision of this Court.<br><br>San Juan contends that at the heart of all the purported "serious errors of law" raised by petitioner are essentially factual questions, which petitioner would have the Honorable Court resolve.  Thus, San Juan avers that petitioner asks that this Honorable Court determine:<br><br><blockquote>· if based on the appraisals of the properties involved, the right-of-way acquisitions were "overpriced";<br><br>· if the purchase of the subject properties "had been consummated on 7 May 1998" ;<br><br>· if there was "compliance with the procedure for the valuation of the properties involved";<br><br>· if respondents "amassed wealth" from the subject transaction as to be liable for plunder;<br><br>· if President Estrada "intervened" in the purchase of the right-of-way and the payment thereof;<br><br>· if the titles transferred to the Republic were clean;<br><br>· and so on.</blockquote><br>San Juan concludes from the above that all these questions require an appreciation of the evidence and an examination of the probative value of the proofs presented to determine the truth or falsity of the factual claims of the parties below; these are thus factual questions.<br><br>As regards petitioner's allegations of plunder, San Juan notes that "nowhere in the complaint was it alleged that respondent San Juan or any of his co-respondents received any art of the purchase price for the lands purchased by the Government from AMVEL from the right of way."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [104]</sup>  The initiative of the TRB not only in renegotiating the purchase price and in causing the re- appraisal of the properties by three (3) appraisers but also in successfully reducing the purchase price cannot be the product of, and is in fact inconsistent with, respondents' supposed "connivance" or "collusion" with AMVEL.<br><br>San Juan further alleges that the negotiation, perfection and execution of the Deed of Sale of the lands in question between TRB and Amvel were all done without the participation or involvement of PEA, as it was never involved in the renegotiation efforts.  This is consistent with the terms of the TOA and the MOA, where the "responsibility for acquiring the lands," "the negotiation with its individual owners" and "the preparation of the necessary documents" including the "cancellation of the titles in the name of the individual lot owners" and the "transfer thereof in the name of the government" were all vested in TRB without the intervention of PEA.<br><br>San Juan alleges that the following steps were taken to ensure the regularity of the questioned transaction:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> Prior to the full payment of the purchase price to the sellers, TRB ensured that the Deeds of Sale were executed by authorized signatories, with the required Board resolutions and Special Powers of Attorney and duly notarized.<br><br></li><li>TRB likewise made certain that the real estate taxes covering the remaining quarters of the year and the documentary stamp taxes due on the transactions equivalent to 1.5% of the purchase price were shouldered and paid for by AMVEL with the corresponding tax clearance duly issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue; and that all titles to the properties were clean and transferred in the name of the Republic of the Philippines before the balance of the purchase price was fully paid.<br><br></li><li>Other than paying the purchase price for the properties, the Government did not pay any expenses for notarization, taxes and transfer fees, registration and processing of the transfer of titles to the Republic of the Philippines and clearing the properties of occupants and their relocation.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>San Juan concludes that contrary to petitioner's claims, AMVEL never received a "windfall from the government for which it acquired for almost nothing."  In truth, apart from receiving a purchase price reduced to the extent of P370 million, AMVEL was required to pay, as it did, expenses normally shouldered by a seller - all these on top of what petitioner himself recognized as developments undertaken by AMVEL on the properties prior to their acquisition by the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>San Juan contends that tax declarations, which petitioner presented as evidence of the alleged overpriced purchase price of the properties, are neither proof of the true market value of properties nor conclusive evidence of their value, but only enable the assessor to identify the same for their assessment levels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, San Juan alleges that the acquisition cost of a property cannot be the sole basis for determining its fair value; the current value of similar properties and their actual or potential uses must be considered together with other factors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>Regarding petitioner's insistence that Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 50 should have been applied, San Juan's averments are summarized below:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>  A.O. No. 50 would have no application to the contract between TRB and AMVEL which had been priorly perfected on  May 7, 1998.<br><br></li><li>The Zonal valuation (6<sup>th</sup> Division) which took effect on February 2, 1997, fixing the amount of P4,500/sq m as valuation of the affected properties, refers to residential regular (RR) lands situated in Dr. A. Santos Avenue, San Dionisio, Paranaque City.  The commercial lands along same place was fixed at P20,000.00/ sq m and along Ninoy Aquino International Airport at P30,000/00 per sq m. The affected AMVEL properties were classified by Ordinance No. 97-08 as within the C-3 high intensity commercial zone.<br><br></li><li> A.O. No. 50 does not in any way prohibit the conduct of a negotiated sale which is more expeditious and less expensive for the Government than engaging in a protracted expropriation proceedings over the properties with the owners thereof.  The purported costs in terms of time, resources and money will not necessarily result in savings for the Government.<br><br></li><li>Even in expropriation proceedings, just compensation for the properties must be determined.  And by "just compensation" is meant "a fair and full equivalent for the loss sustained, which is the measure of the indemnity x x x the market value of the land taken x x x being the sum of money which a person desirous, but not compelled to buy, and an owner, willing, but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received for such property."  Thus, to determine just compensation, the parties must add to the market value, the consequential damages.  (<i>Tuason v. LTA</i>, 31 SCRA 413) In the present case, the final valuation agreed upon by the TRB and AMVEL, upon consideration of the market value as determined by four (4) independent appraisers, constitutes such just compensation that is not only fair to the seller but to the Government as well.<br><br></li><li>The Honorable Court itself had occasion to observe that protracted expropriation proceedings do not only mean delay and difficulty for the Government, it also results in the citizen losing faith in the Government and in its readiness to pay for what it appropriates.  x x x</li></ol></blockquote><br>In this case, the properties affected by the right-of-way involve numerous owners.  Thus, in pursuing a negotiated sale instead of opting for expropriation proceedings and arriving at a mutually acceptable acquisition price in consideration for the transfer of clean and unencumbered titles to the Republic, the Government did not suffer any losses, contrary to petitioner's claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>San Juan claims that neither the TRB nor PEA could have aborted the purchase of the AMVEL properties based on the alleged falsification of the Court of Appeals Decision dated October 29, 1998.  These properties were essential for the Tollway Project - a fact which petitioner himself concedes is a reasonable, necessary and urgent public work.  Thus, the TRB, more so PEA, could not have simply re-arranged the project plans and decided not to acquire the AMVEL properties.  In fact, it is absurd to even suggest that PEA could override the decision to build a cheaper and faster expressway traversing the AMVEL properties.  Not only did the AMVEL properties have the most advantageous access to the NAIA, their development was the easiest to implement, because they had already been cleared of squatters and other occupants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>As for San Juan's purported "approval" of the take-over of the Tollway Project by the Coastal Road Corporation (CRC), San Juan states that there is simply no basis for this claim, for the following reasons:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li> At the end of 1999, the Malaysian counterpart could no longer fund the project due to currency regulations.  After CRC offered to take over the interest of Renong-Berhad, PEA in fact required it so show proof of its financial and technical capability. When respondent San Juan's term as PEA chairman ended, CRC had not yet submitted the PEA requirements. Consequently, respondent San Juan could not have given my approval to de-prioritize the C-5 project and to prioritize the R-1 Expressway extension as allegedly proposed by CRC.

Velarde, Gregorio R. Vigilar, Ronaldo B. Zamora, Manuel B. Zamora Jr., Cesar E.A. Virata, Luis L. Virata, and Frisco F. San Juan contend that a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure before this Honorable Court is not the proper mode of appeal in questioning any final order or resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman; thus, the instant petition should be outrightly dismissed <i>motu proprio</i>.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.  <i>Filing of petition with Supreme Court</i>. - A party desiring to appeal by <i> certiorari</i> from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.  The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.</blockquote><br>Private respondents Velarde aver that the "courts" referred to in the provision quoted above are "the courts that compose the integrated judicial system and do not include quasi-judicial bodies or agencies such as the Office of the Ombudsman."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>  They claim that the proper mode of appeal in questioning the final judgment, order, or resolution of quasi-judicial bodies or agencies is provided under <b>Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</b>. Section 1 of said Rule states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.  <i>Scope.</i>. - This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions.  Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6557, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law."</blockquote><br>To support their contention that Rule 43 applies to this case, private respondents rely on the Court's ruling in <i>Fabian v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113] </sup>which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Under the present Rule 45, appeals may be brought through a petition for review on <i> certiorari</i> but only from judgments and final orders of the courts enumerated in Section 1 thereof.  <b> Appeals from judgments and final orders of quasi-judicial agencies are now required to be brought to the Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review, under the requirements and conditions in Rule 43 which was precisely formulated and adopted to provide for a uniform rule of appellate procedure for quasi-judicial agencies. </b><br><br>It is suggested, however, that the provisions of Rule 43 should apply only to "ordinary" quasi- judicial agencies, but not to the Office of the Ombudsman which is a "high constitutional body." We see no reason for this distinction for, if hierarchical rank should be a criterion, that proposition thereby disregards the fact that Rule 43 even includes the Office of the President and the Civil Service Commission, although the latter is even an independent constitutional commission, unlike the Office of the Ombudsman which is a constitutionally-mandated but statutorily-created body.  (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Public respondent Ombudsman likewise argues that petitioner has taken the wrong mode of appeal, citing the rule as laid down by this Court in <i>Tirol v. del Rosario</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [114] </sup>which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 provides that orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases are appealable to the Supreme Court via Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, in Fabian v. Desierto, we declared that Section 27 is unconstitutional since it expanded the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, without its advice and consent, in violation of Article VI, Section 30 of the Constitution.  Hence, all appeals from decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases may be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>True, the law is silent on the remedy of an aggrieved party in case the Ombudsman found sufficient cause to indict him in criminal or non-administrative cases.  We cannot supply such deficiency if none has been provided in the law.  We have held that the right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege and may be exercised only in the manner prescribed by, and in accordance with, the provisions of law.  Hence, there must be a law expressly granting such privilege.  The Ombudsman Act specifically deals with the remedy of an aggrieved party from orders, directives and decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. As we ruled in Fabian, the aggrieved party is given the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals.  <b>Such right of appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like finding probable cause to indict accused persons.</b></blockquote><br>Public respondent avers that no information has been filed with either the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> or the Regional Trial Court; and not only did petitioner resort to the wrong mode of appeal, he also raised factual issues in his petition, which are not proper grounds for appeal under the rule. Public respondent further avers that an error in the choice or mode of appeal is one of the grounds for the dismissal of the appeal under Section 5, Rule 56 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> This, aggravated by improper grounds raised on appeal, has rendered the instant petition dismissible.<br><br>Although we agree with private respondents Velarde that a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 is not the proper remedy for parties seeking relief from final judgments, orders, or resolutions of quasi- judicial bodies or agencies like the Office of the Ombudsman, as has been repeatedly held by this Court,[116] we find that the remedy of appeal under Rule 43 posited by private respondents Velarde is not proper either. This Court subsequently held that under the ruling in <i>Fabian</i>, "all appeals from decisions of the Ombudsman in <b><i>administrative disciplinary cases</i></b> may be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117] </sup> Said remedy, therefore, is not applicable to cases involving criminal or non-administrative charges filed before the Office of the Ombudsman, which is the situation in the case before us now.  As we further stated in <i>Tirol v. Del Rosario</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[An] aggrieved party is not without recourse where the finding of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. An aggrieved party may file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under <b>Rule 65</b> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. </blockquote> In <i>Fabian v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> the case was dismissed and remanded to the Court of Appeals.  This case being criminal and not administrative in nature, however, the conclusion in <i>Fabian</i> is not applicable.<br><br>Thus, due to the nature of this case and the allegations involving grave abuse of discretion committed by the Office of the Ombudsman, it should have been filed under <b>Rule 65</b>, and not Rule 45, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>This Court had already provided this remedy in <i>Nava v</i>. <i>Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> wherein we held:<br><br><blockquote><b>The remedy availed of by petitioner is erroneous. Instead of a petition for <i>certiorari </i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, petitioner filed with this Court the present petition for review on <i> certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court pursuant to the provisions of Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770. </b><br><br>Rule 45 of the Rules of Court provides that only judgments or final orders or resolutions of the Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court and other courts, whenever authorized by law, may be the subject of an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to this Court.  It does not include resolutions of the Ombudsman on preliminary investigations in criminal cases. Petitioner's reliance on Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 is misplaced. Section 27 is involved only whenever an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 is taken from a decision in an administrative disciplinary action. It cannot be taken into account where an original action for <i>certiorari </i> under Rule 65 is resorted to as a remedy for judicial review, such as from an incident in a criminal action. In other words, the right to appeal is not granted to parties aggrieved by orders and decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, like the case at bar. Such right is granted only from orders or decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases.<br><br><b>An aggrieved party is not left without any recourse. Where the findings of the Ombudsman as to the existence of probable cause is tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the aggrieved party may file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. </b>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Again, in <i>Flores v. Office of Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> we ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The instant petition was captioned as a petition for review by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, the arguments raised refer to alleged grave abuse of discretion committed by the Office of the Ombudsman.  <b>In determining the nature of an action, it is not the caption, but the averments in the petition and the character of the relief sought, that are controlling. Accordingly, we are compelled to consider the instant petition as one under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.</b></blockquote><br>This case involves a significant amount of money that was already released by the government to a private institution, AMVEL, as purchase price for the road right-of-way in a major infrastructure project that was undertaken by the former and that naturally affected the general public.  Therefore, even if this case was erroneously filed as shown above, and may be dismissed outright under the rules, the Court deems it appropriate to brush aside technicalities of procedure, as this involves matters of transcendental importance to the public;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> and to consider the petition as one for <i>certiorari</i> filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>Respondents argue further that the petition should be instantly dismissed for failing to raise purely questions of law.  As may be gleaned from petitioner's assignment of errors, this Court is being asked to determine the following, which involve questions of fact:<br><br><ol><li>Whether or not Administrative Order No. 50, s. 1999 is applicable to the sale of the subject properties in this case;<br><br></li><li> Whether or not private respondents complied with the prescribed procedure in determining a fair and reasonable valuation of the subject properties;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not respondents bloated the purchase price;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not respondents changed the original alignment of the Sucat Interchange, which resulted in an increase in the size of the AMVEL property sold to the government;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not respondent Mariano Z. Velarde "made a killing" in the sale of the subject properties;<br><br></li><li> Whether or not a portion of the subject properties did not have a clean title at the time they were sold to the government;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the cost of the right-of-way was bloated, which led to the depletion of the proceeds of the US$68.6 Million loan for the right-of-way acquisition; and<br><br></li><li>Whether or not respondents de-prioritized the R-1 Expressway Extension over the C-5 Link Expressway. </li></ol>It is settled that this Court is not a trier of facts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> and its jurisdiction is limited to errors of law.  As we held in <i>Tirol v. Commission on Audit</i>, "There is a question of law in any given case when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts.  A question of fact arises when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of alleged facts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>Moreover, in <i>Medina v. City Sheriff, Manila</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> we have stated:<br><br><blockquote>For this petition to be granted, it must be shown that the respondent appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion equivalent to lack of jurisdiction and not mere errors of judgment, for <i>certiorari</i> is not a remedy for errors of judgment, which are correctible by appeal. </blockquote> <b> <br>B.  Whether or not public respondent Office of the Ombudsman committed serious errors of law as well as grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction in issuing the questioned Resolution and Order</b><br><br>In the case now before us, petitioner wants this Court to review the evidence that was already thoroughly studied by public respondent Ombudsman and passed upon in the questioned Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup>  Thus, public respondent found that:<br><br><blockquote>The uncontroverted facts clearly show that Administrative Order No. 50 was issued on February 17, 1999, while the transaction/ negotiation for the purchase of affected lands was consummated as early as May 1998. As correctly pointed out by respondents, the governing law is Executive Order No. 132, (E.O. No. 132) issued on December 27, 1937, which laid down the following procedure:<br><br><blockquote>a)  The Director of the Bureau of Public Works, City or District Engineer or other officials concerned shall make the necessary negotiations with owner of the property needed for public use with a view to having it donated, or sold to the government at not to exceed the assessed valuation prior to the investigation and survey of the project.<br><br>b)  If the negotiation fails, the officials concerned shall forthwith and by formal notification submit the matter to an Appraisal Committee which is hereby created and which shall be composed of the Provincial Treasurer, as Chairman, and the District Engineer and the District Auditor, as members, of the province where the land is located.  If the property is situated in a chartered city the Appraisal Committee shall composed (<i>sic</i>) of the City Treasurer, as Chairman and the City Engineer and City Auditor, as members. x x x</blockquote>A perusal of the guidelines as well as the documentary evidence on the transaction reveals that respondents complied with the prescribed procedure in determining a fair and reasonable valuation of the properties in question.  The referral for the determination of the fair market value of the properties to [the] Paranaque City Appraisal Committee which recommended the payment of P20,000.00 per sq. m. thereof was in order.  The appraisal was a result of several [factors] ranging from assessing the location accessibility, selling prices of comparable properties, the amenities present like water, electricity, transportation and communication within the vicinity and the status or condition of the parcels of land.  TRB's act of subjecting the properties to another round of appraisal, this time, by three independent appraisal companies is a manifestation that TRB had made sure that the Government would not be put in a disadvantageous position in view of a very high appraisal recommended by PCAC. Clearly, the result of the appraisals conducted by the three (3) independent appraiser companies led TRB to come up with an average appraisal in the amount of P15,355.00 per square [meter] in purchasing AMVEL's property.  The amount is far below the original recommendation of PCAC to purchase AMVEL's property at P20,000.00 per sq. m.<br><br>Complainant merely relied on ... Administrative Order No. 50 issued by respondent Estrada and on the fact that the valuation must be based on zonal valuation fixed by BIR at P4,000.00 per sq. m. a year prior to the sale.<br><br>As earlier stated, Administrative Order No. 50 finds no application to the already perfected contract between TRB and AMVEL. On the Zonal Valuation (6<sup>th</sup> Revision) that took effect on February 2, 1997 whereby it fixed the amount of P4,500.00 per sq. m. as valuation of the affected properties however refers to residential regular (RR) lands situated in Dr. A. Santos Avenue, San Dionisio, Paranaque City.  The commercial lands along same place was fixed at P20,000.00 per sq. m. and along Ninoy Aquino International Airport at P30,000.00 per sq. m.  The affected AMVEL properties were classified by Ordinance No. 97-08, pages 32, 33, 34 as within the C-3 high intensity commercial zone. The properties in question being within commercial zone, PCAC properly recommended valuation of P20,000.00 is justified (<i>sic</i>).  We agree with the PCAC that the appraisal of a property is not limited only to the zonal valuation by the BIR.  As correctly pointed out by respondents Nacianceno, Daval-Santos, Medina-Cue and de Leon, the appraisal of properties are also based on location, accessibility, selling prices of comparable properties, the amenities present like water, electricity, transportation and communication, etc. In fact, in Administrative Order No. 50, zonal valuation is only one of the many factors being considered in the payment of just compensation.<br><blockquote>Complainant also anchored his complaint on two (2) Memoranda dated March 30, 1999, from then President Estrada x x x.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote>We find no circumstance to consider the two (2) Memoranda anomalous or irregular.  The approval of the Deeds of Sale between TRB and AMVEL by respondent Estrada was in pursuance to the provisions of P.D. 1112.<br><br>It may not be amiss to state that the transaction between TRB and AMVEL was consummated as early as May 1998 during the administration of former President Fidel V. Ramos.  The payment of the purchase price was only delayed as the TRB conducted a re-appraisal of the property until the new administration of respondent Estrada in June 1998.  It was only in January 1999 that TRB, then having come out with a new price per sq. m. after averaging the appraisal of the three (3) independent appraisers and of PCAC, approved the purchase price of P1,221,799,806.00 for the acquisition of AMVEL's property totaling 79,598 per sq. m. at P15,350.00.  This delay in the determination of the consideration did not affect the already perfected contract as the consideration thereof was already determined or determinable.  The events negate complainant's claim that the transaction was concluded in just 2 ½ working days.  The insinuation that respondent Estrada favored AMVEL in approving the purchase of subject properties . . . has no basis.  If indeed AMVEL persuaded respondent Estrada to act on its favor, then AMVEL could have pushed for the acquisition of the properties not at P15,350.00 but at P20,000.00 per sq. m.  Besides, the valuation of P15,355.00 per sq. m. paid to AMVEL is much lower than the advertised price of the properties adjacent to AMVEL pegged at least P19,000.00to P55,000.00 per sq. m.  x x x Further, [with] respondents Velarde and/or AMVEL, being engaged in business, it is natural that they engage in profit scheme (<i>sic</i>) which in this case appears justified.<br><br>While there was a complete payment in favor of AMVEL of the purchase price of P1,221,766,640.00 within one (1) month from the time respondent Estrada approved the transaction, we find the same not anomalous. The several [Deeds] of Sale executed by the parties, TRB and AMVEL, stipulate that fifty (50%) percent of the purchase price shall be paid upon execution of the contract.  The other fifty (50%) percent upon issuance by the Register of Deeds of the corresponding Transfer Certificate of Title covering the properties in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>In the crime of Plunder, the following elements must exist:<br><blockquote>2. A public officer acquires wealth by himself or in connivance with another person;<br><br>3. The acquisition of the wealth was obtained through the means described in Section 1 (d).<br></blockquote>In the instant case, the alleged ill-gotten wealth consisting of the overpriced purchase price of the properties affected by C-5 Link, was allegedly obtained by respondents by taking undue advantage of their official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of the Filipino People.<br><br>We find no evidence to support complainant's claim of the existence of ill-gotten wealth.  The purchase price of P1,221,799,804 paid to AMVEL could not be considered as ill-gotten wealth as said amount is a consideration of a legally entered Deeds (<i>sic</i>) of Sale.  There is no evidence that public respondents benefited/profited or had taken shares with private respondents in the transaction.<br><br>Complainant contends that public and private [respondents'] acts constitute also violation of Section 3(a), (e), (g), (h) and (j) of Republic Act 3019, as amended.<br><br>We find no evidence to support said allegation.<br><br>In reference to Section 3(a), there is no sufficient evidence showing that respondents, especially respondent Estrada, induced or influenced anybody to perform an act in violation of rules and regulation (<i>sic</i>). Neither was there proof of a violation of any rules or regulations promulgated by competent authority. Administrative Order No. 50 cannot be considered as the rule violated since it finds no applications (<i>sic</i>) on the questioned transaction.<br><br>Insofar as Section 3(e) is concerned, there was no showing that the government suffered undue injury when the AMVEL properties were purchased at P15,355.00 per sq. m.  As earlier pointed out, complainant relied on the valuation of P4,500.00 per sq. m. fixed by the BIR when the said valuation applies to regular residential land and not to commercial lots fixed at least P20,000.00 per sq. m.  The P15,355.00 per square  meter [price] is relatively low compared to that recommended by PCAC and contained at BIR Zonal Valuation which was P20,000.00 per sq. m.<br><br>Referring to Section 3(g), there was no basis to conclude that the contract was grossly disadvantageous to the government.  On the contrary, the government was able to save money when it decided to purchase the questioned properties at P15,355.00 per sq. m. and not at P20,000.00.<br><br>Section 3(j) has no application in the instant case as it pertains to the granting of a license, permit or benefit. Assuming as it does, it established a record that the affected properties were purchased from persons or [entities] who were legally authorized to sell or own the same in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.<br><br>We find no evidence that the elements of Section 3(h) exist.  The provision requires that there must be an actual intervention in the transaction for financial or pecuniary interest by public respondent.  While there was an intervention by public respondents the same were in pursuance to the exercise official duties.  Neither public respondents have direct or indirect financial or pecuniary interest with AMVEL.<br><br>Considering that the crimes imputed against the respondents were not shown to exist, conspiracy could not likewise be appreciated. It is a well settled ruled that conspiracy must be proven as clearly as the commission of the offense itself.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this case is hereby DISMISSED for lack of evidence.<br><br>SO RESOLVED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Upon Motion for Reconsideration of petitioner, respondent Office of the Ombudsman issued an Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128] </sup>the pertinent portions of which are quoted below:<br><br><blockquote>There is no truth to the allegation that the Ombudsman deliberately failed to order the conduct of fact- finding investigation. To conduct a fact-finding investigation is a question addressed to the sound discretion of the Ombudsman and not therefore as a matter of right.  When the instant complaint was filed complainant attached voluminous documents which when evaluated was sufficient in form and substance to conduct preliminary investigation.  To that matter, there is no need to conduct fact-finding activities as the compliant already reached the formal stage of investigation to determine whether or not probable cause exists to charge respondents.  In the same manner, the request for subpoena duces tecum cannot be demanded as a matter of policy for every [case] filed before this Office. From the very beginning it is the duty of the complainant to present complete and ample evidence to support his allegation and not to rely on the coercive processes of this Office lest to be accused of being a tool for every complainant's crusade and be labeled as engaged in fishing evidence.<br><br>[Complainant] questions the inhibition of the Honorable Ombudsman.  We view however the same inhibition a prudent exercise of impartiality.  Prudence dictates that the Honorable Ombudsman himself should inhibit to clear any suspicion that he would engage in any retaliatory [act] against the complainant in view of the impeachment case filed by the latter.  Far from the accusation that the Honorable Ombudsman prejudged the case as well as the members of the Panel, we submit that the resolution was arrived [at] after a painstaking appreciation of the available evidence of the complainant and respondents.<br><br>As a consequence of the inhibition of the Honorable Ombudsman, the Overall Deputy Ombudsman, Hon. Margarito P. Gervacio, Jr. had to perform the duties of the Ombudsman and assumed and took charge of the disposition of the case.  This finds support under Section 8 of R.A. 6770, otherwise known as "Ombudsman Act of 1989".  On the contrary, complainant failed to cite the particular provision of law allegedly violated when the Overall Deputy Ombudsman approved the dismissal of the case. In the same manner we find the insinuations of the complainant against the Overall Deputy Ombudsman baseless much more sufficient to affect or disturb whatever findings we have in our resolution.<br><br>Complainant alleges that his evidence were totally disregarded.  He forgot however, that respondents have evidence too.  Notwithstanding with the voluminous documents complainant submitted, this Office has to weigh the evidentiary value and credibility of the evidence as well as the arguments of both parties.  It so happened that in the appreciation thereof, we gave credence to the evidence of the other parties.  That judgment cannot be put as an issue that would warrant the reversal of our decision.<br><br>In general, the Motion for Reconsideration failed to advance new arguments that would warrant the reversal of the questioned Resolution.  There was no new evidence submitted by the complainant to warrant a second look of our resolution.  The supposed documents he attached in the Motion were already passed upon and examined by this Office.  Lastly, complainant miserably failed to point out specifically the findings or conclusion of the resolution which was contrary to law.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration of the complainant is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>We find no cogent reason to weigh all over again the evidence in this case and to reverse the findings of the public respondent quoted above.  This is because, as we held in <i>Tirol v. COA:</i><br><br><blockquote>[This] Court ordinarily does not interfere with the discretion of the Ombudsman to determine whether there exists reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts.  This rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well.  Otherwise the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by immeasurable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in as much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br></blockquote><br>More recently, we had occasion to pass upon a similar case, the core issue of which was whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioners' complaint against the respondents.  In that case, we ruled in the negative and, accordingly, dismissed the petition.[130]  Thus, we held:<br><br><blockquote>We cannot overemphasize the fact that the Ombudsman is a constitutional officer duty bound to " investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient."  The raison d 'etre for its creation and endowment of broad investigative authority is to insulate it from the long tentacles of officialdom that are able to penetrate judges' and fiscals' offices, and others involved in the prosecution of erring public officials, and through the execution of official pressure and influence, quash, delay, or dismiss investigations into malfeasances and misfeasances committed by public officers.<br><br>In <i>Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) v. Desierto,</i> we dwelt on the powers, functions and duties of the Ombudsman, to wit:<br><blockquote>The prosecution of offenses committed by public officers is vested primarily in the Office of the Ombudsman. It bears emphasis that the Office has been given a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory powers under the Constitution and Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989). This discretion is all but free from legislative, executive or judicial intervention to ensure that the Office is insulated from any outside pressure and improper influence.<br><br>Indeed, the Ombudsman is empowered to determine whether there exist reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts. The Ombudsman may thus conduct an investigation if the complaint filed is found to be in the proper form and substance. Conversely, the Ombudsman may also dismiss the complaint should it be found insufficient in form or substance.<br><br>Unless there are good and compelling reasons to do so, the Court will refrain from interfering with the exercise of the Ombudsman's powers, and respect the initiative and independence inherent in the latter who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of public service.<br></blockquote>The pragmatic basis for the general rule was explained in <i>Ocampo v. Ombudsman</i>:<br><blockquote>The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by private complainants.<br></blockquote>From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that we do not interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers vested by the Constitution. In short, we do not review the Ombudsman's exercise of discretion in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint except when the exercise thereof is tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup></blockquote><br>In the recent case <i>Lazatin v. Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> this Court held that the question of whether "the Ombudsman correctly ruled that there was enough evidence to support a finding of probable cause pertains to a mere error of judgment."  The Court further held:<br><br><blockquote>It must be stressed that <i>certiorari</i> is a remedy meant to correct only errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment. This has been emphasized in <i>First Corporation v. Former Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals </i>, <i>to wit</i>:<br><blockquote>It is a fundamental aphorism in law that a review of facts and evidence is not the province of the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>, which is <i>extra ordinem</i> -- beyond the ambit of appeal.  In <i> certiorari</i> proceedings, judicial review does not go as far as to examine and assess the evidence of the parties and to weigh the probative value thereof. It does not include an inquiry as to the correctness of the evaluation of evidence.  Any error committed in the evaluation of evidence is merely an error of judgment that cannot be remedied by <i>certiorari</i>.  <i>An error of judgment </i>is one which the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction.  <i>An error of jurisdiction</i> is one where the act complained of was issued by the court without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, which is tantamount to lack or in excess of jurisdiction and which error is correctible only by the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>.  Certiorari will not be issued to cure errors of the trial court in its appreciation of the evidence of the parties, or its conclusions anchored on the said findings and its conclusions of law.  It is not for this Court to re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of the witnesses or substitute the findings of fact of the court <i>a quo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Even if the issues involved here are factual, petitioner invokes the power of the Court to reverse the decision of the Ombudsman by alleging that the latter acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  However, as in <i>Morong Water District v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> we find that:<br><blockquote>[The] Order and the Resolution of the Ombudsman are based on substantial evidence. In dismissing the complaint of petitioner, we cannot say that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion so as to call for the exercise of our supervisory powers over him.  This court is not a trier of facts.  As long as there is substantial evidence in support of the Ombudsman's decision, that ... decision will not be overturned.<br></blockquote><br>As regards petitioner's insistence that the Office of the Ombudsman should have conducted a fact-finding investigation and issued <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> as requested, we find that the Ombudsman's action not to issue the same was not made in grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup>  We have previously ruled regarding this matter in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>If the Ombudsman may dismiss a complaint outright for lack of merit, it necessarily follows that it is also within his discretion to determine whether the evidence before him is sufficient to establish probable cause. Thus, <b>petitioners may not compel the Ombudsman to order the production of certain documents, if in theOmbudsman's judgment such documents are not necessary in order to establish the guilt, or innocence, of the accused.</b><br><br>It has been the consistent policy of the Supreme Court not to interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory powers.  xxx<br><br>[It] is beyond the ambit of this Court to review the exercise of discretion of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before it. Such initiative and independence are inherent in the Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and preserver of the integrity of the public service.<br><br>The rationale underlying the Court's policy of non-interference was laid down in <i>Ocampo v.Ombudsman </i>and reiterated in the more recent case of <i>Venus v. Desierto</i>, to wit:<br><br>The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsmanbut upon practicality as well.  Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup></blockquote><br>Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as "such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction."  The abuse of discretion must be "so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>  We do not find this situation to be present in the instant case so as to merit a reversal of the questioned Resolution and Order issued by respondent Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
