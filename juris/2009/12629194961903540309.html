Towards this end, courts ought to reject assaults against the validity of statutes, barring of course their clear unconstitutionality. To doubt is to sustain, the theory in context being that the law is the product of earnest studies by Congress to ensure that no constitutional prescription or concept is infringed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Consequently, before a law duly challenged is nullified, an unequivocal breach of, or a clear conflict with, the Constitution, not merely a doubtful or argumentative one, must be demonstrated in such a manner as to leave no doubt in the mind of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>BACKGROUND</u></b><br></div><br>The consolidated petitions for prohibition commenced by the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), City of Iloilo, City of Calbayog, and Jerry P.

The motion is denied since there is no majority that voted to overturn the Resolution of 31 March 2009.<br><br>The Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision of 18 November 2008 is DENIED for being a prohibited pleading, and the Motion for Leave to Admit Attached Petition in Intervention x x x filed by counsel for Ludivina T. Mas, et al. are also DENIED. No further pleadings shall be entertained. Let entry of judgment be made in due course. x x x</blockquote><br>On <b>May 14, 2009</b>, respondent LGUs filed a <i>Motion to Amend the Resolution of April 28, 2009 by Declaring Instead that Respondents'  "Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of March 31, 2009" and "Motion for Leave to File and to Admit Attached `Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision Dated November 18, 2008' Remain Unresolved and to Conduct Further Proceedings Thereon</i>."<br><br>Per its <b>Resolution of June 2, 2009</b>, the Court declared the May 14, 2009 motion adverted to as expunged in light of the entry of judgment made on May 21, 2009. Justice Leonardo-De Castro, however, taking common cause with Justice Bersamin to grant the motion for reconsideration of the April 28, 2009 Resolution and to recall the entry of judgment, stated the observation, and with reason, that the entry was effected "before the Court could act on the aforesaid motion which was filed within the 15-day period counted from receipt of the April 28, 2009 Resolution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Forthwith, respondent LGUs filed a <i>Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of June 2, 2009</i> to which some of the petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention filed their respective comments. The Court will now rule on this incident. But first, we set and underscore some basic premises:<br><br>(1) The initial motion to reconsider the November 18, 2008 Decision, as Justice Leonardo-De Castro noted, indeed raised new and substantial issues, inclusive of the matter of the correctness of the factual premises upon which the said decision was predicated.  The 6-6 vote on the motion for reconsideration per the Resolution of March 31, 2009, which denied the motion on the sole ground that "the basic issues have already been passed upon" reflected a divided Court on the issue of whether or not the underlying Decision of November 18, 2008 had indeed passed upon the basic issues raised in the motion for reconsideration of the said decision;<br><br>(2) The aforesaid May 14, 2009 <i>Motion to Amend Resolution of April 28, 2009</i> was precipitated by the tie vote which served as basis for the issuance of said resolution. This May 14, 2009 motion--which mainly argued that a tie vote is inadequate to declare a law unconstitutional-- remains unresolved; and<br><br>(3) Pursuant to Sec. 4(2), Art. VIII of the Constitution, all cases involving the constitutionality of a law shall be heard by the Court <i>en banc </i>and decided with the concurrence of a majority of the Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted thereon.<br><br>The basic issue tendered in this motion for reconsideration of the June 2, 2009 Resolution boils down to whether or not the required vote set forth in the aforesaid Sec. 4(2), Art. VIII is limited only to the initial vote on the petition or also to the subsequent voting on the motion for reconsideration where the Court is called upon and actually votes on the constitutionality of a law or like issuances. Or, as applied to this case, would a minute resolution dismissing, on a tie vote, a motion for reconsideration on the sole stated ground--that the "basic issues have already been passed"-- suffice to hurdle the voting requirement required for a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the cityhood laws in question?<br><br>The 6-6 vote on the motion to reconsider the Resolution of March 31, 2009, which denied the initial motion on the sole ground that "the basic issues had already been passed upon" betrayed an evenly divided Court on the issue of whether or not the underlying Decision of November 18, 2008 had indeed passed upon the issues raised in the motion for reconsideration of the said decision.  But at the end of the day, the single issue that matters and the vote that really counts really turn on the constitutionality of the cityhood laws.  And be it remembered that the inconclusive 6-6 tie vote reflected in the April 28, 2009 Resolution was the last vote on the issue of whether or not the cityhood laws infringe the Constitution. Accordingly, the motions of the respondent LGUs, in light of the 6-6 vote, should be deliberated anew until the required concurrence on the issue of the validity or invalidity of the laws in question is, on the merits, secured.<br><br>It ought to be clear that a deadlocked vote does not reflect the "majority of the Members" contemplated in Sec. 4 (2) of Art. VIII of the Constitution, which requires that:<br><br><blockquote>All cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, international or executive agreement, or law shall be heard by the Supreme Court <i>en banc</i>, x x x shall be decided with the <b>concurrence of a majority</b> of the Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted thereon. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Webster defines "majority" as "a number greater than half of a total."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In plain language, this means 50% plus one. In <i>Lambino v. Commission on Elections</i>, Justice, now Chief Justice, Puno, in a separate opinion, expressed the view that "<b>a deadlocked vote of six (6) is not a majority and a non-majority cannot write a rule with precedential value</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>As may be noted, the aforequoted Sec. 4 of Art. VIII, as couched, exacts a majority vote in the determination of a case involving the constitutionality of a statute, without distinguishing whether such determination is made on the main petition or thereafter on a motion for reconsideration. This is as it should be, for, to borrow from the late Justice Ricardo J. Francisco: "x x x [E]ven assuming x x x that the constitutional requirement on the concurrence of the `majority' was initially reached in the x x x <i>ponencia</i>, the same is inconclusive as it was still open for review by way of a motion for reconsideration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>To be sure, the Court has taken stock of the rule on a tie-vote situation, i.e., Sec. 7, Rule 56 and the complementary A.M. No. 99-1-09- SC, respectively, providing that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7<i>. Procedure if opinion is equally divided</i>. - Where the court en banc is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall again be deliberated on, and if after such deliberation no decision is reached, the original action commenced in the court shall be dismissed; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and on all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied.<br><br><b>  A.M. No. 99-1-09-SC</b> - x x x A motion for reconsideration of a decision or resolution of the Court <i>En Banc</i> or of a Division may be granted upon a vote of a majority of the <i>En Banc</i> or of a Division, as the case may be, who actually took part in the deliberation of the motion.<br><br>If the voting results in a tie, the motion for reconsideration is deemed denied.</blockquote><br>But since the instant cases fall under Sec. 4 (2), Art. VIII of the Constitution, the aforequoted provisions ought to be applied in conjunction with the prescription of the Constitution that the cases "shall be decided with the concurrence of a majority of the Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the instant cases and voted thereon."  To repeat, the last vote on the issue of the constitutionality of the cityhood bills is that reflected in the April 28, 2009 Resolution--a 6-6 deadlock.<br><br>On the postulate then that <i>first</i>, the finality of the November 18, 2008 Decision has yet to set in, the issuance of the precipitate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> entry of judgment notwithstanding, and <i>second</i>, the deadlocked vote on the second motion for reconsideration did not definitely settle the constitutionality of the cityhood laws, the Court is inclined to take another hard look at the underlying decision. Without belaboring in their smallest details the arguments for and against the procedural dimension of this disposition, it bears to stress that the Court has the power to suspend its own rules when the ends of justice would be served thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  In the performance of their duties, courts should not be shackled by stringent rules which would result in manifest injustice.  Rules of procedure are only tools crafted to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application must be eschewed, if they result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice.  Substantial rights must not be prejudiced by a rigid and technical application of the rules in the altar of expediency.  When a case is impressed with public interest, a relaxation of the application of the rules is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  Time and again, this Court has suspended its own rules or excepted a particular case from their operation whenever the higher interests of justice so require.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>While perhaps not on all fours with the case, because it involved a purely business transaction, what the Court said in <i>Chuidian v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> is most apropos:<br><br><blockquote>To reiterate what the Court has said in <i>Ginete vs. Court of Appeals</i> and other cases, the rules of procedure should be viewed as mere instruments designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. They are not to be applied with severity and rigidity when such application would clearly defeat the very rationale for their conception and existence. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules, inclusive of the one-motion rule, can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court has already declared to be final. The peculiarities of this case impel us to do so now.</blockquote><br>The Court, by a vote of 6-4, grants the respondent LGUs' motion for reconsideration of the Resolution of June 2, 2009, as well as their May 14, 2009 motion to consider the second motion for reconsideration of the November 18, 2008 Decision unresolved, and also grants said second motion for reconsideration.<br><br>This brings us to the substantive aspect of the case.<br><br><b><center>The Undisputed Factual Antecedents in Brief</center></b><br>During the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> fifty-seven (57) cityhood bills were filed before the House of Representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Of the fifty-seven (57), thirty-three (33) eventually became laws. The twenty-four (24) other bills were not acted upon.<br><br>Later developments saw the introduction in the Senate of Senate Bill (S. Bill) No. 2157<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to amend Sec. 450 of Republic Act No. (RA) 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991.  The proposed amendment sought to increase the income requirement to qualify for conversion into a city from PhP 20 million average annual income to PhP 100 million locally generated income.<br><br>In March 2001, S. Bill No. 2157 was signed into law as RA 9009 to take effect on June 30, 2001. As thus amended by RA 9009,  Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991 now provides that "[a] municipality x x x may be converted into a component city if it has a [certified] locally generated average annual income x x x of at least [PhP 100 million] for the last two (2) consecutive years based on 2000 constant prices."<br><br>After the effectivity of RA 9009, the Lower House of the 12<sup>th</sup> Congress adopted in July 2001 House (H.) Joint Resolution No. 29<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which, as its title indicated, sought to exempt from the income requirement prescribed in RA 9009 the 24 municipalities whose conversions into cities were not acted upon during the previous Congress. The 12<sup>th</sup> Congress ended without the Senate approving H. Joint Resolution No. 29.<br><br>Then came the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress (July 2004 to June 2007), which saw the House of Representatives re-adopting H. Joint Resolution No. 29 as H. Joint Resolution No. 1 and forwarding it to the Senate for approval.<br><br>The Senate, however, again failed to approve the joint resolution.  During the Senate session held on November 6, 2006, Senator Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. asserted that passing H. Resolution No. 1 would, in net effect, allow a wholesale exemption from the income requirement imposed under RA 9009 on the municipalities. For this reason, he suggested the filing by the House of Representatives of individual bills to pave the way for the municipalities to become cities and then forwarding them to the Senate for proper action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Heeding the advice, sixteen (16) municipalities filed, through their respective sponsors, individual cityhood bills.  Common to all 16 measures was a provision exempting the municipality covered from the PhP 100 million income requirement.<br><br>As of June 7, 2007, both Houses of Congress had approved the individual cityhood bills, all of which eventually lapsed into law on various dates.  Each cityhood law directs the COMELEC, within thirty (30) days from its approval, to hold a plebiscite to determine whether the voters approve of the conversion.<br><br>As earlier stated, the instant petitions seek to declare the cityhood laws unconstitutional for violation of Sec. 10, Art. X of the Constitution, as well as for violation of the equal-protection clause. The wholesale conversion of municipalities into cities, the petitioners bemoan, will reduce the share of existing cities in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), since more cities will partake of the internal revenue set aside for all cities under Sec. 285 of the LGC of 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioners-in-intervention, LPC members themselves, would later seek leave and be allowed to intervene.<br><br>Aside from their basic plea to strike down as unconstitutional the cityhood laws in question, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention collectively pray that an order issue enjoining the COMELEC from conducting plebiscites in the affected areas. An alternative prayer would urge the Court to restrain the poll body from proclaiming the plebiscite results.<br><br>On July 24, 2007, the Court <i>en banc</i> resolved to consolidate the petitions and the petitions-in-intervention. On March 11, 2008, it heard the parties in oral arguments.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>In the main, the issues to which all others must yield pivot on whether or not the cityhood laws violate (1) Sec. 10. Art. X of the Constitution and (2) the equal protection clause.<br><br>In the November 18, 2008 Decision granting the petitions, Justice Antonio T. Carpio, for the Court, resolved the twin posers in the affirmative and accordingly declared the cityhood laws unconstitutional, deviating as they do from the uniform and non-discriminatory income criterion prescribed by the LGC of 1991.  In so doing, the <i>ponencia</i> veritably agreed with the petitioners that the Constitution, in clear and unambiguous language, requires that all the criteria for the creation of a city shall be embodied and written in the LGC, and not in any other law.<br><br>After a circumspect reflection, the Court is disposed to reconsider.<br><br>Petitioners' threshold posture, characterized by a strained interpretation of the Constitution, if accorded cogency, would veritably curtail and cripple Congress' valid exercise of its authority to create political subdivisions.<br><br>By constitutional design<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and as a matter of long-established principle, the power to create political subdivisions or LGUs is essentially legislative in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> But even without any constitutional grant, Congress can, by law, create, divide, merge, or altogether abolish or alter the boundaries of a province, city, or municipality. We said as much in the fairly recent case, <i>Sema v. CIMELEC</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  The 1987 Constitution, under its Art. X, Sec. 10, nonetheless provides for the creation of LGUs, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 10. No province, city, municipality, or <i>barangay </i>shall be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered, except in accordance with the criteria established<b> in the local government code</b> and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the political units directly affected.  (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As may be noted, the afore-quoted provision specifically provides for the creation of political subdivisions "<b>in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code</b>," subject to the approval of the voters in the unit concerned. The criteria referred to are the verifiable indicators of viability, i.e., area, population, and income, now set forth in Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991, as amended by RA 9009. The petitioners would parlay the thesis that these indicators or criteria must be written only in the LGC and not in any other statute. Doubtless, the code they are referring to is the LGC of 1991. Pushing their point, they conclude that the cityhood laws that exempted the respondent LGUs from the income standard spelled out in the amendatory RA 9009 offend the Constitution.<br><br>Petitioners' posture does not persuade.<br><br>The supposedly infringed Art. X, Sec. 10 is not a new constitutional provision. Save for the use of the term "<b>barrio</b>" in lieu of "<b>barangay</b>," "<b>may be</b>" instead of "<b>shall</b>," the change of the phrase "<b>unit or units</b>" to "<b>political unit</b>" and the addition of the modifier "<b>directly</b>" to the word "<b>affected</b>," the aforesaid provision is a substantial reproduction of Art. XI, Sec. 3 of the 1973 Constitution, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. No province, city, municipality, or <b><i>barrio may be</i></b> created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered, except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code and subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the <b>unit or units</b> affected.  (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It bears notice, however, that the "<b>code</b>" similarly referred to in the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions is clearly but a law Congress enacted. This is consistent with the aforementioned plenary power of Congress to create political units. Necessarily, since Congress wields the vast poser of creating political subdivisions, surely it can exercise the lesser authority of requiring a set of criteria, standards, or ascertainable indicators of viability for their creation. Thus, the only conceivable reason why the Constitution employs the clause "<b>in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code</b>" is to lay stress that it is Congress alone, and no other, which can impose the criteria. The eminent constitutionalist, Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J., in his treatise on Constitutional Law, specifically on the subject provision, explains:<br><br><blockquote>Prior to 1965, there was a certain lack of clarity with regard to the power to create, divide, merge, dissolve, or change the boundaries of municipal corporations. The extent to which the executive may share in this power was obscured by <i>Cardona v. Municipality of Binangonan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>Pelaez v. Auditor General </i>subsequently clarified the <i>Cardona</i> case when the Supreme Court said that "the authority to <i>create </i>municipal corporations is essentially legislative in nature."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>Pelaez</i>, however, conceded that "the power to fix such common boundary, in order to avoid or settle conflicts of jurisdiction between adjoining municipalities, may partake of an <i>administrative </i>nature-involving as it does, the adoption of means and ways to <i>carry into effect</i> the law creating said municipalities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>Pelaez</i> was silent about division, merger, and dissolution of municipal corporations. But since division in effect <i>creates </i>a new municipality, and both dissolution and merger in effect abolish a legal creation, it may fairly be inferred that these acts are also <i>legislative</i> in nature.<br><br>Section 10 [Art. X of the 1987 Constitution], which is a legacy from the 1973 Constitution, goes further than the doctrine in the <i>Pelaez</i> case.

(BP) 337, the then LGC, was still in effect. Accordingly, had the framers of the 1987 Constitution intended to isolate the embodiment of the criteria only in the LGC, then they would have actually referred to BP 337. Also, they would then not have provided for the enactment by Congress of a new LGC, as they did in Art. X, Sec. 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the Constitution.<br><br>Consistent with its plenary legislative power on the matter, Congress can, via either a consolidated set of laws or a much simpler, single-subject enactment, impose the said verifiable criteria of viability. These criteria need not be embodied in the local government code, albeit this code is the ideal repository to ensure, as much as possible, the element of uniformity. Congress can even, after making a codification, enact an amendatory law, adding to the existing layers of indicators earlier codified, just as efficaciously as it may reduce the same.  In this case, the amendatory RA 9009 upped the already codified income requirement from PhP 20 million to PhP 100 million.  At the end of the day, the passage of amendatory laws is no different from the enactment of laws, i.e., the cityhood laws specifically exempting a particular political subdivision from the criteria earlier mentioned. Congress, in enacting the exempting law/s, effectively decreased the already codified indicators.<br><br>Petitioners' theory that Congress must provide the criteria solely in the LGC and not in any other law strikes the Court as illogical. For if we pursue their contention to its logical conclusion, then RA 9009 embodying the new and increased income criterion would, in a way, also suffer the vice of unconstitutionality. It is startling, however, that petitioners do not question the constitutionality of RA 9009, as they in fact use said law as an argument for the alleged unconstitutionality of the cityhood laws.<br><br>As it were, Congress, through the medium of the cityhood laws, validly decreased the income criterion vis-à-vis the respondent LGUs, but without necessarily being unreasonably discriminatory, as shall be discussed shortly, by reverting to the PhP 20 million threshold what it earlier raised to PhP 100 million. The legislative intent not to subject respondent LGUs to the more stringent requirements of RA 9009 finds expression in the following uniform provision of the cityhood laws:<br><br><blockquote>Exemption from Republic Act No. 9009. - The City of x x x shall be exempted from the income requirement prescribed under Republic Act No. 9009.</blockquote><br>In any event, petitioners' constitutional objection would still be untenable even if we were to assume purely <i>ex hypothesi</i> the correctness of their underlying thesis, viz: that the conversion of a municipality to a city shall be in accordance with, among other things, the income criterion set forth in the LGC of 1991, and in no other; otherwise, the conversion is invalid. We shall explain.<br><br>Looking at the circumstances behind the enactment of the laws subject of contention, the Court finds that the LGC-amending RA 9009, no less, intended the LGUs covered by the cityhood laws to be exempt from the PhP 100 million income criterion.  In other words, the cityhood laws, which merely carried out the intent of RA 9009, adhered, in the final analysis, to the "<b>criteria established in the Local Government Code</b>," pursuant to Sec. 10, Art. X of the 1987 Constitution.  We shall now proceed to discuss this exemption angle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Among the criteria established in the LGC pursuant to Sec.10, Art. X of the 1987 Constitution are those detailed in Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991 under the heading "<i>Requisites for Creation</i>." The section sets the minimum income qualifying bar before a municipality or a cluster of <i>barangay</i>s may be considered for cityhood. Originally, Sec. 164 of BP 337 imposed an average regular annual income "of <b>at least ten million pesos</b> for the last three consecutive years" as a minimum income standard for a municipal-to-city conversion. The LGC that BP 337 established was superseded by the LGC of 1991 whose then Sec. 450 provided that "[a] municipality or cluster of <i>barangays</i> may be converted into a component city if it has an average annual income, x x x of <b>at least twenty million pesos</b> (P20,000,000.00) for at least two (2) consecutive years based on 1991 constant prices x x x." RA 9009 in turn amended said Sec. 450 by further increasing the income requirement to PhP 100 million, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 450.  <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. - (a) A municipality or a cluster of <i>barangays</i> may be converted into a component city if it has a locally generated average annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of at least <b>One Hundred Million Pesos (P100,000,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive years</b> based on 2000 constant prices, and if it has either of the following requisites:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) The average annual income shall include the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive of special funds, transfers, and non-recurring income.

Bill No. 2157. Of particular significance is his statement regarding the basis for the proposed increase from PhP 20 million to PhP 100 million in the income requirement for municipalities wanting to be converted into cities, viz:<br><br><blockquote><b>Senator Pimentel</b>. Mr. President, I would have wanted this bill to be included in the whole set of proposed amendments that we have introduced to precisely amend the [LGC].  However, it is a fact that there is a <b>mad rush of municipalities wanting to be converted into cities</b>.  Whereas in 1991, when the [LGC] was approved, there were only 60 cities, today the number has increased to 85 cities, with 41 more municipalities applying for conversion x x x.  <b>At the rate we are going, I am apprehensive that before long this nation will be a nation of all cities and no municipalities</b>.<br><br>It is for that reason, Mr. President, that we are proposing among other things, that the financial requirement, which, under the [LGC], is fixed at P20 million, be raised to P100 million to enable a municipality to have the right to be converted into a city, and the P100 million should be sourced from locally generated funds.</blockquote><br>Congress to be sure knew, when RA 9009 was being deliberated upon, of the pendency of several bills on cityhood, wherein the applying municipalities were qualified under the then obtaining PhP 20 million-income threshold. These included respondent LGUs. Thus, equally noteworthy is the ensuing excerpts from the floor exchange between then Senate President Franklin Drilon and Senator Pimentel, the latter stopping short of saying that the income threshold of PhP 100 million under S. Bill No. 2157 would not apply to municipalities that have pending cityhood bills, thus:<br><br><blockquote>THE PRESIDENT. The Chair would like to ask for some clarificatory point. x x x<br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  This is just on the point of the <b>pending bills</b> in the Senate which propose the conversion of a number of municipalities into cities and <b>which qualify under the present standard.</b><br><br>We would like to know the view of the sponsor:  <u>Assuming that this bill becomes a law, will the Chamber apply the standard as proposed in this bill to those bills which are pending for consideration</u>?<br><br>SENATOR  PIMENTEL, Mr. President, <u>it might not be fair to make this bill x x x [if] approved, <b>retroact</b> to the bills that are pending in the Senate for conversion from municipalities to cities</u>.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  Will there be an appropriate language crafted to reflect that view? Or does it not become a policy of the Chamber, assuming that this bill becomes a law x x x that it will apply to those bills which are already approved by the House under the old version of the [LGC] and are now pending in the Senate?  The Chair does not know if we can craft a language which will limit the application to those which are not yet in the Senate.  Or is that a policy that the Chamber will adopt?<br><br>SENATOR PIMENTEL. Mr. President, personally, <u>I do not think it is necessary to put that provision because what we are saying here will form part of the interpretation of this bill.  Besides, if there is no retroactivity clause, I do not think that the bill would have any retroactive effect</u>.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT.  <u>So the understanding is that those bills which are already pending in the Chamber will not be affected.</u><br><br>SENATOR PIMENTEL.  <b><u>These will not be affected</u></b>, Mr. President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br>What the foregoing Pimental-Drilon exchange eloquently indicates are the following complementary legislative intentions: (1) the then pending cityhood bills would be outside the pale of the minimum income requirement of PhP 100 million that S. Bill No. 2159 proposes; and (2)  RA 9009 would not have any retroactive effect insofar as the cityhood bills are concerned.<br><br>Given the foregoing perspective, it is not amiss to state that the basis for the inclusion of the exemption clause of the cityhood laws is the clear-cut intent of Congress of not according retroactive effect to RA 9009. Not only do the congressional records bear the legislative intent of exempting the cityhood laws from the income requirement of PhP 100 million. Congress has now made its intention to exempt express in the challenged cityhood laws.<br><br>Legislative intent is part and parcel of the law, the controlling factor in interpreting a statute.

Accordingly, so the argument goes, such deliberations, more particularly those on the unapproved resolution exempting from RA 9009 certain municipalities, are without significance and would not qualify as extrinsic aids in construing the cityhood laws that were passed during  the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress, Congress not being a continuing body.<br><br>The argument is specious and glosses over the reality that the cityhood bills--which were already being deliberated upon even perhaps before the conception of RA 9009--were again being considered during the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress after being tossed around in the two previous Congresses. And specific reference to the cityhood bills was also made during the deliberations on RA 9009. At the end of the day, it is really immaterial if Congress is not a continuing legislative body. What is important is that the debates, deliberations, and proceedings of Congress and the steps taken in the enactment of the law, in this case the cityhood laws in relation to RA 9009 or vice versa, were part of its legislative history and may be consulted, if appropriate, as aids in the interpretation of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  And of course the earlier cited Drilon-Pimentel exchange on whether or not the 16 municipalities in question would be covered by RA 9009 is another vital link to the historical chain of the cityhood bills. This and other proceedings on the bills are spread in the Congressional journals, which cannot be conveniently reduced to pure rhetoric without meaning whatsoever, on the simplistic and <i>non-sequitur</i> pretext that Congress is not a continuing body and that unfinished business in either chamber is deemed terminated at the end of the term of Congress.<br><br>This brings us to the challenge to the constitutionality of cityhood laws on equal protection grounds.<br><br>To the petitioners, the cityhood laws, by granting special treatment to respondent municipalities/LGUs by way of exemption from the standard PhP 100 million minimum income requirement, violate Sec.1, Art. III of the Constitution, which in part provides that no person shall "<b>be denied the equal protection of the laws</b>."<br><br>Petitioners' challenge is not well taken. At its most basic, the equal protection clause proscribes undue favor as well as hostile discrimination. Hence, a law need not operate with equal force on all persons or things to be conformable with Sec. 1, Art. III of the Constitution.<br><br>The equal protection guarantee is embraced in the broader and elastic concept of due process, every unfair discrimination being an offense against the requirements of justice and fair play. It has nonetheless come as a separate clause in Sec. 1, Art. III of the Constitution to provide for a more specific protection against any undue discrimination or antagonism from government.  Arbitrariness in general may be assailed on the basis of the due process clause. But if a particular challenged act partakes of an unwarranted partiality or prejudice, the sharper weapon to cut it down is the equal protection clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This constitutional protection extends to all persons, natural or artificial, within the territorial jurisdiction. Artificial persons, as the respondent LGUs herein, are, however, entitled to protection only insofar as their property is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In the proceedings at bar, petitioner LCP and the intervenors cannot plausibly invoke the equal protection clause, precisely because no deprivation of property results by virtue of the enactment of the cityhood laws. The LCP's claim that the IRA of its member-cities will be substantially reduced on account of the conversion into cities of the respondent LGUs would not suffice to bring it within the ambit of the constitutional guarantee. Indeed, it is presumptuous on the part of the LCP member-cities to already stake a claim on the IRA, as if it were their property, as the IRA is yet to be allocated. For the same reason, the municipalities that are not covered by the uniform exemption clause in the cityhood laws cannot validly invoke constitutional protection. For, at this point, the conversion of a municipality into a city will only affect its status as a political unit, but not its property as such.<br><br>As a matter of settled legal principle, the fundamental right of equal protection does not require absolute equality. It is enough that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights or privileges conferred and responsibilities or obligations imposed. The equal protection clause does not preclude the state from recognizing and acting upon factual differences between individuals and classes. It recognizes that inherent in the right to legislate is the right to classify,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> necessarily implying that the equality guaranteed is not violated by a legislation based on reasonable classification. Classification, to be reasonable, must (1) rest on substantial distinctions; (2) be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) apply equally to all members of the same class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  The Court finds that all these requisites have been met by the laws challenged as arbitrary and discriminatory under the equal protection clause.<br><br>As things stand, the favorable treatment accorded the sixteen (16) municipalities by the cityhood laws rests on substantial distinction. Indeed, respondent LGUs, which are subjected only to the erstwhile PhP 20 million income criterion instead of the stringent income requirement prescribed in RA 9009, are substantially different from other municipalities desirous to be cities. Looking back, we note that respondent LGUs had pending cityhood bills before the passage of RA 9009. There lies part of the tipping difference. And years before the enactment of the amendatory RA 9009, respondents LGUs had already met the income criterion exacted for cityhood under the LGC of 1991. Due to extraneous circumstances, however, the bills for their conversion remained unacted upon by Congress. As aptly observed by then Senator, now Manila Mayor, Alfredo Lim in his speech sponsoring H. Joint Resolution No. 1, or the cityhood bills, respondent LGUs saw themselves confronted with the "<b>changing of the rules in the middle of the game</b>."  Some excerpts of Senator Lim's sponsorship speech:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [D]uring the Eleventh Congress, fifty-seven (57) municipalities applied for city status, confident that each has met the requisites for conversion under Section 450 of the [LGC], particularly the income threshold of P20 million.  Of the 57 that filed, thirty-two (32) were enacted into law; x x x while the rest - twenty-four (24) in all - failed to pass through Congress.  Shortly before the long recess of Congress in February 2001, to give way to the May elections x x x, Senate Bill No. 2157, which eventually became [RA] 9009, was passed into law, effectively raising the income requirement for creation of cities to a whooping P100 million x x x.  <b>Much as the proponents of the 24 cityhood bills then pending struggled to beat the effectivity of the law on June 30, 2001, events that then unfolded were swift and overwhelming that Congress just did not have the time to act on the measures</b>.<br><br>Some of these intervening events were x x x the <b>impeachment of President Estrada</b> x x x and the <b>May 2001 elections</b>.<br><br>The imposition of a much higher income requirement for the creation of a city x x x was unfair; like any sport - changing the rules in the middle of the game.<br><br>Undaunted, they came back during the [12<sup>th</sup>] Congress x x x.  They filed House Joint Resolution No. 29 seeking exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009. <b>For the second time, [however], time ran out from them</b>.<br><br>For many of the municipalities whose Cityhood Bills are now under consideration, this year, at the closing days of the [13<sup>th</sup>] Congress, marks their <b>ninth year</b> appealing for fairness and justice. x x x<br><br>I, for one, share their view that fairness dictates that they should be given a legal remedy by which they could be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status using the criteria set forth under the [LGC] prior to its amendment by RA 9009.  Hence, when House Joint Resolution No. 1 reached the Senate x x x I immediately set the public hearing x x x.  On July 25, 2006, I filed Committee Report No. 84 x x x. On September 6, I delivered the sponsorship x x x.<br><br>x x x By November 14, the measure had reverted to the period of individual amendments.  This was when the then acting majority leader, x x x informed the Body that Senator Pimentel and the proponents of House Joint Resolution No. 1 have agreed to the proposal of the Minority Leader for the House to first approve the individual Cityhood Bills of the qualified municipalities, along with the provision exempting each of them from the higher income requirement of RA 9009. x x x This led to the certification issued by the proponents short-listing fourteen (14) municipalities deemed to be qualified for city-status.<br><br>Acting on the suggestion of Senator Pimentel, the proponents lost no time in working for the approval by the House of Representatives of their individual Cityhood Bills, each containing a provision of exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  On the last session day of last year, December 21, the House transmitted to the Senate the Cityhood Bills of twelve out of the 14 pre-qualified municipalities. Your Committee immediately conducted the public hearing x x x.<br><br>The whole process I enumerated [span] <b>three Congresses </b>x x x.<br><br>In essence, the Cityhood Bills now under consideration will have the same effect as that of House Joint Resolution No. 1 because each of the 12 bills seeks exemption from the higher income requirement of RA 9009.  The proponents are invoking the <b>exemption on the basis of justice and fairness</b>.<br><br><b>Each of the 12 municipalities has all the requisites for conversion into a component city based on the old requirements set forth under Section 450 of the [LGC], prior to its amendment by RA 9009</b>, namely: x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In hindsight, the peculiar conditions, as depicted in Senator Lim's speech, which respondent LGUs found themselves in were unsettling. They were qualified cityhood applicants before the enactment of RA 009. Because of events they had absolutely nothing to do with, a spoiler in the form of RA 9009 supervened. Now, then, to impose on them the much higher income requirement after what they have gone through would appear to be indeed "<b>unfair</b>," to borrow from Senator Lim.  Thus, the imperatives of fairness dictate that they should be given a legal remedy by which they would be allowed to prove that they have all the necessary qualifications for city status, using the criteria set forth under the LGC of 1991 prior to its amendment by RA 9009. Truly, the peculiar conditions of respondent LGUs, which are actual and real, provide sufficient grounds for legislative classification.<br><br>To be sure, courts, regardless of doubts they might be entertaining, cannot question the wisdom of the congressional classification, if reasonable, or the motivation underpinning the classification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  By the same token, they do not sit to determine the propriety or efficacy of the remedies Congress has specifically chosen to extend.  That is its prerogative. The power of the Legislature to make distinctions and classifications among persons is, to reiterate, neither curtailed nor denied by the equal protection clause. A law can be violative of the constitutional limitation only when the classification is without reasonable basis.<br><br>The classification is also germane to the purpose of the law. The exemption of respondent LGUs/municipalities from the PhP 100 million income requirement was meant to reduce the inequality occasioned by the passage of the amendatory RA 9009. From another perspective, the exemption was unquestionably designed to insure that fairness and justice would be accorded respondent LGUs.  Let it be noted that what were then the cityhood bills covering respondent LGUs were part and parcel of the original 57 conversion bills filed in the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress, 33 of those became laws before the adjournment of that Congress. The then bills of the challenged cityhood laws were not acted upon due, <i>inter alia</i>, to the impeachment of then President Estrada, the related <i>jueteng</i> scandal investigations conducted before, and the EDSA events that followed the aborted impeachment.<br><br>While the equal protection guarantee frowns upon the creation of a privileged class without justification, inherent in the equality clause is the exhortation for the Legislature to pass laws promoting equality or reducing existing inequalities.  The enactment of the cityhood laws was in a real sense an attempt on the part of Congress to address the inequity dealt the respondent LGUs. These laws positively promoted the equality and eliminated the inequality, doubtless unintended, between respondent municipalities and the thirty-three (33) other municipalities whose cityhood bills were enacted during the 11th Congress. Respondent municipalities and the 33 other municipalities, which had already been elevated to city status, were all found to be qualified under the old Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991 during the 11<sup>th</sup> Congress.  As such, both respondent LGUs and the 33 other former municipalities are under like circumstances and conditions.  There is, thus, no rhyme or reason why an exemption from the PhP 100 million requirement cannot be given to respondent LGUs.  Indeed, to deny respondent LGUs/municipalities the same rights and privileges accorded to the 33 other municipalities when, at the outset they were similarly situated, is tantamount to denying the former the protective mantle of the equal protection clause.  In effect, petitioners and petitioners-in-intervention are creating an absurd situation in which an alleged violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution is remedied by another violation of the same clause. The irony is not lost to the Court.<br><br>Then too the non-retroactive effect of RA 9009 is not limited in application only to conditions existing at the time of its enactment.  It is intended to apply for all time, as long as the contemplated conditions obtain.  To be more precise, the legislative intent underlying the enactment of RA 9009 to exclude would-be-cities from the PhP 100 million criterion would hold sway, as long as the corresponding cityhood bill has been filed before the effectivity of RA 9009 <b>and</b> the concerned municipality qualifies for conversion into a city under the original version of Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991.<br><br>Viewed in its proper light, the common exemption clause in the cityhood laws is an application of the non-retroactive effect of RA 9009 on the cityhood bills<b>.  </b>It is not a declaration of certain rights, but a mere declaration of prior qualification and/or compliance with the non-retroactive effect of RA 9009.<br><br>Lastly and in connection with the third requisite, the uniform exemption clause would apply to municipalities that had pending cityhood bills before the passage of RA 9009 and were compliant with then Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991, which prescribed an income requirement of PhP 20 million. It is hard to imagine, however, if there are still municipalities out there belonging in context to the same class as the sixteen (16) respondent LGUs. Municipalities that cannot claim to belong to the same class as the 16 cannot seek refuge in the cityhood laws. The former have to comply with the PhP 100 million income requirement imposed by RA 9009.<br><br>A final consideration. The existence of the cities consequent to the approval of the creating, but challenged, cityhood laws in the plebiscites held in the affected LGUs is now an operative fact. New cities appear to have been organized and are functioning accordingly, with new sets of officials and employees. Other resulting events need not be enumerated. The operative fact doctrine provides another reason for upholding the constitutionality of the cityhood laws in question.<br><br>In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court ought to abandon as it hereby abandons and sets aside the Decision of November 18, 2008 subject of reconsideration. And by way of summing up the main arguments in support of this disposition, the Court hereby declares the following:<br><br>(1) Congress did not intend the increased income requirement in RA 9009 to apply to the cityhood bills which became the cityhood laws in question. In other words, Congress intended the subject cityhood laws to be exempted from the income requirement of PhP 100 million prescribed by RA 9009;<br><br>(2) The cityhood laws merely carry out the intent of RA 9009, now Sec. 450 of the LGC of 1991, to exempt respondent LGUs from the PhP 100 million income requirement;<br><br>(3) The deliberations of the 11th or 12th Congress on unapproved bills or resolutions are extrinsic aids in interpreting a law passed in the 13th Congress. It is really immaterial if Congress is not a continuing body. The hearings and deliberations during the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> Congress may still be used as extrinsic reference inasmuch as the same cityhood bills which were filed before the passage of RA 9009 were being considered during the 13<sup>th</sup> Congress. Courts may fall back on the history of a law, as here, as extrinsic aid of statutory construction if the literal application of the law results in absurdity or injustice.<br><br>(4) The exemption accorded the 16 municipalities is based on the fact that each had pending cityhood bills long before the enactment of RA 9009 that substantially distinguish them from other municipalities aiming for cityhood.  On top of this, each of the 16 also met the PhP 20 million income level exacted under the original Sec. 450 of the 1991 LGC.<br><br>And to stress the obvious, the cityhood laws are presumed constitutional. As we see it, petitioners have not overturned the presumptive constitutionality of the laws in question.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent LGUs' Motion for Reconsideration dated June 2, 2009, their "Motion to Amend the Resolution of April 28, 2009 by Declaring Instead that Respondents' `Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution of March 31, 2009' and `Motion for Leave to File and to Admit Attached Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision Dated November 18, 2008' Remain Unresolved and to Conduct Further Proceedings," dated May 14, 2009, and their second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision dated November 18, 2008 are <b>GRANTED</b>.

Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of the IPRA "on the ground that its provisions amount to an unlawful deprivation of the State's ownership over lands of the public domain as well as minerals and other natural resources therein, in violation of the regalian doctrine embodied in Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution." The Court, <i>via</i> a <i>Per Curiam</i> resolution, dismissed the petition because the Court was equally divided in opinion, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>After due deliberation on the petition, the members of the Court voted as follows:<br><br>Seven (7) voted to dismiss the petition. Justice Kapunan filed an opinion, which the Chief Justice and Justices Bellosillo, Quisumbing, and Santiago join, sustaining the validity of the challenged provisions of R.A. 8371. Justice Puno also filed a separate opinion sustaining all challenged provisions of the law with the exception of Section 1, Part II, Rule III of NCIP Administrative Order No. 1, series of 1998, the Rules and Regulations Implementing the IPRA, and Section 57 of the IPRA which he contends should be interpreted as dealing with the large-scale exploitation of natural resources and should be read in conjunction with Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution. On the other hand, Justice Mendoza voted to dismiss the petition solely on the ground that it does not raise a justiciable controversy and petitioners do not have standing to question the constitutionality of R.A. 8371.<br><br>Seven (7) other members of the Court voted to grant the petition. Justice Panganiban filed a separate opinion expressing the view that Sections 3 (a)(b), 5, 6, 7 (a)(b), 8, and related provisions of R.A. 8371 are unconstitutional. He reserves judgment on the constitutionality of Sections 58, 59, 65, and 66 of the law, which he believes must await the filing of specific cases by those whose rights may have been violated by the IPRA. Justice Vitug also filed a separate opinion expressing the view that Sections 3(a), 7, and 57 of R.A. 8371 are unconstitutional.  Justices Melo, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, and De Leon join in the separate opinions of Justices Panganiban and Vitug.<br><br><b>As the votes were equally divided (7 to 7) and the necessary majority was not obtained, the case was redeliberated upon.
