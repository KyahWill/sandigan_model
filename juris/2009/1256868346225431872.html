				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. and Scandic Shipmanagement, Ltd. (petitioners) hired Eriberto S. Bultron (respondent) on February 3, 1999 as crane operator in their vessel <i>MV EASTERN FALCON</i> for a period of twelve (12) months.<br><br>In the course of his employment, respondent developed "chronic coughs," hence, petitioners referred him to their company physician in Langkawi, Malaysia who issued a medical report dated April 6, 2000 stating, <i> inter alia</i>, that "by the nature of [respondent's] work as a seaman, he has been exposed to cement dust as his cargo ship carries cement;" and that his "Chest X-ray shows bilateral apical infiltrations of the lungs, minimal pleural effusion of the left lung and heart configuration is enlarged."  Dr. Haroun thus advised petitioners to take care of him "for further management . . ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup><br><br>Petitioners allowed respondent to continue with his job until he was repatriated to Manila on April 29, 2000 at the expiration of his contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As respondent constantly complained of "on and off cough[ing]," petitioners referred him to the Metropolitan Hospital.<br><br>After a series of medical tests, Dr. Robert D. Lim (Dr. Lim), petitioners' medical coordinator at the Metropolitan Hospital, issued a medical report <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on July 28, 2000</span> stating that, <i>inter alia</i>, respondent "is now fit to work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Respondent refused, however, to sign the certificate of fitness for work as he felt he was still ill and suffering from disabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioners having discontinued providing medical services and treatment, respondent consulted, at his own expense, a private physician, Dr. Juan Alejandro Legaspi (Dr. Legaspi), who diagnosed him on August 10, 2000 to be suffering from "spinal stenosis, L4-L5, L5-S1," and thus advised him to "avoid exertional activities and prolonged sitting" and to have `bed rest.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Claiming, <i>inter alia</i>, that his illness has "persisted" and has "totally disabled [him] from pursuing his work as a seaman" due to petitioners' failure to provide safety measures and protective gears during his work to shield him from contracting illnesses, respondent filed a <i>Complaint</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for disability benefits and damages against petitioners before the NLRC-NCR Arbitration Branch, Quezon City.<br><br>Petitioners resisted respondent's <i>Complaint</i>, contending that under the POEA Standard Employment Contract, he may only recover such benefits when his repatriation is due to medical reasons, not when it is due to completion of contract as in his case.<br><br>By Decision dated October 8, 2003, Labor Arbiter Felipe P. Pati found for respondent, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises all considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents [now petitioners] jointly and severally liable to:<br><ol><li>pay complainant [now respondent] his proportionate disability benefits in the amount of US$60,000.00 or its peso equivalent at the time of payment; and<br><br></li><li>pay complainant attorney's fees at 10% of the total monetary award to be recovered.<br></li></ol>All other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>After petitioners received a copy of the Labor Arbiter's Decision on November 4, 2003, they filed a <i>Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum</i> via registered mail on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">last day</span> of the 10-day reglementary period of appeal or on November 14, 2003, a Friday, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without the requisite </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">appeal bond</i>.  It was only on the next business day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 17, 2003</span>, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they filed the </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">appeal bond</i>, together with another copy of petitioners' <i>Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum</i>.<br><br>Respondent thus filed a <i>Motion to Dismiss Appeal</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i> </i>on the ground that petitioners' appeal was filed out of time.<br><br>Explaining their failure to file their <i>appeal bond</i> on November 14, 2003, petitioners, through counsel, stated that the appeal bond "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">was not processed on time by the bonding company</span>" and "was issued only on 14 November 2003 at around 4:05 PM in the office of Pioneer Insurance Corporation at Paseo de Roxas, Makati City;" and that "undersigned counsel then carried the <i>appeal bond</i>, drove his car from Makati to Manila area," but "due to extreme traffic condition, he called-up thru his mobile phone his legal assistant to file the appeal via registered mail."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioners thus concluded that "<b>there is actually no delay</b> inasmuch as the appeal was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">initiated</span> within the ten-day reglementary period via registered mail."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup><br><br>The National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup> of March 8, 2006, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">denied </span>respondent's motion to dismiss petitioners' appeal which it considered to have been effected on November 14, 2003.

And where, as here, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">judgment involves monetary award</span>, an appeal therefrom by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">employer</span> may be "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfected only</span> upon the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">posting of a cash or surety bond</span>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> A mere notice of appeal without complying with the other requisites mentioned does not stop the running of the period for perfecting an appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> as in fact  no motion for extension of said period is allowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The perfection of appeals in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">jurisdictional</span> and must, therefore, be strictly observed.<br><br>Petitioners' re-filing on the next working day, November 17, 2003, of the <i>Notice of Appeal with Appeal Memorandum</i>, which was accompanied, this time, by the <i>appeal bond</i>, did not cure the fatal defect of their appeal since said bond<i> </i>was filed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> the ten-day reglementary period had expired - at which time the Labor Arbiter's judgment had already become final and executory and, therefore, immutable. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Respecting petitioners' argument that their appeal was "initiated" within the ten-day reglementary period," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> suffice it to state that <b>all </b>the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">essential </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> requirements</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> for the perfection of the appeal </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">must be</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">filed</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">within</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the reglementary period.</span><br><br>Petitioners' bare invocation of "the interest of substantial justice" does not lie."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Only under exceptionally meritorious cases may a relaxation from an otherwise stringent rule be allowed "to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [22]</sup> - the existence of which petitioners failed to demonstrate.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
