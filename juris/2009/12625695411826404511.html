He was a member of the Associated Marine Officer and Seaman's Union of the Philippines which had a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with respondents.<br><br>On July 12, 2002, while pushing drums full of caustic soda, petitioner complained of chest pains.  He later noticed that whenever he exerted physical effort, the pains persisted. When the vessel was docked at the port of Santos, Brazil on August 2, 2002, he was referred to the Centro Medico Internacional and was diagnosed by Dr. Heraldo de Carvalho to be suffering from "Angina pectoris; Arterial hypertension" which he described as "a serious heart disease, involving life risk."  On the doctor's recommendation, petitioner was repatriated to the Philippines on August 16, 2002, with medical escort, to undergo further "heart investigation (cinecoronarioangiography) and surgery if necessary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was confined on August 18, 2002 at St. Luke's Medical Center under the care of respondents' company-designated physician Natalio G.

Thus it disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby dismissed.

We must not forget that the policy as it stands is that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.  This is simply not awarded every time a party wins a suit.  Besides, the petitioners were never amiss in their responsibility to Iloreta.  In fact, they shouldered all the expenses for the angiogram and angioplasty plus the allowance equivalent to 120 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner's Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the appellate court's decision having been denied by Resolution of July 15, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> he filed the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, faulting the Court of Appeals in not upholding <b>(a)</b> the permanent total disability compensation awarded to him by the Labor Arbiter and affirmed by the NLRC, and <b>(b)</b> the award by the Labor Arbiter of attorney's fees.<br><br>Respondents counter that while petitioner's disability is "permanent," the same "is only partial" since the <i>third</i> doctor, Dr. Fajardo, found him to have only a Grade IV disability impediment of 68.66%.  They thus conclude that the appellate court's decision "has sufficient factual and legal justification."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>The Court has applied the Labor Code concept of permanent total disability to Filipino seafarers in keeping with the avowed policy of the State to give maximum aid and full protection to labor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> it holding that the notion of disability is intimately related to the worker's capacity to earn, what is compensated being not his injury or illness but his inability to work resulting in the impairment of his earning capacity, hence, disability should be understood less on its medical significance but more on the loss of earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><i>Remigio v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> summarizes the laws and jurisprudence on the application of the Labor Code concept of disability compensation to the case of seafarers, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The standard employment contract for seafarers was formulated by the POEA pursuant to its mandate under E.O. No. 247 to "secure the best terms and conditions of employment of Filipino contract workers and ensure compliance therewith" and to "promote and protect the well-being of Filipino workers overseas."  Even without this provision, a contract of labor is so impressed with public interest that the New Civil Code expressly subjects it to "the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects" (Art. 1700).<br><br>Thus, the Court has applied the Labor Code concept of permanent total disability to the case of seafarers. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>There are three kinds of disability benefits under the Labor Code, as amended by P.D. No. 626: (1) temporary total disability, (2) permanent total disability, and (3) permanent partial disability.  Section 2, Rule VII of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code differentiates the disabilities as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Disability</i>.- (a) A total disability is temporary if as a result of the injury or sickness the employee is unable to perform any gainful occupation for a continuous period not exceeding 120 days, except as otherwise provided for in Rule X of these Rules.<br><br>(b)  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A disability is </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">total</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">permanent</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if as a result of the injury or sickness the employee is </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">unable to perform any gainful occupation for a continuous period exceeding 120 days</b>, except as otherwise provided for in Rule X of these Rules.<br><br>(c)  A disability is partial and permanent if as a result of the injury or sickness the employee suffers a permanent partial loss of the use of any part of his body.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Vicente v. ECC</i> (G.R. No. 85024, January 23, 1991, 193 SCRA 190, 195):<br><br>x x x <b style="text-decoration: underline;">the test</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of whether or not an employee suffers from </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">`permanent total disability</b>' is a showing of the capacity of the employee to continue performing his work notwithstanding the disability he incurred. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus, if by reason</span> of the injury or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sickness</span> he sustained, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the employee is </span><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unable to perform his customary job for more than 120 days</span> </b>and he does not come within the coverage of Rule X of the Amended Rules on Employees Compensability (which, in more detailed manner, describes what constitutes temporary total disability), <b style="text-decoration: underline;">then the said employee undoubtedly suffers from `permanent total disability' regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body.</b><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> total </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">disability</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not require that the employee be absolutely disabled or totally paralyzed.  </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">What is necessary is that the injury must be such that the employee cannot pursue his usual work and earn therefrom</b> (<i>Austria v. Court of Appeals</i>, G.R. No. 146636, Aug. 12, 2002, 387 SCRA 216, 221).  On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">total </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">disability</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> considered permanent<i> </i>if it lasts continuously for more than 120 days</b>.  Thus, in the very recent case of <i>Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad </i>(G.R. No. 134028, December 17, 1999, 321 SCRA 268, 270-271), we held:<br><br><blockquote>Permanent disability<i> </i>is inability of a worker to perform his job for more than 120 days, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body. x x x.<br><br>Total disability, on the other hand, means the disablement of an employee to earn wages in the same kind of work of similar nature that he was trained for, or accustomed to perform, or any kind of work which a person of his mentality and attainments could do.  It does not mean absolute helplessness.  In disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Applying the standards reflected above <i>vis-à-vis </i>the fact that from the time petitioner was medically repatriated on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">August 16, 2002</span> up to the time he filed his complaint for disability compensation on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 14, 2003</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for almost eleven (11) months</span>, petitioner remained unemployed, his disability is considered<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> permanent and total</span>.<br><br>The <i>third</i> physician, Dr. Fajardo, whose findings are final and binding on the parties, certified that<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> petitioner is suffering from a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">life-risk</span> and work<b style="text-decoration: underline;">-</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">related</span> heart ailment (hypertensive cardiovascular disease/coronary artery disease, chronic stable angina).  Dr. Fajardo thus cautioned that although petitioner had undergone "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention," his illness "can be aggravated by [his] continued employment" which can cause the "recurrence of [the] coronary events." Significantly, the doctor's impression matches that of petitioner's physician Dr. Vicaldo that petitioner is "unfit to resume work as seaman in any capacity" as<b> </b>"his illness is considered<b> </b>work-aggravated."<br><br>Under paragraph 20.1.5 of the parties' CBA, it is stipulated that "[a] seafarer whose disability is assessed at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">50%</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more</span> under the POEA Employment Contract shall x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be regarded as permanently unfit for further sea service in any capacity and entitled to 100% compensation, </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">i.e.</i>,  x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">US$60,000.00</span> for ratings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Petitioner's disability rating being 68.66%, he is entitled to a 100% disability compensation of US$60,000, as correctly found by the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC. So <i>Philimare, Inc./Marlow Navigation Co., Ltd. v. Suganob</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> enlightens, thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>Apropos</i> the appropriate disability benefits that respondent is entitled to, we find that Suganob is entitled to Grade 1 disability benefits which corresponds to total and permanent disability. . .<br><br>x x x <b>To be entitled to Grade 1 disability benefits, the employee's disability must not only be total but also permanent</b>.<br><br><b>Permanent disability is the inability of a worker to perform his job for more than 120 days, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any of his body</b>.  Clearly, Suganob's disability is <b>permanent</b> since he was unable to work from the time he was medically repatriated on September 17, 2001 up to the time the complaint was filed on April 25, 2002, or more than 7 months.  Moreover, if in fact Suganob is clear and fit to work on October 29, 2001, he would have been taken back by petitioners to continue his work as a Chief Cook, but he was not.  <b>His disability is undoubtedly permanent</b>.<br><br><b>Total disability, on the other hand, does not mean absolute helplessness.</b> In disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity. Total disability does not require that the employee be absolutely disabled, or totally paralyzed.  <b>What is necessary is that the injury must be such that the employee cannot pursue his usual work and earn therefrom</b>. Both the company-designated physician and Suganob's physician found that Suganob is <b>unfit to continue his duties as a Chief Cook since his illness prevented him from continuing his duties as such</b>.  Due to his illness, he can no longer perform work which is part of his daily routine as Chief Cook like lifting heavy loads of frozen meat, fish, water, etc. when preparing meals for the crew members.  <b>Hence, Suganob's disability is also total</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>As for the deletion by the appellate court of the award of attorney's fees, the Court deems it just and equitable to reinstate the same, petitioner having been compelled to litigate due to respondents' failure to satisfy his valid claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  The NLRC ruling reducing to US$1,000 the Labor Arbiter's award of attorney's fees stands, petitioner not having appealed therefrom and, in any event, it being reasonable.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
