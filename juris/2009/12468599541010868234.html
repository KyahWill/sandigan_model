CV No. 65923.<br><br>The undisputed facts are as follows:<br><br>Kumassie Plantation Company Incorporated (KPCI) is the registered owner of 802.2906 hectares of agricultural land situated in Basiawan, Santa Maria, Davao del Sur, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 646.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  In 1982, KPCI and Philippine Cocoa Corporation (PCC) entered into a contract of lease whereby the former agreed to lease the said land together with the improvements thereon to the latter for a period of 25 years beginning 15 May 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Subsequently, PCC executed a deed of assignment transferring all its rights as lessee under the said contract of lease to Philippine Cocoa Estates Corporation (PCEC) effective 31 December 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 18 February 1992, a portion of the aforementioned land, measuring 457.9952 hectares, planted with coconuts and cocoa (subject land), was compulsorily acquired by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), Region XI, Davao City, for distribution to farmer-beneficiaries pursuant to Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  The DAR then requested the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to determine the value of the subject land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  LBP pegged the value of the subject land at P19,140,965.00 or equivalent to P41,792.94 per hectare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  DAR offered to KPCI said amount as compensation for the subject land,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> but it was rejected by KPCI for being "unreasonably low."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Despite the rejection by KPCI of the valuation of the subject land by LBP, the amount of P19,140,965.00 was deposited by LBP, upon the instructions of DAR, in the name and for the account of KPCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  KPCI withdrew from LBP the entire amount in cash and bonds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>DAR then advised the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), on 27 July 1994, to conduct a summary administrative proceeding for the determination of the just compensation due KPCI for the subject land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  The proceeding was docketed as DARAB Case No. JC-R-XI-DAV-OR-0017-CO.  LBP and KPCI later submitted their respective position papers with the DARAB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>DAR next directed the Register of Deeds of Digos, Davao del Sur, on 26 September 1994, to cancel TCT No. 646 covering the subject land in the name of KPCI and to issue a new TCT in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  After the issuance of a new TCT in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, and again upon the request of the DAR, the Register of Deeds of Digos, Davao del Sur, issued Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) to qualified farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On 20 January 1997, KPCI filed with the Davao City Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15 (acting as a Special Agrarian Court), a Complaint against LBP and the DAR for determination and payment of just compensation, docketed as Civil Case No. 25,045-97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  KPCI implored the RTC to render judgment fixing the just compensation for the subject land at P160,000.00 per hectare, or equivalent to a total amount of P73,279,232.00, less the amount of P19,140,965.00 which KPCI had previously withdrawn from LBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, LBP and the DAR filed with the RTC their respective Answers contending that the Complaint was prematurely filed as KPCI failed to exhaust administrative remedies; that KPCI was already paid just compensation for the subject land, determined to be P41,792.94 per hectare, for a total amount of P19,140,965.91; and that KPCI admitted in the Complaint having received such amount from LBP. LBP asserted that it correctly calculated the value of the subject land to be P19,140,965.91, applying the formula prescribed in DAR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by DAO No. 11, Series of 1994.  At the end of their respective Answers, both LBP and DAR sought the dismissal of the Complaint of KPCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The RTC thereafter directed the parties to submit the names of their respective nominees for commissioners in Civil Case No. 25,045-97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  KPCI nominated Oliver A. Morales (Morales), President of Cuervo Appraisers Incorporated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> while LBP submitted the name of a certain Engineer Romeo Cabanial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  For its part, the DAR endorsed Tomasa L. Miranda (Miranda), a DAR employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The RTC appointed Morales and Miranda as commissioners.  The two subsequently took their oaths of office as court-appointed commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the DARAB issued, on 19 May 1997, a Resolution in JC-R-XI-DAV-OR-0017-CO, affirming the valuation of the subject land by the LBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The DARAB found the LBP valuation of the subject land to be "accurate and just," as it was in harmony with the pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>After trial in Civil Case No. 25,045-97, the RTC rendered its Decision on 18 February 1999, fixing the fair and reasonable value of the subject land at P100,000.00 per hectare.  In arriving at said valuation, the RTC considered the location of the subject land, the nature of the trees planted thereon, and the reasons stated in Morales' appraisal report.  The RTC then ordered LBP and DAR to pay KPCI an amount equivalent to P100,000.00 per hectare as just compensation for the subject land, plus legal interest computed from 23 March 1994 until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>LBP filed with the RTC a Motion for Reconsideration of the foregoing Decision;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> while DAR filed a Notice of Appeal, manifesting that it would appeal said RTC Decision to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On 23 July 1999, the RTC issued an Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration of LBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  Aggrieved, LBP filed its appeal with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R CV No. 65923.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  LBP filed, on 27 September 2000, its Appellant's Brief in CA-G.R CV No. 65923.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  DAR joined the appeal of LBP by filing, on 18 January 2001, in CA-G.R CV No. 65923, a Manifestation adopting <i>in toto</i> the Appellant's Brief of LBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On 24 November 2005, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision in CA-G.R CV No. 65923, affirming with modification the appealed RTC Decision. The appellate court sustained the finding of the RTC that the fair and reasonable value of the subject land was P100,000.00 per hectare.  Nevertheless, it ruled that the imposition of legal interest should be deleted, as there was no delay on the part of LBP in depositing the amount of P19,140,965.91 in the account of KPCI, which amount was admittedly withdrawn by KPCI.  The <i>fallo</i> of the Decision of the Court of Appeals reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), 11<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Br. 15, Davao City is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b>. As modified, as none should be awarded, the award of interest is deleted.  No costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>LBP and KPCI each filed its own Motion for Reconsideration of the 24 November 2005 Decision of the Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> but both Motions were denied by the appellate court in its Resolution dated 30 March 2007.<br><br>Hence, LBP and KPCI separately sought recourse from this Court by virtue of the Petitions for Review presently before us, docketed as <b>G.R. No. 177404</b> and <b>G.R. No. 178097, </b>respectively.  The two Petitions were consolidated since they arose from the same set of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The procedure for the determination of compensation cases under Republic Act No. 6657, as devised by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> commences with the valuation by the LBP of the lands taken by the State from private owners under the land reform program.  Based on the valuation of the land by the LBP, the DAR makes an offer to the landowner through a written notice.  In case the landowner rejects the offer, a summary administrative proceeding is held and, afterwards, depending on the value of the land, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD), the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD), or the DARAB, fixes the price to be paid for the said land.  If the landowner still does not agree with the price so fixed, he may bring the matter to the RTC, acting as Special Agrarian Court.<br><br>In the process of determining the just compensation due to landowners, it is a necessity that the RTC takes into account several factors enumerated in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation</i>. - In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, <b>the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors</b> shall be considered. The <b>social and economic benefits</b> contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the <b>non-payment of taxes or loans</b> secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote><br>Being the government agency primarily charged with the implementation of the agrarian reform program, DAR issued DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, filling out the details necessary for the implementation of Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657.  DAR translated the factors specified in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, into a basic formula, presented as follows in DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended:<br><br><blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;">LV = (CNI x 0.6) + ( CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Where: LV = Land Value<br></div><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br><br>CS = Comparable Sales<br><br>MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration<br></div><br>The above formula shall be used if all the three factors are present, relevant, and applicable.<br><br>A.1 When the CS factor is not present and CNI and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = (CNI x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br></div><br>A.2 When the CNI factor is not present, and CS and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = (CS x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br></div><br>A.3 When both the CS and CNI are not present and only MV is applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = MV x 2</div></blockquote><br>In its Petition docketed as <b>G.R. No. 177404</b>, LBP maintains that the RTC and the Court of Appeals erred in their valuation of the subject land at P100,000.00 per hectare because both courts did not consider the factors enumerated in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and the formula for valuation of lands under DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>While the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function which is vested in the RTC acting as Special Agrarian Court, we, nonetheless, disregarded the determination of just compensation made by the RTC in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

Banal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> we emphasized that the factors laid down in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and the formula stated in DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, must be adhered to by the RTC in fixing the valuation of lands subjected to agrarian reform, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In determining just compensation, the <b>RTC is required</b> to consider several factors enumerated in Section 17 of R.A. 6657, as amended, thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br><br>These factors have been translated into a basic formula in [<b>DAO 6-92</b>], as amended by [DAO 11-94], issued pursuant to the DAR's rule-making power to carry out the object and purposes of R.A. 6657, as amended.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>While the determination of just compensation involves the exercise of judicial discretion, however, such discretion must be discharged within the bounds of the law.

The trial judge is directed <b>to observe strictly the procedures specified above</b> in determining the proper valuation of the subject property. (Emphasis ours.)</div></blockquote><br>Again, in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we stressed that the special agrarian court cannot ignore, without violating Republic Act No. 6657, the formula provided by the DAR for the determination of just compensation. We rejected the valuation fixed by the RTC because it failed to follow the DAR formula:<br><br><blockquote>While [Special Agrarian Court] is required to consider the acquisition cost of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declaration and the assessments made by the government assessors to determine just compensation, it is equally true that these factors have been translated into a basic formula by the DAR pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of R.A. No. 6657.  As the government agency principally tasked to implement the agrarian reform program, it is the DAR's duty to issue rules and regulations to carry out the object of the law.  [DAO] No. 5, s. of 1998 precisely "filled in the details" of Section 17, RA No. 6657 by providing a basic formula by which the factors mentioned therein may be taken into account.  <b>The [Special Agrarian Court] was at no liberty to disregard the formula which was devised to implement the said provision.</b><br><br>It is elementary that rules and regulations issued by administrative bodies to interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce, have the force of law, and are entitled to great respect. Administrative issuances partake of the nature of a statute and have in their favor a presumption of legality. As such, courts cannot ignore administrative issuances especially when, as in this case, its validity was not put in issue.  Unless an administrative order is declared invalid, courts have no option but to apply the same. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Instead, we sustained the valuation made by the LBP, which was patterned after the applicable administrative order issued by the DAR, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[LBP] arrived at its valuation by using available factors culled from the Department of Agriculture and Philippine Coconut Authority, and by computing the same in accordance with the formula provided, thus -<br><br>COMPUTATION (Applicable Formula): LV = 0.90 CNI + 0.10 MV<br><br>Comparable Land Transactions (P x x x x ____ ) = P x-x-x<br><br>CapitalizedNet Income: Cassava16,666.67 x 0.90 =  15,000.00<br><br>Corn/Coco 26,571.70 = 23,914.53<br><br>Market ValueCassava8,963.78 x 0.10= 896.38<br><br>per Tax Declaration: Corn/Coco10,053.93 = 1,005.39<br><br>Computed Value per<br><br>Hectare: Cassava  15,896.38; Corn/Coco - 24,919.92<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Value per hectare used: Cassava 15,896.38x6.0000 has. = 95,378.28<br><br>Corn/Coco24,919.92x8.1939 has.= 204,191.33<br><br>Payment due to LO : P299, 569.61<br><br>The above computation was explained by Antero M.

Again, the proper valuation of the subject premises was reached with clear regard for the acquisition cost of the land, current market value of the properties, its nature, actual use and income, <i>inter alia</i> -- factors that are material and relevant in determining just compensation. <b>These are the very same factors laid down in a formula by DAR A.O. No. 5. Due regard was thus given by the RTC to Republic Act No. 6657, DAR A.O.

Lim</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> was confronted with the question of whether the RTC can resort to any other means of determining just compensation aside from Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.  The Court resolved the issue in the negative and pronounced that Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, are mandatory and are not mere guides that the RTC may disregard. Citing <i>Banal</i> and <i>Celada</i>, we held in <i>Lim </i>that:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Banal</i> [434 SCRA 543], <b>this Court underscored the mandatory nature of Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94</b>, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>And in <i>LBP v.

(Emphases ours.)</blockquote><br>In the instant case, the RTC did not pay particular attention to Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.  It merely cited the location of the subject land, nature of the trees planted thereon, and Morales' appraisal report, as bases for fixing the value of the subject land at P100,000.00 per hectare; which are not among the factors mentioned in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657.  Also, the RTC did not apply the formula stated under DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, in fixing the value of the subject land. This undoubtedly constitutes an obvious departure from the settled doctrine previously discussed herein regarding the mandatory nature of Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.<br><br>Further, Morales, in his appraisal report, used the market data approach (a method which based the value of the subject land on sales and listings of similar properties situated within the area), and the income approach (a procedure which based the value of the subject land on the potential net benefit that may be derived from its ownership) in determining the value of the subject land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  Morales did not explicitly state or even impliedly use Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, in his appraisal report for the subject land.  Neither was there any foundation for concluding that the market data approach and income approach conformed to statutory and regulatory requirements. More importantly, Morales himself admitted during the trial that he did not consider Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended, in his appraisal report for the subject land, despite being aware of the said law and rules for a long time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  This being the case, the valuation of the subject land, as contained in the appraisal report adopted by the RTC, cannot be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.<br><br>In contrast, LBP arrived at its valuation of the subject land by considering the factors identified under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, and by computing the same in accordance with the formula in DAO No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended.  The meticulous calculations of LBP are reproduced below:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">FORMULA USED IN THE VALUATION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY<br></div><br>The records show that Acquisition Cost (CA), Market Value based on Mortgage (MVM) and Comparable Sales (CS) are not applicable.

Hence, the Court affirms the valuation by LBP of P41,792.94 per hectare, or a total of P19,140,965.91, for the subject land.<br><br>Since we have already resolved the issue in <b>G.R No. 177404</b>, we shall now discuss and determine the matters brought up in <b>G.R. No. 178097</b>.<br><br>In its Petition docketed as <b>G.R. No. 178097</b>, KPCI argues that the imposition of legal interest as damages is warranted because LBP has delayed in paying just compensation for the subject land.  KPCI alleges that the act of LBP in appealing the decisions of the RTC and the Court of Appeals reveals the intent of the LBP to delay the payment of just compensation to KPCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Given our finding that it is the valuation of the subject land by the LBP that is correct and in compliance with the requirements of the law and administrative rules and regulations, then the issue of interest, raised by KPCI in its Petition, has actually become irrelevant.  The amount of P19,140,965.91, representing the valuation of LBP for the entire subject land, was deposited for the account of and in the name of KPCI, which the latter had admittedly already withdrawn.  The just compensation for the subject land is, thus, already fully paid.<br><br>Even if we were still to address the issue of interest, we shall decide against KPCI.<br><br>In expropriation cases, interest is due the landowner if there was delay in payment.  The imposition of interest was in the nature of damages for the delay in payment, which in effect makes the obligation on the part of the government one of forbearance.  It follows that the interest in the form of damages cannot be applied where there was prompt and valid payment of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  In <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> we stressed that interest on just compensation is imposed only in case of delay in the payment thereof, which must be sufficiently established.<br><br>There is nothing in the records to show that LBP was delayed in the payment of just compensation to KPCI. In fact, contrary to the claim of KPCI, it was paid just compensation by LBP with dispatch.<br><br>The mere fact that LBP appealed the decisions of the RTC and the Court of Appeals does not mean that it deliberately delayed the payment of just compensation to KPCI. LBP is an agency created primarily to provide financial support in all phases of agrarian reform pursuant to Section 74 of Republic Act No. 3844 and Section 64 of Republic Act No. 6657. It is vested with the primary responsibility and authority in the valuation and compensation of covered landholdings to carry out the full implementation of the Agrarian Reform Program.  It may agree with the DAR and the landowner as to the amount of just compensation to be paid to the latter and may also disagree with them and bring the matter to court for judicial determination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  This makes the LBP an indispensable party in cases involving just compensation for lands taken under the Agrarian Reform Program, with a right to appeal decisions in such cases that are unfavorable to it.  Having only exercised its right to appeal in this case, LBP cannot be penalized by making it pay for interest.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing:<br><br>1) The Petition of Land Bank of the Philippines in G.R.
