When respondent judge ordered the production of the minor child during the hearing set on 01 June 2006, <u>the regular presiding judge of Branch 86 was no longer in his office as he already left the building </u>as per information of Branch Clerk of Court Buenaluz. Hence, as pairing judge, she has the authority to act on the said urgent motion and to issue the bench warrant.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent <u>denied her alleged close personal relationship with Atty. Carmina Abbas, counsel of record of complainant's wife.</u> When Atty. Abbas appeared during the hearing on 01 June 2006, it was the second time that she saw her; the first time was sometime two years ago during the IBP meeting in Makati City. She claimed that she did not know either Atty. Abas or the complainant's wife. She only came to know them when the case was referred to her for action.<br><br>With respect to her alleged failure to require complainant to show cause and answer the contempt charge against him, respondent explained that the record of the habeas corpus case shows that <u>complainant was given several opportunities to comply with the Writ to bring the minor child</u>. Per record, the 1<sup>st</sup> refusal to comply was during the hearing on 25 May 2006 when complainant claimed lack of material time to fetch the child from Tagaytay highlands. Then, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> refusal[s] to comply were during the hearings on 26 May 2006 and 01 June 2006, respectively.<br><br>Respondent likewise <u>denied personally calling complainant's counsel</u> and informing her about the motion and the hearing on 01 June 2006. As to the reason for Atty. Ambrosio's unexpected arrival at the respondent's sala and as to how she learned about the motion is unknown to her. She claimed that the <u>sending of notice to party litigants and/or their counsel is not her concern or duty but that of the Branch Clerk of Court.</u><br><br>Respondent noted that the Petition for Certiorari which complainant filed in the Court of Appeals impleaded her in the capacity of Presiding Judge of Branch 87.  Hence, <u>complainant misled the Court of Appeals in making it appear that she issued the questioned order in her capacity as the regular judge of Branch 87.</u><br><br>Respondent <u>only came to know of the TRO when the bench warrant was already disseminate</u>d to the proper government authorities. It was thus <u>incumbent upon the complainant to submit himself to the court and ask that the bench warrant be set aside</u> or recalled because of the TRO.<br><br>. . . .

Although the appearance of the complainant during the hearing may be waived, he has the right to be heard insofar as the said motion is concerned through the filing of his comment thereon.<br><br>Respondent Judge's <b><u>blunder</u></b> was compounded when <u>she immediately cited complainant in contempt of court and issued the bench warrant without requiring the latter to explain the reason for his non-appearance and non-compliance with a standing order</u>. Under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, complainant's alleged disobedience is an indirect contempt the punishment for which requires that a respondent should be first asked to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt.<br><br>There is one more act equally serious in nature. As correctly claimed by the complainant, <u>respondent indeed <b>took cognizance of the consolidated cases without proper authority</b></u>. Respondent cannot reason out that she acted in her capacity as pairing judge.  It is clear from the records that her authority as pairing judge of Branch 86 started only on 01 June 2006 when Judge Bay's leave of absence commenced. Judge Bay was still sitting as the regular judge of Branch 86 as evidenced by the issuance of his order on 31 May 2006. <u>Respondent's explanation that Judge Bay was no longer in the premises in the afternoon of 31 May 2006, so that she could act on the subject ex-parte motion is clearly unacceptable</u>. x x x<br><br>Under Section 8 and 11, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10, the penalty of gross ignorance of the procedure and gross misconduct is dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all salaries, benefits and leave credits to which she may be entitled and with disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporation...<br><br>x x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Italics in the original, emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As reflected above, respondent having been earlier dismissed from the service, the OCA recommended that "respondent should be fined in the sum of P40,000.00 pesos, the maximum penalty of fine under Section 11(3) under Rule 140, as amended."<br><br>By Resolution of June 30, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court re-docketed the complaint as a regular administrative matter.<br><br>The Court finds the evaluation of the case by the OCA well-taken.<br><br>As found by the Court of Appeals, respondent gravely abused her discretion when she acted on the <i>Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Order Respondent to Comply with the Writ of Habeas Corpus with Urgent Motion For Partial Reconsideration (Of the Order dated May 31, 2006).</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><i> </i>That  Judge Bay may have left the court premises in the afternoon of May 31, 2006 did not justify her acting on even date on motion of complainant's wife, as her authority as pairing judge commenced only the following day, June 1, 2006,  when Judge Bay's leave of absence started;  Nor did respondent's opinion on the urgency of the case justify her sacrificing law and settled jurisprudence for the sake of expediency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondent also abused her contempt powers.

The Court of Appeals' Decision reads in part:<br><br>Respondent judge's basis for her acting on the "Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Order Respondent ... to comply with the Writ of Habeas Corpus" filed by herein private respondent in the trial court is the transmittal memo dated 31 May 2006 from Atty.

Apparently, on 31 May 2006, the presiding judge Teodoro A. Bay was still present and not yet on leave. Hence, respondent judge had, as yet, no authority to act upon the case on that day.
