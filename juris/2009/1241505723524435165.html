The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Pablo guilty of having committed the crime of murder as principal by conspiracy. Considering that there are no aggravating or mitigating circumstances attendant to the commission of the crime, pursuant to Article 64 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, accused is sentenced to suffer imprisonment of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. He is further sentence to pay the heirs of the deceased Felix Olandria the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and to reimburse said heirs of the amount of P23,568.00 for expenses incurred for the funeral service, burial and incidental expenses.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote><u><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center></u><br>On appeal, the CA agreed with the RTC's findings and affirmed Pablo's conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The CA, however, corrected the RTC's ruling on the applicable provision of the Revised Penal Code, as amended (<i>Code</i>), and modified the award of actual damages, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

Appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in accordance with <i>Rule 63(2)</i> of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>. He is likewise ordered to pay the heirs of the victim, P23,268.00, as actual damages, P50,000 as civil indemnity and P25,000.00, as exemplary damages, in addition to the award of P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues </u></b><br></div><br>In his <i>Brief </i>before this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Pablo assigns the following errors committed by both the RTC and CA:<br><blockquote><b>(1) In finding that his guilt for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</b><br><br><b>(2) In finding the existence of conspiracy.</b><br></blockquote>Pablo argues that the lower courts erred in failing to give evidentiary weight to his <i>alibi, </i>thus disregarding the constitutional presumption of innocence in his favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> He emphasizes that his <i>alibi</i> was corroborated by defense witness Elma who confirmed that he was at Elias's house at the time of the stabbing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>He alternatively argues that granting that he was a part of Damaso's group and that this group killed the victim, the prosecution failed to prove the conspiracy among them; there was no evidence adduced to establish how the incident that led to the stabbing began. Any doubt that he acted as a principal should have been resolved in his favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In their <i>Brief,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>) representing the <i>People</i>, maintain that no reversible error was committed by the lower courts. The OSG avers that the prosecution's evidence has satisfactorily proven all the elements of the crime.  Similarly, the conspiracy between Pablo and the three accused was proven by the autopsy report which corroborated the categorical testimonies of Romildo and Luther on how the accused and the others acted, clearly showing a unity of purpose in the accomplishment of their criminal objective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The testimonies of these two eyewitnesses also reveal that the killing was attended by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, and the employment of means to weaken the defense of the victim.  These circumstances qualify the killing to <i>murder</i>.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br><b>  We affirm Pablo's conviction.</b><br><br>The appeal essentially attacks the soundness of the factual findings of the RTC and CA that, according to Pablo, are not in accord with the totality of the evidence in the case.  He emphasizes that the RTC and CA disregarded his <i>alibi</i> and the lack of evidence establishing a conspiracy to kill the victim.<br><br>A review of the records fails to persuade us to overturn Pablo's judgment of conviction. We have emphasized often enough that the factual findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses, and its assessment of their probative weight are given high respect, if not conclusive effect, unless cogent facts and circumstances of substance were ignored, misconstrued or misinterpreted, which, if considered, would alter the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Under the circumstances, we find no exceptional reason to warrant a deviation from this rule.<br><br>The records show that both the RTC and CA convicted Pablo of <i>murder</i> based on the positive identification by Romildo and Luther and their eyewitness accounts of the actual killing, showing the existence of a conspiracy among Pablo's group to kill the victim.  The CA decision clearly reflects these findings and reasoning:<br><blockquote>The evidence on record gives the picture of the incident at the time when Felix Olandria was already being held on both hands by accused Pablo Amodia and Arnold Pantosa. It was while in this position that accused Damaso Amodia delivered three (3) stab blows which proved to be fatal  . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote>Both courts gathered, too, from these testimonies that the killing was qualified by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, demonstrated by the concerted efforts of Pablo's group to overpower the victim's strength with their own in carrying out their criminal plan:<br><blockquote>... the nature of the evidence presented, there are sufficient reasons to conclude and consider as having been established beyond reasonable doubt, the existence of conspiracy and the qualifying aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and employment of means to weaken the defense. These are: first, the convergence of four (4) accused; x x x second, the time when the four (4) accused were seen together which is about 12:05 in the early morning of November 26, 1997; x x x third, the place where they were seen together which is below the bridge of C-5; fourth, possession by accused Damaso Amodia of a knife his occupation being that of a painter; fifth, absence of any other injuries in other parts of the body of the victim Felix Olandria x x x; sixth, the location of the three stab wounds all of which were directed against delicate parts of the body indicating intent to kill... The foregoing circumstances clearly proven by the prosecution evidence, when taken together with the fact that death ensued indicate that there was conspiracy on the part of the accused that they abused their superior strength and employed means to weaken the defense. The act of one is to be considered therefore the act of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i><u>The Eyewitnesses Testimonies.</u></i></b><br><br>The RTC and CA found the identification made by Romildo and Luther to be <i>clear</i>, <i>categorical,</i> and <i>consistent.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>  We observed that in accepting the truth of the identification and the account of how the stabbing took place, the RTC and CA considered the witnesses' proximity to the victim and his assailants at the time of the stabbing - they were about three arms length away and 15 meters away, respectively; the well-lighted condition of the crime scene; and the familiarity of these eyewitnesses with the victim and his assailants - they were all residents of the same area. Similarly, we also note that no evidence was presented to establish that these eyewitnesses harbored any ill-will against Pablo and had no reason to fabricate their testimonies.  The weight of jurisprudence is to accept these kinds of testimonies as true for being consistent with the natural order of events, human nature and the presumption of good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Aside from these, we additionally note that Romildo and Luther never wavered, despite the contrary efforts of the defense, in their positive identification of Pablo as one of the assailants of the victim. The records glaringly show the defense counsel's vain efforts to prove that these eyewitnesses committed a mistake in identifying Pablo as one of the assailants since his name was allegedly Pablito Amadio, and not Pablo.<br><br>We state in this regard that positive identification pertains essentially to <i>proof of identity</i> and not necessarily to the name of the assailant.  A mistake in the name of the accused is not equivalent, and does not necessarily amount to, a mistake in the identity of the accused especially when sufficient evidence is adduced to show that the accused is pointed to as one of the perpetrators of the crime.  In this case, the defense's line of argument is negated by the undisputed fact that the accused's identity was known to both the eyewitnesses. On the one hand, we have Romildo's testimony stating that Pablo lived across Scorpion Street from where he lived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He also stated that he had known Pablo for more than a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> On the other hand, Luther testified that he had known Pablo since 1986 because they were neighbors and that he even played basketball with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> We stress that Pablo never denied these allegations.<br><br>In <i>People v. Ducabo, </i>we took notice of the human trait that once a person knows another through association, identification becomes an easy task even from a considerable distance; most often, the face and body movements of the person identified has created a lasting impression on the identifier's mind that cannot easily be erased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The association the eyewitnesses cited - specifically, being neighbors and even basketball game mates - rendered them familiar with Pablo, making it highly unlikely that they could have committed a mistake in identifying him as one of the assailants. Their identification came at the first opportunity (<i>i.e</i>., when they revealed) what they knew of the killing, and culminated with their courtroom identification of Pablo as among those who assaulted the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Two reasons settle the argument about Pablo's name against his favor.  It strikes us that this argument is a line of defense that came only as the defense's turn to present evidence neared. We have on record that prior to the defense's presentation of evidence, Pablo referred to himself as Pablo Amodia when the court asked him his name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>  We likewise find no competent evidence, other than his assertion and those of his siblings, showing that his true name is really Pablito Amodia.  We therefore conclude that any uncertainty on the name by which the accused is or should be known is an extraneous matter that in no way renders his identification as a participant in the stabbing uncertain.<br><br>We find nothing irregular, unusual, or inherently unbelievable, in the eyewitnesses' testimonies that would affect their credibility. Their narratives are remarkably compatible with the physical evidence on hand; likewise, their accounts are also consistent with each other. More importantly, the narration of these eyewitnesses are in full accord with the human experience of individuals who are exposed to a startling event and their initial reluctance to involve themselves in the criminal matters especially those involving violent crimes committed by individuals known to them.<br><br><b><i><u>The Defense of Alibi</u></i></b><br><br>Pablo argues that his <i>alibi</i> should have been given greater evidentiary weight because it was corroborated by his sister, Elma.

A first limitation fully applicable to this case is that <i>alibi</i> cannot overcome positive identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> For the defense of <i>alibi</i> to prosper, evidence other than the testimony of the accused must be adduced.  Evidence referred to in this respect does not merely relate to any piece of evidence that would support the <i>alibi</i>; rather, there must be sufficient evidence to show the physical impossibility (as to time and place) that the accused could have committed or participated in the commission of the crime.  For <i>alibi</i> to be given evidentiary value, there must be clear and convincing evidence showing that at the time of the commission of the crime, it was physically impossible for the accused to have been at the <i>situs criminis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>As we have discussed at length, Pablo was positively identified by Romildo and Luther as one of the victim's assailants. We find no reason to doubt the accuracy of the identification made.<br><br>Pablo's <i>alibi </i>does not also meet the requirements of physical impossibility of time and place.  A scrutiny of the entire testimony of Elma failed to show that it was physically impossible for Pablo to be at the crime scene when the stabbing took place. We note that although Elma testified that Pablo was at Elias' house at the time of the stabbing, she nonetheless admitted that her house (which was located beside Elias' house) and the bridge where the crime was committed is a 10-minute walking distance away from each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  She further testified that after Pablo left for Elias' house, she only saw him again at around 1:00 a.m. and at 2:00 a.m at their brother's house. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Hence, it was possible that Pablo could have gone out of Elias' house to join Damaso, George, and Arnold in assaulting the victim, and afterwards returned to his brother's house without Elma knowing that he was ever gone.<br><br>We scrutinize Elma's version of the events with utmost care considering that she is Pablo's sister.  This is not the first time that this Court has encountered a case where <i>alibi</i> is provided by a close kin; we have recognized that in these situations, it may come naturally to some to give more weight to blood ties and close relationship than to the objective truth;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>  thus, our strict scrutiny.<br><br>We find that the time frame in Elma's version of events shows a pattern of inconsistency that renders its truthfulness suspect.  The testimony is inconsistent on the time Pablo slept and was awakened by Elias - details that, to our mind, are material to show his whereabouts on that fateful night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Elma initially stated that Pablo slept at 9:00 p.m. and was awakened by Elias at 12:00 midnight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thereafter, she claimed that Pablo was also awakened by Elias at 9:00 p.m. (the same time that Pablo slept) that evening, and that Pablo went to Elias's house around 12:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Subsequently, she averred that Pablo was awakened at 10:00 p.m. but went back to sleep then awakened again at 12:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>These conflicting statements are not rendered any more believable by their conflict with the time frames claimed in Pablo's version of events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Similarly, Elma's version of <i>what</i> occurred <i>when</i> is likewise inconsistent with Elias' version of events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Finally, even granting that a semblance of truth exists in the defense's narration of events, the inconsistencies and contradictions in its witnesses' testimonies render their evidence uncertain.  In the final analysis, even their version does not preclude Pablo from being physically present at the crime scene when the killing took place. Thus, the defense and prosecution's evidence taken together, render Pablo guilty of the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b><u>Conspiracy</u></b><br><br>As an alternative argument, Pablo puts into issue the failure of the prosecution's evidence to establish the conspiracy between him and his other co-accused to make him liable for <i>murder</i>. He emphasizes that the evidence, as testified to by the eyewitnesses, only relate to events during, and not prior to, the assault and the stabbing of the victim. He argues that no evidence was adduced to show that the accused all agreed to kill the victim.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>  It arises on the very instant the plotters agree, <b>expressly or impliedly</b>, to commit the felony and forthwith decide to pursue it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>  It may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Direct proof of conspiracy is rarely found; circumstantial evidence is often resorted to in order to prove its existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Absent of any direct proof, as in the present case, conspiracy may be deduced from the mode, method, and manner the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves, when such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> An accused participates as a conspirator if he or she has performed some overt act as a direct or indirect contribution in the execution of the crime planned to be committed.[101]  The overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the commission of the crime, or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators.[102] Stated otherwise, it is not essential that there be proof of the previous agreement and decision to commit the crime; it is sufficient that the malefactors acted in concert pursuant to the same objective.[103]<br><br>Although there was no evidence in the present case showing a prior agreement among Pablo, Arnold, George, and Damaso, the following chain of events however show their commonality of purpose in killing the victim: <i>first, </i>the accused surrounded the victim on all sides: Damaso at the front, George at the victim's rear, while Pablo and Arnold flanked the victim on  each side; <i>second</i>, Pablo then wrested the right arm of the victim and restrained his movement, while Arnold did the same to the left arm of the victim; <i>third</i>, George then hit the victim's head with a piece of wood; and <i>fourth</i>, Damaso stabbed the victim three times.<br><br>In <i>People v. Elijorde,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>The cooperation that the law punishes is the assistance knowingly or intentionally rendered which cannot exist without previous cognizance of the criminal act intended to be executed. It is therefore required in order to be liable either as a principal by indispensable cooperation or as an accomplice that the accused must unite with the criminal design of the principal by direct participation.<br></blockquote>In  <i>People v. Manalo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105] </sup>we declared that the act of the appellant in holding the victim's right hand while the latter was being stabbed constituted sufficient proof of conspiracy<i>:</i><br><blockquote>Indeed, the act of the appellant of holding the victim's right hand while the victim was being stabbed by Dennis shows that he concurred in the criminal design of the actual killer. If such act were separate from the stabbing, appellant's natural reaction should have been to immediately let go of the victim and flee as soon as the first stab was inflicted.  But appellant continued to restrain the deceased until Dennis completed his attack.<br></blockquote>Tested against these, the existence of conspiracy among the four accused is clear; their acts were aimed at the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing their respective parts in the series of acts that, although appearing independent from one another, indicated a concurrence of sentiment and intent to kill the victim. Following the reasoning in <i>Manalo</i>, if there was in fact no unity of purpose among Pablo and the three other accused, Pablo's reaction would have been to let go of the victim and flee after the first stabbing by Damaso. The evidence reveals, however, that after the first stabbing, Pablo still continued to hold the right arm of the victim, rendering him immobile and exposed to further attack.<br><br>Where there is conspiracy, a person may be convicted for the criminal act of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Where there is conspiracy, the act of one is deemed the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>The Crime</u></i></b><br><br>Murder is committed by killing a person under any of the qualifying circumstances enumerated by Article 248 of the Code not falling within the provisions of Article 246 (<i>on parricide</i>), Article 249 (<i>on homicide</i>), and Article 255 (on <i>infanticide</i>) of the said Code.<br><br>With Pablo's participation in the killing duly established beyond reasonable doubt, what is left to examine is whether or not the aggravating circumstance of <i>abuse of superior strength</i>, which qualifies the crime to <i>murder</i>, is present under the circumstances.<br><br>To take advantage of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Taking advantage of superior strength does not mean that the victim was completely defenseless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Ventura</i>, we opined that there are no fixed and invariable rules in considering abuse of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>  Superiority does not always mean numerical superiority.  Abuse of superiority depends upon the relative strength of the aggressor <i>vis-à-vis</i> the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup>  Abuse of superiority is determined by the excess of the aggressor's natural strength over that of the victim, considering the position of both, and the employment of the means to weaken the defense, although not annulling it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>  The aggressor must have advantage of his natural strength to ensure the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>In the present case, we find that there was abuse of superior strength employed by Pablo, Arnold, George and Damaso in committing the killing.  The evidence shows that the victim was unarmed when he was attacked.  In the attack, two assailants held his arms on either side, while the other two, on the victim's front and back, each armed with a knife and a piece of wood that they later used on the victim. Against this onslaught, the victim's reaction was graphically described by the prosecution eyewitness, Luther, when he testified:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Which came first, by the way, was the victim or what was the victim doing then when the fight took place?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Wala siyang nagawa kase hinawakan siya, gusto niyang makawala pero wala siyang magawa</i></b><i> <b>hinawakan siya sa leeg,</b> sir.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> [Emphasis supplied] </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Under these circumstances, no doubt exists that there was gross inequality of forces between the victim and the four accused and that the victim was overwhelmed by forces he could not match. The RTC and CA therefore correctly appreciated the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength which qualified the killing to the crime of <i>murder</i>.<br><br><b><i><u>The Penalty</u></i></b><br><br>The penalty for <i>murder</i> under Article 248 of the Code is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Article 63 (2) of the same Code states that when the law prescribes a penalty consisting of two indivisible penalties and there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the lesser penalty shall be imposed. Since the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength already qualified the killing to murder, it can no longer be used to increase the imposable penalty.  We note that while another aggravating circumstance, <i>i.e., </i>employing means to weaken the defense of the victim, was alleged in the Information, the prosecution failed to adduce evidence to support the presence of this circumstance. Hence, the RTC and CA correctly imposed the penalty of<i> reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Likewise, the CA correctly awarded P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary to the heirs of the victim consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.[115] However, in line with recent jurisprudence, the award of civil indemnity shall be increased from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA erred in awarding actual damages in the amount of P23,268.00.
