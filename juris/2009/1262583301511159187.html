				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Ma. Cristina Torres (Ma. Cristina) and Pablo Sicad Braza, Jr. (Pablo), also known as "Pablito Sicad Braza," were married<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> on January 4, 1978.  The union bore Ma. Cristina's co-petitioners Paolo Josef<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  and Janelle Ann<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on May 8, 1978 and June 7, 1983, respectively, and Gian Carlo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on June 4, 1980.<br><br>Pablo died<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> on April 15, 2002 in a vehicular accident in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.<br><br>During the wake following the repatriation of his remains to the Philippines, respondent Lucille Titular (Lucille) began introducing her co-respondent minor Patrick Alvin Titular Braza (Patrick) as her and Pablo's son.  Ma. Cristina thereupon made inquiries in the course of which she obtained Patrick's birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> from the Local Civil Registrar of Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental with the following entries:<br><br><blockquote>Name of Child: PATRICK ALVIN CELESTIAL<br>TITULAR<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Date of Birth: 01 January 1996</span><br>Mother: Lucille Celestial Titular<br>Father: Pablito S. Braza<br>Date Received at the<br>Local Civil Registrar: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 13, 1997</span><br>Annotation: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Late Registration</span>"<br>Annotation/Remarks: <b>"Acknowledge (sic) by the father Pablito Braza on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">January 13, 1997</span>"</b><br>Remarks: <b>Legitimated by virtue of subsequent marriage of parents on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 22, 1998</span> at Manila</b>.  Henceforth, the child shall be known as <b>Patrick Alvin Titular Braza </b>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Ma. Cristina likewise obtained a copy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of a marriage contract showing that Pablo and Lucille were married on April 22, 1998, drawing her and her co-petitioners to file on December 23, 2005 before the Regional Trial Court of Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to correct the entries in the birth record of Patrick in the Local Civil Register.<br><br>Contending that Patrick could not have been legitimated by the supposed marriage between Lucille and Pablo, said marriage being bigamous on account of the valid and subsisting marriage between Ma. Cristina and Pablo, petitioners prayed for (1) the <i>correction of the entries </i>in Patrick's birth record with respect to his legitimation, the name of the father and his acknowledgment, and the use of the last name "Braza"; 2) a directive to Leon, Cecilia and Lucille, all surnamed Titular, as guardians of the minor Patrick, to <i>submit Parick to DNA testing </i>to determine his paternity and filiation; and 3) the declaration of nullity of the legitimation of Patrick as stated in his birth certificate and, for this purpose, the <i>declaration of the marriage of Lucille and Pablo as bigamous</i>.<br><br>On Patrick's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, the trial court, by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of September 6, 2007, dismissed the petition without prejudice, it holding that in a special proceeding for correction of entry, the court, which is not acting as a family court under the Family Code, has no jurisdiction over an action to annul the marriage of Lucille and Pablo, impugn the legitimacy of Patrick, and order Patrick to be subjected to a DNA test, hence, the controversy should be ventilated in an ordinary adversarial action.<br><br>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration having been denied by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of November 29, 2007, they filed the present petition for review.<br><br>Petitioners maintain that the court <i>a quo </i>may pass upon the validity of marriage and questions on legitimacy even in an action to correct entries in the civil registrar.  Citing <i>Cariño v. Cariño,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  <i>Lee v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and <i>Republic v. Kho</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> they contend that even substantial errors, such as those sought to be corrected in the present case, can be the subject of a petition under Rule 108.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The petition fails.  In a special proceeding for correction of entry under Rule 108 (Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Original Registry), the trial court has no jurisdiction to nullify marriages and rule on legitimacy and filiation.<br><br>Rule 108 of the Rules of Court <i>vis a vis </i>Article 412 of the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> charts the procedure by which an entry in the civil registry may be cancelled or corrected.  The proceeding contemplated therein may generally be used only to correct clerical, spelling, typographical and other innocuous errors in the civil registry.  A clerical error is one which is visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding; an error made by a clerk or a transcriber; a mistake in copying or writing, or a harmless change such as a correction of name that is clearly misspelled or of a misstatement of the occupation of the parent.  Substantial or contentious alterations may be allowed only in adversarial proceedings, in which all interested parties are impleaded and due process is properly observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The allegations of the petition filed before the trial court clearly show that petitioners seek to nullify the marriage between Pablo and Lucille on the ground that it is bigamous and impugn Patrick's filiation in connection with which they ask the court to order Patrick to be subjected to a DNA test.<br><br>Petitioners insist, however, that the main cause of action is for the correction of Patrick's birth records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and that the rest of the prayers are merely incidental thereto.<br><br>Petitioners' position does not lie.  Their cause of action is actually to seek the declaration of Pablo and Lucille's marriage as void for being bigamous and impugn Patrick's legitimacy, which causes of action are governed not by Rule 108 but by A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC which took effect on March 15, 2003, and Art. 171<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Family Code, respectively, hence, the petition should be filed in a Family Court as expressly provided in said Code.<br><br>It is well to emphasize that, doctrinally, validity of marriages as well as legitimacy and filiation can be questioned only in a direct action seasonably filed by the proper party, and not through collateral attack such as the petition filed before the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>Petitioners' reliance on the cases they cited is misplaced.<br><br><i>Cariño v. Cariño </i>was an action filed by a second wife against the first wife for the return of one-half of the death benefits received by the first after the death of the husband.  Since the second wife contracted marriage with the husband while the latter's marriage to the first wife was still subsisting, the Court ruled on the validity of the two marriages, it being essential to the determination of who is rightfully entitled to the death benefits.<br><br>In <i>Lee v. Court of Appeals</i>, the Court held that contrary to the contention that the petitions filed by the therein petitioners before the lower courts were actions to impugn legitimacy, the prayer was not to declare that the petitioners are illegitimate children of Keh Shiok Cheng as stated in their records of birth but to establish that they are not the latter's children, hence, there was nothing to impugn as there was no blood relation at all between <br><br><br>the petitioners and Keh Shiok Cheng.  That is why the Court ordered the cancellation of the name of Keh Shiok Cheng as the petitioners' mother and the substitution thereof with "Tiu Chuan" who is their biological mother. Thus, the collateral attack was allowed and the petition deemed as adversarial proceeding contemplated under Rule 108.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. Kho</i>, it was the petitioners themselves who sought the correction of the entries in their respective birth records to reflect that they were illegitimate and that their citizenship is "Filipino," not Chinese,  because their parents were never legally married.  Again, considering that the changes sought to be made were substantial and not merely innocuous, the Court, finding the proceedings under Rule 108 to be adversarial in nature, upheld the lower court's grant of the petition.<br><br>It is thus clear that the facts in the above-cited cases are vastly different from those obtaining in the present case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED.</b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Marriage Contract, records, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Certificate of Live Birth, id. at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Report of Death, id. at14-15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 16-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Certificate of Marriage, id. at 19-20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 1-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Penned by Presiding Judge Nilo M.
