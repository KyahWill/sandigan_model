				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From 1995-1996, Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank (Banco Filipino) which is a respondent in these five consolidated cases, filed before 17 Regional Trial Courts (RTC) nationwide 17 complaints for reconveyance of different properties against petitioners Tala Realty Services Corporation (Tala Realty), Nancy L. Ty (Nancy), Pedro B. Aguirre, Remedios A. Dupasquier (Remedios), Pilar D. Ongking (Pilar), Elizabeth H. Palma (Elizabeth), Dolly W. Lim (Dolly),  Rubencito M. Del Mundo (del Mundo), Add International Services, Inc. (Add International), and Cynthia E. Messina (Cynthia).<br><br>Banco Filipino's complaints commonly alleged that in 1979,  expansion of its operations required the purchase of real properties for the purpose of acquiring sites for more branches; that as Sections 25(a) and 34 of the General Banking Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  limit a bank's allowable investments in real estate to 50% of its capital assets,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> its board of directors decided to warehouse some of its existing properties and branch sites.  Thus, Nancy, a major stockholder and director, persuaded Pedro Aguirre and his brother Tomas Aguirre, both major stockholders of Banco Filipino, to organize and incorporate Tala Realty to hold and purchase real properties in trust for Banco Filipino; that after the transfer of Banco Filipino properties to Tala Realty, the Aguirres' sister Remedios prodded her brother Tomas to, as he did, endorse to her his shares in Tala Realty and registered them in the name of her controlled corporation, Add International.<br><br>Thus, Nancy, Remedios, and Pedro Aguirre controlled Tala Realty, with Nancy exercising control through her nominees Pilar, Cynthia, and Dolly, while Remedios exercised control through Add International and her nominee Elizabeth. Pedro Aguirre exercised control through his own nominees, the latest being Tala Realty's president, del Mundo.<br><br>In implementation of their trust agreement, Banco Filipino sold to Tala Realty some of its properties.  Tala Realty simultaneously leased to Banco Filipino the properties for 20 years, renewable for another 20 years at the option of Banco Filipino with a right of first refusal in the event Tala Realty decided to sell them.<br><br>In August 1992, Tala Realty repudiated the trust, claimed the titles for itself, and demanded payment of rentals, deposits, and goodwill, with a threat to eject Banco Filipino.<br><br>Thus arose Banco Filipino's 17 complaints for reconveyance against Tala Realty, docketed and raffled to the branches of the courts to which they were filed, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%">Case No.</td> <td width="50%">Regional Trial Court (RTC)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-127</td> <td>Branch 57, Lucena</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 22493</td> <td>Branch 28, Iloilo</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 545-M-95</td> <td>Branch 84, Batangas City</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. U-6026</td> <td>Branch 48, Urdaneta, Pangasinan</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 4992</td> <td>Branch 66, La Union</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 3036</td> <td>Branch 13, Cotabato</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. Q-95-24830</td> <td>Branch 91, Quezon City</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 2506-MN</td> <td>Branch 72, Malabon, Metro Manila</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-230</td> <td>Branch 274, Parañaque</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-170-MK</td> <td>Branch 272, Marikina</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-75212</td> <td>Branch 45, Manila</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-75213</td> <td>Branch 46, Manila</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 95-75214</td> <td>Branch 47, Manila</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 23,821-95</td> <td>Branch 33 Davao City</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 96-0036</td> <td>Branch 255, Las Piñas</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Civil Case No. 2176-AF</td> <td>Branch 86, Cabanatuan City</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Petitioners filed motions to dismiss all the complaints on the grounds of <u>forum shopping</u>, <u>lack of cause of action</u>, and <i><u>pari delicto</u></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The present petitions (G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 166608, 155201, 155171) originated from Civil Case Nos. 2176-AF (the Cabanatuan City case), U-6026 (the Urdaneta case), 95-127 (the Lucena case), and 23, 821-95 (the Davao City case).<br><br><b><i><u>G.R.

Against this Order, it then filed on <u>7 September 1996 (the last day for perfecting an appeal therefrom</u>) a motion for reconsideration which herein Respondent Judge denied on 13 January 1997.  Petitioner received a copy of this Order denying its above motion<u> 17 January 1997, Petitioner thus had only one or the following day, 18 July 1997, to file its mandatory "notice of appeal". Thereafter, beyond 18 January 1997, the said Order lapsed into finality.  It was no longer legally appeallable.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>And petitioners brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals the pendency of G.R. No. 12711 before this Court, questioning the denial of their motion to dismiss in Civil Case No. 545-M-95 (the Batangas case), contending as follows:<br><blockquote>[Banco Filipino] tenders one and only one issue in its instant petition, to wit:  Did or did not Respondent Judge gravely abuse his discretion when he dismissed its complaint with him under Civil Case No. 2176-AF as violative of the Supreme Court's Administrative Circular on "forum shopping?"<br><br>The instant petition was filed with this Court on 07 February 1997.  On this date, exactly the same issue above raised was already before the Supreme Court for ruling and/or judicial determination.  Two weeks earlier, on 20 July 1997 to be exact, herein Private Respondents filed with the said Tribunal under G.R. No. 12711 a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition that precisely and specifically prayed for the condemnation of [Banco Filipino's] complaint with the Cabanatuan RTC, Branch 86, under Civil Case No. 2176-AF, (the very complaint involved in this petition, together with fifteen (15) other like suits, as "forum shopping." x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>[Banco Filipino] received its service copy of the above petition on 25 January 1997.  On 7 February 1997 when it filed with this Court the instant petition, said Petitioner was thus already on full and official notice of the said petition with the Supreme Court under G.R. No. 127611.  Entirely apart then from the undeniable fact that the instant petition thus likewise breaches the Supreme Court's circular against "forum shopping", there is the matter of [Banco Filipino's] criminal perjury in this case of attesting under oath that "no other action or proceeding is pending in any other court, tribunal or agency" x x x "involving the same issues" as those tendered in the instant petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals denied the Motion to Recall by Resolution of June 17, 1997, declaring that its February 14, 1997 Resolution stands but the Answer should be submitted within ten days from notice.  Hence, the first above-captioned petition for certiorari, and prohibition (G.R. No. 130088)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> raising the following arguments:<br><blockquote>Respondent Court issued its two assailed Resolutions in knowing disregard of the prior jurisdiction much earlier assumed by this Court over the matters subject of its said Resolutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>In undisguised disdain and defiance of This Court's doctrinal instructions, Respondent Court substituted certiorari for a lost appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent Court's determination that [Banco Filipino's] subject petition was "sufficient [in form] and substance" was in fact a mere cover of its whimsical prejudgment of the said petition as meritorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent Court issued its two Resolutions subject of this petition knowing that it was effectively undoing, or at least putting to ridicule and disrepute an earlier judgment of its co-equal Division of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Banco Filipino argued that certiorari is not the appropriate remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>G.R.

The RTC denied the motion, the orders denying the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion for Reconsideration having already become final and, in any event, petitioners had already filed their Answers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the denial of their Motion for Reconsideration, contending that as the orders were interlocutory, they could not have gained finality.

Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> this Court, by Decision dated November 22, 2002, ruling on one of several ejectment cases filed by Tala Realty against Banco Filipino arising from the <u>same trust agreement</u> in the reconveyance cases subject of the present petitions, held that the trust agreement is <u>void and cannot thus be enforced</u>.  The relevant portion of the Court's ruling in said case reads:<br><blockquote>The Bank alleges that the sale and twenty-year lease of the disputed property were part of a larger implied trust "warehousing agreement."  Concomitant with this Court's factual finding that the 20-year contract governs the relations between the parties, we find the Bank's allegation of circumstances surrounding its execution worthy of credence; the Bank and Tala entered into contracts of sale and lease back of the disputed property and created an implied trust "warehousing agreement" for the reconveyance of the property.  In the eyes of the law, however, this implied trust is inexistent and void for being contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>An implied trust could not have been formed between the Bank and Tala as this Court has held that "where the purchase is made in violation of an existing statute and in evasion of its express provision, no trust can result in favor of the party who is guilty of the fraud."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he bank cannot use the defense of nor seek enforcement of its alleged implied trust with Tala since its purpose was contrary to law.  As admitted by the Bank, it "warehoused" its branch site holdings to Tala to enable it to pursue its expansion program and purchase new branch sites including its main branch in Makati, and at the same time avoid the real property holdings limit under Sections 25(a) and 34 of the General Banking Act which it had already reached. x x x<br><br>Clearly, the Bank was well aware of the limitations on its real estate holdings under the General Banking Act and that its "warehousing agreement" with Tala was a scheme to circumvent the limitation. Thus, the Bank opted not to put the agreement in writing and call a spade a spade, but instead phrased its right to reconveyance of the subject property at any time as a "first preference to buy" at the "same transfer price."  This agreement which the Bank claims to be an implied trust is contrary to law.  Thus, while we find the sale and lease of the subject property genuine and binding upon the parties, we cannot enforce the implied trust even assuming the parties intended to create it.  In the words of the Court in the <i>Ramos case</i>, "the courts will not assist the payor in achieving his improper purpose by enforcing a resultant trust for him in accordance with the `clean hands' doctrine."  <b><u>The Bank cannot thus demand reconveyance of the property based on its alleged implied trust relationship with Tala</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>The Bank and Tala are <i>in pari delicto</i>, thus, no affirmative relief should be given to one against the other</u>.  The Bank should not be allowed to dispute the sale of its lands to Tala nor should Tala be allowed to further collect rent from the Bank.  The clean hands doctrine will not allow the creation nor the use of a juridical relation such as a trust to subvert, directly or indirectly, the law. Neither the Bank nor Tala came to court with clean hands; neither will obtain relief from the court as the one who seeks equity and justice must come to court with clean hands. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, once a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases where the facts are substantially the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  This Court's ruling quoted in the immediately preceding paragraph on the nullity of the trust agreement which Banco Filipino seeks to enforce thus applies to the present petitions.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>GRANTED</b>.
