				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners Juanito A. Garcia and Alberto J. Dumago assail the December 5, 2003 Decision and April 16, 2004 Resolution of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 69540 which granted the petition for certiorari of respondent, Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL), and denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, respectively.  The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered and in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is hereby GIVEN DUE COURSE.  The assailed November 26, 2001 Resolution as well as the January 28, 2002 Resolution of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission [NLRC] is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Consequently, the Writ of Execution and the Notice of Garnishment issued by the Labor Arbiter are hereby likewise ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>The case stemmed from the administrative charge filed by PAL against its employees-herein petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> after they were allegedly caught in the act of sniffing shabu when a team of company security personnel and law enforcers raided the PAL Technical Center's Toolroom Section on July 24, 1995.<br><br>After due notice, PAL dismissed petitioners on October 9, 1995 for transgressing the PAL Code of Discipline,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> prompting them to file a complaint for illegal dismissal and damages which was, by Decision of January 11, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> resolved by the Labor Arbiter in their favor, thus ordering PAL to, <i>inter alia,</i><u> immediately comply with the reinstatement aspect of the decision</u>.<br><br>Prior to the promulgation of the Labor Arbiter's decision, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) placed PAL (hereafter referred to as respondent), which was suffering from severe financial losses, under an Interim Rehabilitation Receiver, who was subsequently replaced by a Permanent Rehabilitation Receiver on June 7, 1999.<br><br>From the Labor Arbiter's decision, respondent appealed to the NLRC which, by Resolution of January 31, 2000, reversed said decision and <u>dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of merit.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied by Resolution of April 28, 2000 and Entry of Judgment was issued on July 13, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Subsequently or on October 5, 2000, the Labor Arbiter issued a Writ of Execution (Writ) respecting the <u>reinstatement aspect</u> of his January 11, 1999 Decision, and on October 25, 2000, he issued a Notice of Garnishment (Notice).  Respondent thereupon moved to quash the Writ and to lift the Notice while petitioners moved to release the garnished amount.<br><br>In a related move, respondent filed an Urgent Petition for Injunction with the NLRC which, by Resolutions of November 26, 2001 and January 28, 2002, <u>affirmed the validity of the Writ and the Notice</u> issued by the Labor Arbiter <i>but</i><u> suspended and referred the action to the Rehabilitation Receiver for appropriate action.</u><br><br>Respondent elevated the matter to the appellate court which issued the herein challenged Decision and Resolution nullifying the NLRC Resolutions on two grounds, essentially espousing that: <b>(1)</b> a subsequent finding of a valid dismissal removes the basis for implementing the reinstatement aspect of a labor arbiter's decision (the first ground), and <b>(2)</b> the impossibility to comply with the reinstatement order due to corporate rehabilitation provides a reasonable justification for the failure to exercise the options under Article 223 of the Labor Code (the second ground).<br><br>By Decision of August 29, 2007, this Court PARTIALLY GRANTED the present petition and effectively reinstated the NLRC Resolutions <u>insofar as it suspended the proceedings</u>, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Since petitioners' claim against PAL is a money claim for their wages during the pendency of PAL's appeal to the NLRC, the same should have been suspended pending the rehabilitation proceedings. The Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, as well as the Court of Appeals should have abstained from resolving petitioners' case for illegal dismissal and should instead have directed them to lodge their claim before PAL's receiver.<br><br>However, to still require petitioners at this time to re-file their labor claim against PAL under peculiar circumstances of the case- that their dismissal was eventually held valid with only the matter of reinstatement pending appeal being the issue- this Court deems it legally expedient to suspend the proceedings in this case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the instant petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED in that <u>the instant proceedings herein are SUSPENDED <i>until further notice from this Court</i></u>.  Accordingly, respondent Philippine Airlines, Inc. is hereby DIRECTED to quarterly update the Court as to the status of its ongoing rehabilitation.  No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By Manifestation and Compliance of October 30, 2007, respondent informed the Court that the SEC, by Order of September 28, 2007, granted its request to exit from rehabilitation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In view of the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings, the Court now proceeds to resolve the <u>remaining issue for consideration</u>, which is <b>whether petitioners may collect their wages during the period between the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement pending appeal and the NLRC decision overturning that of the Labor Arbiter, now that respondent has exited from rehabilitation proceedings. </b><br><br><b><i>Amplification of the First Ground</i></b><br><br>The appellate court counted on as its first ground the view that a subsequent finding of a valid dismissal removes the basis for implementing the reinstatement aspect of a labor arbiter's decision.<br><br>On this score, the Court's attention is drawn to seemingly divergent decisions concerning reinstatement pending appeal or,<b> </b>particularly, the <b>option of payroll reinstatement</b>.  On the one hand is the jurisprudential trend as expounded in a line of cases including <i>Air Philippines Corp. v. Zamora,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> while on the other is the recent case of <i>Genuino v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  At the core of the seeming divergence is the application of paragraph 3 of Article 223 of the Labor Code which reads:<br><blockquote>In any event, <u>the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the <b>reinstatement aspect </b>is concerned, shall <b>immediately be executory, pending appeal</b></u>.  The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation or, <u>at the option of the employer</u>, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The view as maintained in a number of cases is that:<br><br>x x x [<b>E</b>]<b>ven if the order of reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter is reversed on appeal, it is obligatory on the part of the employer to reinstate and pay the wages of the dismissed employee during the period of appeal until reversal by the higher court</b>. On the other hand, if the employee has been reinstated during the appeal period and such reinstatement order is reversed with finality, <u>the employee is <i>not </i>required to reimburse whatever salary he received for he is entitled to such, more so if he actually rendered services during the period.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; italics and underscoring supplied)<br><br>In other words, a dismissed employee whose case was favorably decided by the Labor Arbiter is entitled to receive wages pending appeal upon reinstatement, which is immediately executory.  Unless there is a restraining order, it is ministerial upon the Labor Arbiter to implement the order of reinstatement and it is mandatory on the employer to comply therewith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The opposite view is articulated in <i>Genuino</i> which states:<br><blockquote><u>If the decision of the labor arbiter is later reversed on appeal upon the finding that the ground for dismissal is valid, then<b> the employer has the right to require the dismissed employee <i>on payroll reinstatement </i>to refund the salaries s/he received</b> while the case was pending appeal, or it can be deducted from the accrued benefits </u>that the dismissed employee was entitled to receive from his/her employer under existing laws, collective bargaining agreement provisions, and company practices.  However, if the employee was reinstated to work during the pendency of the appeal, then the employee is entitled to the compensation received for actual services rendered without need of refund.<br><br>Considering that Genuino was not reinstated to work or placed on payroll reinstatement, and her dismissal is based on a just cause, then she is not entitled to be paid the salaries stated in item no. 3 of the <i>fallo</i> of the September 3, 1994 NLRC Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It has thus been advanced that there is no point in releasing the wages to petitioners since their dismissal was found to be valid, and to do so would constitute unjust enrichment.<br><br>Prior to <i>Genuino</i>, there had been no known similar case containing a dispositive portion where the employee was required to refund the <u>salaries received on payroll reinstatement</u>.  In fact, in a catena of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court did not order the refund of salaries garnished or received by payroll-reinstated employees despite a subsequent reversal of the reinstatement order.<br><br>The dearth of authority supporting <i>Genuino</i> is not difficult to fathom for it would otherwise render inutile the rationale of reinstatement pending appeal.<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he law itself has laid down a compassionate policy which, once more, vivifies and enhances the provisions of the 1987 Constitution on labor and the working man.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>These duties and responsibilities of the State are imposed not so much to express sympathy for the workingman as to forcefully and meaningfully underscore labor as a primary social and economic force, which the Constitution also expressly affirms with equal intensity. Labor is an indispensable partner for the nation's progress and stability.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x In short, with respect to decisions reinstating employees, the law itself has determined a sufficiently overwhelming reason for its execution pending appeal.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x Then, by and pursuant to the same power (police power), the State may authorize an immediate implementation, pending appeal, of a decision reinstating a dismissed or separated employee since that saving act is designed to stop, although temporarily since the appeal may be decided in favor of the appellant, a continuing threat or danger to the survival or even the life of the dismissed or separated employee and his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><b>The social justice principles of labor law outweigh or render inapplicable the civil law doctrine of unjust enrichment </b>espoused by  Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr. in his Separate Opinion.<b> </b>The constitutional and statutory precepts portray the otherwise "unjust" situation as a condition affording full protection to labor.<br><br>Even outside the theoretical trappings of the discussion and into the mundane realities of human experience, the "refund doctrine" easily demonstrates how a favorable decision by the Labor Arbiter could harm, more than help, a dismissed employee.  The employee, to make both ends meet, would necessarily have to use up the salaries received during the pendency  of the appeal, only to end up having to refund the sum in case of a final unfavorable decision.  It is mirage of a stop-gap leading the employee to a risky cliff of insolvency.<br><br>Advisably, the sum is better left unspent.  It becomes more logical and practical for the employee to refuse payroll reinstatement and simply find work elsewhere in the interim, if any is available.  Notably, the option of payroll reinstatement belongs to the employer, even if the employee is able and raring to return to work.  Prior to <i>Genuino</i>, it is unthinkable for one to refuse payroll reinstatement.  In the face of the grim possibilities, the rise of concerned employees declining payroll reinstatement is on the horizon.<br><br>Further, the <i>Genuino</i> ruling not only disregards the social justice principles behind the rule, but also institutes a scheme unduly favorable to management.  Under such scheme, the salaries dispensed <i>pendente lite</i> merely serve as a bond posted <u>in installment</u> by the employer.  For in the event of a reversal of the Labor Arbiter's decision ordering reinstatement, the employer gets back the same amount <u>without having to spend ordinarily for bond premiums</u>.  This circumvents, if not directly contradicts, the proscription that the "posting of a bond [even a cash bond] by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br> <br>In playing down the stray posture in <i>Genuino</i> requiring the dismissed employee on payroll reinstatement to refund the salaries in case a final decision upholds the validity of the dismissal, the Court realigns the proper course of the prevailing doctrine on reinstatement pending appeal vis-à-vis the effect of a reversal on appeal.<br><br>Respondent insists that with the reversal of the Labor Arbiter's Decision, there is no more basis to enforce the reinstatement aspect of the said decision.  In his Separate Opinion, Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr. supports this argument and finds the prevailing doctrine in <i>Air Philippines</i> and allied cases inapplicable because, unlike the present case, the writ of execution therein was secured <u>prior to</u> the reversal of the Labor Arbiter's decision.<br><br>The proposition is tenuous.  <i>First</i>, the matter is treated as a mere race against time.  The discussion stopped there without considering the cause of the delay.  <i>Second</i>, it requires the issuance of a writ of execution despite the immediately executory nature of the reinstatement aspect of the decision.  In <i>Pioneer Texturing Corp. v. NLRC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> </i>which was cited in <i>Panuncillo v. CAP Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court observed:<br><blockquote>x x x The provision of Article 223 is clear that an award [by the Labor Arbiter] for reinstatement <i>shall be immediately executory even pending appeal</i><i> and the posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement</i>. The legislative intent is quite obvious, i.e., to make an award of reinstatement immediately enforceable, even pending appeal. <b>To require the application for and issuance of a writ of execution </b>as prerequisites for the execution of a reinstatement award <b>would certainly betray and run counter to the very object and intent of Article 223</b>, i.e., the immediate execution of a reinstatement order. The reason is simple. An application for a writ of execution and its issuance could be delayed for numerous reasons. A mere continuance or postponement of a scheduled hearing, for instance, or an inaction on the part of the Labor Arbiter or the NLRC could easily delay the issuance of the writ thereby setting at naught the strict mandate and noble purpose envisioned by Article 223. In other words, <u>if the requirements of Article 224</u> [including the issuance of a writ of execution] <u>were to govern</u>, as we so declared in <i>Maranaw</i>, <u>then the executory nature of a reinstatement order or award contemplated by Article 223 will be unduly circumscribed and rendered ineffectual</u>. In enacting the law, the legislature is presumed to have ordained a valid and sensible law, one which operates no further than may be necessary to achieve its specific purpose. Statutes, as a rule, are to be construed in the light of the purpose to be achieved and the evil sought to be remedied. x x x In introducing a new rule on the reinstatement aspect of a labor decision under Republic Act No. 6715, Congress should not be considered to be indulging in mere semantic exercise. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court reaffirms the prevailing principle that even if the order of reinstatement of the Labor Arbiter is reversed on appeal, it is obligatory on the part of the employer to reinstate and pay the wages of the dismissed employee during the period of appeal until reversal by the higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  It settles the view that the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement is immediately executory and the employer has to either re-admit them to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to their dismissal, or to reinstate them in the payroll, and that <u>failing to exercise the options in the alternative, employer must pay the employee's salaries.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b><i>Amplification of the Second Ground</i></b><br><br>The remaining issue, nonetheless, is resolved in the negative on the strength of the second ground relied upon by the appellate court in the assailed issuances.  The Court sustains the appellate court's finding that the peculiar predicament of a corporate rehabilitation rendered it impossible for respondent to exercise its option under the circumstances.<br><br>The spirit of the rule on reinstatement pending appeal animates the proceedings once the Labor Arbiter issues the decision containing an order of reinstatement.  The immediacy of its execution needs no further elaboration.  <u>Reinstatement pending appeal necessitates its immediate execution during the pendency of the appeal</u>, if the law is to serve its noble purpose.  At the same time, <u>any attempt on the part of the employer to evade or delay its execution</u>, as observed in <i>Panuncillo</i> and as what actually transpired in <i>Kimberly,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><i> Composite,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Air Philippines,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and <i>Roquero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <u>should not be countenanced</u>.<br><br><b>After the labor arbiter's decision is reversed by a higher tribunal, the employee may be barred from collecting the accrued wages, if it is shown that the delay in enforcing the reinstatement pending appeal was <u>without fault on the part of the employer</u>. </b><br><br>The test is two-fold: (1) there must be actual delay or the fact that the order of reinstatement pending appeal was not executed prior to its reversal; and (2) the delay must not be due to the employer's unjustified act or omission.  If the delay is due to the employer's unjustified refusal, the employer may still be required to pay the salaries notwithstanding the reversal of the Labor Arbiter's decision.<br><br>In <i>Genuino</i>, there was no showing that the employer refused to reinstate the employee, who was the Treasury Sales Division Head, during the short span of four months or from the promulgation on May 2, 1994 of the Labor Arbiter's Decision up to the promulgation on September 3, 1994 of the NLRC Decision.  Notably, the former NLRC Rules of Procedure did not lay down a mechanism to promptly effectuate the self-executory order of reinstatement, making it difficult to establish that the employer actually refused to comply.<br><br>In a situation like that in <i>International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where it was alleged that the employer was willing to comply with the order and that the employee opted not to pursue the execution of the order, the Court upheld the self-executory nature of the reinstatement order and ruled that the salary automatically accrued from notice of the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement until its ultimate reversal by the NLRC. It was later discovered that the employee indeed moved for the issuance of a writ but was not acted upon by the Labor Arbiter.  In that scenario where the delay was caused by the Labor Arbiter, it was ruled that the inaction of the Labor Arbiter who failed to act upon the employee's motion for the issuance of a writ of execution may no longer adversely affect the cause of the dismissed employee in view of the self-executory nature of the order of reinstatement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The new NLRC Rules of Procedure, which took effect on January 7, 2006, now require the employer to submit <u>a report of compliance within 10 calendar days from receipt</u> of the Labor Arbiter's decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> disobedience to which clearly denotes a refusal to reinstate.  The employee need not file a motion for the issuance of the writ of execution since the Labor Arbiter <u>shall</u> thereafter<i> motu proprio</i> issue the writ. <b>With the new rules in place, there is hardly any difficulty in determining the employer's intransigence in immediately complying with the order</b>.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioners exerted efforts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> to execute the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement until they were able to secure a writ of execution, albeit issued on October 5, 2000 <i>after </i>the reversal by the NLRC of the Labor Arbiter's decision.  Technically, there was still actual delay which brings to the question of whether the delay was due to respondent's unjustified act or omission.<br><br>It is apparent that there was inaction on the part of respondent to reinstate them, but whether such omission was justified depends on the onset of the exigency of corporate rehabilitation.<br><br>It is settled that upon appointment by the SEC of a rehabilitation receiver, all actions for claims before any court, tribunal or board against the corporation shall <i>ipso jure</i> be suspended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  As stated early on, during the pendency of petitioners' complaint before the Labor Arbiter, the SEC placed respondent under an Interim Rehabilitation Receiver. After the Labor Arbiter rendered his decision, the SEC replaced the Interim Rehabilitation Receiver with a Permanent Rehabilitation Receiver.<br><br>Case law recognizes that <u>unless there is a restraining order</u>, the implementation of the order of reinstatement is ministerial and mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  This injunction or suspension of claims by legislative fiat<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> partakes of the nature of a restraining order that constitutes a legal justification for respondent's non-compliance with the reinstatement order.  Respondent's failure to exercise the alternative options of actual reinstatement and payroll reinstatement was thus justified.  Such being the case, respondent's obligation to pay the salaries pending appeal, as the normal effect of the non-exercise of the options, did not attach.<br><br>While reinstatement pending appeal aims to avert the continuing threat or danger to the survival or even the life of the dismissed employee and his family, it does not contemplate the period when the employer-corporation itself is similarly in a <i>judicially monitored</i> state of being resuscitated in order to survive.<br><br>The parallelism between a judicial order of corporation rehabilitation as a justification for the non-exercise of its options, on the one hand, and a claim of actual and imminent substantial losses as ground for retrenchment, on the other hand, stops at the red line on the financial statements.  Beyond the analogous condition of financial gloom, as discussed by Justice Leonardo Quisumbing in his Separate Opinion, are more salient distinctions.  Unlike the ground of substantial losses contemplated in a retrenchment case, the state of corporate rehabilitation was judicially pre-determined by a competent court and not formulated for the first time in this case by respondent.<br><br>More importantly, there are legal effects arising from a judicial order placing a corporation under rehabilitation. Respondent was, during the period material to the case, effectively deprived of the alternative choices under Article 223 of the Labor Code, not only by virtue of the statutory injunction but also in view of the interim relinquishment of management control to give way to the full exercise of the powers of the rehabilitation receiver. Had there been no need to rehabilitate, respondent may have opted for actual physical reinstatement pending appeal to optimize the utilization of resources.  Then again, though the management may think this wise, the rehabilitation receiver may decide otherwise, not to mention the subsistence of the injunction on claims.<br><br>In sum, the obligation to pay the employee's salaries upon the employer's failure to exercise the alternative options under Article 223 of the Labor Code is not a hard and fast rule, considering the inherent constraints of corporate rehabilitation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY DENIED</b>.  Insofar as the Court of Appeals Decision of December 5, 2003 and Resolution of April 16, 2004 annulling the NLRC Resolutions affirming the validity of the Writ of Execution and the Notice of Garnishment are concerned, the Court finds no reversible error.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Azcuna, Tinga, Nachura, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, J.,</span> with separate opinion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, J.</span>, join the concurring and dissenting of J.Brion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J.</span>, concur in the result (with separate opinion)<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Brion, J.,</span> with concurring opinion and dissenting opinion.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Justices Marina L.

Hence, the NLRC erred in upholding its validity. Since PAL was under receivership, it could not have possibly reinstated petitioners due to retrenchment and cash-flow constraints. The appellate court declared that a stay of execution may be warranted by the fact that PAL was under rehabilitation receivership. The dispositive portion of the decision dated December 5, 2003, reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered and in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is hereby <b>GIVEN DUE COURSE</b>.  The assailed November 26, 2001 Resolution, as well as the January 28, 2002 Resolution of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission is hereby <b>ANNULLED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the reinstatement aspect of the Labor Arbiter's decision, albeit under appeal, is immediately enforceable as a consequence of which, the employer is duty-bound to choose forthwith whether to re-admit the employee or to reinstate him in the payroll. Failing to exercise the options in the alternative, the employer must pay the salary of the employee which automatically accrued from notice of the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement until its ultimate reversal by the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><b>  </b>Petitioners add that PAL should not be excused from complying with the order of reinstatement on the ground that it was under receivership. At the time PAL received a copy of the Labor Arbiter's decision, PAL was not yet under receivership.<br><br>Respondent counters that PAL was already under an Interim Rehabilitation Receiver at the time it received a copy of the Labor Arbiter's decision. It also contends that it cannot be compelled to reinstate petitioners pending appeal to the NLRC since retrenchment and cash flow constraints rendered it impossible to exercise its option under Article 223 of the Labor Code.<br><br>At the crux of the controversy is the application of Article 223 of the Labor Code which provides that:<br><blockquote>ART. 223. Appeal.-- ...<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal.  The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation, or at the option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll.  The posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>To be sure, the Court has divergent views on the immediately executory nature of reinstatement pending appeal particularly where the reinstatement order is reversed on appeal. On one hand, the Court has ruled that even if the Labor Arbiter's reinstatement order is reversed on appeal, it is the employer's obligation to reinstate and pay the wages of the dismissed employee during the period of appeal until reversal by the NLRC. However, if the employee has been reinstated during the period of appeal and such reinstatement order is reversed with finality, the employee is not required to reimburse whatever salary he received for he is entitled to such, more so if he actually rendered services during the period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Court has held that if the decision of the Labor Arbiter is later reversed on appeal upon the finding that the ground for dismissal is valid, then the employer has the right to require the dismissed employee on payroll reinstatement to refund the salaries s/he received while the case was pending appeal, or it can be deducted from the accrued benefits that the dismissed employee was entitled to receive from his/her employer under existing laws, collective bargaining agreement provisions, and company practices. However, if the employee was reinstated to work during the pendency of the appeal, then the employee is entitled to the compensation received for actual services rendered without need of refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In his dissenting opinion, Justice Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr. adopts the second interpretation and explains that since no actual or payroll reinstatement pending appeal transpired, petitioners are no longer entitled to their salaries for the period in question with the reversal of the Labor Arbiter's reinstatement order. There is no more legal basis for the payment of their salaries since their right to reinstatement pending appeal has been lost and extinguished. To release their salaries for the period in question would constitute unjust enrichment.<br><br>The rationale for execution pending appeal has been explained by this Court in <i>Aris (Phil.) Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>In authorizing execution pending appeal of the reinstatement aspect of a decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, the law itself has laid down a compassionate policy which, once more, vivifies and enhances the provisions of the 1987 Constitution on labor and the working-man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>If in ordinary civil actions execution of judgment pending appeal is authorized for reasons the determination of which is merely left to the discretion of the judge, We find no plausible reason to withhold it in cases of decisions reinstating dismissed or separated employees. In such cases, the poor employees had been deprived of their only source of livelihood, their only means of support for their family -- their very lifeblood. To Us, this special circumstance is far better than any other which a judge, in his sound discretion, may determine. In short, with respect to decisions reinstating employees, the law itself has determined a sufficiently overwhelming reason for its execution pending appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the principle of unjust enrichment does not apply. <i>First</i>, the provision on reinstatement pending appeal is in accord with the social justice philosophy of our Constitution. It is meant to afford full protection to labor as it aims to stop (<i>albeit</i> temporarily, since the appeal may be decided in favor of the employer) a continuing threat or danger to the survival or even the life of the dismissed employee and his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>Second</i>, the provision on reinstatement pending appeal partakes of a special law that must govern the instant case. The provision of the Civil Code on unjust enrichment, being of general application, must give way.<br><br>In any case, Justice Velasco points out that the writ of execution in the instant case was issued after the promulgation of the NLRC resolution. As petitioners failed to act on their rights and seek enforcement of the reinstatement pending appeal, PAL is not liable to pay their accrued salaries for the period in question.<br><br>In <i>Pioneer Texturizing Corp. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court clarified that an award or order for reinstatement is self-executory, to wit:<br><blockquote>A closer examination, however, shows that the necessity for a writ of execution under Article 224 applies only to final and executory decisions which are not within the coverage of Article 223. ...<br><br>x x x x<br><br>... It can not relate to an award or order of reinstatement still to be appealed or pending appeal which Article 223 contemplates. The provision of Article 223 is clear that an award for reinstatement <i>shall be immediately executory even pending appeal </i>and <i>the posting of a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement</i>. The legislative intent is quite obvious, i.e., to make an award of reinstatement immediately enforceable, even pending appeal. To require the application for and issuance of a writ of execution as prerequisites for the execution of a reinstatement award would certainly betray and run counter to the very object and intent of Article 223, i.e., the immediate execution of a reinstatement order. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>Since the reinstatement order is self-executory, it is inaccurate to say that its non-implementation was due to petitioners' fault who failed to enforce their rights at the proper and opportune time. To reiterate, the reinstatement order does not require a writ of execution, much less a motion for its issuance. To require petitioners to move for the enforcement of the reinstatement order and blame them for its belated enforcement, as Justice Velasco does, would render nugatory the self-executory nature of the award.<br><br>Justice Velasco also posits that Article 223 of the Labor Code does not automatically make the employer liable for accrued salaries during the reinstatement pending appeal where no reinstatement took place. He stresses that the only relief given under the NLRC Rules of Procedure is the remedy of compulsion <i>via</i> a citation for contempt, thus:<br><blockquote>RULE V. SEC. 14. Contents of Decisions. --- ...<br><br>In case the decision of the Labor Arbiter includes an order of reinstatement, it shall likewise contain: a) a statement that the reinstatement aspect is immediately executory; and b) a directive for the employer to submit a report of compliance within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the said decision.<br><br>RULE IX. SEC. 6. EXECUTION OF REINSTATEMENT PENDING APPEAL. --- <b>In case the decision includes an order of reinstatement, and the employer disobeys the directive</b> under the second paragraph of Section 14 of Rule V <b>or refuses to reinstate the dismissed employee, the Labor Arbiter shall immediately issue a writ of execution, even pending appeal, directing the employer <u>to immediately reinstate the dismissed employee either physically or in the payroll</u>, and <u>to pay the accrued salaries</u></b> as a consequence of such reinstatement at the rate specified in the decision.<br><br>The Sheriff shall serve the writ of execution upon the employer or any other person required by law to obey the same. <b>If he disobeys the writ, such employer or person <u>may be cited for contempt</u></b> in accordance with Rule IX. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Contrary to the position of Justice Velasco, there are actually two reliefs given in the foregoing provisions: (1) the payment of accrued salaries, and (2) a citation for contempt.<br><br>If the Labor Arbiter's decision includes a reinstatement order, the decision should state that the reinstatement aspect is immediately executory and direct the employer to submit a compliance report within ten calendar days from receipt of the said decision. Should the employer disobey the directive of the Labor Arbiter or refuse to reinstate the dismissed employee, the Labor Arbiter shall immediately issue a writ of execution, even pending appeal, directing the employer to immediately reinstate the dismissed employee either physically or in the payroll, and to pay the accrued salaries as a consequence of such reinstatement. If the employer still disobeys the writ of execution, then he may be cited for contempt.<br><br>Finally, the majority put forth the view that after the Labor Arbiter's reinstatement order is reversed by the NLRC, the employee may be barred from collecting his accrued salaries if it is shown that the non-implementation of the reinstatement order was not due to the fault of the employer. In the instant case, the corporate rehabilitation of PAL had the effect of suspending all actions or claims against it. It partakes of the nature of a restraining order that constitutes a legal justification for PAL's non-compliance with the reinstatement order. The writer adds that reinstatement pending appeal does not contemplate the period when the employer is similarly in a state of being resuscitated in order to survive.<br><br>In <i>Rubberworld (Phils.), Inc. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we recognized that the automatic stay of all pending actions for claims is intended to enable the management committee or the rehabilitation receiver to effectively exercise its/his powers free from any judicial or extra judicial interference that might unduly hinder or prevent the `rescue' of the distressed corporation. To allow such other actions to continue would only add to the burden of the management committee or rehabilitation receiver, whose time, effort and resources would be wasted in defending claims against the corporation instead of being directed toward its restructuring and rehabilitation.<br><br>Indeed, rehabilitation merely provides for the automatic stay of all pending actions or the suspension of payments of the distressed corporation to prevent the dissipation of its assets; it does not relieve the corporation of its obligations. Upon its successful rehabilitation, it must settle in full all claims previously suspended.<br><br>Applying the foregoing rule, we cannot adhere to the posture taken by the majority. Just because PAL was under rehabilitation did not necessarily mean that immediately executory orders such as reinstatement pending appeal will be put to naught. That would in effect nullify the relief given to the employee when all the law seeks to do is suspend it.<br><br>Furthermore, we do not agree that reinstatement pending appeal is inapplicable in the instant case since, as the majority puts it, PAL is similarly in a state of being resuscitated in order to survive. PAL even argues that retrenchment and cash flow constraints rendered it impossible to comply with the reinstatement order. In <i>Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP) v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> we noted that PAL failed to substantiate its claim of actual and imminent substantial losses which would justify the retrenchment of more than 1,400 of its cabin crew personnel. Although the Philippine economy was gravely affected by the Asian financial crisis, however, it cannot be assumed that it has likewise brought PAL to the brink of bankruptcy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In effect, we held that the mere fact that PAL underwent corporate rehabilitation does not automatically mean that it suffered specific and substantial losses that would necessitate retrenchment. In fact, PAL was on the road to recovery as early as February 1999 and was declaring profits in millions in the succeeding years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Given the circumstances in this case, delay on the employee's part was not an issue.  But we cannot agree that the petitioners could be barred from collecting accrued wages, merely on the ground of their delay in enforcing reinstatement pending appeal.  For it was the statutory duty of the respondent as employer to comply with a self-executory order in favor of the employees, herein petitioners.<br><br>Thus, while its rehabilitation may have prevented PAL from exercising its option either to re-admit petitioners to work or to reinstate them in the payroll, it did not defeat petitioners' right to reinstatement pending appeal which vested upon rendition of the Labor Arbiter's decision; more so when no actual and imminent substantial losses were proven by PAL.<br><br>To reiterate, there is no longer any legal impediment to hold PAL liable for petitioners' salaries which automatically accrued from notice of the Labor Arbiter's order of reinstatement until its ultimate reversal by the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I would vote to <b>GRANT </b>the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Garcia v.
