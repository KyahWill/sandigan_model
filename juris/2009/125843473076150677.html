				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a decision dated October 25, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Danao City, Branch 25 found accused-appellant Felix Casas Perez guilty of two counts of qualified rape for sexually abusing his 15-year-old daughter, AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> He was sentenced to death for each count of qualified rape and to pay P100,000 as damages.<br><br>On intermediate appellate review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Because the Information did not state the age of AAA at the time of the commission of the offense, the CA downgraded accused-appellant's offenses to simple rape and consequently lowered the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count thereof. It likewise ordered accused-appellant to pay P50,000 moral damages and P25,000 exemplary damages. <i> </i><br><br>The RTC and the CA found that accused-appellant forced his daughter AAA to have sexual intercourse with him on December 20 and 25, 1995. In both instances, he was armed with a knife and a <i>pinuti</i> (or a long bolo) and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident.<br><br>We find no reason to disturb the findings of the RTC as affirmed by the CA. The records are replete with evidence establishing accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. However, to conform with existing jurisprudence, P50,000 civil indemnity<i> ex delicto,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> P50,000 moral damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and P30,000 exemplary damages for each count of rape must be awarded to the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
