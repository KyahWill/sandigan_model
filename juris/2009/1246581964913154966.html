Subsequently, she, appellant Katipunan, and a certain Reynaldo Soriano (Soriano) -- appellant Katipunans alleged uncle who was with them inside the house during the arrest -- were brought to the police station.&nbsp; Soriano was beaten up by the policemen in the said station, but was released two days after the arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Appellant Katipunan declared she was in her house at 1022 Callejon Flores, Solis Street, Tondo Manila on 14 January 2004.&nbsp; At about 5:00 p.m., appellant Hernandez arrived at her house.

The RTC and the Court of Appeals found the testimonies of PO2 Dimacali and PO2 Carandang to be credible. Both courts also found no ill motive on their part to testify against appellants.<br><br>The prosecution adduced as its documentary and object evidence the transparent plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> sold by appellants to PO2 Dimacali during the buy-bust operation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the chemistry report of PNP Forensic Chemist Macapagal confirming that the plastic sachet sold by appellants to PO2 Dimacali contained 0.047 gram of <i>shabu</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and the marked money used during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode, method, and manner in which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community of interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It is clear from the testimony of PO2 Dimacali that appellants were of one mind in selling <i>shabu</i> to him as shown by their series of overt acts during the transaction, to wit: (1) when PO2 Dimacali told appellant Katipunan that he would buy two hundred pesos worth of <i>shabu</i>, appellant Katipunan told appellant Hernandez to give her (appellant Katipunan) one sachet of <i>shabu</i>; (2) appellant Hernandez immediately brought out from her pocket one plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> and handed it to appellant Katipunan; (3) after receiving the plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> from appellant Katipunan, PO2 Dimacali handed the buy-bust money to the former who, in turn, gave it to appellant Hernandez; (4) When PO2 Dimacali introduced himself as a police officer and announced the arrest, appellants tried to escape; and (5) the buy-bust money was recovered from the possession of appellant Hernandez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> No other logical conclusion would follow from the appellants' concerted action except that they had a common purpose and community of interest. Conspiracy having been established, appellants are liable as co-principals regardless of their participation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The rule is that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect, because trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor of the witnesses as they testify. This is more true if such findings were affirmed by the appellate court. When the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>To rebut the overwhelming evidence for the prosecution, appellants interposed the defense of denial and frame-up.&nbsp; Appellants denied they sold <i>shabu</i> to PO2 Dimacali during the buy-bust operation and claimed that the arresting officers tried to extort money from them in exchange for their freedom.<br><br>The defense of denial and frame-up has been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor, for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In order to prosper, the defense of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In the case before us, appellants miserably failed to present any evidence in support of their claims.&nbsp; Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations.<br><br>Appellants admitted that they did not know PO2 Dimacali, PO2 Carandang and the rest of the back-up team prior to their arrest and could not state any reason why they were arrested and charged with selling <i>shabu</i>, hence negating any improper motive on the part of the arresting officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> When the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation have no ill motive to testify against the accused, the courts shall uphold the presumption that they have performed their duties regularly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Further, appellants have not filed a single complaint for frame-up or extortion against the arresting officers.&nbsp; This inaction clearly betrays appellants' claim of frame-up.<br><br>It is true that Victoria and Marileth testified in behalf of appellants. However, their testimonies refer only to peripheral matters and not to the actual buy-bust transaction itself.&nbsp; They were not present in the crime scene during the transaction.&nbsp; In short, they have no personal knowledge of what actually transpired during the actual buy-bust operation.&nbsp; Their testimonies, therefore, deserve scant consideration.<br><br>Given the foregoing circumstances, the positive and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses prevail over the defense of denial and frame-up of appellants.<br><br>Appellants, nonetheless, averred that the buy-bust team did not comply with the procedure in the custody of seized/confiscated dangerous drugs as provided under Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">ARTICLE II<br>UNLAWFUL ACTS AND PENALTIES<br></div><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. -</i><br><br>x x x x<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody of all dangerous drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br></blockquote>Appellants also contended that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the prohibited drug allegedly seized from them based on the following reasons: (1) PO2 Dimacali, PO2 Carandang and the rest of the back-up team did not write their initials on the one transparent plastic sachet allegedly containing <i>shabu</i> immediately after recovering the same from appellants; (2) no inventory or identifying mark was made at the crime scene; (3) the confiscated drug was belatedly marked by PO2 Dimacali at the police station; and (4) Inspector Tiu was not presented as a witness to corroborate PO2 Dimacali's testimony that the latter turned over to the former the seized transparent plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> after appellants' arrest.&nbsp; Thus, there is doubt on whether the specimen examined by PNP Forensic Chemist Macapagal and eventually submitted to the RTC was the same specimen recovered from appellants. Moreover, the alleged buy-bust operation and buy-bust money was not recorded in the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that appellants tried to raise the buy-bust team's alleged non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; This, they cannot do. It is too late in the day for them to do so.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Sta. Maria,</i><i><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></b></i> in which the very same issue was raised, we held:<br><blockquote>The law excuses non-compliance under justifiable grounds. However, whatever justifiable grounds may excuse the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation in this case from complying with Section 21 will remain unknown, because appellant did not question during trial the safekeeping of the items seized from him. Indeed, the <b>police officers'</b> <b>alleged violations</b> of Sections 21 and 86 of Republic Act No. 9165 <b>were not raised before the trial court but were instead raised for the first time on appeal. In no instance did appellant least intimate at the trial court that there were lapses in the safekeeping of seized items that affected their integrity and evidentiary value. Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, he must so state in the form of objection. Without such objection, he cannot raise the question for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; </b>(Emphases supplied.)<br></blockquote>Moreover, we have held in several cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 is not fatal and will not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, the integrity of the drug seized from appellants was preserved.&nbsp; The chain of custody of the drug subject matter of the instant case was shown not to have been broken.<br><br>Records disclosed that after PO2 Dimacali confiscated the one transparent plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> from appellants, he immediately brought the same to the police station where he marked it "GKC" and turned it over to Inspector Tiu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The latter then forwarded the said plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> marked "GKC" to the<i> </i>PNP Crime Laboratory of the Western Police District, U.N. Avenue, Ermita, Manila, for laboratory examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; After a qualitative examination conducted on the contents of the plastic sachet marked "GKC," PNP Forensic Chemist Macapagal found it to be positive for <i>methylamphetamine hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Upon being weighed, the plastic sachet was determined to be containing 0.047 gram of <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>When the prosecution presented the plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> marked "GKC," PO2 Dimacali positively identified it as the one he bought from appellants in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The plastic sachet containing 0.047 gram of <i>shabu</i> had the marking "GKC" as attested by PNP Forensic Chemist Macapagal in her chemistry report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The existence, due execution, and genuineness of the said chemistry report, as well as the qualifications of PNP Forensic Chemist Macapagal as an expert witness, were admitted by the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Further, PO2 Dimacali categorically declared during the trial that he put the "GKC" marking on the one transparent plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> recovered from appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, the identity of the drug recovered from appellants has been duly preserved and established by the prosecution. Hence, there is no doubt that the plastic sachet marked "GKC" submitted for laboratory examination and later on found to be positive for <i>shabu</i> was the same one sold by appellants to PO2 Dimacali during the buy-bust operation.<br><br>Besides, the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered with.&nbsp; Appellants in this case bear the burden of showing that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption that there was regularity in the handling of exhibits by public officers, and that the latter properly discharged their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Appellants failed to produce convincing proof that the evidence submitted by the prosecution had been tampered with.<br><br>The fact that Inspector Tiu was not presented as a witness to corroborate PO2 Dimacali's testimony does not warrant appellants' acquittal of the crime charged.&nbsp; Not all people who came into contact with the seized drugs are required to testify in court.&nbsp; There is nothing in Republic Act No. 9165 or in any rule implementing the same that imposes such a requirement. As long as the chain of custody of the seized drug was clearly established to have not been broken and the prosecution did not fail to identify properly the drugs seized, it is not indispensable that each and every person who came into possession of the drugs should take the witness stand.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Zeng Hua Dian</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> we ruled:<br><blockquote>After a thorough review of the records of this case we find that the chain of custody of the seized substance was not broken and that the prosecution did not fail to identify properly the drugs seized in this case. The non-presentation as witnesses of other persons such as SPO1 Grafia, the evidence custodian, and PO3 Alamia, the officer on duty, is not a crucial point against the prosecution. The matter of presentation of witnesses by the prosecution is not for the court to decide. The prosecution has the discretion as to how to present its case and it has the right to choose whom it wishes to present as witnesses.<br></blockquote>Appellants' assertion that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were fabricated because the alleged buy-bust operation and buy-bust money were not recorded in the police blotter is unmeritorious.&nbsp; The buy-bust operation conducted on appellants was duly recorded in the police blotter, as shown in the Pre-Operation/Coordination Sheet made and signed by Inspector Tiu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; With regard to the non-recording of the buy-bust money in the police blotter, suffice it to state that neither law nor jurisprudence requires that the buy-bust money be entered in the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; At any rate, the non-recording of the buy-bust operation and buy-bust money in the police blotter is not essential, since they are not elements in the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.&nbsp; As earlier discussed, the only elements necessary to consummate the crime is proof that the illicit transaction took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the dangerous drug seized as evidence.&nbsp; Both were satisfactorily proved in the present case.<br><br>Since appellants' violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 was duly established by the prosecution's evidence, we shall now ascertain the penalties imposable on them.<br><br>Under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, the unauthorized sale of <i>shabu</i>, regardless of its quantity and purity, carries with it the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00).<br><br>Pursuant, however, to the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled, "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines," only life imprisonment and fine shall be imposed.&nbsp; Thus, the RTC and the Court of Appeals were correct in imposing the penalty of life imprisonment and fine of P500,000.00 on each of the appellants.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, after due deliberation, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
