Subsequently, accused-appellant also went back inside Casa Blanca, finished his drink and left the restaurant with Maritess.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Dorothy Rivera, the owner of Casa Blanca, corroborated Aguilar’s testimony and stated that in the early morning of July 8, 1995, while she was supervising the waitresses inside the restaurant, she saw the accused-appellant and Maritess quarrelling near the front gate of the restaurant compound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Shortly thereafter, Avila, Jr. bade her goodbye.&nbsp; Rivera knew Avila, Jr. because he was a cousin of her brother-in-law.&nbsp; Avila then rode his motorcycle which was parked inside the restaurant compound and went on his way home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>As Avila turned his motorcycle to the right side of the gate of Casa Blanca, Rivera heard a gunshot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thereafter, Maritess went back inside the restaurant.&nbsp; Rivera then asked her if she knew anything about the gunshot that had just been fired.&nbsp; Maritess replied that the accused-appellant had fired a warning shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Later, the accused-appellant also went back inside the restaurant and finished his beer.&nbsp; Maritess and the accused-appellant talked again for a few minutes and then they left Casa Blanca.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For his part, Ramil Llorado testified that at about 1:00 a.m. on July 8, 1995, while he was drinking liquor with two other persons in front of his house in Narciso St., some fifty to sixty meters away from Casa Blanca, he heard a lone gunshot. Three to four minutes after the said gunshot was fired, a man riding a motorcycle stopped in front of them and asked for help.&nbsp; Thereafter, the man fell down from his motorcycle.&nbsp; Llorado recognized the man as Vidal Avila, Jr., an employee in the Office of the City Engineer of Surigao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Llorado and one of his friends then hailed a tricycle and rushed to the city police station.&nbsp; They reported the incident to the desk officer and requested for assistance. The police then sent two policemen in a patrol car to Narciso St. to look into the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Upon returning to Narciso St. with the policemen, Llorado helped carry Avila, Jr. inside the police car to bring him to the Surigao Provincial Hospital. Llorado cradled Avila, Jr.’s head on his lap and asked the latter who shot him.&nbsp; Avila, Jr. replied in a weak voice that a policeman shot him.&nbsp; Llorado was shocked upon hearing Avila, Jr.’s answer, but since they were inside a police car at that time together with some policemen, he refrained from further asking questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, as PO3 Deguino was driving to Casa Blanca in response to the radio communication which he had earlier received, he saw some men carrying a wounded man inside a police car parked along Narciso St. He learned that the wounded man was the person shot in front of&nbsp; Casa Blanca earlier that morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He then proceeded to Casa Blanca to investigate regarding the incident. He was told by a certain Simon Ferol and a Benhur Turtor who were at Casa Blanca at the time of the shooting that the assailant was Deguino’s fellow police officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Later, PO2 Carias told him that the policeman whom they dropped off at Casa Blanca at around 12:45 a.m. of July 8 was the accused-appellant, and that the latter was already drunk when he got off at said restaurant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Deguino also talked to Kit Aguilar who confirmed that the accused-appellant was at Casa Blanca with his girlfriend Maritess earlier that morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Deguino and PO3 Marcial Tinio proceeded to the hospital where Avila, Jr. was brought to ask the latter some questions regarding the shooting.&nbsp; Upon arriving there at around 3:00 a.m., they found another policeman surnamed Cabada trying to interview Avila, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Sensing that Avila, Jr. was dying, Deguino requested Cabada to allow him to ask the questions as he and the victim were friends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Deguino then placed his mouth near Avila, Jr.’s ear and spoke loudly: “Jun, this is your friend Bebot.”&nbsp; Avila, Jr. opened his eyes and raised his head toward Deguino.&nbsp; The latter then asked Avila, Jr., “Do you recognize the person who shot you?”&nbsp; After Deguino repeated the question three times, Avila, Jr. replied yes.&nbsp; Deguino then asked: “<i>Kinsa man?</i>&nbsp; (Who) Who, a policeman?”&nbsp; Avila, Jr. said yes again.&nbsp; Deguino asked the latter a third question: “Was it Akib?”&nbsp; Deguino had to repeat the question several times before Avila finally said yes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Deguino could not believe what Avila, Jr. had just said that he felt his body hairs stand up.&nbsp; He and Tinio then went to their vehicle and returned to the police station.&nbsp; Upon reaching the same, he informed Inspector Gregorio Peramide, the officer of the day, what Avila, Jr. had told him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Another witness, Senior Inspector Edgar Leva, testified that at around 2:00 a.m. on July 8, 1995 while he was waiting in Barangay Lipata for the vehicle that would tow the car used by him and some other policemen back to Surigao City, he monitored a message from their radio equipment that there was a shooting incident in Casa Blanca in Narciso St., Surigao City.&nbsp; About twenty minutes after he heard said message, he arrived at the Surigao City Police Station where he met Peramide whom he ordered to follow-up the developments regarding the shooting incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> At around 3:00 a.m., not long after Leva had returned to his residence, Inspector Morales arrived therein and reported to him that the accused-appellant was the prime suspect in the shooting of Avila, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Shortly thereafter, Peramide, and later Tinio and Deguino also arrived at Leva’s house and made similar reports that the accused-appellant was suspected of having shot Avila, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As deputy chief of police of Surigao City, Leva directed them to cordon off the house of Norrudin in Gimena St., Surigao City as there were reports that the accused-appellant was in his home.<br><br>Subsequently, Leva received a call that he was needed at the accused-appellant’s house which was already surrounded by policemen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> When he reached the same, he called out the accused-appellant’s name and asked the latter to come out of the house.&nbsp; However, the accused-appellant instead asked Leva to enter the house.&nbsp; Leva and Deguino went in and the accused-appellant surrendered to them.&nbsp; Leva then brought the accused-appellant to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>PO3 Eutropio Paltinca, a laboratory technician in the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory in Cagayan de Oro City who had been temporarily assigned to the forensic processing department in Surigao City, testified that he conducted a paraffin test on the accused-appellant pursuant to the request of the Chief of Police of Surigao City.&nbsp; He conducted the test on both hands of the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The following day, he personally brought the test results to the crime laboratory in Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>Chemistry Report No. C-022-95 dated July 9, 1995 prepared by forensic analyst Senior Inspector Vicente P. Armada, revealed that the accused-appellant’s right hand tested positive for gunpowder residue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Armada also examined the revolver, a caliber .38 Squares Bingham with Serial No. 924673 assigned to the accused-appellant, to determine if the same had been fired recently before it was confiscated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Chemistry Report No. C-036-95 prepared by Armada stated that nitrate and gunpowder residue were found on the barrel and cylinder of the firearm.&nbsp; He concluded that the firearm had been fired recently before it was confiscated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The physician on duty in Surigao Provincial Hospital on July 8, 1995, Dr. Audie Relliquete, testified that at about 2:35 a.m. on July 8, 1995, a wounded man identified as Vidal Avila, Jr. was brought to the hospital due to a gunshot wound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Dr. Relliquete examined the victim and noticed that the latter was cyanotic and pale due to loss of blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The doctor discovered that the bullet entered the victim’s body on the right side of the abdomen and exited at the left side of his navel.&nbsp; The wound of entry was contused and circular and had the characteristics of a bullet wound.&nbsp; The trajectory of the wound was about level from the points of entry to exit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Dr. Relliquete also stated that he applied dextrose and other medicines on Avila, Jr. and scheduled him for an exploratory laparotomy, but the victim died at around 4:10 a.m. even before the operation could be conducted.&nbsp; The cause of death was severe blood loss, shock and heart failure secondary to the bullet wound.<br><br>The victim’s wife, Florentina Avila (Mrs. Avila), testified that she and Avila, Jr. had four children.&nbsp; Their oldest child was 11 years old while the youngest was only two years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> At the time of his death,&nbsp; Avila, Jr. was 43 years old and working as a building inspector at the City Engineer’s Office with a net take home pay of P1,909.88 per month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Had he lived until retirement at age 60, he would have about 17 more years in government service and would have earned a total of P389,615.52 during this period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Mrs. Avila further stated that she spent a total of P113,900.00 in miscellaneous expenses for the wake and interment of her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> She also claimed moral damages for the shock, serious anxiety and worry that she and her children suffered as a result of her husband’s death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant denied the charges against him.&nbsp; While he admitted in his testimony that on the night of July 7, 1995, after his duty, he went to Barangay Lipata, Surigao City with Police Inspector Morales, PO2 Carias, and PO2 Valeciano Rivas to inspect the police detachment located therein, and thereafter, to have a few drinks, he insisted that after they returned to Surigao City at about 2:00 a.m. on July 8, 1995, he asked PO3 Pepito Gloria who was driving the vehicle to drop him off at his house in the PNP Compound in Borromeo St.&nbsp; He said that when he got home, he changed clothes, ate supper and then went to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant further stated that at around 6:30 a.m. of July 8, 1995, he was awakened by the arrival of Senior Inspector Edgar Leva and SPO4 Antonio Cortes at his residence.&nbsp; He was told that they were going to the police station.&nbsp; Upon their arrival at said place, Leva and Cortes asked the accused-appellant what he did earlier that morning.&nbsp; The latter replied that he did not do anything.&nbsp; Leva then told him that he (accused-appellant) shot a man dead at Casa Blanca.&nbsp; The accused-appellant said he was stunned by Leva’s statement since he had nothing to do with the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant also denied that Maritess, the GRO from Casa Blanca, is his girlfriend.&nbsp; He maintained that he does not know the woman and he has not gone inside the said restaurant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Ruperto Deguino was assailed by the accused-appellant on the ground of alleged bias and ill-will.&nbsp; He said that sometime in August 1993, he and Deguino were assigned to guard the PHILNICO in Barangay Nonoc, Surigao City.&nbsp; Deguino tried to smuggle out certain jeep parts from the company compound but he was prevented from doing so by the accused, who reported the incident to the company management, so Deguino threatened to get even with him someday.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant also explained that the firearm assigned to him had nitrate and gunpowder residue because he test-fired the same two times in the PNP Compound on July 7, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>PO2 Pepito Gloria corroborated the accused-appellant’s statement that they went to Barangay Lipata in the evening of July 7, 1995 and returned to Surigao City at around 1:00 a.m. on July 8, 1995.&nbsp; He said that they dropped off the accused-appellant at Firma Lodge near the PNP Compound before proceeding to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> PO2 Valeriano Rivas likewise gave a similar testimony before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On January 24, 1997, the RTC promulgated its Decision finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of reclusion perpetua.<br><br>Accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal from the decision of the RTC on February 18, 1997.<br><br>In his appeal brief, accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of murder based on the evidence presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; He argues that the alleged dying declaration is inadmissible because it was not reduced into writing.&nbsp; The victim’s alleged declaration was testified to only by PO3 Deguino, and such testimony was not corroborated by any other witness.&nbsp; Accused-appellant further states that even assuming that the victim’s dying declaration is admissible on that score, the trial court should not have admitted the same because the prosecution failed to establish that at the time the victim told Deguino&nbsp; who killed him, he was conscious that he was at the brink of death. Citing <i>People vs. Lanza</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and <i>People vs. Elizaga</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the accused-appellant argues that such element must be proven for the dying declaration to be admissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Moreover, the accused-appellant contends that the alleged dying declaration is doubtful, considering that it was Deguino who “forced into the mouth of the victim the identity of the [accused-]appellant as his supposed assailant,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and that in other words, it was not the victim who actually identified the accused-appellant as his killer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant likewise assails the trial court’s findings that it was he who shot Avila, Jr., and maintains that the owner of Casa Blanca, Dorothy Rivera, as well as Kit Aguilar who was also at said restaurant at the time of the shooting, testified that at the moment they heard the gunshot, they did not see accused-appellant holding a gun nor shooting the victim nor posed to shoot the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>It is further argued that Maritess’ statement addressed to Rivera and Aguilar that accused-appellant had fired a warning shot should not have been admitted by the trial court for being hearsay, as Maritess was never presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General on the other hand contends that accused-appellant’s guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He maintains that the dying declaration of Vidal Avila, Jr. was made under consciousness of impending death, and is therefore sufficient to convict accused-appellant of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>He further contends that even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the victim’s declaration is inadmissible in evidence, still the accused-appellant can be convicted beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of circumstantial evidence which proves the accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The Court affirms the trial court’s ruling.<br><br>At the outset, it must be said that the Court finds no reason to deviate from the general rule that factual findings of the trial court are entitled to respect and shall not be disturbed on appeal, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked or misinterpreted, and would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In the case at bar, the lower court did not err in ruling that there is direct as well as circumstantial evidence to prove accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Anent the issue as to whether the responses uttered by Avila, Jr. shortly before his death identifying accused-appellant as the one who shot him satisfies the requisites of a dying declaration, the rule is that the following elements must concur for said declaration to be admissible in evidence:&nbsp; (1) the dying declaration must concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death; (2) at the time it was made, the declarant was under a consciousness of impending death; (3) the declarant must have been competent to testify as a witness; and (4) the declaration is offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder or parricide in which the declarant was the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Although Avila, Jr. did not expressly state that he was dying when he made the declaration,&nbsp; the circumstances surrounding such declaration show that the same was uttered by him under the concsiousness of impending death.&nbsp; It has been held in a number of cases that even if a declarant did not make a statement that he was on the brink of death, a dying declaration may be admissible if there are circumstances from which it may be inferred with certainty that such was his state of mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thus, the Court in <i>People vs. Tañeza</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and <i>People vs. Serrano</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> held that the fact that the victim died shortly after making a declaration as to the identity of his killer, gives rise to the inference that the victim knew that he was dying at the time such declaration was made.<br><br>A dying declaration made in the form of answers to questions put by the person to whom the declaration is made is admissible in court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and may be proved by the testimony of the witness who heard the same or to whom it was made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, the trial court did not err in admitting the following testimony of Deguino in whose presence Avila, Jr. made the dying declaration:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">(PROS.
