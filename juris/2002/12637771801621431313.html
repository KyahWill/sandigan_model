<p class="BODY">Initially charged for the felony were Proculo Mejeca y

<p class="BODY">The case then proceeded to trial after which, the court <i style="">a quo </i>rendered judgment, the dispositive
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the Court finds the
accused ARNOLD NARCISO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery
with Homicide penalized under Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code with
the aggravating circumstances of the use of unlicensed firearm and in band and
is sentenced to suffer the maximum penalty of DEATH by lethal injection.  The said accused is further ordered to pay
the heirs of Lita Berlanas the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS as
indemnity for the latter’s death and to pay the owner of JTC Pawnshop, Victoria

against them for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond
reasonable doubt and are ordered released from the custody of the Marikina City
Jail unless validly held for some other offense.  The case against the other accused who remain at large is ordered
archived and let a warrant of arrest be issued against them.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On automatic review before this Court, accused-appellant Arnold
Narciso assails the imposition of the supreme penalty of death against him
alleging that –</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE
IMPROBABLE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION EYEWITNESS NANCY ALEGRE</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT ON
THE GROUND OF REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the prosecution’s version of the incident, as summarized in
the People’s brief, it appears that on July 11, 1996, Nancy “Ancy” Alegre, then
an appraiser employed by the JTC Pawnshop, owned and operated by Victoria
Tuparan-Manansala, left the pawnshop’s Cogeo-Antipolo branch, around 5:30 in
the afternoon and proceeded to the main branch at Bayan-bayanan Avenue,
Concepcion, Marikina City to submit her report to Lita Berlanas and to Edna
Escabe, employees of the main branch.  She arrived at the main branch between 6:30 and 7:00 in the evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">When she was about five steps from the entrance of the main
branch, she saw a man in front of the pawnshop, brandishing a gun in his right
hand while holding Lita Berlanas by her nape with his left hand.  She later identified this man as
accused-appellant Arnold Narciso.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bystanders advised Ancy not to proceed to the pawnshop warning
her, thus: “<i style="">Miss, huwag ka nang tumuloy,
may hold-apan</i>.”<i style="">  </i>Alerted to the danger, she then went to
other side of the road near a 7-11 Convenience Store to observe what was going
on.  She heard several gunshots fired
inside the pawnshop.  She saw Arnold
fire the gun upwards and towards the street. After the gun was fired, Lita
Berlanas ran and Arnold shot her.  Several men, numbering about four, including Arnold, ran out of the
pawnshop.  One of the men, who was also
carrying a gun, manned the traffic. The four men commandeered a Tamaraw FX
vehicle and boarded it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ancy then rushed towards the pawnshop where she found Edna Escaba
hiding under the sink.  She proceeded
towards the side of the pawnshop and found the lifeless body of Lita
Berlanas.  All the pawned items were
gone.  At that point, Ancy lost
consciousness and was brought to the hospital.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The pawnshop’s owner, Victoria Tuparan-Manansala, arrived at the
scene of the crime after the robbery.  She had just come from their branch on Molave Street, where she
inspected the pawned items.  She
received a message on her pager that there was a robbery at the main branch and
that Lita Berlanas was gunned down.  She
rushed to the site where she saw barangay officials carrying Lita Berlanas’
body out of the shop.  She found that
all the items in the pawnshop were taken.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> The
value of the items taken from the pawnshop amounted to more or less Four
Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00).</p>

<p class="BODY">Almost two years later, in January 1998, the pawnshop’s
Karuhatan-Valenzuela branch was robbed at gunpoint.  The suspects were caught and brought to Camp Crame where the
employees of the JTC Pawnshop, Ancy and a certain Edera, identified them as the
same persons who committed the July 11, 1996 robbery of the pawnshop’s Marikina
branch.  They were identified as accused
Diosecoro Narciso, Dante Aras, Arnold Narciso and Julie Hilario.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellant Arnold Narciso was arrested and detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, accused-appellant had a different story to
tell.  He denied any participation in
the crime and alleged that on July 11, 1996, he was in his residence in Bagong
Nayon II, Antipolo City, digging a well.  He asserted that the claim of Ancy Alegre that it was he who took Lita
Berlanas hostage was a “big lie.”  He
pointed out that when Ancy first testified, she identified the person on the
cartographic sketch as Baldomero Quintana. However, she later declared that it
was accused-appellant who was depicted on the sketch.  He also claimed that Ancy may have singled him out because among
the four accused, he was the only one who was the most vocal in court.  He denied knowledge of the location of the
Marikina Branch of JTC Pawnshop.  He
claimed that he only found out where it was situated when he was indicted and
detained in Marikina.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> He
further testified that the distance between the pawnshop and the 7-11 Convenience
Store where Ancy allegedly stood was approximately 35-40 meters.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The JTC Pawnshop is facing the church while the convenience store is facing
Bayan-bayanan Avenue.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant alleged that on January 24, 1998, while he was
in his house in Bagong Nayon II, Antipolo City tending to his child and nephew,
two men in civilian clothes arrived.  One of the men stood in front of the house while the second who was in
shorts with a long firearm approached him and asked him if he was the brother
of Diosecoro Narciso.  When he answered
affirmatively, the man suddenly struck him on his stomach with the butt of the
gun.  He was then pushed to the ground,
handcuffed behind his back, blindfolded and brought to a vehicle.  He learned for the first time that he was
being implicated in the robbery when he was detained in Valenzuela.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant insists that he was not positively identified
by eyewitness Ancy Alegre.  He argues
that Ancy could not have seen his face as she described him as “sporting long
hair with dark brown complexion,” therefore “it is highly probable that the
witness could not have clearly seen the face of the man as the latter’s face
may have been covered by his long wavy hair.”  He also makes capital of the fact that Ancy did not describe his
features to the police-investigator/cartographer, implying that had she really
been familiar with his face, other sketches need not have been shown to
her.  He further argues that he is not
the only one among the accused with “medium build, dark complexion, sporting
long wavy hair,” inasmuch as his co-accused, Baldomero Quintina, also fits that
description and, thus, Ancy may have mistaken him for Quintina.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, accused-appellant raises the issue of credibility.  He assails the assessment by the trial court
of the witnesses’ testimonies in regard to his identification as one of the
perpetrators of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Matters concerning the credibility of the witnesses are best
addressed to the sound judgment of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is well-settled that appellate courts will not interfere with the trial
court’s assessment in this regard, absent any indication or showing that the
trial court has overlooked some material facts of substance or value or gravely
abused its discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> The
matter of assigning values to declarations at the witness stand is best and
most competently performed or carried out by a trial judge who, unlike
appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the light of accused’s
behavior, demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, we note in particular accused-appellant’s
positive identification by eyewitness Ancy Alegre, who testified on direct
examination as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">There were attempts by defense counsel to impeach Ancy’s
credibility on cross-examination by dwelling on what was perceived to be a
vague description of accused-appellant and the supposed darkness and poor
visibility, but they only succeeded in eliciting the opposite response:</p>

<p class="BODY">What, however, spelled finis to accused-appellant’s pretensions
of innocence are the following declarations of Ancy Alegre on re-direct
examination:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Miss Witness, you earlier
identified Arnold Narciso as the one whom you saw standing in front of the
pawnshop at the time of the incident and who was then holding the nape of Lita

</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected accused-appellant’s defense which
consisted mainly of denial and alibi.  Ancy Alegre placed him at the scene and time of the robbery and saw him
shoot Lita Berlanas.  In convicting
accused, the trial court relied on Ancy’s testimony which it found to be “clear
and straightforward.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> Such
positive testimony prevails over accused-appellant’s denial and alibi.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as established at the trial, Ancy Alegre had no
ulterior motive to falsely testify against accused-appellant whom she has never
met prior to the robbery.  Categorical
and consistent positive identification, absent any showing of ill-motive on the
part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over
accused-appellant’s defense of denial and alibi.  Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense
is negative, self-serving and undeserving of any weight in law.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we find no reason to reverse the ruling of the court <i style="">a quo </i>insofar as accused-appellant’s
culpability is concerned.  This brings
us to the propriety of the imposition of the death penalty against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No.
7659, provides that:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 294. <i style="">Robbery with
violence against or intimidation of persons. – Penalties. – </i>Any person
guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any
person shall suffer:</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -27pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The penalty of <i style="">reclusion perpetua </i>to death, when by reason or on occasion of the
robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery
shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson;  xxx.</p>

<p class="BODY">In meting out the supreme penalty of death, the trial court
appreciated the special aggravating circumstance of use of an unlicensed
firearm under Section 1, paragraph 3, of R.A. No. 8294. </p>

<p class="BODY">The imposition of the death penalty is infirm for several
reasons:</p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">First,</i> R.A. No. 8294
took effect on July 6, 1997, fifteen days after its publication on June 21,
1997.  The crime imputed to
accused-appellant was committed on July 11, 1996.  It is fundamental that laws shall have no retroactive effect,
unless the contrary is provided.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> More
importantly, penal laws are construed liberally in favor of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, insofar as R.A. No. 8294 is not beneficial to the accused because it
unduly aggravates the crime, such new law will not be given retroactive
application, lest it acquire the character of an <i style="">ex post facto </i>law.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated differently, R.A. No. 8294, which considers the use of an unlicensed
firearm in the killing of a victim as an aggravating circumstance, cannot be
given retroactive effect because to do so would be unfavorable to the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">Second,</i> inasmuch as the
use of an unlicensed firearm is now considered as a special aggravating
circumstance<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
which would merit the imposition of the supreme penalty of death, the same must
be <i style="">specifically alleged </i>in the
information.  The amended information in
this case alleges, <i style="">inter alia</i>, that –</p>

<blockquote>. . . the above-named accused, all armed with assorted firearms,
conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one
another, with intent to gain and by means of force, violence and intimidation,
did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter the premises of
JTC Pawnshop and once inside robbed the aforesaid pawnshop of assorted
jewelries worth more or less P3,000,000.00; that on the occasion and by reason
of said robbery one of the accused with intent to kill, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot LITA BERLANAS,
vault custodian of said JTC Pawnshop, thereby inflicting upon the latter
gunshot wounds which directly caused her death. xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The use of an unlicensed firearm in the commission of murder or
homicide is a qualifying circumstance. Following the well established rules
pertinent to this issue, the imposition of capital punishment on
accused-appellant is improper absent the <i style="">express
allegation </i>of such qualifying circumstance,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
otherwise it would violate his right to be informed of the nature and cause of
the accusation against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">Third,</i> two (2)
requisites are necessary to establish illegal possession of firearms: first,
the <i style="">existence </i>of the subject firearm;
and second, the fact that the accused who owned or possessed the guns did <i style="">not </i>have the corresponding license or
permit to carry it outside his residence.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Given the prevailing facts of this case, it becomes readily apparent that these
elements are <i style="">absent </i>herein.  With regard to the first element, it must be
noted that the murder weapon was <i style="">never </i>presented
in evidence as it was not confiscated by the police.  There was, therefore, no opportunity to prove that the
accused-appellant used an unlicensed firearm.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">As for the second element, it bears stressing that the essence of
the crime penalized under P.D. No. 1866, as amended, is primarily the accused’s
<i style="">lack </i>of license or permit to carry or
possess the firearm, as possession by itself is not prohibited by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
As such, it is the duty of the prosecution not only to allege it but also to
prove it beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> In
this regard, either the testimony of a representative of or a certification
from the Philippine National Police Firearms and Explosives Office attesting
that a person is not a licensee of any firearm would suffice to prove beyond
reasonable doubt the second element.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
There, likewise, has been no such proof to show the existence of such element
herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the generic aggravating circumstance of <i style="">cuadrilla</i> (band) can not be appreciated
in this case.  An offense is deemed to
have been committed by a band where more than three armed malefactors acted together
in the commission thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> As
stated, the prosecution failed to establish with certainty that all the
perpetrators of the robbery, numbering four, were armed as no such weapons were
presented in evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, the
proper imposable penalty is <i style="">reclusion
perpetua, </i>the lower of the two indivisible penalties.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the appealed decision
of the Regional Trial Court of Marikina City, Branch 272, finding
accused-appellant Arnold Narciso guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Robbery with Homicide and ordering him to pay the amount of P50,000.00 as civil
indemnity to the heirs of the deceased, Lita Berlanas, and  the amount of Three Million Five Hundred
Sixty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Five Pesos (P3,563,645.00) as actual
damages to Victoria Tuparan, the owner of the JTC Pawnshop, is AFFIRMED with
