				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Consolidated Petitions for Review of 1.) the Decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 49056 dated October 5, 1999, which affirmed with modifications the Order dated September 11, 1998, issued by the SEC En Banc in SEC Case No. 598 and 601, confirming the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement; and 2.) the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated August 17, 2000 which denied the motions for reconsideration filed by the private parties herein, except Masagana Telamart, Inc.<br><br>The antecedent facts of the case, as summarized by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<br><blockquote>"As one traverses Taft Avenue in Pasay City, one will see the Masagana Citimall, a commercial complex owned and managed by the First Landlink Asia Development Corporation (FLADC) (p. 127, 520 and 211, Rollo).&nbsp; It was not long ago when this commercial complex, then unfinished, was threatened with incompletion when its owner found it in financial distress in the amount of P190,000,000.00 for being indebted to the Philippine National Bank (PNB), (pp. 520 and 212, Rollo).&nbsp; That was in 1994 (Ibid.)<br><br>"FLADC was then fully owned by the Tiu Group composed of David S. Tiu, Cely Y. Tiu, Moly Yu Gaw, Belen See Yu, D. Terence Y. Tiu, John Yu and Lourdes C. Tiu (p. 211, Rollo).&nbsp; In order to recover from its floundering finances, the Ong Group composed of Ong Yong, Juanita Tan Ong, Wilson T. Ong, Anna L. Ong, William T. Ong and Julie Ong Alonzo, were invited by the Tius to invest in FLADC (pp. 211 and 520, Rollo).&nbsp; Hence, the execution of a Pre-Subscription Agreement by and between the Tiu and Ong Groups on August 15, 1994 (pp. 211-216, Rollo).<br><br>"By the Pre-Subscription Agreement, both parties agreed to maintain equal shareholdings in FLADC with the Ongs investing cash while the Tius contributing property (pp. 213-214, Rollo).&nbsp; Specifically, the Ongs were to subscribe to 1 million shares of FLADC at a par value of P100.00 per share while the Tius were to subscribe to 549,800 shares more of FLADC at a par value of P100.00 per share over and above their previous subscription of 450,200 shares in order to complete a subscription of 1 million shares (Ibid.). Commensurate to their proposed subscriptions, the Ongs were to pay P100,000,000.00 in cash (p.213, Rollo), while the Tius were to contribute the following properties by way of separate Deeds of Assignments:<br><br>“1. A four-storey building described in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15587 registered in the name of Intraland Resources and Development Corporation (a corporation wholly owned by the Tius) and valued at P20,000,000.00;<br><br>"2.&nbsp; A 1,902.30 square meter parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15587 in the name of Masagana Telamart, Inc. (also a corporation owned by the Tius) and valued at P30,000,000.00; and<br><br>"3.&nbsp; A 151 square meter parcel of land adjacent to the properties covered by Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 132493 and 132494 and valued at P4,980,000.00 (pp. 212 and 214, Rollo).<br><br>“Also for purposes of equality, the parties agreed that 6 directors of FLADC were to be nominated from the Ong Group, while 5 directors thereof were to be nominated from the Tiu Group (p. 213, Rollo).&nbsp; It was also agreed that the positions of President and Secretary of FLADC shall be held by the Ongs, while the positions of Vice-President and Treasurer thereof shall be held by the Tius (Ibid.).<br><br>"In order to liquidate FLADC's outstanding P190,000,000.00 loan from the PNB, the parties to the Pre-Subscription Agreement proposed payment thereof with the P100,000,000.00 cash to be invested by the Ongs to FLADC and with the available funds of FLADC derived from:<br><br>“1. Reimbursement of costs of improvements received from tenants on the spaces leased to them;<br><br>“2. Receipts from reservations to lease; and<br><br>“3. Receipts for deposit or advance rentals from tenants (pp. 213-214, Rollo).<br><br>"In order to comply with the Pre-Subscription Agreement, the necessary increase in capital stock of FLADC was applied for and duly approved (pp. 184-187, Rollo).&nbsp; The Ongs subscribed to 1 million shares thereof at a par value of P100.00 per share, or P100,000,000.00 (p. 185, Rollo).&nbsp; Intraland Resources and Development Corporation executed the requisite Deed of Assignment over a 4-storey building it owned in favor of FLADC and was duly credited with 200,000 shares therefor in FLADC (Ibid; pp. 837-838, Rollo).<br><br>"Masagana Telamart, Inc. executed a Deed of Assignment over the 1,902.30 square meter property in favor of FLADC and delivered the owner's copy of the transfer certificate of title of the same as well as the possession thereof to the latter (pp. 221-226, Rollo).&nbsp; Title over the 151 square meter property was also transferred in the name of FLADC (pp. 1062-1063, Rollo).<br><br>"FLADC's articles of incorporation were also duly amended increasing the number of its directors from seven (7) to eleven (11), six (6) of which were nominated by the Ong Group, while the rest were nominated by the Tiu Group (pp. 188-189, Rollo).&nbsp; Later, Wilson T. Ong and Juanita Tan Ong were elected President and Secretary, respectively, while David S. Tiu and Cely Yao Tiu were elected Vice-President and Treasurer, respectively (pp. 191-192, Rollo)<br><br>"The P190,000,000.00 loan from the PNB was also settled, but not quite in accord with the provisions of the Pre-Subscription Agreement (pp.437-441, Rollo).&nbsp; In lieu of the FLADC funds which were supposed to be used as partial payment for said loan per Pre-Subscription Agreement, the Ongs had to pay P70,000,000.00 more aside from their P100,000,000.00 subscription payment, and the Tius had to advance P20,000,000.00 in cash, which amount was loaned to them by the former (Ibid.).<br><br>"The controversy between the two parties arose when the Ongs refused to credit the number of FLADC shares in the name of Masagana Telamart, Inc. commensurate to its 1,902.30 square meter property contribution; also when they refused to credit the number of FLADC shares in favor of the Tius commensurate to their 151 square meter property contribution; and when David S. Tiu and Cely Y. Tiu were proscribed from assuming and performing their duties as Vice-President and Treasurer, respectively of FLADC (pp. 132-136, Rollo).&nbsp; These became the basis of the Tius' unilateral rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement on February 23, 1996 (p. 867, rollo)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>On February 27, 1996, the Tius sought the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmation of their rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement.&nbsp; Their complaint was docketed as SEC Case No. 02-96-5269.<br><br>On May 19, 1997, after the Tiu Group, Masagana Telamart, Inc., Intraland Resources and Development Corporation, the Ong Group and FLADC were heard on their respective claims regarding the propriety of the Pre-Subscription Agreement's rescission, SEC Hearing Officer Rolando G. Andaya, Jr., rendered a decision thereon confirming the rescission as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered confirming the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, and consequently ordering:<br><br><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“(a)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The cancellation of the 1,000,000 shares subscription of the individual defendants in FLADC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">FLADC to pay the amount of P170,000,000.00 to the individual defendants representing the return of their contribution for 1,000,000 shares of FLADC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(c) </td> <td><div align="justify">The plaintiffs to submit with the Securities and Exchange Commission amended articles of incorporation of FLADC to conform with this decision;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(d)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The defendants to surrender to the plaintiffs TCT Nos. 132493, 132494, 134066 (formerly 15587), 135325 and 134204 and any other title or deed in the name of FLADC, failing in which said titles are declared void;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(e)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The Register of Deeds to issue new certificates of titles in favor of the plaintiffs and to cancel the annotation of the Pre-Subscription Agreement dated 15 August 1994 on TCT No. 134066 (formerly 15587).</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(f) </td> <td><div align="justify">The individual defendants, individually and collectively, their agents and representatives, to desist from exercising or performing any and all acts pertaining to stockholder, director or officer of FLADC or in any manner intervene in the management and affairs of FLADC;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(g) </td> <td><div align="justify">The individual defendants, jointly and severally, to return to FLADC interest payment in the amount of P8,866,669.00 and all interest payments as well as any payments on principal received from the P70,000,000.00 inexistent loan, plus the legal rate of interest thereon from the date of their receipt of such payment, until fully paid;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(h) </td> <td><div align="justify">The plaintiff David Tiu to pay individual defendants the sum of P20,000,000.00 representing his loan from said defendants plus legal interest from the date of receipt of such amount.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On motion of the Ong Group, the aforequoted decision was later partially reconsidered in an omnibus order issued by SEC Hearing Officer Manolito S.

On September 11, 1998, the SEC en banc issued an order, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered CONFIRMING the omnibus Order dated 24 November 1997 insofar as it confirms the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement and REVERSING the same insofar as it held that the seventy million (P70 M) paid by the Ong Group over and above the par value of the one million (1,000,000) shares of stocks of FLADC which they had subscribed as loan and not premium.<br><br>“Accordingly,<br><br><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“1.</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The subscription contract entered into by the Ong group and the corporation is hereby declared rescinded, the latter is ordered to cancel the one million (1,000,000) shares subscription of the Ong Group in FLADC, and FLADC shall return the amount of one hundred and seventy million pesos (P170 M) to the Ong Group;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“2.</td> <td> <div align="justify">The Tiu Group shall pay the twenty million pesos&nbsp;

The question is who between the contending parties may avail of the alternative remedies when both of them violated the provisions of the contract, their Pre-Subscription Agreement.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also found that the Ongs were indeed preventing the Tius from assuming the duties and responsibilities of the position of Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC.&nbsp; The Ongs also violated the Pre-subscription agreement when they did not credit to Masagana Telamart, Inc. the number of shares in FLADC commensurate to its property contribution (1,902.30 sq. m.), despite the execution by the Tius of the Deed of Assignment over said property.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also stated that the records also reveal the following violations on the Tius' part: 1.) While there is, on record, a Deed of Assignment over the 151 sq. m. parcel of land in favor of FLADC, said Deed was not executed by the Tius in favor of FLADC but by the Lichaucos; and 2.) the Tius did not turn over to the Ong Group the entire amount of FLADC's funds in violation of the Pre-Subscription Agreement which stipulated that the former grants to the latter, the management and administration of the regular business of FLADC upon the agreement's execution.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also found that the Tius were diverting rentals due to FLADC into their own MATTERCO account which rentals appear to have not been remitted to FLADC up to now.&nbsp; Considering the foregoing, the Court of Appeals concluded that the two groups can no longer work harmoniously together and deemed it proper to confirm the rescission and for the Ongs and the Tius to liquidate FLADC in accordance with their respective cash and property contribution.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also resolved the question of the nature of the P70 M paid by the Ongs in excess of 1 million shares they acquired from FLADC, ruling that the same is an advance made by the Ongs in favor of FLADC, and not a premium or paid-in surplus on the actual value of 1 million shares, and that no interest thereon may be awarded as there is no evidence on record which shows that at the time the P70M was advanced to FLADC, the parties agreed that the same shall earn interest.<br><br>On August 17, 2000, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution which denied the private parties' motions for reconsideration.<br><br>The Ong Group and the Tiu Group both filed their respective petitions for review subject of these consolidated cases.<br><br>Except for the fourth assigned error in the Ongs' petition (G.R. No. 144476) and sub-paragraphs (vi) and (vii) of the second assigned error in the Tius’ petition (G.R. No. 144629), which are well taken, We find both petitions to be without merit.<br><br>In their Petition, docketed as G.R.

An obligation is a juridical necessity to give, to do or not to do.<br><br>"Art. 1159. Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith."</blockquote>and that should there be any violation, those who failed to fulfill their obligations should be required to perform their obligations under the agreement.<br><br>Contrary to the Ongs' assertion, the Songcuan case does not apply squarely to this case.&nbsp; In the Songcuan case, this Court ruled that Art. 1191 to rescind the right of the Alviars to repurchase does not apply because their corresponding obligations can hardly be called reciprocal because the obligation of the Alviars to lease to Songcuan the subject premise arises only after the latter had reconveyed the realties to them.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the instant case, the obligations of the two (2) groups to pay 50% of the increased capital stock of FLADC and to install them as members of the Board of Directors and to certain corporate positions are simultaneous and arise upon the execution of the pre-subscription agreement.<br><br>The Ongs illustrate reciprocity in the following manner: In a contract of sale, the correlative duty of the obligation of the seller to deliver the property is the obligation of the buyer to pay the agreed price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the correlative obligation of the Tius to let the Ongs have and exercise the functions of the positions of President and Secretary is the obligation of the Ongs to let the Tius have and exercise the functions of Vice-President and Treasurer.&nbsp; In this regard, the Court of Appeals aptly stated, and we quote:<br><blockquote>"It cannot be denied that the Pre-Subscription Agreement contains reciprocal obligations owing to the fact that the parties thereto agreed to maintain parity not only in their shareholdings in FLADC but also with regard to their standing in FLADC (pp. 214, 662, 708-710, 715-716, 1914, Rollo).&nbsp; In fine, each party has the obligation to remain equal with the other on every matter pertaining to FLADC.&nbsp; Herein lies the reciprocity in the Pre-Subscription Agreement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, the Ongs are now estopped from denying the applicability of Art. 1191 to the present controversy.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution dated August 17, 2000, which denied the Ongs' motion for reconsideration:<br><blockquote>"Petitioners keep on harping for the Pre-Subscription Agreement's specific performance yet they also actually failed to give a legal basis therefor.&nbsp; Why then must they deny that the Tiu Group has a right to ask for rescission of their agreement per Article 1191 of the Civil Code (pp. 1141-1145, Rollo) when they themselves invoke the same law as basis for asking the specific performance of the same agreement (pp.1156-1159, Rollo)”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>In paragraph (b) of the first assigned error, the Ongs allege that rescission is not applicable when "rights" over the subject matter of the rescission have been acquired by third persons.&nbsp; The Ongs refer to Arts. 1191 and 1385.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Ongs argue that the payment on subscription of P100 million by the Ongs is not to the Tius and the payment of P54.98 million by the Tius is not to the Ongs, but to FLADC, the corporation, which is distinct and separate from the Ongs and the Tius notwithstanding the fact that they may be the only stockholders.&nbsp; Pursuant to Arts. 1191 and 1385, continue the Ongs, the payment made by the two (2) groups have come to be legally owned and possessed by FLADC, the corporation, a third person, who did not act in bad faith.&nbsp; So that any alleged violation of the Pre-Subscription Agreement would have no consequence on the respective amounts paid by the two (2) groups on their subscription to FLADC, a third party.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>The reliance of the Ongs on Article 1385 is misplaced.&nbsp; We agree with the Tius that the things which are the object of the Pre-Subscription Agreement – one million shares of stock subscribed to by the Ong Group, the additional 549,800 shares subscribed to by the Tius, and the corporate positions mentioned above – are not in the possession of third persons, but are in the possession of the parties to the Pre-Subscription Agreement.&nbsp; In any case, FLADC is not a third person in relation to the Pre-Subscription Agreement though not named as a party.&nbsp; FLADC is deemed a party to the agreement by virtue of stipulations pour autrie clearly and deliberately conferring on it a favor or benefit which it subsequently accepted.&nbsp; (Art. 1311, Civil Code)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Such benefit was in the form of the payments made by the parties for their subscription to shares of stock in FLADC, which FLADC accepted.<br><br>In paragraph (c) of the first assigned error, the Ongs allege that rescission is only applicable in case of substantial and fundamental breach.&nbsp; The Ongs contend that the substantial and fundamental aspects of the Pre-Subscription Agreement between the two (2) groups are their commitment to subscribe to their respective numbers of shares and to pay corresponding amount thereof.&nbsp; The Ongs say that they have accomplished their part but not the Tius; and that their alleged breach of the agreement in their alleged failure to provide adequate offices to David Tiu as Vice-President and Cely Yao Tiu, as Treasurer, is hardly substantial and fundamental because stockholders become Vice-President or Treasurer of a corporation by election, not by virtue of office facilities he/she may have been provided.<br><br>The Ongs' contention is without merit.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that what makes a stockholder an officer of a corporation is not simply the fact of his election but, more important, his ability to perform the powers and functions of that office.&nbsp; As will be discussed in the next assigned error, the Ongs indeed prevented the Tius from exercising the powers and functions of their office.&nbsp; We rule, therefore, that such breach of the agreement on the part of the Ongs is substantial and fundamental.<br><br>On the second assigned error, the Court of Appeals did not err in finding that the Ongs violated the "Pre-Subscription Agreement"&nbsp; (a.) when it prevented the Tius from assuming the duties and responsibilities of the Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC by not providing them with adequate offices, and (b.) when it did not credit Masagana with 300,000 shares corresponding to the value of its 1,902.30 sq. m. property contribution.<br><br>On paragraph (a), this Court takes exception to the phrase "by not providing them with adequate offices." This is not the only reason but only one of the reasons cited by the Court of Appeals in concluding that the Ongs violated the pre-subscription agreement when they prevented the Tius from assuming the duties and responsibilities of the Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC.&nbsp; The discussion made by the Court of Appeals on this point is correct, very clear and enlightening, and we quote:<br><blockquote>"A reading of the records, which to date comprises more than 2,100 pages, reveal that the Ongs were indeed preventing the Tius from assuming the duties and responsibilities of the position of Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC.&nbsp; This is highlighted by the fact that the Ongs' attempt to provide David S. Tiu and Cely Y. Tiu with executive offices before the filing of the complaint <i>a quo</i>, was merely half-hearted as evidenced by the delay in providing for said offices despite repeated demands therefor (pp. 844-845, 862-868, 877-878, 895-896, 999-1000, Rollo), and by the need to pass a board resolution when none is necessary in order to provide executive offices for the FLADC President and his staff (pp. 936-937, Rollo).&nbsp; Another fact which shows that the Tius were being prevented from assuming their responsibilities is the criminal case for theft filed by the Ongs against David S. Tiu (pp. 856-859, Rollo).&nbsp; Why must there be a need for the Tius to act surreptitiously in order to have a copy of&nbsp; FLADC's records made if they were not actively being prevented from inspecting the same?&nbsp; Anyway, for all intents and purposes, the Ongs admit that they were preventing the Tius from assuming the responsibilities of Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC.&nbsp; This was made via their reply to the Tiu's letter rescinding the Pre-Subscription Agreement, which in part reads:<br><blockquote>'As to your contention that the ONG GROUP has failed to accord you, the elected Vice-President of FLADC, and your wife, the elected treasurer of FLADC, the powers vested in you by the by-laws, allow me to remind you that in accordance with the Pre-Subscription Agreement, ‘the First Party (TIU GROUP) hereby grants to the Second Part (ONG GROUP) the management and administration of the regular business of the corporation upon the execution of this documents (sic).’ Notwithstanding this fact, the ONG GROUP has always made you a co-signatory to the bank accounts of the corporation; however, to the great prejudice and damage of the corporation you have, more often than not, either purposely delayed or refused to affix your signature to checks in payment for the valid obligations of the corporation.&nbsp; Moreover, from the start, the corporation has given your wife, who is the Treasurer of FLADC, a space in our office but she has seldom come to hold office there.&nbsp; Despite this, we have already acceded to your demand that your wife be given <u><b>a room in lieu of the space provided for her.</b></u>&nbsp; Furthermore, pursuant to the by-laws, both the Vice-President and the Treasurer are to perform duties which may be assigned to them by the Board of Directors and/or the President.&nbsp; (p. 2049, Rollo; underscoring supplied)'</blockquote>"The Pre-Subscription Agreement provides that the position of Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC shall be nominated from the Tiu Group (p. 213, Rollo).&nbsp; Despite the provision in the agreement turning over the management and administration of FLADC to the Ong Group (p. 215, Rollo), there is nothing in the agreement which states that the elected Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC cannot or must not be allowed to assume the responsibilities of their respective office.&nbsp; From the tenor of the aforequoted reply to the Tius' letter of rescission, it is evident that the Ongs have reduced the positions of Vice-President and Treasurer of FLADC to mere figure heads."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Appeals did not err in arriving at the same conclusion like the three (3) tribunals below (Hearing Officer Andaya, Hearing Officer Soller and the SEC <i>En Banc</i>), that the Ongs excluded the Tius from the corporation by preventing them from participating in its operation and financial affairs.<br><br>In paragraph (b) of the second assigned error, the Ongs maintain that their group cannot be faulted for not crediting Masagana with 300,000 shares corresponding to the value of its 1,902.30 sq. m. property contribution, because the Deed of Assignment over the said property executed by Masagana in favor of FLADC was patently incomplete (not dated, no instrumental witness signed the Deed and the Acknowledgement was not executed, because the Tius asked that the execution of the document be not completed) and that the necessary documentary stamp taxes, and capital gains and transfer taxes had not been paid, such that FLADC could not process with the SEC the application regarding the exchange of the said property for shares of stock in the corporation.<br><br>The issue boils down to the question of "Who has the obligation to pay the taxes incident to the assignment?"<br><br>We rule that FLADC, the assignee, has the obligation to pay the taxes incident to the assignment.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals did not err in holding that:<br><blockquote>"xxx The provisions on this matter in the Pre-Subscription Agreement is clear that upon&nbsp; the execution of the Deed of Assignment thereon in favor of FLADC, Masagana Telamart, Inc. shall be credited with the number of shares in FLADC commensurate to the value thereof of P30,000,000.00 (see paragraphs 14-15, 17 of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, p. 214, Rollo).&nbsp; Since the Deed of Assignment over this property has already been executed in favor of FLADC, and the owner's duplicate of the title and possession thereof have already been delivered to FLADC (pp. 221-226, 563, Rollo), the Ongs should have credited 300,000 shares of FLADC at a par value of P100.00 per share in the name of Masagana Telamart, Inc.&nbsp; The transfer of the title to said property in FLADC's name is another matter which is governed by the Deed of Assignment itself and not the Pre-Subscription Agreement (pp. 221-222, Rollo)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>The Deed of Assignment stipulates:<br><blockquote>"The ASSIGNEE (FLADC) hereby accepts said assignment and assumes all the obligations of performing <u><b>all</b></u> the terms and conditions including but not limited to, the transfer of the said parcel of land in the name of First Landlink Asia Development Corporation within a reasonable time." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Said stipulation does not enumerate nor exclude any obligation on the part of the assignee for purposes of transferring the property in its name.&nbsp; Instead, the Deed stipulates in simple language "all the obligations of performing all the terms and conditions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">including</span>, but not limited to, the transfer of the said parcel of land in the name of (FLADC)." It imposes no obligation at all on the part of the assignor for purposes of transferring the parcel of land in the name of FLADC.<br><br>In the interpretation of contracts, "if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the liberal meaning of its stipulation shall control." (Art. 1370, Civil Code).&nbsp; Thus, the FLADC should shoulder all obligations, such as taxes, legal fees, notarial fees and expenses of registration, for the conveyance to be registered and the title to the property placed in the name of FLADC.<br><br>If the Ongs find ambiguity in the said stipulation in that the same allegedly does not provide that FLADC would pay for the taxes arising from the assignment, and that it should have been expressly provided in the deed of assignment, such alleged ambiguity can only be resolved against the Ongs for it was their lawyer, the late Atty. John Uy, who prepared the Deed of Assignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Where the provisions of a contract are ambiguous, such ambiguity must be construed against the party who drafted the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>At any rate, the intention of the parties could not have been to impose on Masagana the obligation to pay said taxes.&nbsp; As explained by the Tius in their Comment –<br><blockquote>"xxx for such imposition is not consistent with the fundamental concept of 'equality' on which the Pre-Subscription Agreement is based.&nbsp; If Masagana were to pay the taxes and other expenses for the transfer of its 1,902.30 sq. m. property contribution to FLADC, Masagana would, in effect, be paying more than P30 million, the agreed valuation of the said property contribution, for 300,000 shares of stock in FLADC.&nbsp; Thus, assuming the Ong Group's computation of Masagana's net gain on the assignment is correct, i.e., P14 million, and Masagana were to pay 35% of P14 million (P4.9 million) in taxes for such assignment, in addition to the amount of P570,690.00 in documentary stamp taxes, Masagana would be paying P35,470,690.00 for 300,000 shares of stock&nbsp; in FLADC, instead of only P30 million.&nbsp; This could not have been the intention of the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The Ongs presented as proof that the Tius acknowledged their liability for the payment of the taxes, the following letter-reply dated April 27, 1995 of Mr. David Tiu to Mr. Wilson T. Ong's request for him to remit payment for documentary stamp tax:<br><blockquote>"With respect to your request for the remittance of P570,690.00 representing 1-1/2% of documentary stamps on the assignment of the land with an area of 1,902.30 sq. m. described in TCT No. 134066, we are willing to remit the same after our proposed meeting, together with Atty.

No. 144629.<br><br>On the third assigned error, the Ongs allege that "the Court of Appeals erred in confirming rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement and the liquidation of FLADC&nbsp; 'for practical reasons,' and to prevent 'further squabbles and numerous litigations,' reasons unknown in law." Allegedly, it is an error for the Court of Appeals to order the transfer to the Tiu Group whatever remains of the assets of the FLADC and the management thereof, upon the return to each group of their respective cash and property contribution.&nbsp; The Ongs maintain that the two (2) groups' payment for the shares of stocks belong to the corporation, no longer to the Ongs or Tius; and even if the Ongs and Tius were the only stockholders, they do not have the authority to transfer cash or properties of FLADC to themselves, for that would be misappropriation.&nbsp; The Ongs further cite Sec. 122 of the Corporation Code to support their claim that the order of the Court of Appeals for the return of the parties' contribution (distribution of FLADC assets, in the words of the Ongs) is prohibited, thus:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 122.&nbsp; Corporate Liquidation. - xxx<br><br>"Except by decrease of capital stock and as otherwise allowed by this Code, no corporation shall distribute any of its assets or property except upon lawful dissolution and after payment of all its debts and liabilities."</blockquote>The Ongs also question the order of the Court of Appeals to transfer to the Tius the Masagana Citimall (the asset which would remain after moving out cash and property to the Ongs and Tius), "the corporation's priceless jewel," when it was they who caused the venture to flourish because of their P190 million contribution and their management thereof.<br><br>We find the Ongs' contentions to be without merit.<br><br>The Tius counter, among others, that: "When the Ong Group invested their P170 million for 50% of the shares of FLADC, and loaned Mr. Tiu P20 million to enable FLADC to pay the P190 million PNB loan, the mall leasing business was already in place, and all the Ong Group had to do was continue the administration of the mall already started by the Tiu Group, and oversee the collection of rentals which were supposed to be remitted to the Treasurer, but which the Ong Group refused to do.&nbsp; For the Ong Group to disregard the valuable contributions of the Tiu Group and monopolize the credit for FLADC's success is plain arrogance."<br><br>As discussed in the first assigned error, the Court of Appeals correctly confirmed the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement on the basis of Art. 1191 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; It could have relied on the said provision and nonetheless stood on valid ground.&nbsp; It, however, judiciously took into account the special circumstances of the case and further justified its decision confirming the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement on the basis of its perception that the two groups "can no longer work harmoniously together" and that "to pit them together in the management of FLADC will only result to further squabbles and numerous litigation."<br><br>Moreover, what the Court of Appeals ordered was not corporate liquidation upon lawful dissolution under Sec. 122 of the Corporation Code, as cited by the Ong Group.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals clarified in its Resolution promulgated on August 17, 2000 that "in ordering liquidation, the Court does not mean its dissolution as provided in the Corporation Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The prohibition, therefore, under Section 122 against distribution of assets or properties of the corporation does not apply.<br><br>As a legal consequence of rescission, the order of the Court of Appeals to return the cash and property contribution of the parties is based on law, hence, cannot be considered an act of misappropriation.&nbsp; For how can the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement be implemented without returning to the two groups whatever they delivered to the corporation in accordance with the Agreement?<br><br>With regard to the order of the Court of Appeals transferring to the Tiu Group whatever remains of the assets of FLADC and the management thereof, the same is but an inevitable consequence of the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement.&nbsp; Restoration of the parties to <i>status quo ante</i> dictates that the building constructed on the two (2) existing lots of FLADC, the remaining asset of FLADC, be transferred to the Tiu Group.&nbsp; The <i>status quo ante</i> immediately prior to the execution of the Pre-Subscription Agreement was that the Tius, then wholly owning FLADC, had control and custody over this remaining asset.<br><br>On the fourth assignment of error, we find the same to be well taken.&nbsp; Indeed, the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that: "Since no period was stipulated for the return thereof&nbsp; (the P20 million loan extended to the Tius and the P70 million the Ongs advanced to FLADC), the Court resolves to fix the same upon the finality of this Decision (See Article 1197, Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>).&nbsp; Failure of the Tius to pay the same upon the finality of this decision shall make them liable for legal interests thereon pursuant to Article 2209 of the New Civil Code."<br><br>We agree with the Ongs that since no period was stipulated for the return of the P20 million loan they extended to the Tius, the same should earn 12% interest per annum and the period of payment of interest thereon should reckon from the time of judicial (or extrajudicial) demand, which was, from April 23, 1996, when the Ongs filed their Answer, and not upon the finality of this Decision.<br><br>In <i><b>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and affirmed in <b><i>Gomez vs. Court of Appeals</i></b> (Sept. 21, 2000, G.R.

No. 134972), among other cases, this Court discussed at length the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof in awarding interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages and held that:<br><blockquote>"1. When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded.&nbsp; In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the Civil Code."</blockquote>However, we do not deem it fit that the ruling in Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. should also apply to the P70 million that the Ongs advanced to FLADC.&nbsp; This is because the Ongs themselves, in the Board Resolution (Exhibit "16") that was approved in the meeting of the Board of Directors of FLADC held on June 19, 1996 (during which the Tiu group was absent), authorized payment of 10% interest per annum on the said P70 million.&nbsp; Thus, as to the P70 million, the FLADC should be made to pay only 10% interest per annum and not 12%, the period to be reckoned from June 19, 1996.<br><br>The matter of why the P70 million paid by the Ongs should be adjudged as an advance and not a premium or paid-in surplus shall be taken up in G.R. No. 144629, the petition filed by the Tius.<br><br>On the fifth assigned error, the Ongs allege that the Court of Appeals erred in not ordering the Tius to pay costs and damages to the Ongs for the filing of this baseless and unwarranted suit.&nbsp; Considering all the foregoing which shows that the case filed by the Tius for confirmation of the rescission of the pre-subscription agreement, is meritorious, it is obviously no longer necessary to discuss this issue.<br><br>In their Petition, docketed as G.R.

It is not merely to terminate it and release the parties from further obligations to each other but to abrogate it from the beginning and restore parties to their relative position which they would have occupied had no contract ever been made (<i><b>Ocampo vs. Court of Appeals</b></i>, 233 SCRA 551)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Tius also contend that the liquidation of the profits of FLADC and the distribution thereof to the parties offend the very essence of rescission which merely requires mutual restoration in consonance with the basic principle that when an obligation has been extinguished, it is the duty of the court to require the parties to surrender whatever they may have received from the other so that they may be restored, as far as practicable, to their original situation.&nbsp; In support thereof, the Tius cite the following cases: <i><b>Floro Enterprises, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</b></i>, 249 SCRA 354 [1995], citing <b><i>Agustin vs. Court of Appeals</i></b>, 186 SCRA 375 [1990]; <i><b>Magdalena Estate, Inc. vs. Myrich</b></i>, 71 Phil., 344 [1941]; <b><i>Po Pauco vs. Siguenza, et al.</i></b>, 49 Phil. 404 [1926].<br><br>On the other hand, the Ongs, in their Comment also question the order of the Court of Appeals in its Decision for the rescission and liquidation of FLADC and for the return to the Ongs of their P190 million, and nothing more.&nbsp; The Ongs ask what became of the profits earned and the additional assets acquired by FLADC through the efforts of the Ongs, and the P190 million they invested in FLADC.<br><br>To the above queries of the Ongs, it is precisely for those reasons that the Court of Appeals in its Resolution of August 17, 2000, clarified thus:<br><blockquote>"xxx. While the Court in the case at bench ordered the rescission of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, it did not, however, order restitution of what the parties contributed pursuant thereto.&nbsp; What the Court ordered was the liquidation of FLADC in accordance with the actual amount of investment each party made in FLADC (pp. 18-19 and 24 of Decision; pp. 1045-1046 and 1050, Rollo).&nbsp; Restitution and liquidation are two different things.&nbsp; Liquidation includes both the profits and losses each party derived within the duration of their respective investment (see Sibal, Philippine Legal Encyclopedia, p. 531; Black's Law Dictionary, p. 839; De Leon, The Corporation Code of the Philippines Annotated, 1997 ed., p. 705, citing 16 Fletcher, p. 658).&nbsp; Contrary therefore to Willie Ong's contention that the Ongs will simply receive a return of their money without any fruits or interest, the decision assures them that they (the Ong and Tiu Groups) will have a bountiful return of their respective investments derived from the profits of the corporation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>With regard to the Tius' allegations, the same are without merit.&nbsp; As cited by the Tius themselves, "it is the duty of the court to require the parties to surrender whatever they may have received from the other so that they may be restored, <u>as far as practicable</u>, to their original situation." Restoration of the parties to their relative position which they would have occupied had no contract ever been made is not practicable nor possible because we cannot turn back the hands of time when the mall was only "nearing completion" in 1994, when the mall was not fully tenanted yet and they had an existing loan of P190 million with PNB with an interest of 19% per annum.&nbsp; But the Masagana Citimall is now completely constructed/finished, the P190 million loan fully paid without their having to pay enormous interest, and the Tius cannot deny that the Ongs are partly to be credited for the success of the venture.&nbsp; What the Tius want the Court to order would have been fair and just had there been no fault on their part as would be discussed in the second assigned error, and had they come to Court with clean hands because he who comes to Court must come with clean hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> If, as the Tius espouse, the Court would simply order the return of the P190 million of the Ongs, then, the Tius would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the Ongs.&nbsp; Under the law, no one shall unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another.

As of July 18, 1994, FLADC had already drawn a total amount of P188,254,599.77 from the credit line and was paying interest thereon at the rate of 19.00% per annum or close to P3 Million every month.<br><br>"From the above-mentioned facts, assuming that FLADC would no longer draw on its remaining credit line to complete the building, the following indisputable conclusions may be reached:<br><br>"a. At 19% interest per annum, the interest payments alone for the P188,254,599.77 existing loan of FLADC with the PNB would be equivalent to the following amount:<br><br>P35,768,373.96 on an annual basis;<br>P&nbsp; 8,942,093.49 on a quarterly basis; and<br>P&nbsp; 2,980,697.03 on a monthly basis.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"c. For the same P190 Million loan, and in addition to the above-mentioned interest payments, the semi-annual amortization for the PNB loan would have been P18,825,459.97 per payment and should have been payable as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">April 29, 1996 - initial payment<br>October 29, 1996 - 2<sup>nd</sup> payment<br>April 29, 1997 - 3<sup>rd</sup> payment<br>October 29, 1997 - 4<sup>th</sup> payment<br>April 29, 1998&nbsp; - 5<sup>th</sup> payment<br>October 29, 1998 - 6<sup>th</sup> payment<br>April 29, 1999 - 7<sup>th</sup> payment<br>October 29, 1999 - 8<sup>th</sup> payment<br>April 29, 2000&nbsp; - 9<sup>th</sup> payment<br>October 29, 2000 - final payment<br></div><br>"d. Again, had the Ongs not invested in FLADC in August 1994, then by the time FLADC would have made its initial amortization payment of P18,825,459.97 on April 29, 1996, it would have been paying interest in the total amount of P59,613,940.60 (P2,980,697.03/month x 20 months).<br><br>"Again, even assuming that the mall which FLADC was building was already completed, it was impossible to generate these amounts from the mall operation for that short period of time.<br><br>"e.&nbsp; Clearly, the Tius were constrained to invite a partner to rescue FLADC from its inevitable bankruptcy."</blockquote>With the above illustration of the Ongs, it became incumbent upon the Tius to counter it by showing how it would have been able to generate such income as would enable FLADC to pay interest and loan amortization without P190 million infused by another group.&nbsp; This the Tius failed to do.&nbsp; All the Tius made was their bare allegation that the Mall was already more than 50% tenanted at that time, and was capable of paying the interests and amortization.<br><br>The Tius' claim – that they invited the Ongs to come in as stockholders of FLADC to expand the company's leasing business – does not also appear to be true.&nbsp; Were this the case, they should have used the new capital infusion of the Ongs to purchase adjoining properties and/or erect a new building that could be connected with the existing structure of FLADC. The Ongs put it in the following manner: "A close reading of the Pre-Subscription Agreement belies the claims of the Tius.&nbsp; The reality, as clearly appearing in the said agreement, is that the parties intended to fully liquidate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the P190 million loan of FLADC with PNB so that the company could continue to operate on a clean slate without the need of paying enormous interests.&nbsp; The reason is simple.&nbsp; Since the Tius were not able to attract enough lessees to occupy the Citimall, they knew that they would not be able to raise enough funds to pay its loan with PNB.&nbsp; Thus, the Tius invited the Ongs primarily for two reasons: <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1]</span> to pay off FLADC's obligation with PNB, and <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> to help the Tius fill up the Citimall with new lessees."<br><br>The Court also notes that while it was the Tius who started the corporation, they acquiesced to the arrangement that the President should come from the Ong Group and the Board of Directors shall comprise of six (6) members from the Ongs, and only five (5) from the Tius.&nbsp; If the Tius were not desperate or in financial distress why should they agree to such an arrangement when, as claimed by the Tius, (Petition, p. 74, Rollo, G.R. No. 144629, p. 171), the appraised value of the entire property of FLADC as of 1994 was P420.3 million?&nbsp; If the FLADC had enough funds, why did it have to borrow P70 million from the Ongs to be used in paying the P190 million loan with PNB?&nbsp; Therefore, we also agree with the Court of Appeals when it held that:<br><blockquote>"The Tius, in unilaterally rescinding the Pre-subscription Agreement, are now trying to oust the Ongs from enjoying the fruits of their P190 million investment in FLADC.&nbsp; This is ingratitude at its height, xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>As to sub-paragraph (v.) suffice it to say that none of the two groups may claim that their group's business acumen, hard work, and dedication account for what Masagana Citimall is today because both of the groups contributed money/property and labor thereto.<br><br>As to sub-paragraphs (vi) and (vii), the Court of Appeals indeed erred in finding that the Tiu Group violated the Pre-Subscription Agreement since the deed of assignment over the 151 sq. m. lot was not executed by the Tiu Group but by the Lichaucos in favor of FLADC. Hence, the Tiu Group cannot be credited with the number of shares commensurate to the value of said lot and will not, therefore, be able to equal the Ong Group's one million subscription in FLADC.<br><br>We do not agree with the following discussion of the Court of Appeals on this point:<br><blockquote>"Under the Pre-Subscription Agreement, the Tius were obliged to execute a Deed of Assignment over a 151 square meter parcel of land in favor of FLADC as payment of 49,800 shares thereof at a par value of P100.00 per share (see paragraphs 14, 15 and 17 of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, p. 214, Rollo).&nbsp; While there is on record a Deed of Assignment thereon in favor of FLADC (pp. 308-312, Rollo), said Deed of Assignment was not executed by the Tius in favor of&nbsp; FLADC.&nbsp; The Deed of Assignment was executed by the Lichaucos in favor of FLADC (Ibid).&nbsp; If ever somebody has to be credited with the number of shares commensurate to the value of the 151 square meter property, it will not be the Tius but the Lichaucos.<br><br>"Per the Pre-Subscription Agreement, the 151 square meter property shall be used by the Tius to acquire a number of shares in FLADC in order to equal the 1 million subscription of the Ongs in FLADC (supra).&nbsp; It turned out, however, that the 151 square meter property was acquired by FLADC for a consideration of P900,000.00 (see paragraph 5 of Deed of Assignment, p. 309, Rollo).&nbsp; It will therefore be iniquitous were the Ongs to credit the Tius the number of shares in FLADC commensurate to the value of the 151 square meter property when the Tius did not contribute the same for the purpose of acquiring shares in FLADC.&nbsp; The deed assigning this property to FLADC was executed by the Lichaucos for a consideration which FLADC itself paid.&nbsp; Said deed was executed even before the Pre-Subscription Agreement was entered into between the parties.&nbsp; Consequently, the Tius cannot be credited with the number of shares commensurate to the value of the 151 square meter property and will not therefore be able to equal the Ongs' 1 million subscription in FLADC in accordance with their undertaking in the Pre-Subscription Agreement (see paragraph 14 of Pre-Subscription Agreement, p. 214, Rollo)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>The Tius aver that the direct transfer of the property from the Lichaucos to FLADC did not prejudice the Ongs or FLADC.&nbsp; According to the Tius, what is important is that they obtained title to the 151 sq. m. property in the name of FLADC after the execution of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, and possession thereof has already been turned over to the corporation.&nbsp; Per the Tius, they cannot be denied full credit for such property contribution, without unjustly enriching the Ongs and FLADC which are now exercising control over the said property.<br><br>The Tius make the following explanations:<br><blockquote>"During the brief negotiations that culminated in the execution of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, the Tiu Group informed the Ong Group that as early as March 1994 they had acquired from the Lichauco family another adjoining property consisting of 151 sq. m. which was actually intended for the expansion of the mall.&nbsp; They disclosed to the Ong Group that the Deed of Assignment over the said property was placed in the name of FLADC and was to be directly transferred from the Lichauco family to the corporation.&nbsp; This is precisely the reason why the property was described in the Pre-Subscription Agreement as '[t]he lot under Transfer Certificate No. ______ with an area of 150 sq. m., more or less xxx,' clearly indicating that all that the&nbsp; parties were waiting for, at the time they were discussing the terms of the Pre-Subscription Agreement, was the issuance of the title to the said lot.<br><br>"The Ong Group were (sic) fully aware of the real status of the 151 sq. m. property when they agreed to consider it as one of the property contributions of the Tiu Group in payment for their additional subscription in FLADC."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>The Tius' contentions on this issue are well taken.&nbsp; We do not see why the Lichaucos, and not the Tius, should be credited with the number of shares commensurate to the value of the 151 sq. m. property.&nbsp; The Lichaucos are not parties to the Pre-Subscription Agreement and are not even demanding that they be credited with such shares in exchange for the said property.&nbsp; Just like this property, the 1,902.30 sq. m. parcel of land in the name of Masagana Telamart, Inc. (also a corporation owned by the Tius), was also acquired by the Tius before the execution of the Pre-Subscription Agreement.&nbsp; The fact that the 1,902.30 sq. m. property was acquired by the Tius beforehand does not prejudice the Ongs, as shown by the Ongs' non-objection to crediting the Masagana Telamart, Inc. with the commensurate number of shares, subject only to the Tius' payment of the expenses for the transfer of the title in the name of FLADC.&nbsp; So, too, in the case of the 151 sq. m. property, the fact that the Deed of Assignment between the Lichaucos and the FLADC was executed prior to the execution of the Pre-Subscription Agreement does not prejudice the Ongs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Tius should be credited with 49,800 shares in FLADC for this property contribution, pursuant to the Pre-Subscription Agreement.<br><br>Sub-paragraph (viii) of the second assigned error states that the Tius turned over to the Ong Group the entire amount of FLADC funds mentioned in paragraph 5 of the Pre-Subscription Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Tius have the following explanation: "xxx sometime in August 1994, the total amount of these available funds had not yet been determined.&nbsp; Consequently, in lieu of these funds, which amounted to P5,840,089.12, P1,.30,002.63(sic) of which had been earlier remitted to FLADC, Mr. Tiu paid the same using the P20 million he borrowed from Mr. Ong Yong.&nbsp; Such payment dispensed with the need to remit the said funds to FLADC."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Why should Mr. Tiu pay P20 million if he only needs to remit P5.8 million?<br><br>At any rate, assuming that the Tius' claim on this point, is true, the same is not reason enough to alter the order of the Court of Appeals for the liquidation of FLADC.<br><br>On sub-paragraph (x), the Tius maintain that they never siphoned any rentals due to FLADC to their MATERRCO account.&nbsp; In fact, the Tius continue, the trumped-up criminal charges filed by the Ongs against Mr. and Mrs. Tiu regarding the aforesaid act of siphoning FLADC funds, filed during the pendency of the rescission case with the SEC to harass the Tius, were dismissed by the DOJ in its Resolution dated 15 Feb. 1999.<br><br>The argument fails to persuade.&nbsp; The dismissal of the said criminal case does not necessarily mean that no act of siphoning FLADC funds was committed by the Tius.&nbsp; The following excerpts from the testimony of Mr. David Tiu on cross-examination shows otherwise:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Mr. Tiu, of course, you will admit that during the transition period, you were already operating Masagana Superstore, is that not correct?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, partly we are occupying a portion of the building. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Of course, Masagana Superstore was operated by Matterco, Inc. of which you were the president?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“Q </td> <td><div align="justify">And I understand also that Matterco, Inc. is wholly owned or majority owned by the Tius?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, Ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Is it wholly owned by the Tius?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A</td> <td> <div align="justify">Majority owned.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“Q </td> <td><div align="justify">Mr. Tiu, I am showing to you a rental receipt no. 067 of Mercury Drug Corporation which is a tenant of FLADC.&nbsp; This rental receipt is a receipt of Masagana Superstore operated by Matterco., Inc.

"4," the Ongs' own exhibit, is quite clear that the amount of P170 million was the agreed price for the Ong Group's subscription to one million shares in FLADC representing 50% of the capital stock of the corporation.&nbsp; Exh. "4," reads:<br><blockquote>"Received from Mr. Ong Yong the amount of TWENTY MILLION PESOS (P20,000,000.00) in full payment of the agreed price of ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION PESOS (P170,000,000.00) representing his group's FIFTY PERCENT (50%) share in First Landlink Asia Development Corporation."</blockquote>The Tius explain that the excess payment of P70 million, considering that the par value of the one million shares subscribed by the Ongs was only P100 million, at P100 per share, in corporation law, is called "paid-in surplus" or premium.<br><br>We are not convinced.&nbsp; This issue was very well discussed by the Court of Appeals, and we agree and quote:<br><blockquote>"But the available funds of FLADC were not enough to cover the P90,000,000.00 more needed to pay the PNB loan because all there was of FLADC's funds at the time was P5,840,089.12 (pp. 734-735, Rollo).&nbsp; It was then, therefore, that the Ongs advanced P70,000,000.00 in cash to FLADC while the Tius advanced P20,000,000.00 in cash, an amount they also had to borrow from the Ongs (pp. 437-441, Rollo).<br><br>"The Pre-Subscription Agreement is explicit in its terms - that the Ongs agreed to pay P100,000,000.00 only for 1 million shares in FLADC at a par value of P100.00 per share (p. 211, Rollo).&nbsp; FLADC's application for an increase in capital stock shows that the par value of each of its shares is P100.00 only (pp. 185-186, Rollo).&nbsp; The same application also shows that the Ongs subscribed to 1 million shares of FLADC at a par value of P100.00 per share (Ibid).&nbsp; There is nothing in the application which shows that FLADC's shares are to be sold at a premium or at an amount higher than the stated par value per share (Ibid).<br><br>"The receipt which states that the Ongs paid P170,000,000.00 for a 50% share in FLADC must not be construed to mean that the Ongs paid P170,000,000.00 for one million shares in FLADC, thereby making the P70,000,000.00 thereof a premium or paid-in-surplus on the actual par value of 1 million shares (p. 182, Rollo).&nbsp; To treat the P70,000,000.00 as premium would not only have the effect of modifying the Pre-Subscription Agreement, but would actually novate it (see Article 1291 (1), New civil Code).<br><br>"To allow a novation of the Pre-Subscription Agreement in this manner would negate or contravene the very intention of the parties in entering into the Pre-Subscription Agreement&nbsp; which is to maintain EQUALITY between them.<br><br>"The Tius, in filing the complaint for rescission a quo, rely heavily on the Pre-Subscription Agreement and even emphasized that it was entered into with the intention of maintaining EQUALITY as regards the parties standing in FLADC (pp. 127-136, Rollo).&nbsp; If the Court were to allow the P70,000,000.00 to be classified as premium or paid-in-surplus, then the Tius' theory will altogether crumble.&nbsp; The respective valuation of the properties to be used as payment of the Tius' 1 million share in FLADC which were presented in evidence to prove that said properties are worth more than the agreed value thereof in the Pre-Subscription Agreement, and therefore when added to the P45,020,000.00 paid up capital, are worth more than 1 million shares in FLADC, is of no consequence (pp. 1023-1047-A, Rollo).&nbsp; The same valuations have been made AFTER the Pre-Subscription Agreement was entered into and does not therefore reflect the actual value of the properties at the time the Pre-Subscription Agreement was entered into (p. 1046, Rollo).<br><br>"The Tius also claim that the P70,000,000.00 cannot be treated as an advance because there was no board resolution authorizing FLADC to incur such an obligation (pp. 764-767, Rollo).&nbsp; As pointed out by SEC Hearing Official Soller, the fact that no board resolution was passed allowing FLADC to incur such an obligation is immaterial, it appearing that there was also no board resolution authorizing FLADC to secure a P20,000,000.00 advance from the Tius (p. 367, Rollo).&nbsp; What matters then and now is that the P190,000,000.00 loan from PNB was finally settled in order for FLADC to resume its business without fear of foreclosure of its properties.<br><br>"Besides, at the time the Ongs invested in FLADC, they knew that the same was in financial distress.&nbsp; Why would the Ongs buy the shares of FLADC for 70% more than their actual par value of P100.00 per share, when to do so would not be in consonance with what a prudent man would do under the same circumstances?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>Except for the issue regarding the rate of interest and reckoning period for the payment thereof, and that the Tius should be credited with 49,800 shares of FLADC for their 151 sq. m. lot property contribution, we find no other error in the assailed Decision which was judiciously rendered by the Court of Appeals.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the following <b>MODIFICATIONS:</b> <ol> <li>the P20 million loan extended by the Ongs to the Tius shall earn interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum to be computed from the time of judicial demand which is from April 23, 1996;<br><br></li><li>the P70 million advanced by the Ongs to the FLADC shall earn interest at ten percent (10%) per annum to be computed from the date of the FLADC Board Resolution which is June 19, 1996;
