This was quite evident in her testimony in court where she was allegedly inconsistent and was narrating irrelevant, immaterial and impertinent matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since her credibility as a witness is questionable, her testimony in court must, therefore, not be admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The contention is untenable.<br><br>While it is&nbsp; true that the victim’s mental state is not normal, such handicap does not automatically render the victim disqualified from testifying about the facts she knew as long as she was capable of perceiving and making her perception known to others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> A mental retardate is not, by reason of such handicap alone, disqualified from being a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, when a witness takes the stand to testify, the law, on grounds of public policy, presumes that he is competent unless shown to be otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the instant case, the defense did not present evidence showing that the victim was incompetent at the time she was presented as a witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused-appellant did not pose any objection&nbsp; when&nbsp; the victim was offered as a&nbsp; witness.&nbsp; In fact, the counsel for the accused-appellant even&nbsp; had the opportunity to cross-examine the victim.<br><br>The victim was consistent and firm in her answers on direct and cross-examination. Except for minor details as to the time and place of the commission of rape, the alleged inconsistencies in her testimony are not enough to impair her credibility.&nbsp; To every question asked, the victim gave straightforward and forthright answers which to the mind of the trial court was credible and worthy of belief.&nbsp; Considering that the trial court was in a better position to observe the demeanor of the witness during the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we, therefore, do not find any error on the part of the trial court in admitting the testimony of the victim.<br><br>On the witness stand, the victim positively identified the accused-appellant as the man who raped her on April 28, 1995.&nbsp; On direct examination, the victim testified:<br><blockquote>State Prosecutor Barrios:<br><br>Q.

What do you mean by "Hymen is moderately thick and distensible?"<br><br>A.
