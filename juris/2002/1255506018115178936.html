				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant’s claim that he cannot be convicted of two counts of rape on the basis of an information that charged only one count is negated by the plain fact that he pleaded guilty to two separate though identically worded Informations bearing different case numbers.&nbsp; Furthermore, his counsel cross- examined complainant on these two separate charges.&nbsp; In his own testimony, appellant also denied committing either of the two acts of rape.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Statement of the Case</b></u><br></div><br>Alberto Gonzales Jr. appeals the August 5, 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Mateo, Rizal (Branch 76) in Criminal Case Nos. 3514 and 3515,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape.&nbsp; The RTC disposed of the cases as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: <ol> <li>In Crim.

As she went out of the store, appellant, a next-door neighbor, waved to her, asking her to come near.&nbsp; She went near him and he asked her to massage him.&nbsp; She said that she would have to ask permission first from Mama Ti. Appellant told her not to ask permission anymore as Mama Ti might get angry.&nbsp; Appellant was known to Maria as she sometimes took care of his four-year old son, Paulo.<br><br>“Appellant brought Maria to his house which was just beside the house of Maria’s employer.&nbsp; Appellant turned off the lights in his room and when Maria asked him why it was dark inside his room, he told her that it was really like that.&nbsp; Appellant then removed his shirt and handed an Omega painkiller bottle to Maria and asked her to start the massage.&nbsp; Maria started to massage appellant’s back but after a few minutes, appellant pushed her down on the floor.&nbsp; He removed her clothing and covered her mouth with his right hand.&nbsp; He threatened her that he would cut off her head if she shouted.&nbsp; While appellant was removing Maria’s T-shirt, she was elbowing him away but he proved too strong for her.&nbsp; Also, she was afraid that he would box her.&nbsp; Appellant then went on top of Maria and inserted his penis into her vagina. Maria felt pain so that she moved her body.&nbsp; She felt something hot (like urine) come out from appellant.<br><br>“Maria wanted to stand up and escape but was unable to do so because appellant was still on top of her, holding her hands.&nbsp; Then, he again inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; When appellant released her hands, she was able to stand up and r[u]n outside the room.&nbsp; She wore her shorts and T-shirt at the sala, then opened the door to the kitchen and ran outside.&nbsp; She jumped off the fence going to her employer’s house.<br><br>“Regino Bravo, a neighbor, saw Maria running down the stairs to where she lived about 12:30 after x x x midnight.&nbsp; He noticed she was crying and was pale and trembling.&nbsp; She did not respond to him when he greeted her.<br><br>“It was only the following day that Maria’s employer learned of the incident.&nbsp; Alma Legaspi, who was also Maria’s employer (Mariel’s sister), was informed by their mother about 10 o’clock in the evening to check on their housemaid who was not feeling well the whole day.&nbsp; She found Maria lying on the bed covered with a blanket.&nbsp; She did not respond to her inquiries as to what was wrong.&nbsp; She kept on crying and mumbling that her head would be cut off.&nbsp; After sometime, Maria, who had difficulty speaking in Tagalog, was able to reveal that appellant raped her, ‘nagalaw siya’ by their neighbor, Alberto Gonzales, Jr.&nbsp; Alma called her elder sister, Mariel Caboteja, and told her what happened.&nbsp; Maria told them that appellant raped her twice.<br><br>“They reported the matter to the Marikina police but they were told it was not within their jurisdiction. They called up the San Mateo police station and two (2) police officers came.&nbsp; Appellant was summoned and they were brought to the barangay hall where Maria pointed to appellant as the one who raped her. They then proceeded to the police station of San Mateo, Rizal to file the complaint.<br><br>“The doctor who examined Maria, Dr. Tomas D. Suguitan, is a Medico-Legal Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, Quezon City.&nbsp; He conducted the examination on January 28, 1998 upon the request of the San Mateo Police station.&nbsp; His finding, reduced in Medico-Legal Report No. M-228-98 (Exh. ‘C’ Rec. p. 8) has the following entries: ‘. . . On separating the same disclosed an abrade posterior fourchette and an elastic hymen with shallow healed lacerations at 3, 6 and 8 o’clock positions.’ Dr. Suguitan concluded that the findings are compatible with the recent loss of virginity.&nbsp; He also opined that the injuries were inflicted less than five (5) days from date of examination and consistent with the injuries caused by insertion of a blunt object, like a penis, into the vagina.<br><br>“Police Officer Ronaldo San Diego, who investigated Maria, prepared two statements.&nbsp; In the first statement, he was not able to state that Maria was raped twice so that Maria made handwritten insertions on the left margin.&nbsp; San Diego retyped the statement to reflect the corrections.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Version of the Defense</i></u><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant presents the following version of the facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>“On November 24, 1998, the defense commenced presentation of its evidence with the accused- appellant, ALBERTO GONZALES, Jr., taking the witness stand. He DENIED having raped MARIA ANUB and recalled that at about 9:30 in the evening of January 26, 1998, his three (3) friends Josefino ‘Matt[‘] del Mundo, Yayo Dinero and Jaime Reyes, ha[d] a casual drinking meet just outside his house but he just talked to them without drinking.&nbsp; He saw MARIA ANUB passing by and he asked her if she knew how to massage, to which she answered in the affirmative and told him of the fact that she was the one massaging her father; that she promised to massage him later because she would still fix her dishes. At about 11:30 p.m., his drinking friends left, thus, he went inside the house and watched x x x television with his 3-year old son, PAOLO. It was then when the private complainant knocked at his back door and informed him of her intention to massage him to which he declined and told her that it was already late however she insisted so he allowed her to enter his house, which was lighted. She waited while he borrowed the Omega Pain Killer from his next-room mother, who was still awake, thus, he told her about the presence thereat of the private complainant.&nbsp; After massaging him for about 15 to 20 minutes, MARIA ANUB asked permission to leave, hence, he saw her to the door but after he closed it, he noticed that she left her sweatshirt so he called her [and] gave it to her near the door.&nbsp; Thereafter, he switched off the television set and slept with his son.<br><br>“It was already about 12:00 o’clock on January 28, 1998 when he learned from the policemen who went to his house that MARIA ANUB was complaining against him and since then he was placed in detention where his ‘ninang-neighbor,[‘] PRISCILLA ANDRADE visited to him and revealed to him that MARIA ANUB admitted that he did not [abuse] her but she was ordered by his ‘KUYA’ who was a stranger to him, to file the complaint against him.<br><br>“The accused testified that while being massaged he was lying down on bed, with his T-shirt raised up to his neck. He drew a sketch of the place showing the relative positions of the houses of the private complainant, REGINO BRAVO, his sister[,] the Regaspi’s store and his own, as well as the streets going down the houses and the interior of his house as EXHIBIT ‘4’ with submarkings.&nbsp; He identified his ‘GANTING SALAYSAY’ as EXHIBIT ‘5’ to 5-a’.<br><br>“On cross examination, the accused explained that this [sic] mother was already bedridden for almost two months prior to the incident; that he and ‘Helen’, his sister’s housemaid, jointly took care of her; that his wife was not at the house in [the] time of the rape; that he did not sexually molest the complainant.&nbsp; He recalled that he was about three weeks in detention cell and he submitted his COUNTER-AFFI[D]AVIT when PRISCILLA ANDRADE told him about the admission to her of MARIA ANUB that he did not rape her.&nbsp; He clarified that his GANTING SALAYSAY or EXHIBIT ‘5’ was based on his originally handwritten account of the incident while he was already in jail, which he gave to his lawyer.<br><br>“On re-direct examination, accused clarified that at about 11:30 p.m., of January 26, 1998, when he entered his room and turned on the television, his son was awakened, hence, both of them watched it until the private complainant came, then the boy slept again; that all the time, he kept the door of the room of his bedridden mother [open[ so he could always see her, even while the private complainant was massaging him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>The RTC ruled that plain denial by appellant could not relieve him of liability for the rapes charged.&nbsp; It gave more weight and credence to the positive assertions of the victim that she had been raped twice on that fateful night by appellant.&nbsp; It also noted that, other than her desire to see her ravisher punished, she had no motive whatsoever to testify falsely against him.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant raises the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“I<br></div><br>The lower court erred in convicting the accused-appellant of two (2) counts of rape in an Information which alleged a single rape.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“II<br></div><br>The lower court erred in not acquitting the accused-appellant [of] the imputed two (2) counts of rape, despite the material incons[i]stencies in private compl[a]inant’s&nbsp; statements/testimony, with contradiction from her witnesses and the requisite resistance to the attributed rape.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>First Issue:</b></u></div><div style="text-align: center;"><u style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Defective Information</i></u><br></div><br>Appellant claims that he cannot be convicted of two counts of rape, considering that the Information filed against him alleged a single offense.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, the records show that four Informations were lodged against him: two original (both dated February 26, 1998) and two amended ones (both dated April 6, 1998).&nbsp; The original Informations were identically worded, but they bore two separate numbers: Criminal Case Nos. 3514 and 3515.&nbsp; The amended Informations, both bearing these docket numbers, were similarly worded and basically the same as the two original ones, except for the change of complainant’s age from 15 to 16 years.<br><br><i>Second</i>, two Orders of the trial court, specifically those of March 19, 1998 and April 2, 1998, clearly indicated that more than one charge of rape had been filed against him.

Thus, he cannot claim to be unaware that he was being charged with two counts of rape.<br><br>The two original&nbsp; Informations were amended because of the late presentation by complainant of the certified true copy of her Birth Certificate issued by the National Census and Statistics Office. It was only on April 2, 1998, almost a month after the prosecution had filed the original Informations, when she furnished those copies showing that she was really 16, not 15, years old.&nbsp; Thus, to conform with the evidence, a Motion with Leave of Court to Amend and Admit Attached Amended Informations was filed by the assistant provincial prosecutor, pursuant to Section 14 of Rule 110 of Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, appellant’s counsel did not interpose any objection to this Motion.&nbsp; Hence, the lower court granted the relief prayed for via its April 22, 1998 Order which we reproduce hereunder:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“<u>ORDER</u><br></div><br>“As prayed for by Public Prosecutor Florante R.
