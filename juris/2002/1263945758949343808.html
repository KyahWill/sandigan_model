<p>Before us is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>assailing the 5 
November 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the 18 
August 2000 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of 
Appeals in CA G.R. CV No. 52848. The former affirmed the 5 June 1995 and 7 
September 1995 Orders of the Regional Trial Court, Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 21, 
in Civil Case No. 526-M-93, and the latter denied petitioner’s motion for 
reconsideration. </p>
<p>The case at bar stemmed from the petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for consolidation of title or ownership 
filed on 5 July 1993 with the trial court by herein respondent Rodrigo V. Ramos 
(hereafter RAMOS) against herein petitioners, Spouses Silvestre and Celia 
Pascual (hereafter the PASCUALs). In his petition, RAMOS alleged that on 3 June 
1987, for and in consideration of P150,000, the PASCUALs executed in his favor a 
Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase over two parcels of land and the 
improvements thereon located in Bambang, Bulacan, Bulacan, covered by Transfer 
Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 305626 of the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan. This 
document was annotated at the back of the title. The PASCUALs did not exercise 
their right to repurchase the property within the stipulated one-year period; 
hence, RAMOS prayed that the title or ownership over the subject parcels of land 
and improvements thereon be consolidated in his favor.</p>
<p>In their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the PASCUALs 
admitted having signed the Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase for a 
consideration of P150,000 but averred that what the parties had actually agreed 
upon and entered into was a real estate mortgage. They further alleged that 
there was no agreement limiting the period within which to exercise the right to 
repurchase and that they had even overpaid RAMOS. Furthermore, they interposed 
the following defenses: (a) the trial court had no jurisdiction over the subject 
or nature of the petition; (b) RAMOS had no legal capacity to sue; (c) the cause 
of action, if any, was barred by the statute of limitations; (d) the petition 
stated no cause of action; (e) the claim or demand set forth in RAMOS’s pleading 
had been paid, waived, abandoned, or otherwise extinguished; and (f) RAMOS has 
not complied with the required confrontation and conciliation before the 
barangay. </p>
<p>By way of counterclaim, the PASCUALs prayed that RAMOS be ordered to execute 
a Deed of Cancellation, Release or Discharge of the Deed of Absolute Sale with 
Right to Repurchase or a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage; deliver to them the 
owner’s duplicate of TCT No. T-305626; return the amount they had overpaid; and 
pay each of them moral damages and exemplary damages in the amounts of P200,000 
and P50,000, respectively, plus attorney’s fees of P100,000; appearance fee of 
P1,500 per hearing; litigation expenses; and costs of suit. </p>
<p>After the pre-trial, the trial court issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> wherein it identified the following 
issues: (1) whether the Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase is an 
absolute sale or a mere mortgage; (2) whether the PASCUALs have paid or overpaid 
the principal obligation; (3) whether the ownership over the parcel of land may 
be consolidated in favor of RAMOS; and (4) whether damages may be awarded. </p>
<p>Among the documents offered in evidence by RAMOS during the trial on the 
merits was a document denominated as <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> signed by RAMOS and Silvestre Pascual, but 
not notarized. The contents of the document read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ako, si SILVESTRE PASCUAL, Filipino, nasa hustong gulang, may asawa at

<ol class="style2"><li>Na ngayong June 3, 1987 dahil sa aking matinding pangangailangan ng puhunan 
ay lumapit ako at nakiusap kay Rodrigo Ramos ng Taal, Pulilan, Bulacan na 
pautangin ako ng halagang P150,000.00. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Na aming napagkasunduan na ang nasabing utang ay babayaran ko ng tubo ng 
seven percent (7%) o P10,500.00 isang buwan (7% per month). 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Na bilang sangla (collateral security) sa aking utang, kami ay nagkasundo na 
mag-execute ng Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase para sa aking bahay at lupa

at binigyan ako ni Mr. Ramos ng isang taon hanggang June 3, 1988 upang mabiling 
muli ang aking isinanla sa kaniya sa kasunduang babayaran kong lahat ang capital 
na P150,000.00 pati na ang P10,500.00 na tubo buwan buwan. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Na bilang karagdagang condition, si RODRIGO RAMOS ay pumayag sa aking 
kahilingan na kung sakali na hindi ko mabayaran ng buo ang aking pagkakautang 
(Principal plus interest) sa loob ng isang taon mula ngayon, ang nakasanglang 
bahay at lupa ay hindi muna niya iilitin (foreclose) o ipalilipat sa pangalan 
niya at hindi muna kami paaalisin sa tinitirhan naming bahay hanggat ang tubo 
(interest) na P10,500.00 ay nababayaran ko buwan buwan.

</li><li>Na ako ay sumasang-ayon sa kundisyon ni Rodrigo Ramos na pagkatapos ng isang 
taon mula ngayon hanggang June 3, 1988 at puro interest lamang ang aking 
naibabayad buwan-buwan, kung sakaling hindi ako makabayad ng tubo for six (6) 
consecutive months (1/2 year after June 3, 1988 (6 na buwang hindi bayad ang

kapangyarihan na mag-mayari ng aming bahay at lupa at kami ng aking pamilya ay 
kusang loob na aalis sa nasabing bahay at lupa na lumalabas na ibinenta ko sa 
kaniya dahil hindi ako nakasunod sa aming mga pinagkasunduang usapan. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>At bilang finale ng aming kasunduan, ako ay nangangako na hindi maghahabol

<p>For their part, the PASCUALs presented documentary evidence consisting of 
acknowledgment receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to prove the 
payments they had made. </p>
<p>The trial court found that the transaction between the parties was actually a 
loan in the amount of P150,000, the payment of which was secured by a mortgage 
of the property covered by TCT No. 305626. It also found that the PASCUALs had 
made payments in the total sum of P344,000, and that with interest at 7% per 
annum, the PASCUALs had overpaid the loan by P141,500. Accordingly, in its 
Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of 15 March 1995 the trial 
court decreed as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants and against 
the plaintiff in the following manner: </p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Dismissing the plaintiff’s petition; 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Directing the Register of Deeds to cancel the annotation of the Deed of Sale 
with Right to Repurchase on the dorsal side of TCT No. 305626; 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Awarding the defendants the sum of P141,500.00 as overpayment on the loan 
and interests; 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>Granting the defendants attorney’s fee in the sum of P15,000.00 and 
P3,000.00 for litigation expenses. </li></ol>
<p></p>With costs against the plaintiff. 
<p>RAMOS moved for the reconsideration of the decision, alleging that the trial 
court erred in using an interest rate of 7% per annum in the computation of the 
total amount of obligation because what was expressly stipulated in the 
<em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em> was 7% per month. The total interest due from 3 
June 1987 to 3 April 1995 was P987,000. Deducting therefrom the interest 
payments made in the sum of P344,000, the amount of P643,000 was still due as 
interest. Adding the latter to the principal sum of P150,000, the total amount 
due from the PASCUALs as of 3 April 1995 was P793,000. </p>
<p>Finding merit in the motion for reconsideration, which was not opposed by the 
PASCUALs, the trial court issued on 5 June 1995 an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> modifying its decision by deleting the 
award of P141,500 to the PASCUALs as overpayment of the loan and interest and 
ordering them to pay RAMOS P511,000 representing the principal loan plus 
interest. The trial court acknowledged that it had inadvertently declared the 
interest rate to be 7% per annum when, in fact, the <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em> 
stipulated 7% per month. It noted that during trial, the PASCUALs never disputed 
the stipulated interest rate. However, the court declared that the 7% per month 
interest is too burdensome and onerous. Invoking the protective mantle of 
Article 24 of the Civil Code, which mandates the courts to be vigilant for the 
protection of a party at a disadvantage due to his moral dependence, ignorance, 
indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, the trial court 
unilaterally reduced the interest rate from 7% per month to 5% per month. Thus, 
the interest due from 3 June 1987 to 3 April 1995 was P705,000. Deducting 
therefrom the payments made by the PASCUALs in the amount of P344,000, the net 
interest due was P361,000. Adding thereto the loan principal of P150,000, the 
total amount due from the PASCUALs was P511,000. </p>
<p>Aggrieved by the modification of the decision, the PASCUALs filed a motion to 
reconsider the Order of 5 June 1995. They alleged that the motion for 
reconsideration filed by RAMOS was a mere scrap of paper because they received a 
copy of said motion only a day before the hearing, in violation of the 
3-day-notice rule. Moreover, they had already paid the interests and had in fact 
overpaid the principal sum of P150,000. Besides, RAMOS, being an individual, 
could not charge more than 1% interest per month or 12% per annum; and, the 
interest of either 5% or 7% a month is exorbitant, unconscionable, unreasonable, 
usurious and inequitable. </p>
<p>RAMOS opposed the motion of the PASCUALs. He contended that the 
non-compliance with the 3-day-notice rule was cured when the trial court gave 
them an opportunity to file their opposition, but despite the lapse of the 
period given them, no opposition was filed. It is not correct to say that he was 
not allowed to collect more than 1% per month interest considering that with the 
moratorium on the Usury Law, the allowable interest is that agreed upon by the 
parties. In the absence of any evidence that there was fraud, force or undue 
influence exerted upon the PASCUALs when they entered into the transaction in 
question, their agreement embodied in the <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em> should be 
respected. Furthermore, the trial court had already reduced the interest rate to 
5% per month, a rate which is not exorbitant, unconscionable, unreasonable and 
inequitable. </p>
<p>Their motion for reconsideration having been denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of 7 September 1995, the PASCUALs 
seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals. They pointed out that since the 
only prayer of RAMOS in his petition was to have the title or ownership over the 
subject land and the improvements thereon consolidated in his favor and he did 
not have any prayer for general relief, the trial court had no basis in ordering 
them to pay him the sum of P511,000. </p>
<p>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of 5 November 
1999, the Court of Appeals affirmed in toto the trial court’s Orders of 5 June 
1995 and 7 September 1995. It ruled that while RAMOS’s petition for 
consolidation of title or ownership did not include a prayer for the payment of 
the balance of the petitioners’ obligation and a prayer for general relief, the 
issue of whether there was still a balance from the amount loaned was deemed to 
have been raised in the pleadings by virtue of Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules 
of Court, which provides that “[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are 
tried with the express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated 
in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” In the course of 
the trial, receipts were presented by the PASCUALs evidencing the payments they 
had made. Taken in conjunction with the <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em> which 
specified the interest rate at 7% per month, a mathematical computation readily 
leads to the conclusion that there is still a balance due from the PASCUALs, 
even at a reduced interest rate of 5% interest per month. </p>
<p>With the denial of their motion for reconsideration of the decision by the 
Court of Appeals, the PASCUALs filed before us the instant petition raising the 
sole issue of whether they are liable for 5% interest per month from 3 June 1987 
to 3 April 1995. Invoking this Court’s ruling in Medel v. Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> they argue that the 5% per month interest 
is excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable and exorbitant. Moreover, respondent 
should not be allowed to collect interest of more than 1% per month because he 
tried to hide the real transaction between the parties by imposing upon them to 
sign a Deed of Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase. </p>
<p>For his part, RAMOS contends that the issue raised by petitioners cannot be 
entertained anymore because it was neither raised in the complaint nor 
ventilated during the trial. In any case, there was nothing illegal on the rate 
of interest agreed upon by the parties, since the ceilings on interest rates 
prescribed under the Usury Law had expressly been removed, and hence parties are 
left freely at their discretion to agree on any rate of interest. Moreover, 
there was no scheme to hide a usurious transaction. RAMOS then prays that the 
challenged decision and resolution be affirmed and that petitioners be further 
ordered to pay legal interest on the interest due from the time it was demanded. 
</p>
<p>We see at once the proclivity of the PASCUALs to change theory almost every 
step of the case. </p>
<p>By invoking the decision in Medel v. Court of Appeals, the PASCUALs are 
actually raising as issue the validity of the stipulated interest rate. It must 
be stressed that they never raised as a defense or as basis for their 
counterclaim the nullity of the stipulated interest. While overpayment was 
alleged in the Answer, no ultimate facts which constituted the basis of the 
overpayment was alleged. In their pre-trial brief, the PASCUALs made a long list 
of issues, but not one of them touched on the validity of the stipulated 
interest rate. Their own evidence clearly shows that they have agreed on, and 
have in fact paid interest at, the rate of 7% per month. Exhibits “1” to “8” 
specifically mentioned that the payments made were for the interest due on the 
P150,000 loan of the PASCUALs. In the course of the trial, the PASCUALs never 
put in issue the validity of the stipulated interest rate. </p>
<p>After the trial court sustained petitioners’ claim that their agreement with 
RAMOS was actually a loan with real estate mortgage, the PASCUALs should not be 
allowed to turn their back on the stipulation in that agreement to pay interest 
at the rate of 7% per month. The PASCUALs should accept not only the favorable 
aspect of the court’s declaration that the document is actually an equitable 
mortgage but also the necessary consequence of such declaration, that is, that 
interest on the loan as stipulated by the parties in that same document should 
be paid. Besides, when RAMOS moved for a reconsideration of the 15 March 1995 
Decision of the trial court pointing out that the interest rate to be used 
should be 7% per month, the PASCUALs never lifted a finger to oppose the claim. 
Admittedly, in their Motion for Reconsideration of the Order of 5 June 1995, the 
PASCUALs argued that the interest rate, whether it be 5% or 7%, is exorbitant, 
unconscionable, unreasonable, usurious and inequitable. However, in their 
Appellants’ Brief, the only argument raised by the PASCUALs was that RAMOS’s 
petition did not contain a prayer for general relief and, hence, the trial court 
had no basis for ordering them to pay RAMOS P511,000 representing the principal 
and unpaid interest. It was only in their motion for the reconsideration of the 
decision of the Court of Appeals that the PASCUALs made an issue of the interest 
rate and prayed for its reduction to 12% per annum. </p>
<p>In <em>Manila Bay Club Corp. v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> this Court ruled that if an issue is 
raised only in the motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Court of 
Appeals, the effect is that it is as if it was never duly raised in that court 
at all. </p>
<p>Our ruling in <em>Medel v. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> is not applicable to the present case. In 
that case, the excessiveness of the stipulated interest at the rate of 5.5 % per 
month was put in issue by the defendants in the Answer. Moreover, in addition to 
the interest, the debtors were also required, as per stipulation in the 
promissory note, to pay service charge of 2% per annum and a penalty charge of 
1% per month plus attorney’s fee of equivalent to 25% of the amount due. In the 
case at bar, there is no other stipulation for the payment of an extra amount 
except interest on the principal loan. Thus, taken in conjunction with the 
stipulated service charge and penalty, the interest rate of 5.5% in the Medel 
case was found to be excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable, exorbitant and 
hence, contrary to morals, thereby making such stipulation null and void. </p>
<p>Considering the variance in the factual circumstances of the <em>Medel</em> 
case and the instant case, we are not prepared to apply the former lest it be 
construed that we can strike down anytime interest rates agreed upon by parties 
in a loan transaction. </p>
<p>It is a basic principle in civil law that parties are bound by the 
stipulations in the contracts voluntarily entered into by them. Parties are free 
to stipulate terms and conditions which they deem convenient provided they are 
not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p>The interest rate of 7% per month was voluntarily agreed upon by RAMOS and 
the PASCUALs. There is nothing from the records and, in fact, there is no 
allegation showing that petitioners were victims of fraud when they entered into 
the agreement with RAMOS. Neither is there a showing that in their contractual 
relations with RAMOS, the PASCUALs were at a disadvantage on account of their 
moral dependence, ignorance, mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, 
which would entitle them to the vigilant protection of the courts as mandated by 
Article 24 of the Civil Code. Apropos in our ruling in Vales vs. Villa: </p>
<p>All men are presumed to be sane and normal and subject to be moved by 
substantially the same motives. When of age and sane, they must take care of 
themselves. In their relations with others in the business of life, wits, sense, 
intelligence, training, ability and judgment meet and clash and contest, 
sometimes with gain and advantage to all, sometimes to a few only, with loss and 
injury to others. In these contests men must depend upon themselves – upon their 
own abilities, talents, training, sense, acumen, judgment. The fact that one may 
be worsted by another, of itself, furnishes no cause of complaint. One man 
cannot complain because another is more able, or better trained, or has better 
sense or judgment than he has; and when the two meet on a fair field the 
inferior cannot murmur if the battle goes against him. The law furnishes no 
protection to the inferior simply because he is inferior, any more than it 
protects the strong because he is strong. The law furnishes protection to both 
alike – to one no more or less than to the other. It makes no distinction 
between the wise and the foolish, the great and the small, the strong and the 
weak. The foolish may lose all they have to the wise; but that does not mean 
that the law will give it back to them again. Courts cannot follow one every 
step of his life and extricate him from bad bargains, protect him from unwise 
investments, relieve him from one-sided contracts, or annul the effects of 
foolish acts. Courts cannot constitute themselves guardians of persons who are 
not legally incompetent. Courts operate not because one person has been defeated 
or overcome by another, but because he has been defeated or overcome illegally. 
Men may do foolish things, make ridiculous contracts, use miserable judgment, 
and lose money by then – indeed, all they have in the world; but not for that 
alone can the law intervene and restore. There must be, in addition, a violation 
of law, the commission of what the law knows as an actionable wrong, before the 
courts are authorized to lay hold of the situation and remedy it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p>
<p>With the suspension of the Usury Law and the removal of interest ceiling, the 
parties are free to stipulate the interest to be imposed on loans. Absent any 
evidence of fraud, undue influence, or any vice of consent exercised by RAMOS on 
the PASCUALs, the interest agreed upon is binding upon them. This Court is not 
in a position to impose upon parties contractual stipulations different from 
what they have agreed upon. As declared in the decision of <em>Cuizon v. Court 
of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the province of the court to alter a contract by construction or to 
make a new contract for the parties; its duty is confined to the interpretation 
of the one which they have made for themselves without regard to its wisdom or 
folly as the court cannot supply material stipulations or read into the contract 
words which it does not contain. </p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, we cannot supplant the interest rate, which was reduced to 5% per month 
without opposition on the part of RAMOS. </p>
<p>We are not persuaded by the argument of the PASCUALs that since RAMOS tried 
to hide the real transaction by imposing upon them the execution of a Deed of 
Absolute Sale with Right to Repurchase, he should not be allowed to collect more 
than 1% per month interest. It is undisputed that simultaneous with the 
execution of the said deed was the execution of the <em>Sinumpaang 
Salaysay</em>, which set forth the true agreement of the parties. The PASCUALs 
cannot then claim that they did not know the real transaction. </p>
<p>RAMOS’s claim that the interest due should earn legal interest cannot be 
acted upon favorably because he did not appeal from the Order of the trial court 
of 5 June 1995, which simply ordered the payment by the PASCUALs of the amount 
of P511,000 without interest thereon. No relief can be granted a party who does 
not appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Therefore, the order of 
the trial court should stand. </p>
<p>Incidentally, we noticed that in the Memorandum filed by RAMOS, the ruling in 
Vales v. Valle was reproduced by his counsel without the proper citation. Such 
act constitutes plagiarism. Atty. Felimon B. Mangahas is hereby warned that a 
repetition of such act shall be dealt with accordingly. </p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> in view of all the foregoing, the petition is
