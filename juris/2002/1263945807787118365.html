<p>An audit examination was conducted on the Municipal Trial 
Court, Guinayangan, 
Quezon pursuant to the Resolution of the Third Division dated August 2, 
2000, 
directing the Court Management Office of the Office of the Court 
Administrator 
(OCA) to immediately conduct a financial audit on Clerk of Court Mrs. 
Elena P. 
Reformado due to non-remittance of Judicial collections.</p>
<p>In their Memorandum dated January 24, 2001, the Audit Team 
reported that upon 
their arrival at the MTC, Guinayangan, Quezon, the Team was informed 
that Clerk 
of Court Reformado was on forced leave although her leave application 
was not 
signed by Judge Designate Manuel G. Salumbides. The Team proceeded to 
the house 
of Ms. Reformado to inform her about the purpose of their travel and to 
require 
her presence in the court for the needed documents, but Ms. Reformado 
was not 
around as she was allegedly in Manila to attend to a member of a family 
who was 
confined in the hospital.</p>
<p>The Team went back to the court to continue with their 
examination of the 
pertinent records/documents involving cash collections/remittances and 
these 
were their findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx the Team was told by the court staff that all 
records/documents involving 
cash collections and remittances are not kept in the Court and that Mrs.
 
Reformado is keeping them at home. The documents surrendered during that
 
instance are the Official Receipts under Series Numbers 12589851 to 
12589900 and 
12589901 to 12589950 being used at present for JDF and General Fund, 
respectively. The said OR’s were left in the custody of Mrs. Fe F. 
Olivera, 
Court Stenographer, whose only responsibility is to issue receipts to 
parties 
but the total collections for the day are being turned-over to Mrs. 
Reformado. 
The Official Receipts used for the collections of Fiduciary Fund were 
being kept 
by Mrs. Reformado.</p>
<p>Based on the official receipts presented, the unremitted cash 
collections at 
the time of the cash count amounted to Two Thousand Ninety Pesos 
(P2,090.00) 
xxx</p>
<p>In order to complete the records and to finalize the audit, the
 Team gave 
them a Checklist of Requirements to be forwarded to the Fiscal 
Monitoring 
Division immediately upon the return of Mrs. 
Reformado.</p></blockquote>
<p>Records will show that the last audit conducted at the 
Municipal Trial Court 
of Guinayangan, Quezon covered the period April 1985 to May 31, 1991 
with then 
Amelita O. Laduan as Clerk of Court and found her cleared of all her 
accountabilities. The audit covering the incumbency of Elena P. 
Reformado was 
confined only to collections/deposits/withdrawals on the Judiciary 
Development 
Fund for the period June 1, 1991 to present as well as the Clerk of 
Court 
General Fund and the Clerk of Court Fiduciary Fund for the period June 
1995 to 
present.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The legal fees being collected by the subject court are the 
following:</p>
<ol><li>Clerk of Court Fiduciary Fund 
<p></p>
</li><li>Clerk of Court General Fund 
<p></p>
</li><li>Judiciary Development Fund 
<p></p></li></ol></blockquote>
<p>Based on the Subsidiary Ledgers of the Accounting Division, 
Financial 
Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, it was found out 
that Mrs. 
Reformado is not submitting her monthly reports of 
collections/deposits/withdrawals for JDF and General Fund since 1997 up 
to the 
present and has not submitted a single report for Fiduciary Fund 
collection.</p>
<p>For the non-submission of her monthly reports, the salaries and
 other 
allowances of Mrs. Reformado are being withheld. One would wonder why 
she was 
able to survive for more than one and a-half years without receiving her
 salary 
and other benefits since May 1999 with children being sent to college 
and a 
husband whose only means of income is the earnings derived from being a 
tricycle 
driver. Why she is also not so anxious to recover her accumulated 
salaries by 
simply complying with all the requirements is a puzzle for us that puts 
her 
character in a cloud of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>Unable to conduct a full audit on the MTC, Guinayangan, Quezon 
because of 
Mrs. Reformado’s absence who had in her possession the other pertinent 
documents, the Financial Audit Team was then instructed by the OCA to 
join the 
other judicial audit team assigned to the Municipal Trial Courts of 
Catanauan, 
General Luna, Lopez, Mulanay and Unisan and in the Municipal Circuit 
Trial 
Courts of San Narciso-Buenavista and San Francisco-San Andres, all 
within the 
Bondoc Peninsula of the Province of Quezon.</p>
<p>With respect to these courts, the Team found the inventory of 
the cash and 
other cash items in order except in the MTC of Catanauan, Quezon. In the
 same 
Memorandum dated January 24, 2001, the following were 
reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Virgilio M. Fortaleza, the Clerk of Court of the MTC, 
Catanauan, Quezon 
was not around when the Team arrived in this Court. Since Mr. Virgilio 
Fortaleza 
was not present at that time, Mrs. Norberta Fortaleza, Court 
Stenographer I, 
assisted them when they demanded that the official receipts and cash on 
hand be 
presented for inventory. It took some time before the cash and other 
cash items 
were given. xxx</p>
<p>The cash presented amounted to P66,800.00 as against the 
unremitted 
collections amounting to P65,170.00 resulted to an overage amounting to 
One 
Thousand Six Hundred Thirty Pesos (P1,630.00). The overage of P1,630.00 
per cash 
count can not as yet be considered as such since the Team had not done 
the 
detailed examination of Mr. Fortaleza’s cashbooks and other related 
documents.</p>
<p>Based on the Subsidiary Ledger of the Accounting Division, 
Financial 
Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, Mr. Fortaleza was 
observant in the submission of Monthly Report of 
Collections/Deposits/Withdrawals for all funds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. Fortaleza was aware that he violated 
Administrative 
Circular No. 5-93 dated April 30, 1993 as amended by Administrative 
Circular No. 
3-2000 dated June 15, 2000, Administrative Circular No. 50-95 dated 
October 11, 
1995 and Chapter 4 Article 1 Section 111 (Vol. 1) of the Government 
Accounting 
and Auditing Manual. Regarding this matter, the Team advised him to 
refrain from 
delaying the deposits/remittance of 
collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, after a week of the surprise audit examination on 
the MTC, 
Guinayangan, Quezon, Ms. Reformado personally appeared before Atty. 
Thelma Bahia 
and Mrs. Verina Yap at the Office of the Court Administrator to explain 
her 
accountabilities. She confessed that she used the money for her personal
 needs 
and promised to restitute whatever amount may be established and to 
submit the 
needed documents as soon as she returned to her station. Per Audit 
Team’s 
assessment, Mrs. Reformado’s total accountabilities for the JDF and 
Clerk of 
Court General Fund amounted to the following:</p>

<p>As
 a result of the aforesaid Report of the Audit Team, the Court issued a 
Resolution dated February 6, 2001 where the Court Resolved to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) NOTE the Memorandum dated 24 January 2001 of Court 
Administrator Alfredo 
L. Benipayo;</p>
<p>(b) RELIEVE immediately Mrs. Elena P. Reformado, Clerk of 
Court, MTC, 
Guinayangan, Quezon, of her duties as Accountable Officer;</p>
<p>(c) DIRECT Judge Manuel G. Salumbides to designate forthwith 
someone from the 
same court to supervise the handling of collections pertaining to the 
Judiciary;</p>
<p>(d) DIRECT Mrs. Reformado to (d-1) RESTITUTE the shortages for 
JDF and Clerk 
of Court General Fund amounting to P66,415.15 and P1,070.04, 
respectively; (d-2) 
SUBMIT the cashbooks, monthly reports and other documents regarding the 
collections, deposits, withdrawals, court orders and acknowledgment 
receipts for 
Fiduciary Fund to fully determine her total accountabilities for said 
fund; and 
(d-3) EXPLAIN why no disciplinary action shall be taken against her for 
her 
failure to submit her monthly reports for JDF and General Fund since 
April 1997 
and for Fiduciary Fund since the start of collection, all within ten 
(10) days) 
days from notice hereof;</p>
<p>(e) DIRECT Mr. Virgilio Fortaleza, Clerk of Court, MTC, 
Catanauan, Quezon, to 
EXPLAIN within ten (10) days from notice why no disciplinary action 
should be 
imposed upon him for keeping in his possession for a long period of time
 the 
money collected pertaining to the Judiciary and for his failure to remit
 the 
same on time; and</p>
<p>(f) ADVISE Clerks of Court/Officers-in-Charge of the MTCs of 
Catanauan, 
General Luna, Lopez, Mulanay and Unisan and the MCTC of San 
Narciso-Buenavista 
and San Francisco-San Andres to follow strictly the Supreme Court 
circulars on 
the proper handling of Judiciary collections.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>In compliance with the above resolution, Mr. Virgilio M. 
Fortaleza, Clerk of 
Court of MTC, Catanauan, Quezon gave his explanation dated March 19, 
2001 which 
was received by the Office of the Court Administrator on March 29, 2001.
 Mr. 
Fortaleza reasoned out that he has been actually remitting his Judiciary
 
collections to the Land Bank of the Philippines, Mulanay Branch, 
Mulanay, 
Quezon, which is about fifteen (15) kilometers away from his station 
since there 
is no Land Bank branch in his town. In order to get there, he would opt 
to use 
his own vehicle as an extra precaution to safeguard his collections. 
While it is 
true that at the time of the financial audit examination in September, 
2000, he 
still had in his possession the Judiciary collections, this was, 
however, not 
for a long time. He explained that he would accumulate the collections 
first 
which were sometimes small, and would remit them to the Land Bank at the
 end of 
the month in order to save time and effort in traveling considering the 
distance, not to mention the rough roads he has to travel.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elena Reformado also submitted her explanation dated March
 15, 2001 
which was received by the OCA on April 25, 2001. She explained that she 
failed 
to remit the fees collected because she used the same to save the life 
of her 
ailing father who eventually died and to shoulder the cost of education 
of her 
three (3) children who are in college and another three (3) in high 
school. She 
asked for additional time to restitute the amount due her as she is 
exhausting 
all possible efforts to raise the money. She added that she was able to 
remit to 
the Supreme Court the amount of P25,000.00 the week after she went to 
see Atty. 
Bahia at the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>On July 23, 2001, Ms. Reformado filed another letter requesting
 for an 
extension of time for the restitution of the amount as she found it 
difficult to 
recover the incurred shortages. At the same time, she prayed for the 
lifting of 
the suspension of her salary which started from August, 1999 up to the 
present 
in order to alleviate her present financial distress.</p>
<p>All these letters/explanations were referred to the OCA for 
evaluation and 
recommendation. Acting on the Memorandum dated October 30, 2001 of the 
OCA, the 
Court issued a Resolution on November 27, 2001, with the following 
actions, to 
wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) NOTE the Memorandum dated 30 October 2001 filed by Deputy 
Court 
Administrator Jose P. Perez in compliance with the resolution of 26 June
 and 10 
July 2001;</p>
<p>(b) DOCKET the report on the financial audit conducted in the 
MTC of 
Guinayangan, Quezon as A.M. No. P-01-1524 (Office of the Court 
Administrator vs. 
Virgilio M. Fortaleza, Clerk of Court, MTC, Catanauan, Quezon and Elena 
P. 
Reformado, Clerk of Court II, MTC, Guinayangan, Quezon);</p>
<p>(c) REPRIMAND Mr. Fortaleza with warning that a repetition of 
the same or 
similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely;</p>
<p>(d) ADVISE Mr. Fortaleza to follow strictly the Supreme Court 
circulars on 
the proper handling of Judiciary collections;</p>
<p>(e) SUSPEND Mrs. Reformado pending resolution of this 
administrative 
matter;</p>
<p>(f) DIRECT Mrs. Reformado to (f-1) fully restitute the 
established shortages 
for the JDF (P66,415.15 - P24,259.00 = P42,156.15) and the General Fund 
(P1,070.04); (f-2) submit to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court 
Management 
Office, OCA, duly validated deposit slip as proof of remittance of the 
amount of 
P24,259.00 to the JDF; and (f-3) submit to the Fiscal Monitoring 
Division the 
necessary documents for the Fiduciary Fund;</p>
<p>(g) GRANT Mrs. Reformado an extension of sixty (60) days from 
notice to 
restitute her shortages as directed in the resolution dated 6 February 
2001; 
and</p>
<p>(h) DIRECT Acting Presiding Judge Manuel B. Salumbides, MTC, 
Guinayangan, 
Quezon, to submit the necessary documents for the reconciliation of the 
Fiduciary Fund and to account all the cases filed in the said court 
involving 
trust liabilities, including consignation and rental deposits, within 
thirty 
(30) days from receipt of notice hereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>In compliance with the aforesaid resolution, particularly 
paragraph (h), the 
Acting Clerk of Court of MTC, Guinayangan, Quezon submitted the 
necessary 
documents for the reconciliation of the Fiduciary Fund including the 
list of 
cases with cash deposits as bailbond together with the undertaking of 
bondsmen 
and the accused. A summary of the list of cases are as

<p>Thus, the following evaluation and recommendation of the 
OCAD:</p>
<p>The list of cases with cash deposits shows that Mrs. 
Reformado’s 
accountability covered the collections from 23 June 1995 to 26 January 
2001 or a 
total of P51,750.00. In addition, a certification by the Office of the 
Municipal 
Treasurer issued on 29 March 2001, duly signed by Adoracion T. Caparros,
 
Municipal Treasurer and Reynaldo F. Molines, Municipal Accountant noted 
that 
there is an existing balance of P23,138.18 in the Account Code of 
Depository 
Liabilities (Bail Bond) under Trust Fund, to wit:</p>

<p>From the data on hand, the cash bond collections deposited with
 the Rural 
Bank of Guinayangan (RBG) amounting to P 10,000.00 and those collections
 
allegedly deposited amounting to P24,000.00, or a total of P34,000.00 
should 
form part of the cash shortage against Mrs. Reformado representing 
unwithdrawn 
fiduciary fund. The final accountability, however, could not be still 
determined 
yet, pending submission by respondent of concrete proofs that her other 
accountabilities representing unwithdrawn fiduciary fund had in fact 
been 
deposited with the proper depository agencies. It is also worthy to note
 that 
some official receipts were not issued sequentially violating internal 
control 
procedure in the collection of cash.</p>
<p>The continuous failure of Mrs. Reformado to restitute her 
shortages, despite 
the extensions given by the Court is a clear indication that she has 
incurred 
cash shortages during the period of her accountability. Neither did she 
offer 
any explanation nor presented evidence that would exculpate her from 
responsibility. Her silence and inaction can be interpreted as defiance 
to the 
directives of the Court, and worse, as admission of her 
liability.</p>
<p>The Court was explicit when it held in the case of Office of 
the Court 
Administrator vs. Atty. Rodrigo B. Galo (A.M. No. P-93-989) that failure
 of a 
Clerk of Court to turn over money deposited with him and to explain and 
present 
evidence thereon constitutes gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and even
 
malversation of public funds for which dismissal from the service with 
forfeiture of all leave credits and of retirement privileges and with 
prejudice 
to reappointment are clearly appropriate. Clearly, Mrs. Reformado should
 be held 
liable.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended 
for 
consideration of the Honorable Court that Mrs. Elena P. Reformado, Clerk
 of 
Court II, MTC, Guinayangan, Quezon be DISMISSED from the service for 
gross 
dishonesty, grave misconduct and malversation of public funds while in 
office 
and that her terminal leave pay as well as her withheld salaries be 
forfeited 
and applied to her accountabilities. Likewise, respondent be declared 
disqualified from reemployment in any branch of the government or in any
 
government-owned or controlled corporations. It is further recommended 
that the 
Legal Office, OCA be directed to file the appropriate criminal charges 
against 
Mrs. Reformado.</p>
<p>We adopt the findings and the recommendation of the 
OCA.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Clerk of Court performs a very delicate function. He or she
 is the 
custodian of the court’s funds and revenues, records, property and 
premises. 
Being the custodian thereof, the clerk of court is liable for any loss, 
shortage, destruction or impairment of said funds and property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Clerks of Court have 
always been reminded 
of their duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them 
to the 
authorized government depositories for they are not supposed to keep 
funds in 
their custody. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 In the <em>Report on 
the Financial Audit in RTC, General Santos City and the RTC &amp; 
MTC of 
Polomok, South Cotabato,</em> the Court emphasized the role of the
 clerk of 
court with regard to the collection of legal fees, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>xxx Clerks of court are the chief administrative officers of 
their respective 
courts; with regard to the collection of legal fees, they perform a 
delicate 
function as judicial officers entrusted with the correct and effective 
implementation of regulations thereon. Even the undue delay in the 
remittances 
of amounts collected by them at the very least constitutes misfeasance. 
On the 
other hand, a vital administrative function of a judge is the effective 
management of his court and this includes control of the conduct of the 
court’s 
ministerial officers. It should be brought home to both that the 
safekeeping of 
funds and collections is essential to the goal of an orderly 
administration of 
justice and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory 
nature of 
the Circulars designed to promote full accountability for government 
funds.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Clerk of Court, Mrs. Reformado is an accountable officer 
entrusted with 
the great responsibility of collecting money belonging to the funds of 
the 
Court. Regrettably, she abused the trust and confidence reposed upon her
 and did 
not perform her duty with utmost loyalty and honesty. Ms. Reformado 
admitted 
that she used the money collected to defray the cost of the 
hospitalization of 
her ailing father who eventually succumbed to death and the cost of 
education of 
her children. Mrs. Reformado’s predicament evokes our sympathy, but her 
situation cannot justify what she has done. The money collected are 
government 
funds. She had no right to use them for her personal needs. Failure of a
 Clerk 
of Court to turn over money deposited with him or her and to explain and
 present 
evidence thereon constitutes gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and even
 
malversation of public funds. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
Nonetheless, the Court had been quite lenient with Mrs. Reformado as she
 was 
given sufficient time to be able to restitute the amount but to no 
avail. It is 
also noted that Mrs. Reformado had constantly violated the Court 
Circulars 
regarding the collection of legal fees which were formulated for the 
proper 
management of funds. Her attention was already called when her salaries 
had been 
withheld for her similar transgression as early as August, 1999 and yet,
 Mrs. 
Reformado still failed to obey the Court’s orders. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Her persistent failure to restitute
 her 
shortages despite the extensions of time given and inaction to the 
Court’s 
directives are inexcusable. This Court cannot tolerate nor condone any 
conduct 
which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish the
 faith 
of the people in the justice system. For those who have fallen short of 
their 
accountabilities, we have not hesitated to impose the ultimate 
penalty.</p>
<p><strong>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</strong> the Court hereby 
orders the 
<strong>DISMISSAL</strong> of respondent Elena P. Reformado,
 Clerk of Court II, 
Municipal Trial Court, Guinayangan, Quezon from the service, for gross 
dishonesty, grave misconduct, and malversation of public funds while in 
office, 
with forfeiture of her terminal leave pay as well as her withheld 
salaries, the 
same to be applied to her accountabilities. Likewise, respondent be 
declared 
disqualified from re-employment in any branch of the government or in 
any 
government-owned or controlled corporations.</p>
