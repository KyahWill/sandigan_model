				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a complaint for disbarment against Atty. Reynaldo Novero,
Jr. for alleged patent and gross neglect in the handling of Civil Case No. 7500
which complainant Rizalino Fernandez and others had filed against the Bacolod
City Water District before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 49, Bacolod City.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his letter,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
dated October 16, 1996, to the Court Administrator, complainant imputed the
following negligent acts to respondent which led to the dismissal of Civil Case
No. 7500:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent did not attend
the scheduled hearing on January 11, 1996 nor seek a postponement thereof, for
which reason the trial court considered respondent to have waived further
presentation of his evidence and directed him to formally offer his exhibits
for admission on January 30, 1996;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding receipt
of the order dated January 11, 1996, respondent failed to formally offer his
exhibits on January 30, 1996, prompting the trial court to order the dismissal
of the case;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While respondent filed a
motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal, he did not file his
motion within the reglementary period, as a result of which the said motion,
actually filed on May 7, 1996, was denied by the trial court on May 14, 1996
for having been filed out of time;</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked for an
explanation regarding the dismissal of the case, respondent informed
complainant through a letter, dated July 30, 1996, that he had filed a motion
for reconsideration of the order of dismissal, but the motion, which had been
filed a long time ago, had not yet been resolved by the trial court;</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent tried to shift
the blame on complainant by claiming that the latter insisted on presenting his
sister from Manila as their last witness. The truth was that complainant’s
sister had already testified and there was no more witness to present; and</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent only attended
one (1) hearing in the civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
dated September 3, 1997, respondent averred that the complaint filed against
him was baseless and was purely malicious and speculative considering the fact
that it was not made under oath.  He
alleged that complainant engaged his legal services after the first counsel had
withdrawn from the case because of a misunderstanding with complainant.  He stated that he had no knowledge of what
had happened in the case before he handled it because complainant did not
furnish him the records and stenographic notes of the previous proceedings
despite his repeated requests.  Respondent further claimed that he failed to formally offer the exhibits
as evidence because complainant could not be reached when he was needed for
conference and the latter even tried to take over the handling of the case by
insisting on presenting more witnesses who nevertheless failed to appear during
trial despite several postponements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was referred to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC),
which submitted a report,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
dated February 3, 2001, finding respondent guilty of violation of the Code of
Professional Responsibility and recommending his suspension from the practice
of law for one (1) month.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of
the Philippines (IBP), which in its report and recommendation, dated October
15, 2001, found respondent remiss in observing the standard care, diligence and
competence prescribed for members of the bar in the performance of their
professional duties.  The IBP
Investigating Commissioner recommended that respondent be suspended from the
practice of law for a period of six (6) months with warning that the commission
of the same or similar offenses will be dealt with more severely in the future.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The report and recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner was approved on
June 29, 2002 by the IBP Board of Governors.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration, dated September
17, 2002, alleging that the Court should not have taken cognizance of the
complaint because it was not verified.  According to him, the complaint was a mere political ploy to discredit
him because he was aspiring for a congressional seat in the 1998
elections.  He denied complainant’s
claim that he attended only one hearing.  He explained that he was not able to terminate his presentation of
evidence because complainant insisted on presenting as witness his sister who
was residing in Manila, even though the latter repeatedly failed to appear in
court despite several postponements.  He
claimed that complainant had told him that his intention was really to delay
the case as he was using the same as his leverage in a criminal case filed or
to be filed against him by the Bacolod City Water District for his alleged
water tapping.  When he refused to go
along with the scheme, complainant allegedly threatened to change counsel.  Respondent further alleged that
complainant’s attitude is apparent from the fact that the latter caused to be
disseminated several copies of the IBP Resolution recommending his
(respondent’s) suspension and distributed them to radio stations in Bacolod
City.  For these reasons, respondent
sought the reversal of the IBP Resolution.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After review of the records of this case, the Court finds the
report of the Investigating Commissioner of the IBP to be well taken.  The records clearly show that respondent has
been negligent in the performance of his duties as complainant’s counsel.  His failure to file his formal offer of
exhibits constitutes inexcusable negligence as it proved fatal to the cause of
his client since it led to the dismissal of the case.  To compound his inefficiency, respondent filed a motion for
reconsideration outside the reglementary period, which was thus accordingly denied
by the trial court for being filed out of time.  Hence, the order issued by the trial court dismissing the case
became final.  Respondent’s acts and
omission clearly constitute violation of the Code of Professional
Responsibility which provides in pertinent parts:</p>

<blockquote>CANON 17. <span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">¾</span></span>
A LAWYER OWES FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT AND HE SHALL BE MINDFUL OF
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CANON 18. <span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">¾</span></span>
A LAWYER SHALL SERVE HIS CLIENT WITH COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rule 18.02 <span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">¾</span></span>
A lawyer shall not handle any legal matter without adequate preparation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rule 18.03 <span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">¾</span></span>
A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence
in connection therewith shall render him liable.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As this Court has held:</p>

<blockquote>A counsel must constantly keep in mind that his actions or
omissions, even malfeasance or nonfeasance, would be binding on his
client.  Verily, a lawyer owes to the
client the exercise of utmost prudence and capability in that
representation.  Lawyers are expected to
be acquainted with the rudiments of law and legal procedure, and anyone who
deals with them has the right to expect not just a good amount of professional
learning and competence but also a whole-hearted fealty to the client’s cause.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent’s attempt to evade responsibility by shifting the
blame on complainant is apparent.  His
averment that complainant failed to turn over to him the records and
stenographic notes of the case only highlights his incompetence and inadequacy
in handling complainant’s case.  Considering that respondent has been practicing law for almost 15 years,
he should have known that he could easily obtain a copy of the records and
stenographic notes from the court where the case was docketed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent likewise refers to the alleged obnoxious attitude of
complainant in trying to manipulate the manner in which he was handling the
case as the main reason for his failure to formally offer his exhibits in
contravention of the order of the court.  But respondent should bear in mind that while a lawyer owes utmost zeal
and devotion to the interest of his client, he also has the responsibility of
employing only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his
client and he should not allow the latter to dictate the procedure in handling
the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court said in another case:</p>

<blockquote>A lawyer owes entire devotion in protecting the interest of his
client, warmth and zeal in the defense of his rights.  He must use all his learning and ability to the end that nothing
can be taken or withheld from his client except in accordance with the
law.  He must present every remedy or
defense within the authority of the law in support of his client’s cause,
regardless of his own personal views.  In the full discharge of his duties to his client, the lawyer should not
be afraid of the possibility that he may displease the judge or the general
public.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the contention of respondent that the Court should not have
taken cognizance of the complaint because the letter-complaint was not
verified, as required in Rule 139-B, §1 of the Rules of Court on Disbarment and
Discipline of Attorneys,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
suffice it to say that such constitutes only a formal defect and does not
affect the jurisdiction of the Court over the subject matter of the complaint.
“The verification is merely a formal requirement intended to secure an assurance
that matters which are alleged are true and correct — the court may simply
order the correction of unverified pleadings or act on it and waive strict
compliance with the rules in order that the ends of justice may be served.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Garamond;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, instead of suspension for six (6) months as recommended
by the IBP Investigating Commissioner, we hold that the suspension of
respondent Atty. Reynaldo Novero, Jr. for one (1) month, as recommended by the
Office of the Bar Confidant, would be commensurate considering that this is the
first time Atty. Novero is found guilty of neglect of his client’s case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, Atty. Reynaldo
Novero, Jr. is SUSPENDED  from the
practice of law for one (1) month effective upon finality hereof with WARNING
that a repetition of the same negligent act charged in this complaint will be
dealt with even more severely.</p>
