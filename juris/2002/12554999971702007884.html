In the brief submitted by the Public Attorneys Office in behalf of accused-appellants Garcia, Rogel and Lariba, they argue that the crime of kidnapping for ransom was not committed since Atty. Tioleco was released from detention by means of the rescue operation conducted by the PACC operatives and the ransom money subsequently recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> &nbsp;They conclude that their criminal liability should only be for slight illegal detention under Art. 268, of The Revised Penal Code. Accused-appellants Rogel and Lariba further assert that they could not be held guilty of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition since neither was in complete control of the firearms and ammunition that were recovered when they were arrested and no evidence was offered to prove responsibility for the presence of firearms and ammunition inside the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The brief filed for accused-appellant Gerry B. Valler asserts the same defense he made at the trial that he was at the De Vega compound only to pay his debts to Jimmy Muit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> &nbsp;arguing that Atty. Tioleco did not have the opportunity to really recognize him so that his identification as the driver of the car was tainted by police suggestion, and that P/Chief Insp. Cruz’ testimony is allegedly replete with inconsistencies that negate his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Encapsulated, the issues herein focun on (a) the “ransom” as element of the crime under Art. 267 of <i>The Revised Penal Code</i>, as amended; (b) the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence to prove kidnapping for ransom; (c) the degree of responsibility of each accused-appellant for kidnapping for ransom; and, (d) the liability for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under RA 8294, amending PD 1866.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i><u>First</u></i>. We do not find any quantum of merit in the contention that kidnapping for ransom is committed only when the victim is released as a result of the payment of ransom. In <i>People v. Salimbago</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> &nbsp;we ruled -</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>No specific form of ransom is required to consummate the felony of kidnapping for ransom so long as it was intended as a bargaining chip in exchange for the victim’s freedom. In municipal criminal law, ransom refers to the money, price or consideration paid or demanded for redemption of a captured person or persons, a payment that releases from captivity. Neither actual demand for nor actual payment of ransom is necessary for the crime to be committed. It is enough if the crime was committed “for the purpose of extorting ransom.” Considering therefore, that the kidnapping was committed for such purpose, it is not necessary that one or any of the four circumstances be present.</blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">So the gist of the crime, as aptly stated in American jurisprudence from which was derived the crime of kidnapping for ransom,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> &nbsp;is “not the forcible or secret confinement, imprisonment, inveiglement, or kidnapping without lawful authority, but x x x the felonious act of so doing with intent to hold for a ransom the person so kidnapped, confined, imprisoned, inveigled, etc.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that once that intent is present, as in the case at bar, kidnapping for ransom is already committed. Any other interpretation of the role of ransom, particularly the one advanced by accused-appellants, is certainly absurd since it ironically penalizes rescue efforts of kidnap victims by law enforcers and in turn rewards kidnappers for the success of police efforts in such rescue operations. Moreover, our jurisprudence is replete with cases, e.g., <i>People v. Chua Huy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> &nbsp;<i>People v. Ocampo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> &nbsp;and <i>People v. Pingol</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> &nbsp;wherein botched ransom payments and effective recovery of the victim did not deter us from finding culpability for kidnapping for ransom.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><u><i>Second</i></u>. Issues of sufficiency of evidence are resolved by reference to findings of the trial court that are entitled to the highest respect on appeal in the absence of any clear and overwhelming showing that the trial court neglected, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance affecting the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> &nbsp;Bearing this elementary principle in mind, we find enough evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the cooperation of all accused- appellants in the kidnapping for ransom of Atty. Tioleco.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Truly incriminating is the judicial confession of accused-appellant Garcia of his participation in the commission of the crime. He admitted that he took part in actually depriving Atty. Tioleco of his liberty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> &nbsp;and in securing the ransom payment from Floriana Tioleco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> &nbsp;He could not have been following mechanically the orders of an alleged mastermind, as he claims, since by his own admission he was neither threatened, forced or intimidated to do so<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> &nbsp;nor mentally impaired to resist the orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> &nbsp;In the absence of evidence to the contrary, he is presumed to be in full possession of his faculties and conscience to resist and not to do evil.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">We cannot also give credence to Garcia’s asseveration that the persons still at large were his co- conspirators. This posture is a crude attempt to muddle the case as discerned by the trial court from his demeanor when he testified -</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>Because he had been caught in flagrante delicto, Roland Garcia admitted his participation in the crime charged. From his testimony, however, there appears a veiled attempt to shield Gerry Valler from conviction. First, Garcia claimed that the car they used was reddish in color (TSN, October 20, 1997, pp. 9, 19 &amp; 20). Then he added that the owner of the car was Jimmy Muit and not Gerry Valler (TSN, October 20, 1997, p. 9). Next, he said that there was no conspiracy and he did not know then Gerry Valler, Rodante Rogel and Rogel Lariba until they were placed together in Camp Crame (Ibid., p. 22). </blockquote> The Court however cannot simply accept this part of his story. To begin with, his repeated reference to the color of the car as reddish is quite suspicious. He conspicuously stressed the color of the car in three (3) instances without being asked.

Tioleco as the driver of the dark blue car used in his abduction (TSN, April 10, 1997, pp. 10-11; and TSN, April 14, 1997, pp. 21-27).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]&nbsp;</sup></blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant Valler’s profession of innocence also deserves no consideration. Various circumstances indubitably link him to the crime. For one, he was positively identified by Atty. Tioleco to be the driver of the dark blue Toyota car used in the abduction on 5 October 1997, which car was seen again twice during the occasions for ransom payment. This was followed by a telephone call made by Valler to the house where Atty. Tioleco was being detained and in fact talked with accused-appellant Rogel to tell him that he was coming over<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> &nbsp;and with accused- appellant Garcia to ask from him about the ransom supposedly earlier collected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> &nbsp;Given the overwhelming picture of his complicity in the crime, this Court cannot accept the defense that he was only trying to pay his debts to Jimmy Muit when he was arrested.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">We find nothing substantive in Valler’s attempt to discredit the victim’s positive identification of him on the trifling observation that Atty. Tioleco was too confused at the time of his abduction to recognize accused-appellant’s physical features accurately. It is truly evident from the testimony of Atty. Tioleco that his vision and composure were not impaired by fear or shock at the time of his abduction and that he had the opportunity to see vividly and remember unerringly Valler’s face -</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Where were these two unidentified men positioned inside the car?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">One of them was at the driver’s seat and the other one was immediately behind the driver’s seat.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Now, could you please describe to this honorable court the person who was seated on the driver’s seat?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">He has a dark complexion, medium built and short hair at that time.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">If you see that person again will you be able to identify him sir?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">And if he’s present in the courtroom will you be able to point to him?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">At this juncture your honor we would like to request with the court’s permission the witness be allowed to step down from the witness stand and approach the person just described and tap him on his shoulder.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT INTERPRETER: Witness stepping down from the witness stand and approached the person he had just described and tapped him on his shoulder and who when asked to identify himself he gave his name as Gerry Valler.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Even on cross-examination, Atty.

Candelario</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> &nbsp;it is the most natural reaction for victims of crimes to strive to remember the faces of their assailants and the manner in which the craven acts are committed. There is no reason to disbelieve Atty. Tioeleco’s claim that he saw the faces of his abductors considering that they brazenly perpetrated the crime in broad daylight without donning masks to hide their faces. Besides, there was ample opportunity for him to discern their features from the time two (2) of his kidnappers approached and forced him into their car and once inside saw the other two (2), including Gerry Valler, long enough to recall them until he was blindfolded.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The victim’s identification of accused-appellant Valler is not any bit prejudiced by his failure to mention Valler’s name in his affidavit. It is well-settled that affidavits are incomplete and inaccurate involving as they do mere passive mention of details anchored entirely on the investigator’s questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> &nbsp;As the victim himself explained -&nbsp;</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: none;"> Now, in Question No. 5 and I quote x x x Why did you not identify here the name of the driver as one Gerry Valler?</span></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td>Because they never asked me the name.

Clearly, positive identification of the accused where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter prevails over his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> &nbsp;When there is no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why a prosecution witness would testify falsely against an accused or falsely implicate him in a heinous crime, the testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Finally, we do not see any merit in Valler’s enumeration of alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of P/Chief Insp. Gilbert Cruz concerning (a) the time and place of meeting between the PACC operatives and Floriana Tioleco; (b) the schedule of the first and second ransom pay-offs; (c) the number of Floriana Tioleco’s companions during the aborted first pay-off; (d) the number of occupants in the blue Toyota car; and, (e) the PACC operatives’ recognition of Floriana Tioleco during the ransom payments. This is an argument that clutches at straws. For one, the purported inconsistencies and discrepancies involve estimations of time or number, hence, the reference thereto by the witness would understandably vary. Furthermore, they are too minor to warrant the reversal of the judgment of conviction. They do not affect the truth of the testimonies of witnesses nor do they discredit their positive identification of accused-appellants. On the contrary, such trivial inconsistencies strengthen rather than diminish the prosecution’s case as they erase suspicion of a rehearsed testimony and negate any misgiving that the same was perjured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">We also do not believe that accused-appellants Rogel and Lariba are innocent bystanders in this case. It taxes the mind to believe Rogel’s defense that as a caretaker of the place where Atty. Tioleco was detained, he observed nothing unusual about this incident. An innocent man would have immediately reported such dastardly act to the authorities and refused to sit idly by, but a guilty person in contrast would have behaved otherwise as Rogel did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant Lariba’s defense is similarly incredible. He joins Gerry Valler in proclaiming that he too was allegedly at the wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong reason of just wanting to tune up the car of Jimmy Muit. But for all these assertions, he failed to produce satisfactory evidence that he was indeed there to repair such car. Of all the days he could have discharged his work, he chose to proceed on 8 October 1997 when the kidnapping was in full swing. There was even no car to repair on the date that he showed up. Like the submission of Rogel, Lariba’s defense falls completely flat for he could have so easily observed the kidnapping of Atty. Tioleco that was taking place in the house of Jimmy Muit.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In sum, accused-appellants cannot rely upon the familiar phrase “reasonable doubt” for their acquittal. As demonstrated by the fastiduous references of Valler to alleged inconsistencies of P/Chief Insp. Cruz, not all possible doubt is reasonable since in the nature of things everything relating to human affairs is open to some imaginary dilemma. As we have said in <i>People v. Ramos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> &nbsp;“it is not such a doubt as any man may start by questioning for the sake of a doubt; nor a doubt suggested or surmised without foundation in facts or testimony, for it is possible always to question any conclusion derived from testimony. Reasonable doubt must arise from the evidence adduced or from the lack of evidence, and it should pertain to the facts constitutive of the crime charged.” Accused-appellants have not shown the presence of such fatal defects in this case. Clearly, all the elements and qualifying circumstances to warrant conviction for the crime of kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention have been established beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i><u>Third</u></i>. We go into the criminal liability of each accused-appellant. There is no doubt that Gerry Valler and Ronald Garcia are principals by direct participation and co-conspirators in the kidnapping for ransom of Atty. Tioleco. Their respective participation in perpetrating the crime cannot be denied. As regards their liability as co-conspirators, we find the same to have also been shown beyond reasonable doubt. Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it for which liability is joint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> &nbsp;Proof of the agreement need not rest on direct evidence as the felonious covenant itself may be inferred from the conduct of the parties before, during, and after the commission of the crime disclosing a common understanding between them relative to its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> &nbsp;The acts of Valler and Garcia in coordinating the abduction, collection of ransom and detention of their victim indubitably prove such conspiracy.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Lariba and Rogel were caught inside the house where Atty.

Tioleco had already been rendered immobile with his eyes blindfolded and his hands handcuffed. No evidence exists that he could have gone elsewhere or escaped. At the precise moment of their apprehension, accused-appellants Lariba and Rogel were unarmed although guns inside one of the rooms of the house were available for their use and possession.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Assessing these established circumstances in the manner most favorable to Lariba and Rogel, we conclude that they were merely guarding the house for the purpose of either helping the other accused-appellants in facilitating the successful denouement to the crime or repelling any attempt to rescue the victim, as shown by the availability of arms and ammunition to them. They thus cooperated in the execution of the offense by previous or simultaneous acts by means of which they aided or facilitated the execution of the crime but without any indispensable act for its accomplishment. Under Art. 18 of <i>The Revised Penal Code</i>, they are mere accomplices.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In <i>People v. De Vera</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> &nbsp;we distinguished a conspirator from an accomplice in this manner -</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>Conspirators and accomplices have one thing in common: they know and agree with the criminal design. Conspirators, however, know the criminal intention because they themselves have decided upon such course of action. Accomplices come to know about it after the principals have reached the decision, and only then do they agree to cooperate in its execution. Conspirators decide that a crime should be committed; accomplices merely concur in it. Accomplices do not decide whether the crime should be committed; they merely assent to the plan and cooperate in its accomplishment. Conspirators are the authors of a crime; accomplices are merely their instruments who perform acts not essential to the perpetration of the offense.</blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In the instant case, we cannot deny knowledge on the part of Lariba and Rogel that Valler and Garcia had kidnapped Atty. Tioleco for the purpose of extorting ransom and their cooperation to pursue such crime. But these facts without more do not make them co-conspirators since knowledge of and participation in the criminal act are also inherent elements of an accomplice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> &nbsp;Further, there is no evidence indubitably proving that Lariba and Rogel themselves participated in the decision to commit the criminal act. As the evidence stands, they were caught just guarding the house for the purpose of either helping the other accused- appellants in facilitating the success of the crime or repelling any attempt to rescue the victim as shown by the availability of arms and ammunition to them. These items contrast starkly with the tried and true facts against Valler and Garcia that point to them as the agents <i>ab initio </i>of the design to kidnap Atty. Tioleco and extort ransom from his family.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Significantly, the crime could have been accomplished even without the participation of Lariba and Rogel. As stated above, the victim had been rendered immobile by Valler and Garcia before the latter established contacts with Floriana Tioleco and demanded ransom. The participation of Lariba and Rogel was thus hardly indispensable. As we have held in <i>Garcia v. CA</i>, “in some exceptional situations, having community of design with the principal does not prevent a malefactor from being regarded as an accomplice if his role in the perpetration of the homicide or murder was, relatively speaking, of a minor character.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> &nbsp;At any rate, where the quantum of proof required to establish conspiracy is lacking and doubt created as to whether the accused acted as principal or accomplice, the balance tips for the milder form of criminal liability of an accomplice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">We are not unaware of the ruling in <i>People v. Licayan</i> that conspiracy can be deduced from the acts of the accused-appellants and their co-accused which show a concerted action and community of interest. By guarding Co and Manaysay and preventing their escape, accused- appellants exhibited not only their knowledge of the criminal design of their co-conspirators but also their participation in its execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> &nbsp;But the instant case is different. Considering the roles played by Lariba and Rogel in the execution of the crime and the state the victim was in during the detention, it cannot be said beyond reasonable doubt that these accused-appellants were in a real sense detaining Atty. Tioleco and preventing his escape. The governing case law is <i>People v. Chua Huy</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> &nbsp;where we ruled -</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>The defendants’ statements to the police discarded, the participation of the other appellants in the crime consisted in guarding the detained men to keep them from escaping. This participation was simultaneous with the commission of the crime if not with its commencement nor previous thereto. As detention is an essential element of the crime charged, as its name, definition and graduation of the penalty therefor imply, the crime was still in being when Lorenzo Uy, Tan Si Kee, Ang Uh Ang, William Hao and Young Kiat took a hand in it. However, we are not satisfied from the circumstances of the case that the help given by these accused was indispensable to the end proposed. Our opinion is that these defendants are responsible as accomplices only.</blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><u><i>Fourth</i></u>. In the beginning, we noted that neither Lariba nor Rogel who were both convicted of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition in Crim.

Hence, before us now are opposing views on how to interpret Section 1 of the new law, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 1. - Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><br>Sec. 1.&nbsp;<i>Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition.</i> - The penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period and a fine of not less than Fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000) shall be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess any low powered firearm, such as rimfire handgun, .380 or .32 and other firearm of similar firepower, part of firearm, ammunition, or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition: Provided, That no other crime was committed.<br><br>The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period and a fine of Thirty thousand pesos (P30,000) shall be imposed if the firearm is classified as high powered firearm which includes those with bores bigger in diameter than .30 caliber and 9 millimeter such as caliber .40, .41, .44, .45 and also lesser calibered firearms but considered powerful such as caliber .357 and caliber .22 centerfire magnum and other firearms with firing capability of full automatic and by burst of two or three: Provided, however, That no other crime was committed by the person arrested.<br><br>If homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<br><br>If the violation of this Section is in furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of rebellion or insurrection, sedition, or attempted coup d’etat, such violation shall be absorbed as an element of the crime of rebellion or insurrection, sedition, or attempted coup d’etat.<br><br>The same penalty shall be imposed upon the owner, president, manager, director or other responsible officer of any public or private firm, company, corporation or entity, who shall willfully or knowingly allow any of the firearms owned by such firm, company, corporation or entity to be used by any person or persons found guilty of violating the provisions of the preceding paragraphs or willfully or knowingly allow any of them to use unlicensed firearms or firearms without any legal authority to be carried outside of their residence in the course of their employment.<br><br>The penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> shall be imposed upon any person who shall carry any licensed firearm outside his residence without legal authority therefor.</blockquote>x x x x&nbsp;A simple reading thereof shows that if an unlicensed firearm is used in the commission of any crime, there can be no separate offense of simple illegal possession of firearms. Hence, if the “other crime” is murder or homicide, illegal possession of firearms becomes merely an aggravating circumstance, not a separate offense. Since direct assault with multiple attempted homicide was committed in this case, appellant can no longer be held liable for illegal possession of firearms.<br><br>Moreover, penal laws are construed liberally in favor of the accused. In this case, the plain meaning of RA 8294’s simple language is most favorable to herein appellant. Verily, no other interpretation is justified, for the language of the new law demonstrates the legislative intent to favor the accused. Accordingly, appellant cannot be convicted of two separate offenses of illegal possession of firearms and direct assault with attempted homicide. Moreover, since the crime committed was direct assault and not homicide or murder, illegal possession of firearms cannot be deemed an aggravating circumstance x x x x The law is clear: the accused can be convicted of simple illegal possession of firearms, provided that “no other crime was committed by the person arrested.” If the intention of the law in the second paragraph were to refer only to homicide and murder, it should have expressly said so, as it did in the third paragraph. Verily, where the law does not distinguish, neither should we.<br><br>The Court is aware that this ruling effectively exonerates accused-appellants x x x of illegal possession of an M-14 rifle, an offense which normally carries a penalty heavier than that for direct assault. While the penalty for the first is prision mayor, for the second, it is only <i>prision correccional</i>. Indeed, an accused may evade conviction for illegal possession of firearms by using such weapons in committing an even lighter offense, like alarm and scandal or slight physical injuries, both of which are punishable by <i>arresto menor</i>. This consequence necessarily arises from the language of RA 8294 the wisdom of which is not subject to review by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> </blockquote><div align="JUSTIFY">Accordingly, we are constrained to dismiss Crim. Case No. Q-96-68049 and set aside the judgment of conviction therein since accused-appellants Rotchel Lariba and Rodante Rogel cannot be held liable for illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions there being another crime - kidnapping for ransom - which they were perpetrating at the same time.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In fine, we affirm the conviction of Gerry Valler and Ronald “Roland” Garcia as principals and Rotchel Lariba and Rodante Rogel as accomplices for the crime of kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention. This Court is compelled to impose the supreme penalty of death on Valler and Garcia as mandated by Art. 267 of <i>The Revised Penal Cod</i>e, as amended by RA 7659.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The penalty imposable on Lariba and Rogel as accomplices is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the penalty one degree lower than that prescribed for the crime committed pursuant to Art. 52 in relation to Art. 61, par. (1), of the Code. We however set aside the judgment in Crim. Case No. Q-96-68049 convicting Lariba and Rogel of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition in light of the foregoing discussion.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">As regards the moral damages against accused-appellants to be paid by them <i>in solidum</i>, we find the amount of P200,000.00 to be reasonable compensation for the ignominy and sufferings Atty. Tioleco and his family endured due to accused-appellants’ inhumane act of detaining him in blindfold and handcuffs and mentally torturing him and his family to raise the ransom money. The fact that they suffered the trauma of mental, physical and psychological ordeal which constitute the bases for moral damages under the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> &nbsp;is too obvious to require still the recital thereof at the trial through the superfluity of a testimonial charade.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Following our finding that only Gerry Valler and Ronald “Roland” Garcia are principals by direct participation and conspirators while Rotchel Lariba and Rodante Rogel are accomplices, we apportion their respective responsibilities for the amount adjudged as moral damages to be paid by them solidarily within their respective class and subsidiarily for the others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> &nbsp;Thus, the principals, accused-appellants Ronald “Roland” Garcia and Gerry Valler, shall pay their victim Atty.

In Crim. Case No. Q-96-68049 (G.R. No. 133489) accused-appellants RONALD “ROLAND” GARCIA y FLORES and GERRY B. VALLER are declared guilty as PRINCIPALS of kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention and are sentenced each to death, while accused-appellants RODANTE ROGEL y ROSALES and ROTCHEL LARIBA y DEMICILLO are convicted as ACCOMPLICES and are ordered to serve the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with the accessories provided by law for the same crime of kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention. Accused-appellants are further ordered to pay moral damages in the amount of P200,000.00, with the principals being solidarily liable for P150,000.00 of this amount and subsidiarily for the civil liability of the accomplices, and the accomplices being solidarily liable for P50,000.00 for moral damages and subsidiarily for the civil liability of the principals.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Finally, in Crim.
