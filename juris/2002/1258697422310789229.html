It submitted:<br><blockquote>“The assessment for deficiency percentage tax (broker’s tax) is based on respondents allegations that the compensation received by petitioner from its Head Office for soliciting orders from Philippine customers should be subject to broker’s tax.&nbsp; We most respectfully disagree with this position.<br><br>“It should be noted that petitioner’s (Nichimen - Manila Branch) act in looking for local buyers is merely liaising for its Head Office.&nbsp; The Head Office then allocates certain amounts to the petitioner (Branch) to cover its operating requirements for the liaising activities it does.&nbsp; The amount allocated to the Branch is considered income attributable to the Branch; this is reported to the Central Bank and converted into Philippine pesos and reported as the Branch’s income in its income tax return.<br><br>“Under the circumstances, the petitioner (Branch Office) cannot be considered receiving income subject to broker’s tax from its own Head Office, in the same manner that a person cannot be considered receiving taxable income from itself.<br><br>“The liaising activities of the Branch is performed for its own Head Office.&nbsp; Hence, it is not an activity that is rendered for another person, but for itself because NICHIMEN (Head Office) and NICHIMEN (Manila Branch) are but one, single entity.<br><br>“A broker is one who acts as a negotiator or middleman to close a deal between one person and another.&nbsp; A broker is necessarily distinct from the party for which he renders service.&nbsp; In a transaction involving a broker there are three (3) separate and distinct entities; the principal, the broker, and the buyer.<br><br>“In the case at bar only two parties are involved NICHIMEN (Head Office) and the Philippine customers, the Manila branch being an integral part of the Head Office.&nbsp; Therefore, there could be no broker/agency transaction in instant case.&nbsp; Accordingly, the amounts received by the Branch from its Head Office cannot be considered commission or brokerage fees subject to broker’s tax.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Respondent Commissioner maintained that the assessment for deficiency percentage tax was based on the findings of the Bureau of Internal Revenue that there were receipts for the fiscal year ended 31 March 1997 which showed that certain sales entered into between Philippine customers and foreign manufacturers resulted from the liaising services rendered by petitioner, and contended that the branch office should thus be considered a commercial broker in accordance with Revenue Audit Memorandum Order No. 1-86, par. 3, subpar. 3.2., to wit:<br><blockquote>“3.&nbsp; Branch Operation and Consequences<br><br>“3.2.&nbsp; The branch solicits purchase orders from local buyers, relays the information to its home office, the home office solicits prospective sellers abroad and eventually received compensation for services rendered.<br><br>“In the second type of operation:&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; the branch shall be considered `a commercial broker’ or indentor; (ii)&nbsp; its share from compensation as allocated by its home office shall be subject to commercial broker gross receipts tax; (iii)&nbsp; the branch shall provide itself with corresponding fixed tax as a commercial broker; and (iv)&nbsp; pay income on its share of the compensation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Tax Appeals, in its decision of 12 September 1996, sustained the Commissioner and held:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition for review is hereby DENIED and petitioner is ORDERED to pay the amount of P767,531.10 as deficiency percentage tax for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1987, inclusive of increments, plus 20% interest per annum from February 1, 1990 until fully paid pursuant to Section 283(c) of the Tax Code.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>The tax court concluded that petitioner had earned commissions from companies other than Nichimen Corporation in Japan and that the compensation it received from the head office represented its share in the commissions received by the head office due to their brokerage activities here and abroad.&nbsp; The commissions received depended on the invoice amounts of import-export transactions.&nbsp; Hence, item 2 of petitioner’s Notes to Financial Statements disclosed:<br><blockquote>“2.&nbsp; COMPENSATIONS RECEIVED FROM HOME OFFICE AND COMMISSIONS<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">“Compensations received from Home Office represent income computed at certain percentages of invoice amounts of import and export transactions in the Philippines of the Home Office and others.<br><br>“Commissions represent income computed at certain percentage of invoice amounts of import and export transactions in the Philippines of certain affiliates of Nichimen Corporation and of other parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></div></blockquote>Ms. Myrna Lou Tabije, one of the examiners who investigated the instant tax case, explained:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Now, according to this report, one of your findings is for deficiency broker’s tax in the amount of P718,851.68.&nbsp;

And another instance wherein the head office orders the branch to look for local products wherein the branch merely monitors the shipping to the importer of these local products.&nbsp; And the documents presented there show that the[y] are merely the agent of the buyer and the seller.&nbsp;

Gison of the Tax Division of SGV &amp; Co., external auditors of the petitioner, let the cat out of the bag, so to speak, when in his letter of August 3, 1989, cited in the challenged CTA decision, he stated, inter alia, that the petitioner is not liable for the deficiency fixed tax `as it is only engaging in business as a broker.’&nbsp; The petitioner never bothered to disown or neutralize this highly damaging admission.&nbsp; Thus, the self-serving testimony of its witness, Kenji Chijinatsu,&nbsp; easily pales upon juxtaposition with the respondent’s evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>On 01 October 1999, Nichimen Corporation (Manila Branch) has filed the instant petition for review by <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Section 174 of the National Internal Revenue Code imposes on commercial brokers a percentage tax equivalent to seven (7%) <i>per centum</i> of the gross compensation received by them.&nbsp; Section 157(t) of the same code defines a commercial broker to include “all persons, other than importers, manufacturers, producers, or <i>bona fide</i> employees, who, for compensation or profit, sell or bring about sales or purchases of merchandise for other persons, or bring proposed buyers and sellers together, or negotiate freights or other business for owners of vessels, or other means of transportation, or for the shippers, or consignors or consignees of freight carried by vessels or other means of transportation.&nbsp; The term includes commission merchant.”<br><br>A broker, in general, is a middleman who acts for others, on a commission, negotiating contracts relative to property with the custody of which he has no concern; he is, in more ways than one, an agent of both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> His task is to bring the parties together and to get them to come to an agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> A basic characteristic of a broker is that he acts not for himself, but for a third person, regardless of whether the fee paid to him is a fixed amount, regular or not, or whether the act performed by him can be performed by the principal or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Strictly, a commission merchant differs from a broker in that he may buy and sell in his own name without having to disclose his “principal,” for which purpose, the goods are placed in his possession and at his disposal, features that are not true in the case of a broker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The commission merchant thus maintains a relation not only with the parties but also with the property subject matter of the transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> A dealer buys and sells for his own account.<br><br>The Court of Tax Appeals and the Court of Appeals both found that the receipts upon which the assessed deficiency broker’s tax had been based were derived from sales consummated between customers in the Philippines and manufacturers abroad, other than petitioner itself; the sales were said to have resulted from the liaising services rendered by its Philippine branch.<br><br>The findings of fact of the Court of Tax Appeals exercising particular expertise on the subject bind this Court, particularly when such findings are affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Given all the foregoing, the Court cannot sustain the position taken by petitioner.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Panganiban, Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Annex A-1, Records, p. 75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Decision, Court of Tax Appeals, 12 September 1996.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Ibid., p. 4; Records, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Annex D, Records, pp. 89-90.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rollo, pp. 69-70.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Records, p. 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Records, p. 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Rollo, p. 46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Rollo, pp. 55-56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Behn, Meyer, and Co.
