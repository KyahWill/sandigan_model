J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The hard day’s work would have been easily gratified with whorish talks with his brothers and a few friends but, as darkness crept in the small and quiet barangay in Agoo, La Union, Danilo Collado was struck dead by accused Samuel Emperador, still now claiming guilelessness. <div align="justify"> <p>The accusatory Information for murder against Samuel Emperador read:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The undersigned Chief Investigator of the Agoo Police Station, Agoo, La Union, after having been first duly sworn to an oath in accordance with law, accuses SAMUEL `SONNY’ EMPERADOR y LOPEZ, alias BANENG, for the crime of MURDER, committed as follows:</p> <p>“That on or about 6:30 P.M. of September 14, 1996, at Barangay San Roque West, Municipality of Agoo, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Trial Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and suddenly attack and stab one DANILO `DANIEL’ COLLADO y BALTAZAR, 48 years old, married, resident of San Roque West, Agoo, La Union, several times, with the use of a hunting knife, inflicting him multiple fatal stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which was the direct cause of his death, to the great damage and prejudice of the family of the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>Arraigned, the accused pled “not guilty” to the charge. When trial ensued, the prosecution called Mario Collado, Benigno Collado and Ligaya Collado, brothers and wife of the victim, respectively, to the witness stand. The medico-legal officer, Dr. Fredesvinda Pacis, testified on the result of her autopsy on Danilo. The defense, during its turn, presented accused Emperador himself, Emelita Lopez and Roberto Miranda. </p> <p>Mario Collado was the first to take the witness stand. He narrated that on the early evening of 14 September 1996, about six-thirty, he and his brothers Danilo and Benigno were seated along the barangay road of San Roque West, Agoo, La Union. Edgardo Emperador, a brother of the accused, was also with them. The group was conversing about a funny incident that involved a common friend, Pito Dacanay, when the accused arrived and poised himself in front of Danilo. Without apparent provocation, he pulled out his blade, a japanese hunting knife or bayonet, from his waist and stabbed Danilo on the chest. Danilo ran but the accused caught up with him. Danilo was thrown to the ground face down and repeatedly stabbed by the accused. When Mario tried to rescue the victim, the accused vent his blows on him. Mario fled with a deep cut on his forearm. He went to the hospital where he later learned that Danny died because of multiple stab wounds. </p> <p>Benigno Collado testified that he was with his brothers, Mario and Danilo, when the stabbing incident happened. He could not understand why the accused would stab his brother Danilo without any provocation. Samuel Emperador came from his left side and surged towards Danilo, striking the latter with his japanese hunting knife. Benigno was horrified and glued to his seat. It was only when Samuel chased Danilo and the accused continued hitting the victim that Benigno came to his senses. He rushed to help Danilo but it was too late. Danilo was already sprawled on the ground. The accused then turned his ire on Benigno. Benigno was able to get away but not before being hit himself by a hacking blow delivered by the accused. </p> <p>Dr. Fredesvinda Pacis, the physician who conducted the autopsy on Danilo, declared that she found five stab wounds on the body and several abrasions on the face, forehead and nose of the deceased. The immediate cause of death was attributed to hypovolemic shock caused by the stab wound on the left ventricle of the heart. When asked whether she could tell, by the nature of the wounds, if the victim was stabbed at close range, she answered in the affirmative. </p> <p>Ligaya Collado testified that the death of her husband Danilo was a great loss to the family. The couple had ten surviving children of school age. When Danilo was alive, he was a farmer and a fisherman. He earned 24 sacks of palay in one year and a weekly income of P500.00 as a fisherman and an additional P300.00 as a farm worker. The family spent a good sum of money - P14,500.00 for the coffin and funeral cost, P500.00 for religious services, P900.00 cost of the tomb and the sum of P18,080.00 for food and other expenses – for her husband’s wake and funeral. The sudden death of her husband also caused extreme pain and suffering to her and the others he left behind. </p> <p>The accused interposed self-defense and claimed that he was drinking in front of his house with Domingo Collado, Benigno Collado, Pito Dacanay and Edgardo Emperador when Danilo arrived boisterously and shouted invectives at him. Danilo kicked a bottle of gin and lunged his scythe to stab the accused. The latter punt the scythe out of Danilo’s hands. Danilo then got hold of a knife that the group had used in slicing their pulutan. He wrestled with Danilo for possession of the knife, and it was while they were grappling that the latter was stabbed. He surmised that if he did not fight back, he could have easily been the one killed. </p> <p>Emelita Lopez, a neighbor, corroborated the version given by the accused. She said that from her window she could see the accused drinking gin with his brother Edgardo, along with Pito, Domingo and Benigno Collado, near her house. Danilo, who was drunk, arrived and threw insults on Samuel. He kicked a bottle of gin and it hit the ankle of Samuel. Pito and Edgardo scampered away from the scene but the Collado brothers remained where they were. Danilo and Samuel soon engaged in a fistfight. Domingo and Benigno picked up a hollow block and threw it at Samuel who was able to evade it. She tried to then pacify Domingo but he told her not to interfere. She backed off when she noticed that he was holding an 8-inch long knife. She saw Danilo running away but bumped himself into a post and collapsed to the ground. </p> <p>Roberto Miranda, the barangay Captain of San Roque West, said that Samuel came to see him on 14 September 1996, between six-thirty to seven-thirty in the evening and said that he was surrendering to the authorities. Miranda called up the police and turned in Samuel who likewise turned over the japanese hunting knife or bayonet. </p> <p>The court <em>a quo</em>, convinced of the case made out at the trial by the prosecution rather than the version proffered by the defense, adjudged the accused guilty of the killing but appreciated the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender, as well as passion and obfuscation, holding thusly-</p> <blockquote> <p>“WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the Honorable Court finds the accused Samuel `Sonny’ Emperador Y Lopez GUILTY of the crime of MURDER beyond reasonable doubt. The accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua together with all its accessory penalties; to indemnify the heirs of the victim for Moral Damages in the amount of P50,000.00 for the death of the victim; P35,000.00 in actual expenses; P60,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and to pay the cost of the proceeding.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>In his appeal to this Court, the convicted accused made the following assignment of errors; to wit: </p> <p align="center">I</p> <p align="center">“THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT ACTED IN COMPLETE SELF-DEFENSE.</p> <p align="center">“II</p> <p align="center">“GRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT DID NOT ACT IN SELF-DEFENSE, THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE ATTACK UPON THE VICTIM WAS PERPETRATED WITH TREACHERY, THUS, QUALIFYING THE KILLING TO MURDER.</p> <p align="center">“III</p> <p align="center">“GRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT DID NOT ACT IN SELF-DEFENSE, AND THAT TREACHERY WAS PROVEN DURING TRIAL, THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN QUALIFYING THE KILLING TO MURDER DESPITE THE NON-ALLEGATION OF TREACHERY IN THE INFORMATION.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p> <p>Appellant would insist that the trial court failed to recognize his “natural instinct” to protect himself from the impending danger posed by the victim. The infliction by him of a fatal wound on the deceased, he said, was unavoidable. Appellant would also fault the trial court for appreciating treachery which was neither specifically alleged nor proved. </p> <p>A close look at the records, the Court believes, sufficiently establishes the accountability of appellant for the death of Danilo Collado but only for homicide and not murder. The narration of eyewitness Mario Collado of the facts about the incident suffers no ear-mark of falsehood.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Q On September 14, 1996, at around 6:30 in the afternoon, where were you?</p> <p>“A I was at Brgy.

While, verily, the appellant’s act was treacherous - the mode of attack neither forewarned Danilo nor afforded him any opportunity to make a defense or to ward off the attack - the Information, however, bore no specific allegation of treachery or evident premeditation. </p> <p>Unlike the old rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> now explicitly mandates that qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language in the complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When the law or rules specify certain circumstances that can aggravate an offense or that would attach to such offense a greater penalty than that ordinarily prescribed, such circumstances must be both alleged and proven in order to justify the imposition of the increased penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p> <p>Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 248,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> kills another without the attendance of any qualifying circumstances shall be deemed guilty of homicide. The trial court correctly appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender but not the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation. Passion and obfuscation cannot co-exist with treachery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was established though not alleged. In the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation, one loses his reason and self-control, largely precluding him from deliberately employing a particular method, means or form of attack in the execution of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It could not be present where the accused did not act due to uncontrollable burst of emotion provoked by prior or unjust acts or due to a legitimate stimulus that could overcome reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p> <p>Homicide carries the penalty of <em>reclusion temporal </em>with a duration of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years. With the attendance of one mitigating circumstance, i.e., voluntary surrender, the penalty should be meted in its minimum period of anywhere from 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty to be imposed shall be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed for the offense, i.e., prision mayor or from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years, as minimum, to anywhere within the range of <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its minimum period, or from 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months, as maximum. </p> <p>The heirs of the victim should deserve an award of P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages for their pains and sufferings, P35,000.00 actual damages, here duly established, plus the loss of “earning capacity.” The deceased was 48 years old at the time of his death and earning about P800.00 every week or P40,000.00 a year. A net equivalent of 50% of his gross annual income would be a fair calculation of his living expenses and that of his family,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> entitling an award of P426,600.00 for lost earnings in accordance with the formula;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> viz: </p> <blockquote> <p>2/3 (80 – age at the time of death) x (gross annual income [GAI] – living expenses [50% of GAI]) </p> <p>= 2 (80 – 48) </p> <p>____________ <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(40,000 – 20,000) </p> <p><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 10pt;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>3 </p> <p>= 21.33 x 20,000 </p> <p>= 426,600 </p></blockquote> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the assailed decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.

He is likewise ordered to indemnify the heirs in the amounts of P35,000.00 actual damages, P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P426,000.00 for lost earnings.
