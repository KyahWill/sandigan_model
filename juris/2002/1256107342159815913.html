				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case originated from an Information filed by Provincial Prosecutor Francisco G. Rivero against Alfredo Coscos and one John Doe, charging them with the crime of Murder, committed as follows:<br><blockquote> That on or about October 31, 1995, in the Municipality of Maco, Province of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Alfredo Coscos, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping with one John Doe, who is at large, with treachery and evident premeditation, with intent to kill, armed with a firearm, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one Johnny de la Cruz, thereby inflicting upon him wounds which caused his death, and further causing actual, moral and compensatory damages to the heirs of the victim.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Alfredo Coscos was arraigned on 11 December 1995 and pleaded "Not Guilty" to the accusation.&nbsp; John Doe was later on identified as Roel Marcujos and the Information was accordingly amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> However, while a warrant was issued for Marcujos' arrest, he was able to evade the authorities, and the trial proceeded against Coscos alone.<br><br>Belly de la Cruz, widow of the victim, testified for the prosecution.&nbsp; She recalled that on 31 October 1995, at around eight o' clock in the evening, while she was inside their bedroom and her husband was feeding their rabbits, she heard people throwing stones at their dogs.&nbsp; She peeped through a window and saw Alfredo Coscos, Coscos' son Ricky and Roel Marcujos entering their premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Coscos, who was holding a kerosene lamp,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> shouted "Dong Johnny!" Her husband approached the trio.&nbsp; She next heard Coscos saying "Tan-awa ang tiil sa akong bata naghubag, tungod napaakan sa iro" (Look at the leg of my son, it swells because it was bitten by your dog).<br><br>An altercation ensued between the victim and Coscos.&nbsp; Suddenly, Belly heard a burst of gunfire and saw her husband staggering.&nbsp; She heard two (2) more shots and saw her husband fell about ten (10) meters away from where she was.&nbsp; She also saw Coscos holding a gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Fearing that she would also be killed, she decided not to make any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After Coscos and his companions left, she immediately asked for their neighbors’ assistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and brought her husband to the Davao Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Belly de la Cruz further testified that her husband, prior to his death,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> earned about P15,000.00 per month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> She likewise stated that for his farm animals, her husband earned about P150,787.79 for a year.&nbsp; To prove her allegation, de la Cruz submitted the following documents to the court: (1) a receipt, dated 15 September 1995, showing that from June to August 1995, her husband earned 8,162.25 from copra harvest; (2) a receipt, dated 07 December 1995, showing that her husband earned P13,820 from copra harvest ending November 1995; and (3) a letter from the Office of the Provincial Treasurer of Tagum, Davao showing that the deceased extracted about 5,716 cubic meters of gravel and sand from his quarry business from 01 January to 31 July 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finally, the witness testified that the total expenses she incurred for the wake of her husband, as well for the funeral service, memorial park and other expenses, amounted to P61,588.75.<br><br>Dr. Ricardo Rodaje of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Southeastern Mindanao Regional Office, who conducted the autopsy examination on the cadaver of Johnny de la Cruz, testified that the cause of the death was gunshot wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The victim sustained three (3) wounds, found on the neck and on the head.&nbsp; Dr. Rodaje declared that while he recovered a slug on the victim's neck, he could not determine the kind of bullet used as he was not an expert on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Rodaje further testified that based on the entrance wound on the neck of the victim, he was shot while either standing or sitting down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He stated that the muzzle of the gun was a little bit lower than the entrance wound; hence, the gun could be at a lower angle in relation to the neck of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The second wound, located on the left side of the victim's head, exited on the right portion of the head, which could mean that the victim was already lying prostrate when it was inflicted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The witness also asserted that the entries of the wound were 5 x 1.3 cm. and 3 x 2.0 cm., which means that the assailant used a short firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, he could not determine which wound was inflicted first.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> There was a possibility that both the assailant and the victim were standing and that the former was taller than the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Finally, Dr. Rodaje declared that powder burns could not be traced if the assailant was wearing gloves when the gun was fired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The defense presented a number of witnesses to dispute the allegations of the prosecution.<br><br>Jacinto Cole testified that on 31 October 1995, at around eight o' clock in the evening, he heard three (3) gunshots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When he heard a fourth gunshot coming from Ambugan bridge, he left his house to investigate.&nbsp; Somebody told him that Belly de la Cruz needed a vehicle to bring her husband to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He went to the house of the de la Cruzes and was told by Belly that Alfredo Coscos shot her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He was able to get a tricycle and he helped in bringing the victim to Davao Regional Hospital.&nbsp; However, Johnny de la Cruz was declared dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the hospital, he overheard Belly talking with the head nurse and saying that she was not certain if it was Alfredo Coscos who shot her husband although she had a strong suspicion because their dog bit Coscos' son.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Cole, likewise, testified that the victim showed him his .38 caliber revolver, which he used to fire during nighttime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Miguel Travenio, a kagawad of Barangay Dumlan, Maco, Davao, testified that on 31 October 1995, at about eight o'clock in the evening, he was in their house when he heard four (4) gunshots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, he did not do anything because nobody reported to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Later that night, at around ten o’ clock in the evening, Alfredo Coscos went to his house and reported that an unidentified person wearing a black jacket shot Johnny de la Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He recorded the report in the barangay logbook.&nbsp; Coscos was wearing a yellow sleeveless shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Leonel Ballispin and Alfredo Marcujos were in his house when Coscos arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Travenio further stated that the next morning, he, together with Barangay Captain Wilfredo Gonzales and some barangay officials went to the site of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Travenio also maintained that the deceased told him that he was a military asset.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Leonil Ballispin corroborated the testimony of Travenio.&nbsp; He stated before the trial court that he was in the store of Kagawad Travenio when Coscos arrived to report that de la Cruz was shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Barangay Captain Wilfredo Gonzales asserted in his testimony that on 31 October 1995, at around ten o' clock in the evening, he was awaken by someone who told him that Johnny de la Cruz was shot by an unidentified assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He tried to contact the police station through an ICOM radio to report the incident but he was unable to do so.&nbsp; The following morning, Miguel Travenio apprised him of what transpired and he was told that it was Alfredo Coscos who reported the shooting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Police Inspector Leonardo Merced, Chief of Police of Maco, Davao, revealed that on 03 November 1995, he requested the PNP Crime Laboratory to examine Alfredo Coscos for the presence of powder burns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The accused tested negative for powder burns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Judge Mary Anne T. Gonzales-Israel of the Municipal Trial Court of Maco, Davao was also called to testify for the defense.&nbsp; She handled the preliminary investigation of the case and recommended the filing of Information against Alfredo Coscos and John Doe.&nbsp; She recalled that sometime in December 1995, she received a letter addressed to Belly de la Cruz, which appeared to have been sent by a member of the New People's Army (NPA).&nbsp; The sender claimed responsibility for the killing of Johnny de la Cruz.&nbsp; The letter was mailed from Maco, Davao but she could not determine who the sender was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Atty. Restituto Suelto, counsel for Alfredo Coscos, also testified that on 14 December 1995, he, too, received a letter similar to the one received by Judge Gonzales-Israel.&nbsp; The letter came from a certain Vergel Montenegro who claimed to be a member of the Sparrow Unit of the NPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Atty. Suelto claimed that a military intelligence officer informed him that Vergel Montenegro was indeed a leader of a Sparrow Unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The accused, Alfredo Coscos, declared before the trial court that he was at New Corella, Davao in the morning of 31 October 1995.&nbsp; He returned to Dumlan, Maco, Davao at around seven o' clock in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Later, he and his eleven-year old son Ricky went to fetch water from the water pump located in the premises of Johnny de la Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Coscos recalled that as they were getting water, the de la Cruzes’ dogs barked at them, prompting him to throw stones at the animals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Johnny de la Cruz approached them and he explained that he threw stones at the dogs because his son was bitten earlier that day.&nbsp; He even asked Johnny to look at the wound but the latter said they would discuss the matter the next morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As Johnny was about to leave and he was about to pick up the pail of water, he heard a gunshot.&nbsp; He saw a person, wearing a black jacket, pumped two more gunshots at the victim.&nbsp; The assailant thereafter ran towards the creek.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He and his son ran towards their house because they were afraid.&nbsp; They had dinner and later, he reported what he witnessed to Kagawad Travenio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Coscos further testified that he went to New Visayas the day after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Upon his return, he learned from his wife that the police were looking for him.&nbsp; He proceeded to the Maco police station where he was investigated and later, arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> He was examined for powder burns but tested negative therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The trial court found for the prosecution and in a decision, dated 05 May 1997, ruled as follows:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the accused is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.&nbsp; He is further required to pay Belly de la Cruz the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1.&nbsp; P50,000 for the death of Johnny de la Cruz;<br><br>2.&nbsp; P50,000.00 for moral damages;<br><br>3.&nbsp; P68,588.75 for actual expenses;<br><br>4.&nbsp; P180,000.00 for the loss of the earning capacity of the deceased and to pay the cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></div></blockquote>In his appeal before this Court, Alfredo Coscos faulted the trial court for his conviction and asserted that:<br><blockquote> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE SOLE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT OF MRS. BELLY DE LA CRUZ.<br><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED ALFREDO COSCOS AS THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME OF MURDER AS THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY WAS NOT DULY PROVED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote>After a careful review of the records of this case, the Court finds no reason to reverse the conviction of accused-appellant Alfredo Coscos.<br><br>As a general rule, the trial court’s evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses is accorded great respect and finality unless it is shown that it overlooked certain facts and circumstances of weight and influence which, if considered, would alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Here, accused-appellant failed to show that the trial court misinterpreted or misapprehended the evidence presented before it.<br><br>The widow of the deceased positively identified accused-appellant as the assailant.&nbsp; Thus, she testified:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">On October 31, 1995 at about 8:00 o’clock in the evening, where were you?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">I was inside our bedroom.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">How about your husband?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">He was outside, in the house of the rabbits.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">What was he doing there?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">Feeding the rabbits.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">Could you remember of any incident that happened at that time?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">On that time, I heard Alfredo Coscos calling my husband to look to the swollen foot of his son.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Before that incident happened, where did Alfredo Coscos come from?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">He was coming from their house and then went inside our premises.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">How large is your fenced premises?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">It’s big.&nbsp;
