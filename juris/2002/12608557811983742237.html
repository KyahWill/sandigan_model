				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Barili, Cebu, Branch 60, finding the appellant, ROGELIO CALAGO, guilty of murder in Criminal Case No. CEB-BRL-214. The appellant was sentenced to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered to pay the heirs of the victim, Arnulfo Lonzaga, the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br>The records show that an Information dated January 29, 1997, the appellant was accused of stabbing Arnulfo Lonzaga to death with the use of a sharp bladed weapon (<i>plamingko</i>), hitting the latter “at the lower portion of his left chest, right chest wall and left thigh.”&nbsp; The crime was allegedly committed with treachery and evident premeditation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The appellant was arraigned on May 13, 1998. With the assistance of counsel, he pled “not guilty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The prosecution presented three (3) witnesses: (1)&nbsp; Dr. Octavio Ortiz, Municipal Health Officer of Dumanjug, Cebu; (2) Sotero Tewan; and (3) Pedro Durango.<br><br>The prosecution evidence show that on December 20, 1997, at about 3:30 a.m., <b>Sotero Tewan</b> was awakened by a commotion coming from the road, about thirty (30) to thirty-five (35) arm’s length from his house in Lamak, Dumanjug, Cebu. He checked out the source of the commotion. From a distance of about five (5) arm’s length, he saw the appellant, Rogelio Calago, and the victim, Arnulfo Lonzaga. The appellant was holding a knife, locally known as <i>plamingko</i>, while the victim was crying for help. The appellant then stabbed the victim who slumped on the ground.&nbsp; Thereafter, the appellant fled.&nbsp; Tewan rushed to the victim and asked him if he recognized the person who stabbed him to be sure if the victim could identify his assailant. The victim named the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Tewan recognized the appellant and the victim as the crime scene was well-lighted by the new moon. He also personally knew them for a long time as they were residents of adjacent <i>barangays</i>. Appellant is even his <i>kumpadre</i>.<br><br><b>Pedro Durango,</b> a neighbor of Sotero Tewan and a brother-in-law of the appellant, also heard the victim’s cry for help. When he repaired to the crime scene, Tewan was already with the wounded victim, lying on the ground. He overheard Tewan inquire from the victim who stabbed him. The victim replied that it was the appellant. By then, some of their neighbors had gathered at the crime scene.&nbsp; To make the identification clearer, Durango also asked the victim who stabbed him. Again, the victim pointed to the appellant. The victim expired five (5) minutes later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The victim was autopsied on December 20, 1997 by Dr. Octavio Ortiz, Municipal Health Officer of Dumanjug, Cebu. He sustained three (3) stab wounds.&nbsp; Stab wound no. 1 was located at the lower portion of the left chest wall, wound no. 2 was at the right chest wall and wound no. 3 was at the posterior lobe mid-portion of the left thigh. Stab wound nos. 1 and 2 were fatal because they hit the vital organs of the body, namely, the heart and the upper lobe of lungs. All three (3) wounds caused massive loss of blood that resulted in the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense presented the following witnesses: (1) Bernardita Alvios; (2) Bonifacio Durango Calago; and (3) the appellant, Rogelio Calago.<br><br>The appellant denied that he killed the victim.&nbsp; He claimed that he was in his house on the material date and time due to stomach ache. According to him, he had a stomach ache since December 19, 1997.&nbsp; It lingered until the dawn of December 20, 1997.&nbsp; At about 7:00 a.m., that same day, a younger sister of his wife informed them that he was a suspect in the killing of Arnulfo Lonzaga.&nbsp; His story was corroborated by Bernardita Alvios and Bonifacia Calago.<br><br><b>Bernardita Alvios</b> was a neighbor of the Calagos for eight (8) years. At 5:00 p.m. on December 19, 1997, she claimed that she went to the appellant’s house to ask for radish (<i>kalamungay</i>). At that time, the appellant was suffering from a stomach ache and his wife, Bonifacia, was attending to his needs.&nbsp; Alvios left as soon as she got the radish from the couple.&nbsp; She admitted that it was the first and the only time she went to the Calagos in the eight (8) years that they had been neighbors.<br><br><b>Bonifacia Calago</b> confirmed that the appellant was in their house in the early dawn of December 20, 1997. Allegedly, he suffered from stomach ache starting December 19, 1997.&nbsp; Due to his illness, she hardly slept in the evening of said date to attend to him. However, she admitted that she fell asleep, albeit very lightly, between 3:00 a.m. up to 4:00 a.m. of December 20, 1997. She woke up at 4:00 a.m. when the rooster crowed. At 9:00 a.m., her sister arrived in their house and reported to them that the appellant was a suspect in the killing of Arnulfo Lonzaga. She cried upon hearing the report. The policemen came to their house and arrested him.<br><br>The trial court found the prosecution’s version to be more credible and convicted the appellant of murder. Hence, the appeal.<br><br>The appellant contends that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“I.<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT&nbsp; ROGELIO CALAGO GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE FAILURE ON THE PART OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE PRESENCE OF THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF TREACHERY AND EVIDENT PREMEDITATION.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.”</blockquote>We find the appellant guilty of homicide, not murder, for the killing of the victim, Arnulfo Lonzaga.<br><br>Eyewitness Sotero Tewan testified as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“FISCAL NAZARENO:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Now on December 20, 1997, at 3:30 o’clock dawn, can you tell us where were you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">(WITNESS):</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">I was at the house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">What happened while you were at the house&nbsp;

He personally knew the appellant for a number of years.&nbsp; They are even <i>kumpadres</i>.&nbsp; Tewan saw the latter and the victim at a close range of five (5) arm’s length. At that time, too, the crime scene was not completely dark as it was already dawn and the moon was still shining.&nbsp; Thus, Tewan was able to describe the bladed weapon used by the appellant in attacking the victim. He also related where the fatal thrust landed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> We also examined the testimony of Tewan and we could not find any reason for him to commit any falsehood as to the identity of the appellant.<br><br>There is another reason why there can be no doubt that it was appellant who killed the victim. The victim’s statement as to the identity of the appellant as his assailant is competent evidence as a dying declaration or at the very least, as part of <i>res gestae</i>.<br><br>A dying declaration pertains to the declarant’s statements on the cause and surrounding circumstances of his death made under the consciousness of an impending death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It is admissible because, as a general rule, when the person is at the point of death, every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak the truth, and therefore, his statements, under such circumstances, deserve great weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the declarant’s utterances are considered part of res gestae when made immediately after a startling occurrence. The admission of such utterances are based on the well founded belief that words spoken instinctively at the time of a specific transaction or event, without the opportunity for the speaker to effectively concoct a fabricated version of the startling event can only be but credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Durango corroborated the testimony of Tewan concerning the victim’s declaration as to the identity of his assailant shortly before he died, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“FISCAL NAZARENO:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">What happened while you were at your house on Dec. 20, 1997 at 3:30 o’clock dawn?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">I heard a cry for help.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Can you tell us what is (<i>sic</i>) the exact words uttered by one crying for help?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">‘Help me because I was stabbed.’</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">When you heard that cry for help, what did you do?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">I hurriedly went down from the house and proceeded to the place where the cry for help came.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">What did you see when you arrived at the place where the cried (<i>sic</i>) for help was heard?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td> <div align="justify">I saw Arnold (<i>sic</i>) Lonzaga lying on the ground, wounded.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Are you referring to Arnold (<i>sic</i>) Lonzaga the victim in this instant case?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>What was the situation of Arnold (<i>sic</i>) Lonzaga when you saw him?</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><strong> He was in critical condition.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Then, what did you do next?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>I asked Arnulfo Lonzaga who stabbed him.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">And what was his answer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify"><b>He answered that Rogelio Calago was the one who stabbed him.”</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On cross-examination, Durango stated as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY.

Nonetheless, apart from the statements of the declarant, his consciousness of impending death can be proved by surrounding circumstances, such as the nature of injury or by his conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>We can glean from the circumstances that the victim was aware of his impending death when he named the appellant as his assailant.&nbsp; The victim was in critical condition.&nbsp; He sustained severe injuries in the vital organs, such as the heart and the lungs.&nbsp; He bled profusely and due to massive hemorrhage secondary to the stab wounds, he died within minutes after he named the appellant.<br><br>Parenthetically, as in the case of Tewan, there is no showing that Pedro Durango was motivated by ill will in testifying against the appellant.&nbsp; Indeed, they are brothers-in-law, <i>i.e.</i>, the appellant’s wife, Bonifacia Calago, is his sister. Thus, it would be unlikely for Durango to fabricate the victim’s declaration pointing to the appellant as the assailant. His testimony deserves full faith and credit.<br><br>We now consider whether the circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation should be rightly appreciated against the appellant. The appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove the presence of the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation. The Solicitor General agrees.<br><br>We sustain the appellant.<br><br>There is treachery when the offender employs means, methods or forms in the execution of the crime which tends directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, witness Tewan did not give any testimony on how the attack started. He only related that when he arrived at the crime scene, he saw the appellant stab the victim. Before that, he recalled that he was awakened because he heard a commotion and when he went outside his house to check it out, he heard the victim shouting for help. There was no testimony on his part whether the attack was sudden and unexpected that it afforded the victim no chance to defend himself.<br><br>We have held that for treachery to exist, there must be evidence showing that the mode of attack was consciously or deliberately adopted by the culprit to make it impossible or difficult for the person attacked to defend himself or retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Considering that the eyewitness did not see the onset of the assault, it cannot be said that the appellant had deliberately adopted a method or mode that deprived the victim of an opportunity to retaliate. Treachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence as clearly as the crime itself. Otherwise, it cannot be appreciated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The trial court also erred in appreciating the circumstance of evident premeditation. For evident premeditation to be appreciated, the following must be proven: (1) the time when the accused decided to commit the crime; (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that he has clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between the decision and the execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of his act.&nbsp; None of these elements has been established in the case at bar.<br><br>In the absence of any circumstance that would qualify the crime at bar to murder, the appellant could only be held accountable for <b>homicide</b> as defined and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. The prescribed penalty for said crime is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.&nbsp; Considering that there was neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstance present in the commission of the crime, the penalty has to be imposed in the medium period, ranging from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months.&nbsp; The appellant, however, is entitled to avail of the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Thus, he should be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty, the minimum of which would be within the range of <i>prision mayor</i> and the maximum thereof would be within the range of <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the judgment in Criminal Case No. CEB-BRL-214 is <b>MODIFIED</b>. The appellant is declared guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. He is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum.<br><br>The civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 awarded in favor of the heirs of the late Arnulfo Lonzaga is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup>, and <i>Austria-Martinez, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Kapunan</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> Per Special Order No. 220, dated April 22, 2002.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dated July 10, 1999, see Rollo, pp. 17-24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Original Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, Sotero Tewan, September 1, 1998, pp. 3-5, 8, 10-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, Pedro Durango, September 2, 1998, pp. 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, Dr. Octavio Ortiz, August 11, 1998, pp. 5-6; Exh. “A”, Original Records, pp. 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, Sotero Tewan, September 1, 1998, pp. 3-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 8, 10-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Exh. “B”, Original Records, pp. 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> People vs. Preciados, et al., G.R.
