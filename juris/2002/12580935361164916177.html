				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When the accused pleads guilty to the charge, both the trial judge and the defense counsel must observe the stringent requirements of the Rules of Court and applicable jurisprudence in order to safeguard the constitutional rights of the accused.&nbsp; In the present case, the defense counsel not only failed to protect the rights of his client; worse, he even advised him to plead guilty to the Information that had failed to allege the essential elements of qualified rape.&nbsp; As a consequence, appellant was wrongly sentenced to death.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Case</b></u><br></div><br>For automatic review by this Court are two related Decisions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> both dated February 27, 1998, promulgated by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Libmanan, Camarines Sur (Branch 57), in (A) Criminal Case No. L-1888 (which we will consider henceforth as Criminal Case No. L-1889, because it is clear from the subject Decision that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> inadvertently interchanged the case numbers; it had meant to convict appellant under the latter and to acquit him under Criminal Case No. L-1888)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and (B) Criminal Cases Nos.

<i>First</i>, the records do not show whether the defense counsel was asked a series of questions on whether he had explained the meaning and the consequences of appellant’s change of plea.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, no information was elicited by the trial court about the personality profile of appellant that may serve as a trustworthy index of his capacity to give a free and informed plea of guilt.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, the trial court erroneously told him that: “<i>[i]f we proceed with the trial, and if it is proven that you had committed the crime as charged, the penalty would be x x x death sentences.</i>” This implied that it would be better for him not to proceed with the trial, because if it was going to be proven that he committed the crimes charged, then the death penalty would surely be meted out to him.&nbsp; <i>Finally</i>, the RTC did not require him to fully narrate the “rape incidents” or reenact the manner in which he had perpetrated the crimes.<br><br>In addition, the defense counsel was lackadaisical, if not outrightly incompetent, in protecting the rights of appellant.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, he failed to object to the sufficiency of the Information in Criminal Case No. 1889 (this will be explained further below).&nbsp; Worse, he advised the latter to plead guilty to an Information that did not sufficiently state all the elements of qualified rape.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, despite the initial Motion of the defense counsel to have a pretrial of the aforesaid cases, he later moved to waive this right after the hearing was postponed several times.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, he did not present any evidence for the defense.&nbsp; In fact, he had already moved to waive his client’s right to present it, even before the prosecution presented its evidence for some of the charges.&nbsp; <i>Fourth</i>, he failed to advise appellant that even if he had pleaded guilty to some of the charges and denied the others, the penalty of death would still have been meted out to him.<br><br>Why would appellant change his plea and waive his right to present evidence?&nbsp; It seems to us that his change of plea and his waiver of his right to present evidence were advised by his counsel in order to get rid of dreary work, rather than protect the rights of his client.<br><br><u><i><b>Information in Criminal Case No. L-1889</b></i></u><br><br>As earlier stated, the Information in Criminal Case No. L-1889 does not charge the heinous crime of rape.<br><br>Article 335 of Revised Penal Code, the law at the time appellant ravished Evelyn, states:<br><blockquote>“Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed</i>. — Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol><li>By using force or intimidation;</li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and</li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></li></ol>“The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>“Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.<br><br>“When by reason or on occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>“When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>“The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol><li>when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.</li><li>when the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.</li><li>when the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.</li><li>when the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.</li><li>when the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.</li><li>when committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.</li><li>when by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation.”</li></ol></blockquote>In <i>People v. Mahinay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court explained the elements of rape as follows:<br><blockquote>“The gravamen of the offense of rape, prior to R.A. 8353, is sexual congress with a woman by force and without consent.&nbsp; (Under the new law, rape may be committed even by a woman and the victim may even be a man.)&nbsp; If the woman is under 12 years of age, proof of force and consent becomes immaterial not only because force is not an element of statutory rape, but the absence of a free consent is presumed when the woman is below such age.&nbsp; Conviction will therefore lie, provided sexual intercourse is proven.&nbsp; <i>But if the woman is 12 years of age or over at the time she was violated, as in this case, not only the first element of sexual intercourse must be proven but also the other element that the perpetrator’s evil acts with the offended party was done through force, violence, intimidation or threat needs to be established.</i> x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Italics supplied)</blockquote>Other than the allegation of carnal knowledge, no other element of rape as defined by law is alleged in the Information.&nbsp; More to the point, it does not state that the rape was committed through force, violence, intimidation, threat or even through moral ascendancy. It does not even allege that the carnal knowledge was without the consent or against the will of Evelyn.&nbsp; The real nature of the criminal charge is determined by the actual recital of facts in the complaint or information, as the Court held in <i>People v. Mendoza</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>“It is well settled that the real nature of the criminal charge is determined not from the caption or preamble of the Information nor from the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, they being conclusions of law, but by the actual recital of facts in the complaint or information.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The Court explained that the purpose of the information was to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the charge against him so as to enable him to prepare a suitable defense.&nbsp; Equally important, he cannot be convicted of an offense higher than that with which he is charged.<br><blockquote>“x x x.&nbsp; The Constitution guarantees the right of every person accused in a criminal prosecution to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him.&nbsp; This right finds amplification and implementation in the different provisions of the Rules of Court. Foremost among these enabling provisions is the office of an information.<br><br>“The facts stated in the body of the information determine the crime of which the accused stands charged and for which he must be tried.&nbsp; This recital of the essentials of a crime delineates the nature and cause of accusation against an accused.<br><br>“It is fundamental that every element of which the offense is composed must be alleged in the complaint or information.&nbsp; The main purpose of requiring the various elements of a crime to be set out in an information is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense.&nbsp; He is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.<br><br>“An accused person cannot be convicted of an offense higher than that with which he is charged in the complaint or information on which he is tried.&nbsp; It matters not how conclusive and convincing the evidence of guilt may be, but an accused cannot be convicted of any offense, unless it is charged in the complaint or information on which he is tried or is necessarily included therein.&nbsp; He has a right to be informed of the nature of the offense with which he is charged before he is put on trial.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>Added the Court in another case:<br><blockquote>“x x x. In order that this requirement may be satisfied, facts must be stated; not conclusions of law.&nbsp; Every crime is made up of certain acts and intent; these must be set forth in the complaint with reasonable particularity of time, place, names (plaintiff or defendant), and circumstances.&nbsp; In short, the complaint must contain a specific allegation of every fact and circumstance necessary to constitute the crime charged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>Since the Information in Criminal Case No. L-1889 fails to allege the essential elements of qualified rape, appellant should not have been convicted of that crime. Otherwise, his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him would be violated.&nbsp; And yet, counsel advised him to plead guilty of qualified rape, and the trial court convicted him accordingly.<br><br>Because in its proceedings the RTC failed to observe the exacting guidelines on how to conduct a “searching inquiry,” and because the defense counsel failed to protect the right of appellant to due process, we have no other choice but to remand the case to the court a quo for further proceedings that would conform with what we have heretofore expressed.<br><br>Because of the order of remand, the other assigned error will no longer be addressed.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decisions in Criminal Cases Nos. 1889, 1893 and 1896 dated February 27, 1998, issued by the Regional Trial Court of Libmanan, Camarines Sur (Branch 57), are hereby <b><i>SET ASIDE</i></b>.&nbsp; The cases are <i><b>REMANDED</b></i> to the court of origin for further proceedings to be conducted with all deliberate speed, in accordance with this Decision.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Quisumbing, Buena, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Thelma C.
