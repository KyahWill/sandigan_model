Leonido made the following findings:</p> <ol><li>Complete, healed laceration with rounded, non-coaptable borders and retraction of the edges of the hymen at 6 o'clock; <p></p> <p></p> </li><li>Test tube with a diameter of 3/4 inch entered easily the vagina. <p></p> <p></p> </li><li>Erythema of the vulva. <p></p> <p></p> </li><li>No other external physical findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> </li></ol> <p></p>The accused-appellant was brought to trial; and thereafter, he was convicted by the trial court as above stated. Hence, the automatic review of said decision. <p>The accused-appellant raised the following assignment of errors, viz:</p> <p align="center">I.</p> <blockquote> <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE (APPELLANT) GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF FOURTEEN (14) COUNTS OF RAPE IN CRIMINAL CASE NOS. IR-4769 TO IR-4782 DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION.</p></blockquote> <p align="center">II.</p> <blockquote> <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE (APPELLANT).</p></blockquote> <p align="center">III.</p> <blockquote> <p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE (APPELLANT) PARTICULARLY IN CRIMINAL CASE NOS. IR-4769, IR-4781 AND IR-4782 DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ALLEGATIONS THEREIN WITH RESPECT TO THE AGE OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED COMMISSION OF THE RAPES WERE DEFECTIVE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>The accused-appellant contends that Cherry Grace's testimony that he raped her should not have been believed by the trial court because it was impossible for him to have inserted his penis into Cherry Grace's vagina in a standing position. He submits that since Cherry Grace's lower garments were simply pulled down the knee level, indicating that her thighs were "tightly fixed," the alleged sexual act could not have been consummated. He takes stock of the fact that Cherry Grace testified that she never spread her legs, making it impossible for the consummation of the sexual act in a standing position.</p> <p>We disagree.</p> <p>In the first place, it is settled that "sexual intercourse in a standing position while perhaps uncomfortable, is not improbable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> In these cases, the accused-appellant failed to sufficiently show that he could not have raped Cherry Grace in such position. On the other hand, Cherry Grace clearly and consistently testified how the accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina fourteen (14) times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> </p> <p>In the second place, the established facts and circumstances show that it was not impossible for the accused-appellant to have inserted his penis into her vagina in said position, to wit:</p> <ol><li>The accused-appellant has been shown to be a strict and cruel man who inflicts beatings even “without any reason at all” on Cherry Grace and her siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> In fact, he admitted that he is a “strict and cruel man.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Even his wife “could not do anything” because she was afraid of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> In a sense, Cherry Grace was trapped in a web of cruel moral ascendancy of her father over her which deprived her the courage to fight back every time he would rape her and made it quite possible for him to rape her with impunity while in a standing position. <p></p> <p></p> </li><li>The accused-appellant would initially beat Cherry Grace until he was contented every time he would rape her, i.e., he would pin her on the wall, whack her head, and whip her with a belt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Hence, it is not difficult to understand why Cherry Grace would simply succumb to what he wanted to do.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Indeed, after being beaten up, all she could do was to obey the accused-appellant when he made her stand on the <em>bangkito</em>, and to just listlessly stand while he was raping her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Being in pain from the beatings, she could do nothing but yield her body to be sexually violated by him. Consequently, there is no doubt that after physically and violently beating Cherry Grace, the accused-appellant could have spread her legs while she was standing, penetrated her vagina, as well as pushed and pulled his penis therein. <p></p> <p></p> </li><li>The accused-appellant admitted that he was almost six (6) feet tall while Cherry Grace, at age fifteen (15), was five (5) feet and three (3) inches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> To bridge the gap in height, the accused-appellant made Cherry Grace stand on the <em>bangkito</em> which is about seven (7) to eight (8) inches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> With his penis at level with Cherry Grace's vagina, he could have penetrated her in said standing position. </li></ol> <p></p>Nor are we persuaded with the accused-appellant's assertion that since Cherry Grace's buttocks was not "lifted," no sexual coitus could have happened. In no uncertain terms, Cherry Grace testified that in all the times that the accused-appellant was raping her, she was pinned to the wall or pushed to the post, making possible the insertion of his penis into her vagina even without the lifting of her buttocks. Stated differently, the accused-appellant consummated said rapes by forcing himself into her vagina while she was pinned to a wall or pushed to a post. There was therefore no need for him to lift her buttocks. Verily, with her clear and categorical testimony that he inserted his penis inside her vagina, there can be no other conclusion than that his penis touched her <em>labia majora</em> or the <em>labia minora</em> of her <em>pudendum</em>, thereby, constituting consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> <p>Moreover, Cherry Grace's testimony was corroborated by Dr. Loreto G. Leonido who testified that, as he declared in the medical certificate, after he examined Cherry Grace, he found (a) that she has "(c)omplete, healed laceration with rounded, non-coaptable borders and retraction of the edges of the hymen at 6 o'clock;" (b) that a "(t)est tube with a diameter of 3/4 inch entered easily the vagina;" (c) that there was "(e)rythema of the vulva;" (d) that it was possible that the laceration could have been caused by the organ of a person; and (e) that since said test tube easily entered her vagina, it could be possible that she had several sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> It is settled that "(t)he mere introduction of the male organ in the <em>labia majora</em> of the victim’s genitalia consummates the crime;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and that the medical evidence, notably the finding of healed lacerations on the victim’s private parts, supports the theory that Cherry Grace had been a victim of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> In any event, the established facts and circumstances lead us to the ineluctable conclusion that Cherry Grace was raped, what with (a) her positive identification of the accused-appellant, declaration that he made her stand on the <em>bangkito</em>, pinned her against the wall, removed her shorts, and inserted his sex organ in her vagina; and (b) Dr. Leonido's findings of the presence of healed laceration in her vagina.</p> <p>At any rate, we are not persuaded by the accused-appellant's contention that Cherry Grace is not a credible witness.</p> <blockquote> <p>(T)he Court has said time and time again that “the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude. Findings of the trial court on such matters are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>Here, the trial court found, to which finding we fully agree, that Cherry Grace's testimony was credible, viz:</p> <blockquote> <p>In answer to the questions on cross examination, Cherry Grace admitted certain reasons why she finally revealed what her father has been doing to her (T.S.N., March 2, 1999, p. 11) but then this Court believes that "even if complainant is consumed with revenge, it takes a certain amount of psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a story which would put her own father as a candidate for lethal injection and drag herself and the rest of her family to a lifetime of shame" (<em>People v. Melivo,</em> 253 SCRA 347).</p> <p>Neither would the cruelty of her father be sufficient for the complainant to file a charge so serious as the heinous crime of rape against her father simply because she was maltreated, only the compulsive motive to seek justice could be strong enough for her to implicate her flesh and blood (<em>People v. Esquila,</em> 254 SCRA 140).</p></blockquote> <p>Indeed, as early "as in the case of <em>People v. Villaroya</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> we ruled that 'hatred cannot be considered sufficient motive to testify falsely to convict a person for a crime punishable by death.'" A careful review of the evidence on record shows that Cherry Grace testified on the details of the rapes in a straightforward, positive and convincing manner. She did not waiver even during cross-examination, despite her tender age. "It is an established rule that courts usually give credence to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault, particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape because, normally, no person would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> </p> <p>Besides, we find unworthy of belief and credence the accused-appellant's claim that Cherry Grace charged him with rape because she and his in-laws connived with each other in maliciously charging him with committing the acts of rape against Cherry Grace. He asserts that Cherry Grace was raped not by him but by Leopoldo Magistrado, whose wife is the sister of the accused-appellant's mother-in-law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> He claims that he saw Magistrado place Cherry Grace on the latter's lap, pull down her shorts and use her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that she had sexual intercourse with Magistrado at the time the accused-appellant saw them together, such does not contradict the version of the prosecution that she was raped by the accused-appellant fourteen (14) times on different dates.</p> <p>What is more, it is unbelievable that Cherry Grace's mother would expose her to embarrassment, ridicule and stigma just to ensure that Magistrado would not be held liable for his alleged sexual act with Cherry Grace. "No self-respecting individual would want to subject a loved one to the rigors of public trial and the trauma of rigid cross-examination by opposing counsels if (s)he was not purely and solely motivated by the desire to punish the perpetrator of the crime."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> </p> <p>Anent Cherry Grace's delay in reporting the acts of rape against her, suffice it to state that her failure to immediately report the same does not detract from her credibility, her timidity and hesitation being attributable to her age, the moral ascendancy of the accused-appellant over her, and his threats against her and her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> It is extant from the records that Cherry Grace testified that the accused-appellant threatened to kill her and her family if she divulged to anybody what he had been doing to her. It was thus quite natural for her to be scared and to keep her horrible ordeal to herself until she found enough courage to disclose the same to her grandmother. Cherry Grace's reluctance to disclose what the accused-appellant did to her did not render her testimony unworthy of belief. Settled is the rule that delay in reporting a rape incident due to death threats are not to be taken against the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> </p> <p>Furthermore, it bears stressing that Cherry Grace indeed may have failed to escape from the accused-appellant at the earliest opportunity, and even stayed at home even after he raped her fourteen (14) times, but “different people react differently to different situations and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a frightful experience. The victim's mien, rather than composure, could mean resignation, considering her continuing suffering or apoplexy and numbness as the aftermath of her ordeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> The fact, therefore, that Cherry Grace failed to run away immediately from the accused-appellant and avoid his evil clutches should not be taken against her.</p> <p>We thus hold that the accused-appellant’s defense of denial cannot overcome Cherry Grace's positive testimony that he raped her fourteen (14) times, which was substantially corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses. “The rule is that the positive and categorical assertions of witnesses generally prevail over bare denials.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Such “accordance of greater probative value to evidence that is positive in nature than that which is negative in character is a time-honored principle. Hence, the negative assertions of the accused-appellant cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the complainants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Without doubt, Cherry Grace's unwavering and positive identification of her father as her defiler and tormentor cannot prevail over the latter's defense of denial the same being feeble, flimsy, self-serving and uncorroborated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> </p> <p>Neither do we find meritorious the accused-appellant's claim that he could not have raped Cherry Grace because from September 1995 to April 1998, he sometimes worked in Legaspi. The defense of alibi is inherently weak, unreliable and easily fabricated. "For alibi to serve as basis for acquittal, it must be established with clear and convincing evidence. The requisites of time and place must be strictly met."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Here, the accused-appellant failed to reasonably demonstrate that during the time the rapes were committed upon Cherry Grace, it was physically impossible for him to have been in their house at San Vicente Sur, Iriga City, where Cherry Grace was raped fourteen (14) times. It was not sufficiently proven that both the house at San Vicente Sur and the place where he allegedly worked at Legaspi were too far apart to make it possible for the accused-appellant to have raped Cherry Grace on the dates stated in the aforementioned informations against him.</p> <p>Be that as it may, while we affirm the trial court’s judgment of conviction, we do not agree with the trial court’s imposition of the death penalty. As we declared in <em>People v. Esureña</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> to wit:</p> <p>Under Republic Act No. 7659, the imposition of the death penalty in rape cases becomes mandatory when the offended party is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, or relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. The qualifying circumstances of age and relationship of the victim to the accused must specifically be alleged and proved (People v. Villaraza, G.R. Nos. 131848-50, September 5, 2000, p. 22, citing <em>People v. Manggasin,</em> 306 SCRA 228 [1999]).</p> <blockquote> <p>In the case of <em>People v. Manuel Liban</em> (G.R. No. 138330, November 22, 2000), this Court ruled that the birth certificate of the victim or in lieu thereof, any other documentary evidence that can help establish the age of the victim should be presented.</p> <p>In People v. Javier (311 SCRA 122 [1999]), we required the presentation of the birth certificate of the victim to prove her minority, failing which the imposition of the death penalty cannot be upheld.</p> <p>In the case at bar, although the minority of the victim was alleged in the information, the same was not duly proved during the trial of the case. No evidence was presented to show Nena’s age, save for her own testimony. It has been held that while the testimony of a person as to her age, although hearsay, is admissible as evidence of family tradition, it cannot be considered proof of age beyond reasonable doubt (People v. Pine, 346 SCRA 383, 393 [2000]). Hence, the qualifying circumstance of minority cannot be appreciated, and accordingly the death penalty cannot be imposed (<em>People v. Virrey,</em> G.R. No. 133910, November 14, 2001).</p> <p>It is a time-honored principle that in a criminal prosecution, especially where the life of another human being is hanging on the balance, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the accused is charged must be established in order for the corresponding penalty thereto to be upheld.</p> <p>On the other hand, the qualifying circumstance that the rape was committed in full view of the spouse, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third civil degree of consanguinity (Revised Penal Code, Article 266-B, sixth paragraph, subparagraph [3]) although proved, was not alleged in the Information. As such, it also cannot be appreciated to warrant the imposition of the death penalty. Qualifying circumstances which increase the penalty by degree rather than merely affect the period of the penalty, as in the case of aggravating circumstances, must be properly pleaded in the information consistent with the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him (<em>People v. Labayne,</em> G.R. No. 132170, April 20, 2001).</p> <p>Since accused-appellant Antonio is only guilty of simple rape, the amounts awarded as damages must be modified. The amount of P100,000.00 which the trial court awarded as compensatory damages must be reduced to P50,000.00, while the award of P50,000.00 as moral damages is justified and should be maintained (<em>People v. Pamilar,</em> G.R. No. 130846, October 23, 2001). Further, the amount of P25,000.00 should be awarded as exemplary damages, to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior, like accused-appellant, from sexually abusing their daughters.</p></blockquote> <p>The records show that although the victim’s minority was alleged in the informations in these cases, the same was not duly proven during the trial. There was no evidence presented to prove Cherry Grace's age. Consequently, the accused-appellant can only be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, instead of death, in all the subject cases.</p> <p>We likewise award moral damages of P50,000.00 to the victim in each count of rape pursuant to the Court’s current policy that “moral damages are automatically awarded to rape victims without need of proof for it is assumed that they have suffered moral injuries entitling them to such award.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Moreover, we award exemplary damages of P25,000.00 in each count of rape, “to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior, like accused-appellant, from sexually abusing their daughters.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> We also find that the accused-appellant is liable to pay Cherry Grace civil indemnity <em>ex delicto.</em> Pursuant to existing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Cherry Grace is entitled to the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity ex delicto for each count of rape.</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the decision of the Regional Trial Court in Iriga City, Branch 37, in these cases finding the accused-appellant Domingo D.
