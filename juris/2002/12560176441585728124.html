				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Case</u><br></div><br>The case is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> affirming that of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 44, Dumaguete City, which reversed the ruling of the municipal trial court that it has jurisdiction over the case of forcible entry.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Facts</u><br></div><br>The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><blockquote>“<i>Ab initio</i>, on August 5, 1993, Teodora Bollos commenced before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Bayawan-Basay Civil Case No. 993, for forcible entry, solely against Eddie Herrera alleging that the latter, sometime in the second week of 1993, through stealth and strategy and taking advantage of the absence of Teodora, entered and occupied her Sugarland known as Lot No. 20, GSS-615, located at Camandagan, Maninyon, Bayawan, Negros Oriental.&nbsp; Teodora claims to have inherited said parcel, being the only heir, from her deceased father, Alfonso Bollos, who died on December 10, 1992.<br><br>“Defendant, Eddie Herrera, denied the allegations against him maintaining that he entered and occupied not Lot No. 20, as claimed by Teodora, but Lot No. 21, GSS-615, which is owned by Conrado Bollos, a brother of Teodora’s father, Alfonso.&nbsp; Further, Herrera said that his occupation of the property was not through stealth or strategy but by virtue of a contract of lease executed between Conrado Bollos, as lessor, and Ernesto Tijing, as lessee. Herrera is Tijing’s overseer on the land.<br><br>“As a consequence, the complaint was twice amended, first, on March 23, 1994 to include Ernesto T. Tijing as a party-defendant and much later on October 4, 1995, this time to implead Conrado Bollos as an additional defendant.<br><br>“After due proceedings, the first level court rendered its judgment dispositively ruling:<br><blockquote>‘ACCORDINGLY, in the light of the foregoing considerations for plaintiffs’ failure to make-out a forcible entry case because of lack of jurisdiction the above-entitled case is hereby DISMISSED. Plaintiffs’ remedy should be reivendicatory (sic) action before the proper forum.<br><br>‘SO ORDERED.<br><br>‘Given this 30<sup>th</sup> day of June, 1997, at Bayawan, Negros Oriental, Philippines.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 240px; text-align: center;">‘(SGD.)

That plaintiffs and even their predecessor-in-interest Alfonso Bollos were in peaceful, adverse, continuous possession of the property and in <i>concepto de dueno</i> until the commission of the act or acts of dispossession or deprivation by the defendant hereinafter mentioned.<br><br>“5.&nbsp; That sometime in the second week of June, 1993, defendant pursuant to an avaricious intent of enriching himself at the expense of the plaintiffs, through stealth and strategy, and taking advantage of the absence of the latter, entered and occupied the property in question and without any legal justification therefore, fertilized the sugar cane rations growing thereon and planted the vacant portions with sugar cane.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Thus, we find that the complaint alleged prior physical possession <i>de facto</i> which the defendants disturbed by force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth, against the will or without the consent of the plaintiffs, sufficient to constitute a cause of action for forcible entry.<br><br>In fact, defendants admitted the truth of the foregoing facts in their answer and first amended answer. The thrust of their defense was that they had occupied Lot No. 21, not Lot No. 20, which is the land in question.<br><br>On the second issue, the concept of damages in an action for forcible entry and detainer cases is well defined in several cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> These damages mean “rents” or “the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises,” or “fair rental value of the property.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Temperate, actual, moral and exemplary are neither rents nor reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises, nor fair rental value, and are not recoverable in such cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the municipal trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, and the regional trial court reversed&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; but&nbsp; rendered judgment ejecting the defendants from the parcel of land involved, and condemning them to pay damages and attorney’s fees.&nbsp; This is not correct. In case of reversal, the case shall be remanded to the municipal trial court for further proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The regional trial court in reversing an appealed case dismissing the action cannot decree the eviction of the defendants and award damages. A court cannot take judicial notice of a factual matter in controversy. The court may take judicial notice of matters of public knowledge, or which are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Before taking such judicial notice, the court must “allow the parties to be heard thereon.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Hence, there can be no judicial notice on the rental value of the premises in question without supporting evidence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Judgment</u><br></div><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the Court <b>DENIES</b> the petition.&nbsp; However, the Court <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decisions of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and the Regional Trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Court remands the case to the municipal trial court for further proceedings.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In CA-G.
