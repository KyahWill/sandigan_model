				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It is well-settled that the death penalty cannot be imposed in incestuous rapes, if the information does not allege or specify the relationship of the victim to the offender. <p align="center"> <b><u>The Case</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> For automatic review by this Court is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 28, 1999, issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan (Branch 78). The RTC found Rogelio del Ayre y Litran guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape and sentenced him to death for one count and to <em>reclusion perpetua </em>for the other. The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “WHEREFORE, the foregoing considered, this Court hereby finds accused ROGELIO DEL AYRE Y LITRAN<strong> GUILTY </strong>beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua for Crim.

In the house, his 9-year old daughter Zaira del Ayre was attending to her five-year old sister Laiza. Appellant ordered Zaira to serve him a cup of coffee. Zaira’s four (4) other siblings were fast asleep inside their house.&nbsp; </p><p> “Appellant did not drink the coffee but instead forcibly rolled up Zaira’s sleeveless blouse. Zaira tried to resist and said ‘ayoko po,’ but appellant removed her blouse, shorts and panty. Zaira was made to lie down on a wooden bed while appellant removed his short pants and brief. Appellant [lay] on top of Zaira and inserted his finger into her vagina while commanding her not to speak out loud as it would [only take] a few minutes. She tried to resist but appellant squeezed her body. Appellant inserted his finger into her vagina after which he inserted his penis and made push and pull movements for about three (3) minutes. Then appellant threatened Zaira that if the matter was divulged, he would kill the members of the family. Afraid, Zaira proceeded outside their house and cried.&nbsp; </p><p> “On September 26, 1994, Zaira was together with her sister Laiza inside their house. Appellant forcibly pulled Zaira towards him and forced her to lie down on their wooden bed. She tried to resist but appellant prevailed upon her and told her that it would only take a few minutes. Appellant took off Zaira's short pants and panty while the former took off his shorts and brief. Appellant placed himself on top of Zaira, inserted his penis inside her vagina and made push and pull movements for about five (5) minutes. Then appellant inserted his finger into Zaira’s vagina while mashing her breasts for a few minutes. Appellant threatened her not to report the incident to anybody. It was only on July 20, 1997 when Zaira mustered enough courage to report the matter to her grandmother which led to the apprehension of appellant.&nbsp; </p><p> “On July 21, 1997, Zaira underwent medical examination by a medico legal officer from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Manila and it was found that her ‘hymen [was] intact but distendible and its orifice wide (2.5 cm in diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average size adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing any genital injury.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p align="center"> <u><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></u>&nbsp; </p><p> On the other hand, appellant presents his version of the incident as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “Accused <strong>ROGELIO DEL AYRE</strong> testified that on February 16, 1993 at around 5:00 A.M., he was with his wife in the market selling oysters. He sells oysters with his wife from Monday to Sunday. He was also in the market on September 26, 1994. He was sure that he was in the market on both dates when the alleged rape was committed because, that is his daily activity. He was not aware about the charges filed by his daughter against him. He was just arrested in the market on July 1997 by the Barangay Captain. All the charges against him are not true because every time he scolded Zaira, he would hit her. Then she would proceed to the house of his mother-in-law. It was his mother-in-law who instigated the filing of these cases against him. The last time that he scolded Zaira and hit her was about 2 or 3 days before he was arrested. He scolded and hit Zaira because she denied using the money that he told her to keep and that is why he slapped her face strongly.&nbsp; </p><p> “From the time he and his wife got married, his mother-in-law was mad at him because she (mother-in-law) doesn’t like him added by the fact that he disagreed to register in her (mother-in-law) name the lot where their house was built.&nbsp; </p><p> “His house is located at the coastal area where the houses are built adjacent to each other. They applied for that land from the government and when it was approved, his mother-in-law told him to register that land to one person but he disagreed because he thought of his family. His mother-in-law, then got mad at him and told him that she will find ways to get rid of him.&nbsp; </p><p> “Because of that, he decided to talk to his wife and went on vacation for 5 years in the province. After 5 years, he returned to his family only to find out that his mother-in[-]law was still mad at him. He learned that his mother-in-law was telling his children nothing but his faults, that is why his children are mad at him.&nbsp; </p><p> “When he returned to his family, Zaira filed a case of rape against him.&nbsp; </p><p> “<strong>RAYMOND DEL AYRE</strong>, 19 years old, elder brother of private complainant, testified that on February 16, 1993 at 5:00 in the afternoon, he was in their house taking care of his siblings. On the same day, he woke up at 3:00 in the morning. His father and mother were then in the market. His father arrived between 8:00 and 8:30 in the morning. There was no room, nor division inside their small house, which is made up of wood and ‘yero’ (iron sheets). Their house is located in Binuangan, Obando, Bulacan. Their nearest neighbor is about an arm’s length. Beside their house is that of their maternal grandmother. Their aunt likewise lives in the same area. When asked to describe his relationship with his father on the dates when the alleged rape happened, he stated that his father is strict, always cursing and hot-headed.&nbsp; </p><p> “On cross-examination, he admitted having executed a sworn statement and subscribed it before Judge Quilantang, but his statement therein that he witnessed the rape incident on February 26, 1994 was a mere fabrication by him.&nbsp; </p><p> “On re-direct examination, he pointed to the policemen and the barangay captain as those who dictated the contents of his sworn statement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p align="center"> <b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> Finding “complainant’s categorical and coherent declarations” credible, the trial court ruled that appellant had carnal knowledge of complainant on February 16, 1993 and September 26, 1994. It held that his explicit threat to kill her and the other members of her family was strong enough to cow her into submission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> The court<em> a quo</em> further held that the alibi of appellant was unconvincing, considering the short distance and travel time between his house and the market, where he claimed to be at the time of the rape incidents. </p><p> Hence, this automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p align="center"> <u><b>Assignment of Errors</b></u>&nbsp; </p><p> In his Brief, appellant faults the court <em>a quo</em> with the following alleged errors:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="center"> I&nbsp; </p><p> “The trial court gravely erred in finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 1402-M-97 and 1403-M-97 despite the insufficiency of evidence for the prosecution.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> II&nbsp; </p><p> “The trial court erred in not giving any credence to the testimonial evidences for the defense of the accused.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> III&nbsp; </p><p> “Assuming in arguendo that the accused is guilty, the trial court committed grave error in imposing the death penalty in Criminal Case No. 1403-M-97 despite the lack of any qualifying circumstances alleged in the information.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p></blockquote><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> The appeal is partly meritorious. </p><p align="center"> <u><b>First Issue:</b></u>&nbsp; <br> <b><i><u>Sufficiency of Evidence</u></i></b>&nbsp; </p><p> By the very nature of rape, conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant and her testimony. Because the direct participants are often the only ones who have had personal knowledge of the commission of the rape, they are usually the only ones who can directly testify as to its occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, the strength of the prosecution’s evidence ultimately revolves around the credibility of the complaining witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In the present case, complainant related how her father had abused her as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><blockquote><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">“Q</td><td width="93%"> <div align="justify">On February 16, 1993 at around five o’clock in the morning, do you remember where you were?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center">x x x x x x x x x</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td> <div align="justify">I was in our house.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center">x x x x x x x x x</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">What about your father, where was your father at that time? </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">He accompanied my mother to the market.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td> <div align="justify">Did he return? </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir. </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">What time did he return?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td> <div align="justify">I do not know, sir.

Well-settled is the rule that when an alleged victim of rape says she has been violated, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her. So long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on that basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> Also sufficiently established was the employment of force by appellant on complainant, as well as the resistance she put up. His acts of dragging her as she defiantly clung to the door, removing her clothes, and placing her on the bed despite her objections clearly evinced the use of force. Resistance need not be carried out to the point of inviting death or sustaining physical injuries at the hands of the rapist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The force or violence that is required in rape cases is relative; when applied, it need not be overpowering or irresistible. That it enables the offender to consummate his purpose is enough.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The parties’ relative age, size and strength should be taken into account in evaluating the existence of the element of force in the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> In the present case, Zaira was just nine to ten years old at the time of the incidents and was no match against appellant, who was already an adult in the prime of his life. Furthermore, he was her father. Actual force and intimidation is not even necessary in incestuous rape. In a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the moral ascendency of the former over the latter substitutes for violence or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p> Moreover, where the girl -- such as complainant herein -- is below twelve (12) years of age at the time of the incident, violence or intimidation is not required, and the only subject of inquiry is whether “carnal knowledge” took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Proof of force and consent becomes immaterial, because force is not an element of statutory rape; when the rape victim is below age twelve, the absence of free consent is presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>Appellant contends that the age of the offended party was not sufficiently proven, because the prosecution did not present her birth certificate. We clarify. The presentation of the birth certificate is not an all-exclusive requisite in proving the age of the victim. Certainly, her age may be proven by evidence other than that. This principle was upheld in <em>People v. Tipay</em>, which we quote:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “This does not mean, however, that the presentation of the certificate of birth is at all times necessary to prove minority. The minority of a victim of tender age who may be below the age of ten is quite manifest and the court can take judicial notice thereof. The crucial years pertain to the ages of fifteen to seventeen where minority may seem to be dubitable due to one’s physical appearance.”</p></blockquote><p> Likewise, in <em>People v. Boras</em> we held as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “The testimony of the mother as to the age of her child is admissible in evidence for who else would be in the best position to know when she delivered the child. Besides, the court could very well assess whether or not the victim is below twelve years old by simply looking at her physique and built.”</p></blockquote><p> Current jurisprudence requires the presentation of the birth certificate of the alleged victim to ascertain her actual age, only when it is between 13 and 18<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> at the time of the sexual assault, or when there are ambiguous or conflicting testimonies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on record regarding it.</p><p> In the case at bar, there is no doubt that complainant was nine years old on February 16, 1993, and ten years old on September 26, 1994. Her categorical statement that she was 13 years old when questioned under oath in July<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and December<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; 1997 was not inconsistent with her testimony. On the witness stand, she said that she was nine (9) when her father had carnal knowledge of her for the first time on February 16, 1993; and ten (10) years old when the second incident took place on September 26, 1994. Her testimony regarding her age remains uncontradicted in the records. Even appellant categorically confirmed that she was 9 and 10 years old when the two incidents occurred. Indeed, with personal knowledge of his own daughter’s age, he himself offered unsolicited, independent and categorical statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on it, consistent with her claim.</p><p> Appellant also contends that her claim of rape is not supported by the medical findings, which state that the “hymen [of the victim] is intact but distendible and its orifice wide (2.5 cm in diameter) as to allow complete penetration by an average sized adult, Filipino male organ in full erection without producing any genital injury.” We disagree. The intact state of the victim’s hymen does not negate rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> especially considering its self-explanatory qualification or description in this case. That it is broken or lacerated is not an essential element of rape, not even where the victim is an innocent child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> <b><u>Second Issue:<br></u></b><u><i><b>Alibi</b></i></u>&nbsp; </p><p> Appellant, together with his wife, claims to have been in the market on the dates when the rapes were committed. However, no disinterested witness corroborated his alibi. Uncorroborated, it cannot prevail over the positive identification of him by complainant as the man who had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p>For alibi to succeed as a defense, appellant must establish by clear and convincing evidence (a) his presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense and (b) the physical impossibility of his presence at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, his alibi is demolished by the fact that it was not physically impossible for him to have been at their home where the rapes occurred. The market was just 15 minutes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> away. He could have easily gone to the market, returned home, raped his daughter, and then proceeded back to the market, as in fact testified to by the latter. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>Third Issue:<br></u></b><strong><u><i>Proper Penalty</i></u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> In both cases, appellant is liable for simple rape only, which is punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The rape that occurred on February 16, 1993 (Criminal Case No. 1402-M-97) cannot be punished with death, because RA 7659 was not yet effective at the time. Although it was already in effect when the rape on September 26, 1994 took place, still, the penalty of death cannot be imposed on him.</p><p> The reason why the death penalty cannot be imposed, even for the second offense, is that the father-daughter relationship of the parties was not alleged in the Information. “Such failure is fatal and bars conviction for rape in its qualified form, which is punishable with death. The concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender is a special qualifying circumstance that should both be alleged in the information and proven during the trial in order to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Even the OSG concedes that the death penalty was erroneously imposed by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> The court below did not award civil indemnity or exemplary damages to the victim. In accordance with current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> civil indemnity of P50,000 and exemplary damages of P25,000 are in order. Since the relationship was not alleged in either of the two Informations, it cannot be used to aggravate or qualify the rapes. However, even if not so alleged, an aggravating circumstance, when proven to have attended the commission of the crime, entitles the complainant to exemplary damages. In several cases, we have held that the relationship between the appellant and the rape victim justifies this civil award in order to deter fathers with perverse sexual behavior from abusing their daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Civil indemnity of P75,000 is awarded when death is also imposed.</p><p>The trial court awarded moral damages of P75,000. This should be lowered to P50,000 for each case in accordance with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan (Branch 78) is hereby <strong><i>AFFIRMED</i></strong> with the following <strong><i>MODIFICATIONS</i></strong>&nbsp; : (a) In Criminal Case No. 1403-M-97, the penalty is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>; (b) the victim is granted, in each case, civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> of P50,000 and exemplary damages of P25,000; and (c) the award of moral damages is changed to P50,000. </p><p> SO ORDERED. </p><p> <i>Bellosillo, (Acting C.J.), Puno, Vitug, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales</i>, and<i> Callejo, Sr., JJ</i>., concur. <i><br>Davide, Jr., C.J., Mendoza</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.</i>, abroad, on official leave. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 16-23; penned by Judge Gregorio S.
