Decision dated 30 April 1999 and the Resolution dated 16 February 2002 of the
Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></i></span></a>
in CA-G.R. SP No. 50122.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>The Facts<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Metro Transit Organization, Inc. (“MTO” for brevity)
is a government-owned and controlled corporation operating a light rail transit
(“LRT” for brevity), while petitioner Jovencio Bantang, Jr. (“Bantang” for
brevity) is an officer of MTO.  Respondent Ruperto Evangelista (“Evangelista” for brevity) worked as a
cash assistant in the Treasury Division of MTO.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 29, 1989, after completion of an inventory count of
tokens, petitioners discovered that 2,000 pieces of tokens were missing.  Petitioners conducted an investigation which
resulted in implicating Evangelista as one of the alleged perpetrators
responsible for the loss of the tokens.  The evidence presented against Evangelista included three handwritten
letters by three persons, namely: George Kasunuran, a vault keeper of MTO;
Renato Mendoza, a treasury personnel of MTO; and Edgardo de Leon, owner of a
token outlet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the handwritten letters, petitioners terminated
Evangelista’s employment on April 3, 1990 for lack of trust and
confidence.  Petitioners also filed a
criminal case for qualified theft against Evangelista before the prosecutor’s
office but the investigating prosecutor dismissed the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Evangelista filed a case for illegal dismissal
against petitioners.  On September 5,
1991, Labor Arbiter Oswald B. Lorenzo rendered a decision declaring that
petitioners illegally dismissed Evangelista.  The Labor Arbiter ordered petitioners to reinstate Evangelista to his
former position, with payment of full back wages.  The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter’s decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Declaring the dismissal of complainant Ruperto Evangelista, Jr.
as having been effected illegally by respondent Metro Transit Organization,
Inc. and Jovencio P. Bantang, Jr.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Ordering respondents to immediately reinstate complainant to his
former position without loss of seniority rights and other monetary benefits
with full back wages in the amount of FORTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY
PESOS AND FIFTY SIX CENTAVOS (<s>P</s>46,580.56);</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Respondent is further ordered to pay the thirteenth month due
the complainant in the amount of THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY AND ONE
PESOS (<s>P</s>3,881.00);</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. Respondent is further ordered to pay the award of moral damages
to complainant in the amount of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND (<s>P</s>25,000.00) PESOS
and exemplary damages in the amount of TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND (<s>P</s>25,000.00);
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. Finally, respondent is ordered to pay for and as attorney’s fees
the amount of TEN THOUSAND FORTY SIX PESOS AND TWENTY TWO CENTAVOS (<s>P</s>10,046.22)
which is equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the total award due the complainant
herein.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed the Labor Arbiter’s decision to the National
Labor Relations Commission (“NLRC” for brevity). The NLRC rendered a judgment
on March 7, 1996 affirming the Labor Arbiter’s decision but deleting the award
of moral and exemplary damages.  Petitioners did not file any motion for reconsideration. Instead,
petitioners directly filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari
under Rule 65.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1999, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision
dismissing the petition for certiorari filed by petitioners.  The Court of Appeals ruled that the special
civil action of certiorari will lie only if there is no appeal or any other
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.  The Court of Appeals held that the plain and
adequate remedy is a motion for reconsideration of the assailed NLRC decision,
which motion is mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the merits of the case, the Court of Appeals ruled that
petitioners failed to adduce substantial evidence to prove Evangelista’s
culpability for the loss of the 2,000 pieces of tokens.  Petitioners presented only the handwritten
letters implicating Evangelista.  The
Court of Appeals doubted the veracity of the handwritten letters because the
letters were not sufficiently identified.  The affidavit allegedly executed by petitioners’ principal witness,
Renato Mendoza (“Mendoza” for brevity), who identified Evangelista as the
culprit, was not sworn to before any administering officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals also found that petitioner Bantang prepared
Mendoza’s unsworn affidavit, and that Mendoza signed it under a threat of
dismissal if he failed to cooperate with petitioners.  Mendoza later renounced under oath before the investigating
prosecutor his unsworn affidavit which pointed to Evangelista as the culprit.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that petitioners failed to allow
Evangelista to explain his side during the investigation. Neither did
petitioners give Evangelista an opportunity to contest the veracity of the
handwritten letters presented against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals denied petitioners’ Motion for
Reconsideration.  Hence, the present
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evangelista did not file any comment to the instant petition
despite notices sent to him or his counsel at the address on record and despite
earnest efforts by petitioners to locate his new address and that of his
counsel.  Hence, in a Resolution dated
July 3, 2002, the Court considered the case submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>Issues<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners raise the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI UNDER RULE 65 OF THE RULES OF COURT IS NOT THE
PLAIN, SPEEDY AND ADEQUATE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO PETITIONERS;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS
COMMISSION IS NECESSARY BEFORE RESORTING TO A PETITION FOR CERTIORARI;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
PETITIONERS ILLEGALLY DISMISSED PRIVATE RESPONDENT.”</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>The Court’s Ruling<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We shall jointly discuss the first two issues raised by
petitioners since these are interrelated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that a motion for reconsideration is not
necessary before resort to the special civil action of certiorari under Rule
65.  Petitioners contend that they
availed of certiorari under Rule 65 with a prayer for a writ of preliminary
injunction to set aside the NLRC decision because certiorari is the plain,
speedy, adequate and only remedy available to petitioners.  Petitioners argue that without the
extraordinary relief of injunction, the NLRC can immediately execute the questioned
decision rendering the issues raised in the petition moot and academic.  Moreover, petitioners assert that a motion
for reconsideration of the NLRC decision is no longer necessary because the
questions that will be raised in the motion for reconsideration are the very
same questions which the NLRC already considered. </p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that a motion for reconsideration is
indispensable before resort to the special civil action for certiorari to
afford the court or tribunal the opportunity to correct its error, if any.   The rule is well-settled that the filing of a
motion for reconsideration is an indispensable condition to the filing of a
special civil action for certiorari, subject to certain exceptions.  Thus, in <b style=""><i style=""><a href="....2001mar2001143823.htm">Abraham v. NLRC</a></i></b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></i></span></a>
the Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“Generally, certiorari as a special civil action will not lie
unless a motion for reconsideration is filed before the respondent tribunal to
allow it an opportunity to correct its imputed errors. However, the following
have been recognized as exceptions to the rule:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where the order is a
patent of nullity, as where the <i>court a quo </i>has no jurisdiction;<span style=""> </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>where the questions
raised in the certiorari proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by
the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower
court;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where there is an
urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would
prejudice the interests of the Government or of the petitioner or the subject
matter of the action is perishable;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>where, under the
circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless</i>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where petitioner was
deprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where, in a criminal
case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent and the granting of such relief
by the trial court is improbable;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(g)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where the proceedings
in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where the proceedings
was <i>ex parte</i> or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(i)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where the issue
raised is one purely of law or where public interest is involved.” (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <b><i><a href="....2000june2000123619.htm">Seagull
Shipmanagement and Transport, Inc. v. NLRC</a></i></b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></i></span></a>
we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“xxx. The law intends to afford the tribunal, board or office, an
opportunity to rectify the errors and mistakes it may have lapsed into before
resort to the courts of justice can be had.  However, in the case at bar, petitioners had not only failed to explain
its failure to file a motion for reconsideration before the NLRC, it has also
failed to show sufficient justification for dispensing with the
requirement.  Certiorari cannot be
resorted to as a shield from the adverse consequences of petitioners' own
omission to file the required motion for reconsideration.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the records reveals that petitioners did not
file a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC decision.  As petitioners alleged in their petition
before the Court of Appeals, a motion for reconsideration is not necessary as
the questions raised before the court are the very same issues which the NLRC
already considered.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></i></span></a>
Except for this bare allegation, petitioners failed to show sufficient
justification for dispensing with the requirement of a prior motion for
reconsideration.  Petitioners failed to
state any justification that their case falls within any of the exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certiorari is not a shield from the adverse consequences of an
omission to file the required motion for reconsideration.  As correctly pointed out by the Court of
Appeals in its decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></i></span></a>
petitioners may not arrogate to themselves the determination of whether a
motion for reconsideration is necessary or not.  In <b><i>Zapata v.</i></b><i> <b>NLRC</b></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></i></span></a>
this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>“Petitioner cannot, on its bare and self-serving representation
that reconsideration is unnecessary, unilaterally disregard what the law
requires and deny respondent NLRC its right to review its pronouncements before
being hailed to court to account therefor.  On policy considerations, such prerequisite would provide an expeditious
termination to labor disputes and assist in the decongestion of court dockets
by obviating improvident and unnecessary recourse to judicial proceedings. The
present case exemplifies the very contingency sought to be, and which could
have been, avoided by the observance of said rules.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plain and adequate remedy referred to in Section 1 of Rule 65
is a motion for reconsideration of the assailed decision.  The purpose of this requirement is to enable
the court or agency to rectify its mistakes without the intervention of a
higher court.  To dispense with this
requirement, there must be a concrete, compelling, and valid reason for the
failure to comply with the requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that the findings of the Court of Appeals have
no basis in fact and are contrary to law.  Petitioners contend that the retraction of Mendoza is not sufficient to
overturn the other evidence which independently establish the guilt of
Evangelista.  Petitioners assert that
the Court of Appeals relied merely on the recantation of Mendoza.  Petitioners maintain that the Court of
Appeals disregarded the positive identification of Evangelista by another
witness, De Leon, the owner of the token outlet.  Petitioners claim that other than his bare denial, Evangelista
failed to present any other evidence to substantiate his self-serving denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioners lament that despite the overwhelming
evidence pointing to the guilt of Evangelista, the Court of Appeals still chose
to ignore the plain and concrete evidence warranting the termination of
Evangelista’s employment.  Petitioners
aver that the dismissal by the prosecutor of the criminal case against
respondent does not <i>ipso facto</i> make Evangelista’s dismissal
illegal.  Petitioners insist that the
dismissal by the prosecutor of a criminal complaint against an employee for
qualified theft does not bind the labor tribunal in determining whether the
employee has committed an act of dishonesty for stealing company property.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree with petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the criminal case for qualified theft against
Evangelista and the complaint for illegal dismissal against petitioners deal
with two different issues cognizable by two different tribunals.  Indeed, these two cases respectively require
distinct and well delineated degrees of proof.  Proof beyond reasonable doubt is required to sustain a criminal
conviction, while only substantial evidence is required to make a finding of
culpability in a labor case.  A labor
arbiter or tribunal may legally sustain an employee’s dismissal for dishonesty
in stealing company property even if the employee has not been convicted of
qualified theft in a criminal case arising from the same act.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></i></span></a>
Even if the employee is acquitted in the criminal case, he may still be legally
dismissed for the same act, unless the acquittal exonerates him from any
wrongdoing.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case, however, is a petition for review where only
questions of law may be raised.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></i></span></a>
What petitioners are attempting to do here is to urge the Court to re-examine
the probative value or evidentiary weight of the evidence presented below.  The Court cannot do this unless the
appreciation of the pieces of evidence on hand is glaringly erroneous.  This is where petitioners fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed the findings of both the NLRC and
the Labor Arbiter that petitioners failed to present substantial evidence to
establish that Evangelista stole the 2,000 pieces of tokens.  The findings of the Labor Arbiter, when
affirmed by the NLRC and the Court of Appeals, are binding on this Court unless
patently erroneous.  In the instant
case, we find no patent errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh all over
again the evidence already considered in the proceedings below.  The jurisdiction of this Court is limited
only to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower
courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></i></span></a>
Likewise, it is not for this Court to re-examine conflicting evidence,
re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of
an administrative tribunal which has expertise in its special field.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: &quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>
