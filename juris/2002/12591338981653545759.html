				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">An absolutely simulated contract of sale is void ab initio and transfers no ownership right.&nbsp; The purported buyer, not being the owner, cannot validly mortgage the subject property.&nbsp; Consequently, neither does the buyer at the foreclosure sale acquire any title thereto.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Statement of the Case</b></u><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the March 30, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR No. 58346.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the challenged Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, upon the premises, the assailed Decision is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. A new one is rendered declaring BANCOM’s right to the subject land as a purchaser in good faith and for value, and ordering the cancellation of the Notice of Lis Pendens on TCT No. 248262-Bulacan. Without pronouncement as to costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></div><br>The factual antecedents of the case are summarized by the Court of Appeals thus:<br><blockquote>“Brothers Rev. Fr. Edilberto Cruz and Simplicio Cruz, plaintiffs herein, were the registered owners of a 339,335 square meter or 33.9335 hectare parcel of agricultural land together with improvements located in Barangay Pulang Yantoc, Angat, Bulacan covered by TCT No. 19587.&nbsp; Sometime in May 1978, defendant Norma Sulit, after being introduced by Candelaria Sanchez to Fr. Cruz, offered to purchase the land.&nbsp; Plaintiffs’ asking price for the land was P700,000.00, but Norma only had P25,000.00 which Fr. Cruz accepted as earnest money with the agreement that titles would be transferred to Norma upon payment of the balance of P675,000.00.&nbsp; Norma failed to pay the balance and proposed [to] Fr. Cruz to transfer the property to her but the latter refused, obviously because he had no reason to trust Norma.&nbsp; But capitalizing on the close relationship of Candelaria Sanchez with the plaintiffs, Norma succeeded in having the plaintiffs execute a document of sale of the land in favor of Candelaria who would then obtain a bank loan in her name using the plaintiffs’ land as collateral.&nbsp; On the same day, Candelaria executed another Deed of Absolute Sale over the land in favor of Norma.&nbsp; In both documents, it appeared that the consideration for the sale of the land was only P150,000.00.&nbsp; Pursuant to the sale, Norma was able to effect the transfer of the title to the land in her name under TCT No. T-248262.<br><br>“Evidence shows that aside from the P150,000.00, Candelaria undertook to pay the plaintiffs the amount of P655,000.00 representing the balance of the actual price of the land.&nbsp; In a Special Agreement dated September 1, 1978, Norma assumed Candelaria’s obligation, stipulating to pay the plaintiffs the said amount within six months on pain of fine or penalty in case of non-fulfillment.&nbsp; Unknown to the plaintiffs, Norma managed to obtain a loan from Bancom in the amount of P569,000.00 secured by a mortgage over the land now titled in her name.<br><br>“On account of Norma’s failure to pay the amount stipulated in the Special Agreement and her subsequent disappearance from her usual address, plaintiffs were prompted to file the herein complaint for the reconveyance of the land.<br><br>“Norma filed an Answer on February 11, 1980 but failed to appear in court and was eventually declared in default.&nbsp; On May 20, 1980, Bancom filed a motion for leave to intervene which was granted by the trial court.&nbsp; In its Answer in Intervention, Bancom claimed priority as mortgagee in good faith; and that its contract of mortgage with Norma had been executed before the annotation of plaintiffs’ interest in the title.<br><br>“Meanwhile in the middle of 1980, Norma defaulted in her payment to the Bank and her mortgage was foreclosed.&nbsp; At the subsequent auction sale, Bancom was declared the highest bidder and was issued the corresponding certificate of sale over the land.<br><br>“On January 25, 1996, the trial court rendered the herein assailed Decision in favor of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; It ruled that the contract of sale between plaintiffs and Candelaria was absolutely simulated.&nbsp; Consequently, the second contract of sale, that is, between Candelaria and Norma, produced no legal effect.&nbsp; As for Bancom, the trial court held that the Bank was not a mortgagee in good faith thus it can not claim priority of rights over plaintiffs’ property.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>In reversing the RTC, the CA held that the Deeds of Sale were valid and binding, not simulated.&nbsp; Thus, the Contract of Mortgage between Sulit and respondent was likewise valid.<br><br>Petitioners, the CA ruled, intended to be bound by the Contracts of Sale and Mortgage, because they “did not seek to annul the same but instead executed a special agreement to enforce payment of the balance of the price in the amount of P665,000.00.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, it upheld respondent as a “mortgagee in good faith;” ergo, it had a preferential right to the land.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></div><br>In their Memorandum, petitioners raise the following issues for this Court’s consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>“Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals seriously erred when it held that the petitioners intended to enter into a sale of the property in question and that the declarations of Petitioner Fr. Edilberto Cruz in Court belied the court <i>a quo’s</i> finding that the Deeds of Sale in question were absolute simulations.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>“Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals gravely erred when it ruled that respondent bank was a mortgagee in good faith, despite the fact that respondent Bancom was in truth and in fact a mortgagee in bad faith over the subject property.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>“Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals seriously erred when it ruled that the face of the title [to] the property did not disclose any irregularity that would arouse suspicion by respondent bank as to the condition of the subject land despite the fact that questions and circumstances abound which would render respondent bank not a mortgagee in good faith, and that the case of <i>Sunshine Finance Investment Corporation vs. Intermediate Appellate Court</i> applies to the instant case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>“Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals gravely erred when it ruled that respondent bank possesses a preferential right over petitioners on the subject land as a mortgagee in good faith.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>The above issues can be summed up into two:&nbsp; (1) the validity of the Deeds of Sale and Mortgage and (2) the good faith of the mortgagee.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>This Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>First Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Validity of the Sale and the Mortgage</i></b></u><br></div><br>Petitioners claim that the Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> they executed with Sanchez, as well as the Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> executed between Sanchez and Sulit, was absolutely simulated; hence, null and void.&nbsp; On the other hand, echoing the appellate court, respondent contends that petitioners intended to be bound by those Deeds, and that the real estate mortgage over the subject property was valid.<br><br>As a general rule, when the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous about the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.&nbsp; But if the words appear to contravene the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The real nature of a contract may be determined from the express terms of the agreement, as well as from the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, simulation takes place when the parties do not really want the contract they have executed to produce the legal effects expressed by its wordings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Simulation or vices of declaration may be either absolute or relative.&nbsp; Article 1345 of the Civil Code distinguishes an absolute simulation from a relative one while Article 1346 discusses their effects, as follows:<br><blockquote>“Art. 1345. Simulation&nbsp; of a contract may be absolute or relative. The former takes place when the parties do not intend to be bound at all; the latter when the parties conceal their true agreement.<br><br>“Art. 1346. An absolutely simulated contract is void. A relative simulation, when it does not prejudice a third person and is not intended for any purpose contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy binds the parties to their agreement.”</blockquote>In <i><b>Rongavilla v. Court of Appeals</b></i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we&nbsp; held that a deed of sale, in which the stated consideration had not in fact been paid, was “a false contract”; that is “void ab initio.”&nbsp; Furthermore, <b><i>Ocejo v. Flores,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> ruled that “a contract of purchase and sale is null and void and produces no effect whatsoever where it appears that [the] same is without cause or consideration which should have been the motive thereof, or the purchase price which appears thereon as paid but which in fact has never been paid by the purchaser to the vendor.”<br><br>Although the Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> between petitioners and Sanchez stipulated a consideration of P150,000, there was actually no exchange of money between them.&nbsp; Petitioner Edilberto Cruz narrated how the transaction came about:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY.

Supposedly, because the two failed to pay the purchase price of the land, they could not force petitioners to vacate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The records clearly show that the two Deeds of Absolute Sale were executed over the same property on the same date, June 21, 1978.&nbsp; Six days thereafter, on June 27, 1978, it was mortgaged by Sulit to Federal Insurance Company for P500,000.&nbsp; The mortgage was cancelled when she again mortgaged the property to respondent for P569,000 on August 22, 1979.&nbsp;

On the other hand, respondent maintains that petitioners were the ones in bad faith, because they already had knowledge of the existence of the mortgage over the property when they caused the annotation of their adverse claim and notice of <i>lis pendens</i>.<br><br>As a general rule, every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title and is no longer required to look behind the certificate in order to determine the actual owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> To do so would be contrary to the evident purpose of Section 39 of Act 496 which we quote hereunder:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 39. Every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of registration, and every subsequent purchaser of registered land who takes a certificate of title for value in good faith shall hold the same free of all encumbrances except those noted on said certificate, and any of the following encumbrances which may be subsisting, namely:<br><br>“<i>First</i>. Liens, claims, or rights arising or existing under the laws or Constitution of the United States or of the Philippine Islands which the statutes of the Philippine Islands cannot require to appear of record in the Registry.<br><br>“<i>Second</i>.

Any public highway, way, private way established by law, or any Government irrigation canal or lateral thereof, where the certificate of title does not state that the boundaries of such highway, way, or irrigation canal or lateral thereof, have been determined.<br><br>“But if there are easements or other rights appurtenant to a parcel of registered land which for any reason have failed to be registered, such easements or rights shall remain so appurtenant notwithstanding such failure, and shall be held to pass with the land until cut off or extinguished by the registration of the servient estate, or in any other manner.”</blockquote>This rule is, however, subject to the right of a person deprived of land through fraud to bring an action for reconveyance, provided the rights of innocent purchasers for value and in good faith are not prejudiced.&nbsp; An <span style="font-style: italic;">innocent purchaser for value</span> or any equivalent phrase shall be deemed, under Section 38 of the same Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee or any other encumbrancer for value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respondent claims that, being an innocent mortgagee, it should not be required to conduct an exhaustive investigation on the history of the mortgagor’s title before it could extend a loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Respondent, however, is not an ordinary mortgagee; it is a mortgagee-bank.&nbsp; As such, unlike private individuals, it is expected to exercise greater care and prudence in its dealings, including those involving registered lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A banking institution is expected to exercise due diligence before entering into a mortgage contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The ascertainment of the status or condition of a property offered to it as security for a loan must be a standard and indispensable part of its operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In <i>Rural Bank of Compostela v.
