				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellants Donel Go and Val de los Reyes were charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tabaco, Albay with two and three counts of rape, respectively, all committed against Imelda Brutas. Of the two, only accused-appellant Go was initially apprehended; de los Reyes remained at large. <p>Arraigned on May 3, 1995, accused-appellant Go pleaded not guilty to the charges. Before the prosecution could finish presenting evidence, he jumped bail and was tried <i>in absentia</i>.</p> <p>The evidence for the prosecution consists of the testimonies of its five witnesses, namely: private complainant Imelda Brutas, her mother Adela, sister Clara, Dr. Marissa Saguinsin of the Rural Helath Unit in Tabaco, Albay, and SPO4 Rosalino Bonavente; Imelda’s panty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>and watch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which she was wearing when the rape allegedly occurred; the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> about the entry in the police blotter of Imelda’s complaint; the medical certificates issued by Dr. Estela Zenit of the Ziga Memorial District Hospital<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and Dr. Marissa Saguinsin of the Rural Health Unit in Tabaco, Albay;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the affidavit executed by Marivic after the alleged incident;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the photographs of accused-appellants Go and de los Reyes;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and the Referral Form of the ABS-CBN program "Hoy Gising."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> <p>For the defense, the testimonies of five witnesses were offered.</p> <p>In its Decision of June 25, 1997, Branch 16 of the RTC of Tabaco, Albay found accused-appellant Go guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and sentenced him to suffer the <u>death</u> penalty for each count. An alias warrant of arrest against accused-appellant de los Reyes was issued and the cases against him were archived.</p> <p>Hence, the automatic review of the cases against accused-appellant Go, docketed herein as G.R. Nos. 130714 and 139634.</p> <p>Accused-appellant de los Reyes was later apprehended, hence, Branch 16 of the Tabaco, Albay RTC ordered the revival of the cases against him. On December 3, 1997, the cases were transferred to Branch 15 of the same court, it having been designated by this Court as a heinous crimes court. At his arraignment on January 8, 1998, he pleaded not guilty to all three charges of rape. Trial ensued thereafter.</p> <p>Except for SPO4 Bonavente, the same prosecution witnesses who testified at the trial of accused-appellant Go were availed of at the trial of accused-appellant de los Reyes.</p> <p>When Adela Brutas, Imelda’s mother, was called to the witness stand, the private prosecutor started rereading the questions and answers as recorded in the transcript of her testimony <b>at the trial of accused-appellant Go</b>. Before he could go over the entire transcript, however, the defense counsel objected. The private prosecutor thereupon asked Adela, as the following transcript of the proceedings, quoted <i>verbatim</i>, shows, if she affirmed all her answers appearing in the transcript of stenographic notes taken during her testimony at the trial of accused-appellant Go: </p> <blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2">[Private prosecutor Atty.

Estenzo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> after the therein accused had testified, the defense counsel manifested that for the subsequent witnesses, he was filing only their affidavits subject to cross-examination by the prosecution on matters therein and on all matters pertinent and material thereto. The trial court acceded to the manifestation over the objection of one of the private prosecutors.</p> <p>This Court held that such procedure violated Sections 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Rule 132 and Section 1, Rule 133<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the then Revised Rules of Court, which required that the testimonies of witnesses be given orally. Those provisions are substantially reproduced in the Revised Rules of Court as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p>SECTION 1. <i>Examination to be done in open court.</i> — The examination of witnesses presented in a trial or hearing shall be done in open court, and under oath or affirmation. <u>Unless the witness is incapacitated to speak, or the question calls for a different mode of answer, the answers of the witness shall be given orally</u>.</p> <p>SEC. 2. <i>Proceedings to be recorded</i>. ­ The entire proceedings of a trial or hearing, including <u>the questions propounded to a witness and his answers thereto</u>, the statements made by the judge or any of the parties, counsel, or witnesses with reference to the case, <u>shall be recorded</u> by means of shorthand or stenotype or by other means of recording found suitable by the court.</p> <p>A transcript of the record of the proceedings made by the official stenographer, stenotypist or recorder and certified as correct by him shall be deemed<i> prima facie</i> a correct statement of such proceedings. (Rule 131.)</p> <p>SECTION 1. <i>Preponderance of evidence, how determined</i>. — In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence. In determining where the preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues involved lies, the court may consider all the facts and circumstances of the case, <u>the witnesses’ manner of testifying</u>, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial. The court may also consider the number of witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number. (Rule 133, underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote> <p>The Court, still in <i>Estenzo</i>, elaborated: </p> <blockquote> <p>The main and essential purpose of requiring a witness to appear and testify orally at a trial is to secure for the adverse party the opportunity o f cross-examination. "The opponent," according to an eminent authority, "demands confrontation, not for the idle purpose of gazing upon the witness, or of being gazed upon by him, but for the purpose of cross-examination which cannot be had except by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers." There is also the advantage to be obtained by the personal appearance of the witness before the judge, and it is this—it enables the judge as the trier of facts "to obtain the <i>elusive and incommunicable evidence of a witness’ deportment while testifying</i>, and a certain subjective moral effect is produced upon the witness." <b>It is only when the witness testifies <u>orally</u> that the judge may have a true idea of his countenance, manner and expression, which may confirm or detract from the weight of his testimony. Certainly, the physical condition of the witness will reveal his capacity for accurate observation and memory, and his deportment and physiognomy will reveal clues to his character. These can only be observed by the judge if the witness testifies <u>orally</u> in court. Indeed, the great weight given the findings of fact of the trial judge in the appellate court is based upon his having had just that opportunity and the assumption that he took advantage of it to ascertain the credibility of the witnesses</b>. x x x.</p> <p>Thus, Section 1 of Rule 133 of the Rules requires that in determining the superior weight of evidence on the issues involved, the court, aside from the other factors therein enumerated, may consider the "witness’ manner of testifying" which can only be done if the witness gives his testimony "orally in open court." <b>If a trial judge prepares his opinion immediately after the conclusion of the trial, with the evidence and his impressions of the witnesses fresh in his mind, it is obvious that <u>he is much more likely to reach a correct result than if he simply reviews the evidence from a typewritten transcript, without having had the opportunity to see, hear and observe the actions and utterances of the witness</u></b>.</p> <p>There is an additional advantage to be obtained in requiring that the direct testimony of the witness be given orally in court. Rules governing the examination of witness are intended to protect the rights of litigants and to secure orderly dispatch of the business of the courts. Under the rules, only questions directed to the eliciting of testimony which, under the general rules of evidence, is relevant to, and competent to prove, the issue of the case, may be propounded to the witness. A witness may testify only to those facts which he knows of his own knowledge. Thus, on direct examination, leading questions are not allowed, except on preliminary matters, or when there is difficulty in getting direct and intelligible answer from the witness who is ignorant, a child of tender years, or feebleminded, or a deaf-mute. It is obvious that such purpose may be subverted, and the orderly dispatch of the business of the courts thwarted, if trial judges are allowed, as in the case at bar, to adopt any procedure in the presentation of evidence other than what is specifically authorized by the Rules of Court.

This Court held that the witness "should have been examined directly on the statements in her affidavit." The same rule applies in the present cases against accused-appellant de los Reyes where the prosecution witnesses were merely asked to confirm their testimonies given at the trial of another in which he took no part.</p> <p>The apprehensions of the prosecution that the lapse of time may have compromised the memory of the witnesses are understandable. But following this line of thought, would not the witnesses have just the same gone over the transcripts of their testimonies during the trial of accused-appellant Go to refresh them to thereby enable them to answer the questions of accused-appellant de los Reyes’ counsel on cross-examination?</p> <p>In any event, lapse of time is a matter that the trial court would consider in weighing the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies; it does not justify the abbreviated procedure adopted by the trial court, especially considering that the case against accused-appellant Go was tried before <b>another branch</b> of the RTC.</p> <p>As irregularities prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial, the accused is entitled to a new trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup>All the proceedings and evidence affected by such irregularities must thus be set aside and taken anew.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p> <p>Accordingly, the Court, with respect to the cases against accused-appellant de los Reyes, sets aside Exhibits "D," "E-2," "E-2-I," "F" and "G", the transcripts of the testimonies of witnesses Adela, Dr. Saguinsin, Imelda, and Clara Brutas, respectively, in the trial of accused-appellant Go.</p> <p>Exhibits "A" (the panty), "B" (the wrist watch), "C" (the Certification of entry in the Police Blotter), and “H” (the Referral Form of the ABS-CBN program), none of which were identified by any of the witnesses during the trial of accused-appellant de los Reyes, are likewise set aside for lack of basis.</p> <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court Resolved to <b><i>VACATE </i></b>the judgment of Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court of Tabaco, Albay in Criminal Case Nos. T-2639-41, "People v. Val de los Reyes", and to <i><b>SET ASIDE</b></i> Exhibits "A," "B," "C," "D," "E-2," "E-2-A" to "E-2-I," "F," "G" and "H." Said criminal cases are <b><i>REMANDED</i></b> to Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court of Tabaco, Albay for the immediate rehearing of the testimonies of witnesses Adela Brutas, Imelda Brutas, Clara Brutas and Dr. Marissa Saguinsin, in accordance with this Court’s above disquisition. The trial court is further directed to conduct said proceedings and render a decision thereon within 90 days from receipt of this Resolution.
