R. SP Nos. 47158 and 47720, on September 15, 2000, complainants filed with the Supreme Court the instant administrative complaint against respondent justices and employees of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complainants alleged that they lost possession of the subject property due to the “malicious, deliberate and unlawful issuance” of Justices Demetria and Barcelona of the March 23, 1998 restraining order. Justices Demetria, Barcelona and Barrios further perpetrated an injustice when they promulgated the decision of August 21, 1998, and issued the writ of execution pending appeal dated September 21, 1998, despite the pendency of appeal with the Supreme Court. Complainants charged respondent justices, particularly the <i>ponente</i>, Justice Demetria, with violating pertinent provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>On May 4, 2001, the Court required respondents to file their respective comments on the complaint within ten (10) days from receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On May 31, 2001, respondents Justices Ramon A. Barcelona and Roberto A. Barrios, and Division Clerk of Court Teresita R. Marigomen filed a joint comment claiming innocence of the charges against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On June 21, 2001, respondent Justice Demetria filed his comment asserting good faith and basically adopting the defenses and arguments of his co-respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On October 4, 2001, respondent Rivamonte filed his comment stating that he only complied with the orders of his superiors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>With regard to the resolution of March 23, 1998, respondent Justice Barcelona alleged that his concurrence in the issuance of the temporary restraining order was done “in good faith and in deference to the discretion of the <i>ponente</i>,” respondent Justice Demetria, “who has knowledge of the soundness and factual merits of the case.” We find this a wrongful approach to the issue.&nbsp; Concurrence must be based on the justice’s conviction after mature deliberation, not deference to the <i>ponente</i>.&nbsp; Obviously, the procedure adopted showed that there was no due deliberation on the case by the justices of the division.&nbsp; After the division members signed the resolution, the division members would not know the completeness of the signatures in the resolution since its release was ordered by the <i>ponente</i>, not by the Division Chairman.&nbsp; Hence, the division members would not know if the resolution was promulgated without the required number of signatures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent Justice Demetria maintained that the issuance of the March 23, 1998 resolution temporarily restraining the enforcement of the writ of&nbsp; execution in Civil Case No. 113-97 has sound basis in law and jurisprudence and was made after a thorough study by him.<br><br>Respondent Marigomen noted nothing erroneous or anomalous upon seeing only two (2) signatures in the resolution of March 23, 1998, as it is legally permissible for a single justice to issue restraining orders, citing Rule 58, Section 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 3, Section 9,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Court’s Ruling</u><br></div><br>Respondents’ submissions are patently without merit.&nbsp; There is no question regarding the authority of the Court of Appeals to issue a preliminary writ of injunction or temporary restraining order pending the resolution of petitions and appeals within its jurisdiction, especially in meritorious cases.&nbsp; What is questionable is the irregular procedure by which the March 23, 1998 resolution was arrived at and served on the parties.<br><br>As it is, only two members of the Court of Appeals, Special Fourth Division, respondents Justices Demetria, <i>ponente</i>, and Barcelona, member, concurring, signed the resolution. Justice Omar U. Amin, member, did not sign.&nbsp; Hence, the resolution may not be received for filing, much less served on the parties.&nbsp; The clear intent of the division members was for the three members to act on the resolution.&nbsp; It is true that under the rules, a member of the Court of Appeals may issue a temporary restraining order. However, he shall advisedly use such power sparingly, in case of extreme necessity where there are compelling reasons to abate or avoid a grave injury to a party.&nbsp; And, such issuance must be submitted to the Court for ratification at the very next session of the Court.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, we find that Justice Demetria, as <i>ponente</i>, disregarded existing rules of procedure.&nbsp; Considering that what he violated were the same rules of procedure he was expected and required to observe, such failure to comply was inexcusable.&nbsp; When the law transgressed is elementary, the failure to know or observe it constitutes gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As regards respondent Marigomen, we find her explanation deferential to the views of respondent justices.&nbsp; As division clerk of court, she is bound by the prevailing rules of procedure of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Among her duties and responsibilities, she shall maintain the records of the Division in an orderly manner and keep watch over the status and progress of cases assigned to the Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She is expected to immediately report to the Justice assigned to study the case the failure of any party or parties to comply with any resolution or order of the Court within the period prescribed therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She should have called the attention of the <i>ponente</i> upon seeing the incomplete signatures on the resolution.&nbsp; It should have been obvious that the resolution issuing a temporary restraining order was intended as a collegiate act, not the order of a single justice.&nbsp; She should not have released and allowed the said resolution to be served on the parties.<br><br>Respondent Justice Barcelona may be absolved of administrative complicity regarding the issuance of a temporary restraining order.&nbsp; He had no knowledge about the lack of the requisite third signature before the resolution was promulgated.&nbsp; After affixing his signature, the resolution was not submitted to the Chairman for promulgation and release by the Division Clerk of Court.<br><br>However, we find it grossly appalling that the Court of Appeals’ former Special Third Division (Barcelona, Demetria and Barrios, JJ.) immediately enforced its decision pending appeal. Worse, the Court of Appeals (2<sup>nd</sup> Division, Cui, Barcelona and Demetria, JJ.) directed the Chief of the Mailing Section to appoint a special sheriff to carry out the writ of execution pending appeal.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals has no authority to issue immediate execution pending appeal of its own decision.&nbsp; Discretionary execution under Rule 39, Section 2(a), Revised Rules of Court, as amended, applies to a judgment or final order of the <b>trial court</b>, upon good reasons to be stated in a special order after due hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Respondents Justices Barcelona and Barrios state that they were impressed by the good reasons posited by Manila Builders, that is, deprivation of income and its mounting&nbsp; obligations and liabilities. On the other hand, respondent Justice Demetria explained that there is no prohibition, whether expressed or implied, regarding the authority of the Court of Appeals to issue immediate execution pending appeal of its own decision.<br><br>We find no merit in respondents’ ratiocinations.&nbsp; Rule 51, Section 11,&nbsp; Revised Rules of Court expressly provides that the judgment of the Court of Appeals shall be remanded to the lower court for execution ten (10) days after entry of judgment, unless&nbsp; notice&nbsp; is&nbsp; given&nbsp; that&nbsp; the decision would be appealed to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; By requiring the remand of the records to the lower court after the entry of judgment, the rules completely cut off any authority of the Court of Appeals to directly undertake the execution of the final judgment, much less the authority to order its execution pending its finality.<br><br>The Court cannot permit any act or omission, which yanks public faith away from the judiciary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> for a judge’s utter lack of familiarity with the rules undermines public confidence in the competence of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In fact, the Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that judges must be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence.&nbsp; He must have the basic rules at the palm of his hand and be proficient in the interpretation of laws and procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Respondent justices argue that they did not have prior knowledge about the pendency of the petition before the Supreme Court, for had they <b>learned about it,</b> they would <b>not</b> have <b>allowed the execution</b> of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The record belies such pharisaical stance.&nbsp; In the first place, the Court of Appeals was furnished with a copy of the petition.&nbsp; Secondly, the petitioners filed a manifestation expressly opposing execution pending appeal because they had elevated the case to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ignored petitioners’ protestations.&nbsp; Thirdly, the dispositive portion of the September 18, 1998 expressly acknowledged that the decision was <u>not final</u>, to wit:<br><blockquote>“Accordingly, this Court hereby <b>RESOLVE</b>S to grant the instant petition.<br><br>“1. A writ of Execution <b>Pending Appeal of the Decision of this Court</b> dated August 21, 1998 is hereby issued.<br><br>“x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>A scrutiny of the record reveals that respondent Justice Barrios did not take part in the appointment of respondent Rivamonte as special sheriff. The Court (Second Division, Cui, Barcelona and Demetria, JJ.) by minute resolution dated September 21, 1998, directed the Chief mailing section to appoint a special sheriff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Indeed, respondent Justice Demetria has shown keen interest in the immediate execution of the decision despite the Court of Appeal’s lack of authority to appoint a special sheriff.&nbsp; The appointment of a special sheriff, in the person of respondent Rivamonte, encroached on the authority of the Supreme Court as the <b>appointing power</b> of <b>all officials and employees of the judiciary.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court of Appeals has no authority to appoint or to direct any of its employees to appoint a special sheriff,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> who was not even bonded as required by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>With regard to respondent Rivamonte, considering that he relied on the belief that he was performing a ministerial duty of carrying out the orders of his superiors, which he thought to be lawful and valid, and in the absence of malice and bad faith, he may be absolved of administrative liability.&nbsp; However, as the assigned task was not within the scope of his duties as process server in the mailing section, prudence and caution dictated that he declines to perform the assignment.&nbsp; He is hereby warned that a repetition of the same or similar acts would be meted out with the appropriate penalty.<br><br>With regard to the allegation that respondent Justices Demetria, Barcelona and Barrios knowingly rendered an unjust judgment against complainants in the certiorari petition, a review of the record would reveal insufficient evidence of bad faith or ill motive on the part of the magistrates concurring in the <i>ponencia</i>.&nbsp; At most, there was a lack of deliberation on the issues presented. This would not automatically warrant administrative sanctions against the justices,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> in the absence of a showing of any bad faith, malice or corrupt purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In order to discipline a judge, it must be clearly shown that the judgment or order is unjust as being contrary to law and that the judge rendered it with conscious and deliberate intent to do an injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Judges cannot be subjected to liability — civil, criminal&nbsp; or administrative — for any of their official acts, no matter how erroneous, so long as they act in good faith.&nbsp; It is only when they act fraudulently or corruptly, or with gross ignorance may they be held criminally or administratively responsible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> An erroneous decision or order is presumed to have been issued in good faith in the absence of proof to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>We find it apt to stress before we close that it is the duty of the members of the bench to avoid any impression of impropriety to protect the image and integrity of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Judges must not only render just, correct and impartial decisions, but must do so in a manner free of any suspicion as to their fairness, impartiality and integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> For, the conception of good judges has been, and is, of men who have a mastery of the principles of law, who discharge their duties in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Respondent Rivamonte may be absolved of administrative liability but must be admonished and warned to be more cautious in the discharge of his duties.<br><br>The Judgment<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the Court finds respondent Justice Demetrio G.
