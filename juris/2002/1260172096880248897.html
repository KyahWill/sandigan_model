Cruz, Marinduque.&nbsp; The principal loan of US$ 15,000,000.00 was sourced from ADB’s ordinary capital resources, while the complementary loan of US$ 25,000,000.00 was funded by the Bank of Nova Scotia, a participating finance institution.<br><br>On even date, ADB and Placer Dome, Inc., (Placer Dome), a foreign corporation which owns&nbsp; 40% of Marcopper, executed a “Support and Standby Credit Agreement” whereby the latter agreed to provide Marcopper with cash flow support for the payment of its obligations to ADB.<br><br>To secure the loan, Marcopper executed in favor of ADB a&nbsp; “Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated November 11, 1992, covering substantially all of its (Marcopper’s) properties and assets in Marinduque.

(<i>Far East International Import and Export Corporation vs. Nankai Kogyo Co. supra</i>).</b><br><br>“On the issue of whether petitioner is the bona fide owner of all the mining facilities and equipment of Marcopper, petitioner relies heavily on the Assignment Agreement allegedly executed on March 20, 1997 wherein all the rights and interest of Asian Development Bank (ADB) in a purported Loan Agreement were ceded and transferred in favor of the petitioner as assignee, in addition to a subsequent Deed of Assignment dated December 28, 1997 conveying absolutely all the properties, mining equipment and facilities of Marcopper in favor of petitioner.<br><br>“The Deeds of Assignment executed in favor of petitioner cannot be binding on the judgment creditor, private respondent Solidbank, under the general legal principle that contracts can only bind the parties who had entered into it, and it cannot favor or prejudice a third person (<i>Quano vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 211 SCRA 40). Moreover, by express stipulation, the said deeds shall be governed, interpreted and construed in accordance with laws of New York.<br><br><b>“The Deeds of Assignment executed by Marcopper, through its President, Atty.

The second Deed of Assignment purportedly executed on December 28, 1997 was entered into by President Gabor after Solidbank had filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, after the rendition by Branch 26 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila of a Partial Summary Judgment and after the said trial court had issued a writ of execution, and which judgment was later affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</b> While the assignments (which were not registered with the Registry of Property as required by Article 1625 of the new Civil Code) may be valid between the parties thereof, it produces no effect as against third parties.

Petitioner likewise maintains that the two assignment contracts, although executed during the pendency of Civil Case No. 96-80083 in the RTC of Manila, are not fraudulent conveyances as they were supported by valuable considerations.&nbsp; Moreover, they were executed in connection with prior transactions that took place as early as 1992 which involved ADB, a reputable financial institution.&nbsp; Petitioner further claims that when it paid Marcopper’s obligation to ADB, it stepped into the latter’s shoes and acquired its (ADB’S) rights, titles, and interests under the “Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage.”&nbsp; Lastly, petitioner asserts its existence as a corporation, separate and distinct from Placer Dome and Marcopper.<br><br>In its comment, Solidbank avers that: <b>a)</b> petitioner is “doing business” in the Philippines and this is evidenced by the “huge investment” it poured into the assignment contracts; <b>b)</b> granting that petitioner is not doing business in the Philippines, the nature of its transaction reveals an “intention to do business” or “to begin a series of transaction” in the country; <b>c)</b> petitioner, Marcopper and Placer Dome are one and the same entity, petitioner being then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Placer Dome,&nbsp; which, in turn, owns 40% of Marcopper; <b>d)</b> the timing under which the assignments contracts were executed shows that petitioner’s purpose was to defeat any judgment favorable to it (Solidbank); and <b>e)</b> petitioner violated the rule on forum shopping since the object of Civil Case No. 98-13 (at RTC, Boac, Marinduque) is similar to the other cases filed by Marcopper in order to forestall the sale of the levied properties.<br><br>Marcopper, in a separate comment, states that it is merely a nominal party to the present case and that its principal concerns are being ventilated in another case.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>Crucial to the outcome of this case is our resolution of the following issues:&nbsp; <b>1)</b> Does petitioner have the legal capacity to sue?&nbsp; <b>2)</b> Was the Deed of Assignment between Marcopper and petitioner executed in fraud of creditors? <b>3)</b> Are petitioner MR Holdings, Ltd., Placer Dome, and Marcopper one and the same entity? and <b>4)</b>&nbsp; Is petitioner guilty of forum shopping?<br><br>We shall resolve the issues <i>in seriatim.</i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>I</b><br></div><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that petitioner has no legal capacity to sue in the Philippine courts because it is a foreign corporation doing business here without license.&nbsp; A review of this ruling does not pose much complexity as the principles governing a foreign corporation’s&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp; sue in local courts have long been settled by our Corporation Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> These principles may be condensed in three statements, to wit: <b>a)</b> if a foreign corporation <b>does business</b> in the Philippines <b>without a license,</b> it <b>cannot sue</b> before the Philippine courts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <b>b)</b> if a foreign corporation is <b>not doing business</b> in the Philippines, it <b>needs no license to sue</b> before Philippine courts on an isolated transaction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>or on a cause of action entirely independent of any business transaction;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and&nbsp; <b>c)</b> if a foreign corporation <b>does business</b> in the Philippines with the required license, it <span style="font-weight: bold;">can sue</span> before Philippine courts on any transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, it is not the absence of the prescribed license but the “doing&nbsp; (of) business” in the Philippines without such license which debars the foreign corporation from access to our courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The task at hand requires us to weigh the facts <i>vis-à-vis</i> the established principles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question whether or not a foreign corporation is doing business is dependent principally upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, considered in the light of the purposes and language of the pertinent statute or statutes involved and of the general principles governing the jurisdictional authority of the state over such corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Batas Pambansa Blg. 68, otherwise known as “The Corporation Code of the Philippines,” is silent&nbsp; as to what constitutes doing” or&nbsp; “transacting” business in the Philippines.&nbsp; Fortunately, jurisprudence has supplied the deficiency and&nbsp; has held that the term “implies a continuity of commercial dealings and arrangements, and contemplates, to that extent, the performance of acts or works or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of, the purpose and object for which the corporation was organized.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In <i>Mentholatum Co. Inc., vs. Mangaliman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> this Court laid down the test to determine whether a foreign company is&nbsp; “doing business,” thus:<br><blockquote>“ x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; <b>The true test, however, seems to be whether the foreign corporation is continuing the body or substance of the business or enterprise for which it was organized or whether it has substantially retired from it and turned it over to another</b>. (<i>Traction Cos. vs. Collectors of Int. Revenue</i> [C.C.A., Ohio], 223 F. 984,987.) x x x.”</blockquote>The traditional case law definition has metamorphosed into a statutory definition, having been adopted with some qualifications in various pieces of legislation in our jurisdiction.&nbsp; For instance, Republic Act No. 7042, otherwise known as the “Foreign Investment Act of 1991,” defines&nbsp; “doing business” as follows:<br><blockquote>“<b>d)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase ‘doing business’ shall include soliciting orders, service contracts, opening offices, whether called ‘liaison’ offices or branches; appointing representatives or distributors domiciled in the Philippines or who in any calendar year stay in the country for a period or periods totalling one hundred eight(y) (180) days or more; participating in the management, supervision or control of any domestic business, firm, entity, or corporation in the Philippines; and <b>any other act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements, and contemplate to that extent the performance of acts or works; or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the business organization;</b> <i>Provided, however</i>, That the phrase ‘doing business’ shall not be deemed to include mere investment as a shareholder by a foreign entity in domestic corporations duly registered to do business, and/or the exercise of rights as such investor, nor having a nominee director or officer to represent its interests in such corporation, nor appointing a representative or distributor domiciled in the Philippines which transacts business in its own name and for its own account.” (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>Likewise, Section 1 of Republic Act No. 5455,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> provides that:<br><blockquote>“<b>SECTION. 1.</b> <i>Definition and scope of this Act.</i> - (1) x x x the phrase ‘doing business’ shall include soliciting orders, purchases, service contracts, opening offices, whether called ‘liaison’ offices or branches; appointing representatives or distributors who are domiciled in the Philippines or who in any calendar year stay in the Philippines for a period or periods totaling one hundred eighty days or more; participating in the management, supervision or control of any domestic business firm, entity or corporation in the Philippines; and <b>any other&nbsp; act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or arrangements, and contemplate to that extent the performance of acts or works, or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the business organization.”</b></blockquote>There are other statutes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> defining the term “doing business” in the same tenor as those above-quoted, and as may be observed, one common denominator among them all is the concept of “continuity.”<br><br>In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals categorized as “doing business”&nbsp; petitioner’s participation under the “Assignment Agreement” and the “Deed of Assignment.” This is simply untenable.&nbsp; The expression “doing business” should not be given such a strict and literal construction as to make it apply to any corporate dealing&nbsp; whatever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> At this early stage and with petitioner’s acts or transactions limited to the assignment contracts,&nbsp; it cannot be said&nbsp; that it had performed acts intended to continue the business for which it was organized.&nbsp; <b>It may not be amiss to point out that&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; or&nbsp; business&nbsp; for&nbsp; which petitioner was organized is not discernible in the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; No effort was exerted by the Court of Appeals to establish the nexus between petitioner’s business and the acts supposed to constitute “doing business.” Thus, whether the assignment contracts were incidental to petitioner’s business or were continuation thereof is beyond determination.</b>&nbsp; We cannot apply the case cited by the Court of Appeals, <i>Far East Int’l Import and Export Corp. vs. Nankai Kogyo Co., Ltd.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which held that a single act may still constitute “doing business” if&nbsp; “it is not merely incidental or casual, but is of such character as distinctly to indicate a purpose on the part of the foreign corporation to do other business in the state.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In said case, there was an express admission from an official of the foreign corporation that he was sent to the Philippines to look into the operation of mines, thereby revealing the foreign corporation’s desire to continue engaging in business here.&nbsp; But in the case at bar, there is no evidence of similar desire or intent.&nbsp; Unarguably, petitioner may, <b>as the Court of Appeals suggested</b>, decide to operate Marcopper’s mining business, but, of course, at this stage, that is a mere speculation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it may decide to sell the credit secured by the mining properties to an offshore investor, in which case the acts will still be isolated transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>To see through the present facts an intention on the part of petitioner to start a series of business transaction is to rest on assumptions or probabilities falling short of actual proof.&nbsp; Courts should never base its judgments on a state of facts so inadequately developed that it cannot be determined where inference ends and conjecture begins.</b><br><br>Indeed, the Court of Appeals’ holding that petitioner was determined to be “doing business” in the Philippines is based mainly on conjectures and speculation.&nbsp; In concluding that the “<i>unmistakable intention</i>” of petitioner is to continue Marcopper’s business, the Court of Appeals hangs on the wobbly premise that “there is no other way for petitioner to recover its huge financial investments which it poured into Marcopper’s rehabilitation without it (petitioner) continuing Marcopper’s business in the country.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This is a mere presumption.&nbsp; Absent overt acts of petitioner from which we may directly infer its intention to continue Marcopper’s business, we cannot give our concurrence.&nbsp; Significantly, a view subscribed upon by many authorities is that the mere ownership by a foreign corporation of a property in a certain state, <b>unaccompanied by its active use in furtherance of the business for which it was formed,</b> is insufficient in itself to constitute doing business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In <i>Chittim vs. Belle Fourche Bentonite Products Co.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> it was held that <b>even if a foreign corporation purchased and&nbsp; took&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyances&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; mining claim,&nbsp; did&nbsp; some assessment work thereon, and endeavored to sell it, its acts will not constitute the doing of business so as to subject the corporation to the statutory requirements for the transacting of business.</b>&nbsp; On the same vein, petitioner, a foreign corporation, which becomes the assignee of mining properties, facilities and equipment cannot be automatically considered as doing business, nor presumed to have the intention of engaging in mining business.<br><br>One important point.&nbsp; Long before petitioner assumed Marcopper’s debt to ADB and became their assignee under the two assignment contracts, there already existed a “Support and Standby Credit Agreement” between ADB and Placer Dome whereby the latter bound itself to provide cash flow support for Marcopper’s payment of its obligations to ADB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plainly, petitioner’s payment of US$ 18,453, 450.12 to ADB was more of a fulfillment of an obligation under the “Support and Standby Credit Agreement” rather than an investment.&nbsp; That petitioner had to step into the shoes of ADB as Marcopper’s creditor was just a necessary legal consequence of the transactions that transpired.&nbsp; Also, we must hasten to add that the “Support and Standby Credit Agreement” was executed <b>four (4) years prior to Marcopper’s insovency</b>, hence, the alleged “<i>intention of petitioner to continue Marcopper’s business</i>” could have no basis for at that time, Marcopper’s fate cannot yet be determined.<br><br>In the final analysis, we are convinced that petitioner was engaged only in isolated acts or transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Single or isolated acts, contracts, or transactions of foreign corporations are not regarded as a doing or carrying on of business.&nbsp; Typical examples of these are the making of a single contract, sale, sale with the taking of a note and mortgage in the state to secure payment therefor, purchase, or note, or the mere commission of a tort.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In these instances, there is <b>no purpose</b> to do any other business within the country.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>Solidbank contends that from the chronology and timing of events, it is evident that there existed a pre-set pattern of response on the part of Marcopper to defeat whatever court ruling that may be rendered in favor of Solidbank.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>While it may appear, at initial glance, that the assignment contracts are in the nature of fraudulent conveyances, however, a closer look at the events that transpired prior to the execution of those contracts gives rise to a different conclusion.&nbsp; The obvious flaw in the Court of Appeals’ Decision lies in its constricted view of the facts obtaining in the case.&nbsp; In its factual narration, the Court of Appeals definitely left out some events.&nbsp; We shall see later the significance of those events.<br><br>Article 1387 of the Civil Code of the Philippines provides:<br><blockquote>“<b>Art. 1387.</b> All contracts by virtue of which the debtor alienates property by gratuitous title are presumed to have been entered into in fraud of creditors, when the donor did not reserve sufficient property to pay all debts contracted before the donation.<br><br><b>Alienations by onerous title are also presumed fraudulent when made by persons against whom some judgment has been rendered in any instance or some writ of attachment has been issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision or attachment need not refer to the property alienated, and need not have been obtained by the party seeking rescission.</b><br><br>In addition to these presumptions, the design to defraud creditors may be proved in any other manner recognized by law and of evidence.</blockquote>This article presumes the existence of fraud made by a debtor.&nbsp; Thus, in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, an alienation of a property will be held fraudulent if it is made after a judgment has been rendered against the debtor making the alienation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This presumption of fraud is not conclusive and may be rebutted by satisfactory and convincing evidence.&nbsp; <b>All that is necessary is to establish affirmatively that the conveyance is made in good faith and for a sufficient and valuable consideration.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The “Assignment Agreement” and the “Deed of Assignment” were executed for valuable considerations.&nbsp; Patent from the “Assignment Agreement” is the fact that petitioner assumed the payment of US$ 18,453,450.12 to ADB in satisfaction of Marcopper’s remaining debt as of March 20, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Solidbank cannot deny this fact considering that a substantial portion of the said payment, in the sum of US$ 13,886,791.06, was remitted in favor of the Bank of Nova Scotia, its major stockholder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The facts of the case so far show that the assignment contracts were executed in good faith.&nbsp; The execution of the “Assignment Agreement” on Macrh 20, 1997 and the “Deed of Assignment” on December 8,1997 is not the <i>alpha</i> of this case.&nbsp; While the execution of these assignment contracts almost coincided with the rendition on May 7, 1997 of the Partial Judgment in Civil Case No. 96-80083 by the Manila RTC, however, there was no intention on the part of petitioner to defeat Solidbank’s claim.&nbsp; It bears reiterating that as early as November 4, 1992, Placer Dome had already bound itself under a “Support and Standby Credit Agreement” to provide Marcopper with cash flow support for the payment to ADB of its obligations.&nbsp; When Marcopper ceased operations on account of disastrous mine tailings spill into the Boac River and ADB pressed for payment of the loan, Placer Dome agreed to have its subsidiary, herein petitioner, paid ADB&nbsp; the amount of US $18,453,450.12.&nbsp; Thereupon, ADB and Marcopper executed, respectively, in favor of petitioner an “Assignment Agreement” and a “Deed of Assignment.” Obviously, the assignment contracts were connected with transactions that happened long before the rendition in 1997 of the Partial Judgment in Civil Case No. 96-80083 by the Manila RTC.&nbsp; Those contracts cannot be viewed in isolation.&nbsp; If we may add, it is highly inconceivable that ADB, a reputable international financial organization, will connive with Marcopper to feign or simulate a contract in 1992 just to defraud Solidbank for its claim four years thereafter.&nbsp; And it is equally incredible for petitioner to be paying the huge sum of US $ 18, 453, 450.12 to ADB only for the purpose of defrauding Solidbank of the sum of&nbsp; P52,970.756.89.<br><br>It is said that the test as to whether or not a conveyance is fraudulent is -- does it prejudice the rights of creditors?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> We cannot see how Solidbank’s right was prejudiced by the assignment contracts considering that substantially all of Marcopper’s properties were already covered by the registered “Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage” executed by Marcopper in favor of ADB as early as November 11, 1992.&nbsp; As such, Solidbank cannot assert a better right than ADB, the latter being a preferred creditor.&nbsp; It is basic that mortgaged properties answer primarily for the mortgaged credit, not for the judgment credit of the mortgagor’s unsecured creditor. Considering that petitioner assumed Marcopper’s debt to ADB, it follows that Solidbank’s right as judgment creditor over the subject properties must give way to that of the former.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III</b><br></div><br>The record is lacking in circumstances that would suggest that petitioner corporation, Placer Dome and Marcopper are one and the same entity.
