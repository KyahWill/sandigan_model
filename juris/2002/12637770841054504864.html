<p class="BODY">Petitioner Associated Communications and Wireless Services, Ltd.
(“ACWS” for brevity) is a registered partnership organized and existing under
the laws of the Philippines, doing business under the trade name United
Broadcasting Network, Inc.  Initially,
ACWS operated several radio and television stations nationwide by virtue of a
legislative franchise acquired in 1969 under R.A. No. 4551 through Concurrent
Resolution No. 58 of the Sixth Congress of the Philippines.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></i></span></a>  Act No. 3846,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></i></span></a>
as amended, otherwise known as the Radio Laws of the Philippines, requires a
person who operates radio broadcasting stations for commercial purposes to
secure a legislative franchise.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1974, Presidential Decree No. 576-A<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></i></span></a>
(“PD 576-A” for brevity) took effect providing for the regulation of radio and
television broadcast services in the country.  Effective December 31, 1981, PD 576-A<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></i></span></a>
terminated all franchises, grants, licenses, permits, certificates or other
forms of authority to operate radio or television broadcasting systems.  PD 576-A conferred on the Board of
Communications and the Secretary of Public Works and Communications the power
to grant permits to operate radio or TV broadcast stations.  The exercise of this power was made
appealable to the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the termination of its legislative franchise, ACWS continued
to operate its radio and television stations through permits issued by the
Board of Communications and the Secretary of Public Works and Communications
pursuant to PD 576-A.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1979, Executive Order No. 546<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></i></span></a>
(“EO 546” for brevity) created the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.  EO
546 merged the Board of Communications and the Telecommunications Control
Bureau into a single entity called the National Telecommunications Commission
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></i></span></a>  EO 546 vested in the NTC the power to grant
permits for the operation of radio and television stations.  Specifically, subparagraphs (a) and (c) of
EO 546 provide as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 15.  Functions of
the Commission. – The Commission shall exercise the following functions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a. Issue Certificate

<p class="BODY">The NTC granted ACWS renewable temporary permits and licenses for
the continued operation of its radio<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></i></span></a>
and television broadcasting systems.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACWS operates Channel 25 under call sign DWQH-TV in the Ultra
High Frequency (UHF) Band as authorized by temporary permits.  The latest temporary permit for Channel 25
was Temporary Permit No. BSD-0828-95 dated July 7, 1995, effective from June
29, 1995 to June 28, 1997.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACWS applied for an increase of the transmitter power of Channel
25 from one kilowatt to 25 kilowatts, the application docketed as NTC Case No.
91-031.  In an Order dated May 28, 1996,
then NTC Commissioner Simeon Kintanar granted the application on the ground
that ACWS “is legally, financially and technically capable and the proposed
increase of power will redound to the interest of the public.”  Consequently, ACWS embarked on an expansion
program to meet the NTC-approved upgrading of its facilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the expiration of Temporary Permit No. BSD-0828-95, ACWS
applied for its renewal on June 3, 1997.  In a letter dated January 19, 1998, NTC Senior Executive Assistant III
Delilah F. Deles informed ACWS of the approval of its temporary permit for
Channel 25, to be released upon payment of the necessary fees in the total
amount of <s>P</s>3,600.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></i></span></a>  ACWS paid the amount on February 4, 1998 as
evidenced by Official Receipt No. 0879209.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The NTC, however, refused to release to ACWS the approved and
paid for temporary permit.  Instead, the
NTC issued an Order<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></i></span></a>
dated February 26, 1998 directing ACWS to show cause why its temporary permit
to operate should not be recalled for failure to secure a legislative
franchise.  The NTC also ordered ACWS to
cease and desist from operating Channel 25.  The order reads:</p>

<blockquote>“In a letter dated 17 November 1997, a copy of which is hereto
attached as Annex “A”, this Commission, thru its Broadcast Service Division,
directed above-named respondents to submit, within thirty (30) days from
expiration of its Temporary Permit, a new congressional franchise and failure
to do so may cause a denial of their application for renewal of their Temporary
Permits.  Despite this directive,
respondents failed to submit a new congressional franchise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Earlier on, or on 28 October 1997, this Commission, thru the Chief,
Broadcast Division, received from the Committee on Legislative Franchises, a
certification, a copy of which is hereto attached as Annex “B” that respondents
were ordered to submit requirements to support their franchise application
(House Bill No. 14345) but respondents failed to do, thus the application was
never deliberated upon in the 9<sup>th</sup> Congress.  In the 10<sup>th</sup> Congress, no refiled
application by the respondents was pending in the Committee on Legislative
Franchise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, respondents are hereby directed to show cause in
writing within ten (10) days from receipt of this order why their assigned
frequency, more specifically Channel 25 in the UHF Band, should not be recalled
for lack of the necessary Congressional Franchise as required by Section 1, Act
No. 3846, as amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, respondent is hereby directed to cease and desist from
operating DWQH-TV, unless subsequently authorized by the Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as NTC Administrative Case No. 98-009.  On March 17, 1998, ACWS filed its Answer
praying among others that the Order dated February 26, 1998 be set aside and
the administrative case be dismissed.  Petitioner also prayed that the approved temporary permit to operate
Channel 25 be released.  Upon ACWS’s
request, the NTC conducted a hearing on the matter on April 22, 1998, during
which ACWS adduced evidence.  ACWS requested
a continuance to June 8, 1998.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 15, 1998, despite the pendency of NTC Administrative Case
No. 98-009 and its request for continuance, ACWS filed with the Court of
Appeals a petition for “<i style="">Mandamus,
Prohibition and Damages with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ
of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction.”  </i>ACWS prayed that the NTC be ordered to release ACWS’s already
approved and paid for temporary permit to operate Channel 25 or to issue the
corresponding Certificate of Public Convenience pursuant to EO 546.  ACWS also sought to enjoin NTC from
proceeding with NTC Administrative Case No. 98-009.  ACWS likewise sought reimbursement of its legal expenses
amounting to <s>P</s>100,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated May 22, 1998, the Court of Appeals
restrained the NTC from continuing with the proceedings in NTC Administrative Case
No. 98-009.  In due course, however, the
Court of Appeals rendered its Decision denying ACWS’s petition and its motion
to reconsider the same.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals held that mandamus does not lie to compel
the exercise of discretion in the grant or release of a temporary permit to
operate a television station.  Neither
is prohibition proper to enjoin the NTC from proceeding with NTC Administrative
Case No. 98-009.  The Court of Appeals
explained that even if the renewal of ACWS’s temporary permit had been approved
and paid for, the NTC could still inquire whether ACWS complied with the
Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU” for brevity) between the House Committee on
Legislative Franchises and the KBP of which ACWS is a member.  The MOU provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The NTC shall continue to issue and grant permits or
authorizations to operate radio and television broadcast stations within their
mandate under Section 15 of Executive Order No. 546, provided that such
temporary permits or authorization to operate shall be valid for two (2) years
within which the permittee shall be required to file an application for a
legislative franchise with the congress not later than December 31, 1994;
provided further, if the application for franchise remains unacted by the
Congress without however being disapproved or denied, such temporary permit or
authorization to operate shall be extendible for another two (2) year period;
provided finally, that if the <b style="">permittee
of the temporary permit or authorization to operate fails to secure  the legislative franchise with Congress
within this period, the NTC shall not extend or renew its permit or
authorization to operate any further.”  </b>(Emphasis
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In view of ACWS’s failure to secure a
legislative franchise as required by the MOU, the NTC issued its Order of
February 26, 1998.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals then observed that the matters ventilated in
the petition were substantially the same as those raised in ACWS’s answer in
NTC Administrative Case No. 98-009.  Applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals
declared that the determination of whether ACWS complied with the requisites
for the renewal of its permit is best left for the NTC to decide as the
government agency tasked to oversee the operations of radio and television
stations.  The Court of Appeals
concluded that ACWS cannot at this stage come to the court to enjoin the NTC
from excising a power clearly vested in it by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Issues<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals grievously erred in:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;">1. FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE TRUE ISSUE
PRESENTED BY PETITIONER IN THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;">2. FAILING OR REFUSING TO GRASP THE
BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MERE RELEASE OF AN ALREADY APPROVED AND PAID FOR TEMPORARY
PERMIT TO OPERATE AND THE EVALUATION OF PETITIONER’S CAPABILITY TO OPERATE A
TELEVISION STATION.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;">3. RECOGNIZING THE MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING ENTERED INTO AMONG THE RESPONDENTS COMPRISING THE NTC, THE HOUSE
OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATIVE FRANCHISES AND THE <i style="">KAPISANAN NG MGA BRODKASTER SA PILIPINAS.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;">4. FINDING THAT THE DOCTRINE OF PRIMARY
JURISDICTION APPLIES TO THE CASE AT BAR.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;">5. NOT ORDERING RESPONDENTS TO REFUND
OR REIMBURSE PETITIONER THE ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUFFERED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR
REFUSAL TO RELEASE THE ALREADY APPROVED AND PAID FOR TEMPORARY PERMIT TO
OPERATE AS WELL AS THEIR BASELESS SUSPENSION OF PETITIONER’S OPERATIONS.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the first and second issues, ACWS agrees that the exercise of
discretion cannot be compelled by mandamus.  ACWS likewise agrees that the power to grant a permit or authority to
operate a broadcast facility is discretionary.  However, ACWS points out that once the discretionary power has been
exercised as in this case where the temporary permit had already been approved,
the <i style="">simple act of releasing</i> the
approved and paid for temporary permit becomes merely ministerial.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the third issue, ACWS contends that the MOU is contrary to PD
576-A and EO 546 for requiring a legislative franchise in order to secure a
certificate of public convenience.  Moreover, the MOU, as executed by a mere Committee of the Lower House
and the KBP encroaches on the exercise of the executive functions of the NTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the fourth issue, ACWS argues that the doctrine of primary
jurisdiction is inapplicable to this case considering that the issue submitted
to the Court of Appeals does not call for any “special knowledge, experience
and service of the tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of
fact.”  The question for  resolution of the Court of Appeals is
whether the NTC acted in a whimsical and arbitrary manner in its unjustified
refusal to release the already approved and paid for temporary permit and in
immediately ordering the suspension of ACWS’s television operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner argues that it is entitled to a reimbursement
of its legal expenses in the amount of <s>P</s>100,000.00 on account of NTC’s
capricious, vexing and arbitrary actuations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, petitioner seeks the following reliefs: (1) the release
of its already approved and paid for temporary permit to operate; (2) the
cessation of the administrative proceedings initiated by NTC against petitioner
for the purpose of recalling its Channel 25 permit to operate; and (3) damages
in the amount of <s>P</s>100,000.00 for the capricious, vexing and arbitrary
actuations of the NTC officials concerned.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Court’s Ruling<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot rule on the merits of the petition on the grounds of
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies and <i>litis pendentia</i>.<b style=""><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p class="BODY">NTC Administrative Case No. 98-009 commenced upon NTC’s issuance
of the Order dated February 26, 1998.  The Order “directed ACWS to show cause in writing within ten (10) days
from receipt why their assigned frequency, Channel 25 in the UHF Band, should
not be recalled for lack of the necessary congressional franchise as required
by Section 1, Act No. 3846, as amended.”  The Order also directed ACWS to cease and desist from operating its
television station, unless subsequently authorized by the Commission.  There was no mention of the MOU purportedly
executed by the House Committee on Legislative Franchises and the KBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 17, 1998, ACWS filed an answer asserting that the
frequency assigned to Channel 25 should not be recalled for the following
reasons: (1) Department of Justice Opinion No. 98, Series of 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></i></span></a>
states that EO 546 authorizes an administrative agency such as the NTC to issue
permits for the operation of radio and television broadcasting systems without
need of a prior franchise issued by Congress; (2) NTC is estopped from recalling
the assigned frequency since it had previously approved the application for
renewal of the temporary permit which has been paid for; (3) the recall or
cancellation is unreasonable, unfair and oppressive considering that ACWS had
commenced upgrading and expanding its facilities, expending millions of pesos
purchasing new equipment after NTC approved its permit to purchase; and (4) the
letter dated November 17, 1997 mentioned in the Order dated February 26, 1998
was never sent nor received by ACWS as validated by the lack of proof of
service  or at least the registry
receipt or a return card.  ACWS sought
the dismissal of the administrative case and the release of the temporary
permit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the rights asserted and reliefs prayed for by ACWS before
the NTC, the Court of Appeals and now before this Court are identical and based
on the same facts.  ACWS did not wait
for the administrative case to proceed to its appropriate conclusion before
seeking judicial intervention.  Hence,
the Court of Appeals properly denied the petition for premature invocation of
the court’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the NTC issued the Order pursuant to the NTC
Rules of Practice and Procedure.  Rule
13, Part IV (Summary Proceedings) of the NTC Rules provides thus:</p>

<blockquote>“PART IV-SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rule 13 – Order to Show
Cause</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 1.  When applicable.
– Based on the report of an authorized personnel of the Board, or the credible
sworn statement of any offended party, the board instead of acting according to
the procedure indicated for complaints, may issue an order directing a
respondent operator to appear before the board within seventy-two hours from
his receipt of a copy of the order and show cause why his certificate should
not be cancelled or suspended for the cause stated in the report or complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This summary proceeding shall apply, in the discretion of the
Board, only in cases where the continued acts of the public’s utility operator
shall cause serious detriment to public interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This summary proceeding shall also be applicable in cases of
willful or contumacious refusal by an operator to comply with an order, rule or
regulation of the Board, or any provision of the Public Services Act, as
amended, or any provisions of the Plan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Board, for good cause, may prior to the hearing suspend for a
period not exceeding thirty (30) days any certificate or the exercise of any
right or authority granted under the Act or Plan by order of the Board,
whenever such step shall in the judgment of the Board be necessary to avoid
serious and irreparable damage or inconvenience to the public or to private
interests.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 2.  Content. – The
order to show cause shall include a statement in substance of the violation
reported or complained of, and, whenever practicable, there shall be appended
to it a copy of the report or complaint upon which the order is based.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that ACWS had in fact applied for a franchise
with the 9<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Philippines but failed to submit the
necessary supporting documents.  The Committee
on Legislative Franchises issued a certification attesting to this fact.  It was then that the NTC, now acting as a
three-member commission, inquired why ACWS failed to submit the documents.  The NTC also  warned ACWS about the probable recall of its assigned frequency
for failure to secure a legislative franchise as required by Act No. 3846.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies is Fatal<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Before a party may seek the intervention of the court, he should
first avail of all the means afforded him by administrative processes.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></i></span></a>
This rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies was explained thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The underlying principle of the rule on exhaustion of
administrative remedies <b>rests on the presumption that the administrative
agency, if afforded a complete chance to pass upon the matter, will decide the
same correctly</b>.  There are both
legal and practical reasons for the principle.  The administrative process is intended to provide less expensive and
more speedy solution to disputes.  Where
the enabling statute indicates a procedure for administrative review and
provides a system of administrative appeal or reconsideration, the courts - for
reasons of law, comity and convenience - will not entertain a case unless the
available administrative remedies have been resorted to and the appropriate
authorities have been given an opportunity to act and correct errors committed
in the administrative forum.” <a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></i></span></a>  (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the issues which administrative agencies such as the NTC
are authorized to decide should not be summarily taken from them and submitted
to a court without first giving such administrative agency the opportunity to
dispose of the same after due deliberation.  The purpose of the administrative case was precisely to thresh out the
legality of the continued operation of Channel 25.</p>

<p class="BODY">The administrative case was the proper forum for ACWS to
ventilate its side.  The administrative
case also provides an opportunity for the NTC to correct any actual or fancied
errors attributed to it by way of re-examination of the factual and legal
aspects of the case.  This is the reason
why ACWS was required to file an answer and hearings were held on the matter.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>Resort to Mandamus and Prohibition was Premature<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The NTC in its Order dated February 26, 1998 gave ACWS ten days
from receipt to file an answer.  On
March 17, 1998, ACWS filed an answer.  Upon ACWS’s request, a hearing was held on April 22, 1998.  Upon ACWS’s motion, a continuance to June 8,
1998 was granted.  ACWS filed a petition
for mandamus and prohibition with the Court of Appeals on May 15, 1998,
thirteen days after the first hearing and twenty-four days before the scheduled
second hearing.  Under these
circumstances, the NTC could hardly be expected to have acted on the issues and
corrected itself.  Clearly, ACWS filed
the petition prematurely.</p>

<p class="BODY">The special civil actions of prohibition and mandamus are
extraordinary remedies that a party can resort to only in cases of extreme
necessity where the ordinary forms of procedure are powerless to afford relief
and where there is no other clear, adequate and speedier remedy.  In this case, NTC Administrative Case No.
98-009 was the adequate, speedier and less expensive remedy to secure the
reliefs sought.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is basic that a party’s failure to exhaust administrative
remedies is fatal, especially where the case involves not just issues of law
and of fact but of administrative discretion.  The available administrative procedures must be pursued until a definite
and final determination is held.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>Litis Pendentia also Fatal to Petitioner’s Cause<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Memorandum filed before this Court on December 14, 1999,
ACWS claims that the NTC has already decided NTC Administrative Case No.
98-009. ACWS further claims that it filed an appeal under the 1997 Rules of
Civil Procedure before the Court of Appeals from the NTC’s decision in the
administrative case.  There are in
effect two cases pending between the same parties for the same causes of action
and reliefs, one in the Court of Appeals and the other in this Court.<b style=""><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></b></p>

<p class="BODY">If we resolve this case on the merits while ACWS’s appeal is
pending before the Court of Appeals, the duplicity of suits would result in
confusion and the possibility of conflicting decisions could arise.  For an orderly administration of justice,
ACWS’s appeal now pending before the Court of Appeals should be resolved first
considering that the appeal is from a decision of the NTC on the merits of the
case.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i>No Denial of Due Process<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither
could ACWS plead denial of due process as justification for its immediate
resort to the court.  </span>Section 1
of the Bill of Rights lays down what is known as the “due process clause” of
the Constitution, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Section 1.  No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law, x x x.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In order to fall within the protection of this provision, two
conditions must concur, namely, that there is a deprivation and that such
deprivation is done without proper observance of due process.  When one speaks of due process of law, a
distinction must be made between matters of procedure and matters of
substance.  In essence, procedural due
process “refers to the method or manner by which the law is enforced,” while
substantive due process “requires that the law itself, not merely the
procedures by which the law would be enforced, is fair, reasonable, and just.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></i></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">ACWS argues that NTC failed to observe due process in the
issuance of the Order dated February 26, 1998 because<span style=""> ACWS </span>did not receive the letter dated
November 17, 1998<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></i></span></a>
mentioned in the Order.  The letter required
petitioner to submit its new congressional franchise within 30 days from
expiration of the temporary permit to be renewed.  The letter did not refer to Channel 25 but to the radio stations
maintained and operated by ACWS.  ACWS
likewise assails the directive to cease and desist from operating Channel
25.  Obviously, ACWS is referring to the
procedural aspect of the due process clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notice and hearing are fundamental requirements of procedural due
process when an administrative body exercises its quasi-judicial
functions.  Both were complied with in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that ACWS did not receive the letter dated
November 17, 1998.  What is important is
that ACWS received the Order dated February 26, 1998 requiring it to show cause
why its permit to operate Channel 25 should not be cancelled.  In any case, the Court has maintained a
clear position with regard to the due process requirements in administrative
cases, that is -</p>

<blockquote>“(a)s long as a party was given the opportunity to defend his interests
in due course, he cannot be said to have been denied due process of law, for
this opportunity to be heard is the very essence of due process.  <b><i>Moreover, this constitutional mandate
is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek reconsideration
of the action or ruling complained of.”</i></b><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><i><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></i></b></span></a><b><i>
</i></b>(Emphasis supplied).<b><i><o:p></o:p></i></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NTC afforded ACWS an opportunity to be heard by requiring it
to submit an answer and by conducting hearings on the matter.  All told, ACWS had an opportunity to seek a
reconsideration of the Order dated February 26, 1998 before the NTC.</p>

Republic Act No. 4551 granted Marcos Villaverde and Winfred Villaverde a
50-year franchise to operate radio stations, a provincial telephone system,
commercial telephone and/or radiotelegraph communications stations, with
corresponding relay stations, among others. On June 18, 1969, the Sixth
