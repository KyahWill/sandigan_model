  <p>On March 22, 2000, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) received an Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 from Armando R. Canillas, an Associate Professor of Pangasinan State 
University, charging Corazon V. Pelayo, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial 
Court, Rosales, Pangasinan with Grave Abuse of Authority.  </p>
  <p> Complainant avers that on March 8, 2000 he received a <em>subpoena</em>
 served by ordinary mail, commanding him to appear before the Municipal 
Trial Court of Rosales, Pangasinan on March 24, 2000 at 10:00 o’clock in
 the morning. However, the portions in the <em>subpoena</em> indicating 
the name of the accused, the case number and the nature of the case were
 merely marked “x x x.” It bore the embossed seal presumably of the 
court and was duly signed by respondent Corazon Pelayo. </p>
  <p>On March 14, 2000, complainant verified the <em>subpoena</em> from the court of origin. A court employee informed him that the <em>subpoena</em>
 was sent merely to compel him to settle his obligation with a certain 
Salome Jacob. Complainant asked for the I.S. docket number of the case 
against him, but he was told that the complaint has been prepared and 
will be filed if he does not settle his obligation. Complainant was not 
able to confront the respondent since the latter was already out for 
lunch although it was only about 11:00 in the morning then. </p>
  <p>Subsequently, on April 13, 2000, complainant wrote a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 to the Court Administrator manifesting that he is no longer interested 
in pursuing the instant administrative complaint and, thus, he is 
withdrawing the same. </p>
  <p>When asked to comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> respondent stated that the <em>subpoena</em>
 was actually intended as an invitation to a mediation conference. 
Respondent maintains that she was motivated by an honest desire to give 
complainant the opportunity to settle his obligation with Ms. Jacob, who
 is about to file seventeen (17) complaints for violation of B.P. 22 
against complainant, and spare the latter the rigors of a court 
litigation. </p>
  <p>Respondent likewise averred that she has apologized to complainant for sending a <em>subpoena</em>
 instead of an invitation letter. In fact, after her explanation, 
complainant decided to withdraw the complaint against her. Respondent 
assured this Court that she will not commit the same mistake again. </p>
  <p>Upon evaluation, the OCA found the respondent Clerk of Court guilty
 of Grave Abuse of Authority. The OCA opined that respondent’s act of 
sending a <em>subpoena</em> instead of an invitation letter violated Rule 21, Section 1 of the Rules of Court which defines a <em>subpoena</em>
 as “a process directed to a person requiring him to attend and to 
testify at the hearing or trial of an action, or at any investigation 
conducted by competent authority, or for the taking of his deposition.” 
The <em>subpoena</em> sent by respondent to complainant was not for the 
latter to attend or testify at the hearing of a case or for an 
investigation since no case has yet been filed in court, but merely as 
an invitation to a mediation conference. Correspondingly, the OCA 
recommended that the respondent Clerk of Court be fined in the amount of
 P1,000.00 with a stern warning that the commission of similar acts in 
the future shall be dealt with more severely. </p>
  <p>We agree with the recommendation of the OCA. </p>
  <p>At the outset, it must be emphasized that the withdrawal of a 
complaint for lack of interest of a complainant does not necessarily 
warrant the dismissal of an administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 Administrative actions cannot depend on the will or pleasure of a 
complainant who may, for reasons of his own, condone what may be 
detestable. Neither can the Court be bound by the unilateral act of a 
complainant in a matter relating to its disciplinary power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> since complainants in administrative cases against court personnel are, in a real sense, only witnesses. </p>
  <p>Respondent’s excuse that she was motivated solely by an honest 
desire to give complainant the opportunity to settle his obligation to 
Salome Jacob and to spare him from court litigation cannot justify her 
infraction. Any mistake of this sort, once committed, by court 
employees, more so by clerks of court, creates a stigma that cannot just
 be expunged from the eyes of the people who look up to the courts as 
sacred places where litigants are heard, rights and conflicts settled 
and justice solemnly dispensed. Although there is no showing that she 
benefited from such arrangement, her integrity was placed in serious 
doubt when she irregularly prepared and caused the <em>subpoena</em> to 
be sent to complainant. As an officer of the court, she should have 
conducted herself in a manner that would not have cast any suspicion or 
doubt on her integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
That clerks of court ought to live in the strictest standard of honesty,
 integrity and uprightness in the conduct of their affairs has been 
echoed in the recent case of Reyes-Domingo v. Morales,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> where this Court held that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A Clerk of Court is essential and a ranking officer of our 
judicial system who performs delicate administrative functions vital to 
the prompt and proper administration of justice. A Clerk of Court’s 
Office is the nucleus of activities both adjudicative and 
administrative, performing, among others, the functions of keeping the 
records and seal, issuing processes, entering judgments and orders and 
giving, upon request, certified copies from the records. </p>
    <p>Owing to the delicate position occupied by Clerks of Court in the
 judicial system, they are required to be persons of competence, honesty
 and probity since they are specifically imbued with the mandate of 
safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings, to earn and
 preserve respect therefor, to maintain loyalty thereto and to the judge
 as superior officer, to maintain the authenticity and correctness of 
court records and to uphold the confidence of the public in the 
administration of justice. </p>
    <p>x x x. Those involved in the administration of justice must live 
up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public 
service, much more so Clerks of Court who play a key role in the 
complement of the court and, thus, can not be permitted to slacken their
 jobs under one pretext or another. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Time and again, we have emphasized that the conduct and behavior 
of every one connected with an office charged with the dispensation of 
justice, from the presiding judge to the sheriff and to the lowliest 
clerk should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 Every court personnel must be constantly reminded that any impression 
of impropriety, misdeed or negligence in the performance of official 
functions must be avoided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> They should always be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> in view of the foregoing, the Court 
finds respondent Corazon V. Pelayo, Clerk of Court of the Municipal 
Trial Court of Rosales, Pangasinan, guilty of Grave Abuse of Authority 
and imposes on her a FINE of One Thousand Pesos (1,000.00) with a STERN 
WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with
 more severely. </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED. </p>
