				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This is a petition for review of the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 31, 2001, of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the award of damages made by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 106, Quezon City to respondent for breach of contract by petitioner.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>Respondent Edwin Enriquez wanted to export cookies, locally known as <i>broas</i>, to the United States.&nbsp; Petitioner MOF Company, Inc. is a domestic corporation engaged in ship brokerage and agency, customs brokerage, air-sea-land forwarding, and other allied businesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Upon the request of respondent, petitioner sent him a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 22, 1988, quoting the cost of shipments of goods from Manila to Washington, U.S.A., including the additional charge for “door-to-door” service.&nbsp; Respondent contacted the forwarding company, in response to which he received a letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated June 13, 1989, signed by Minnie C. Almarines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> account executive of MOF Company, Inc., giving details of its previous price quotation.&nbsp; Based on the letter, respondent contracted the delivery service of petitioner for its <i>broas</i> export to the U.S.A.&nbsp; Their agreement was that the service charges would be collected from the consignee upon delivery of the goods, although initially they would have to be paid by respondent, to be reimbursed later by petitioner, upon collection of final service fees from the consignee.<br><br>The first batch of cargo, consisting of 30 cartons of <i>broas</i>, was picked up at respondent’s office for shipment on June 28, 1989, while the second batch of shipment, consisting of 14 cartons of <i>broas</i> cookies, was picked up on July 5, 1989.&nbsp; Respondent paid the total amount of P4,440.00 as initial service fee to petitioner for the two shipments.<br><br>After the export documents had been processed, petitioner delivered the first cargo to Continental Freight Services, Inc. (Continental Freight) for loading on the latter’s vessel.&nbsp; Continental Freight issued Bill of Lading No. MNLNAM06.242<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> under a “freight-collect port-to-door” arrangement to petitioner, which then delivered the bill to respondent.&nbsp; The second cargo delivered by petitioner to Continental Freight was covered by Bill of Lading No. MNLNAM07.266,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which contained the same terms and conditions as the first cargo.<br><br>Both cargoes failed to reach the consignee in the U.S.A.&nbsp; For this reason, respondent complained&nbsp; to petitioner, which promised to follow up the shipments.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the consignee never received the shipment, respondent filed a complaint for damages against petitioner for breach of contract.&nbsp; The complaint was filed&nbsp; in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 106, Quezon City, which, on August 30, 1996, rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, by a preponderance of evidence, the Court hereby renders judgment for the plaintiff and against the defendant MOF Company, Inc., for which the said defendant is hereby ordered to pay the plaintiff the following: <ol> <li>Actual damages of P634,958.15 for the value of broas cookies and unrealized profits suffered by the plaintiff;<br></li><li>Moral damages of P50,000.00;<br></li><li>Exemplary damages of P25,000.00;<br></li><li>Attorney’s fees of P20,000.00; and<br></li><li>Costs. </li></ol> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Appeals, to which petitioner appealed, rendered a decision on July 31, 2001 affirming <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>Petitioner contends that:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE INSTANT APPEAL FALLS UNDER THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE THAT THE HONORABLE SUPREME COURT IS NOT A TRIER OF FACTS.<br><blockquote>THE FACTUAL FINDINGS OF THE LOWER COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS DO NOT CONFORM TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.<br><br>THE CONCLUSION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS GROUNDED ENTIRELY ON SPECULATIONS, SURMISES AND&nbsp; CONJECTURES.<br><br>THE FINDINGS OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS CONTRARY TO THE ADMISSIONS OF BOTH THE PETITIONER AND RESPONDENT.<br></blockquote></li><li>THE CONTRACT TO DELIVER THE “BROAS” TO THE CONSIGNEE WAS BETWEEN RESPONDENT AND CONTINENTAL FREIGHT.<br><br></li><li>THE RESPONDENT IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE AWARD OF DAMAGES OF WHATEVER KIND OR NATURE.<br><br></li><li>THE PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO ITS COUNTERCLAIMS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><i>First.</i> Petitioner denies that it entered into a contract with respondent for the “door-to-door” delivery of his goods to the consignee in the U.S.A.&nbsp; It claims that it offered its services to respondent, but the latter allegedly found petitioner’s rates too expensive.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that what it had contracted to render to respondent was only brokerage and forwarding services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>This contention has no basis.&nbsp; To begin, the factual findings of the trial court, which the appellate court affirmed, are fully supported by the evidence on record.&nbsp; It is settled that such findings are binding upon this Court and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> There are exceptional circumstances when findings of fact of lower courts may be set aside<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> but none of them is present in this case.<br><br>Petitioner admits having sent respondent price quotations for its “door-to-door” delivery service to the U.S.A.&nbsp; Indeed, this fact is evidenced by petitioner’s letters to respondent dated July 22, 1988 and June 13, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Petitioner’s offer&nbsp; was accepted by respondent when he decided to export <i>broas</i> to the U.S.A. in 1989.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that the amount (P4,440.00) paid by respondent was the minimum fee, which indicates that what was contracted was merely brokerage and forwarding services.&nbsp; As found by the trial court, however, the said amount was only the initial charge for brokerage and forwarding fees, which was to be reimbursed by petitioner upon collection of the final service fees for the “door-to-door” delivery from the consignee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that, because respondent found its seafreight rates expensive, the latter asked Minnie Almarines, petitioner’s account executive, to send his shipment through another company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This claim is belied by the evidence presented by the parties.&nbsp; Based on the price quotation of petitioner, its rates are as follows:<br><blockquote>“<u>LCL SHIPMENTS - SEAFREIGH</u>T<br><br>From: MANILA<br>To&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : WASHINGTON, U.S.A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US$140.00/cbm +<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">P80.00 (LCL charge)<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Door-to-Door Service: Additional US$160.00<br>(until 5 cbm)”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></div></blockquote>On the other hand, the rate charged by Continental Freight for the two shipments of <i>broas</i> was US$350.00/CBM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Hence, contrary to petitioner’s allegation, Continental Freight’s rate was more expensive than that of petitioner.&nbsp; In fact, respondent chose petitioner over other shipping companies precisely because petitioner offered the best terms and conditions, to wit: (1) the goods would be picked up from the shipper’s office or residence; (2) the goods would be delivered within 24 days from pick up; (3) the expenses would be paid for by the consignee upon delivery (freight collect); (4) the consignee would be informed regarding the shipment within two weeks from the pick up of goods from the shipper’s residence or office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i>Second.</i>&nbsp; According to petitioner, the contract for delivery of cookies was between respondent and Continental Freight Services, Inc. and that what it did was merely to act as an agent of respondent in dealing with Continental Freight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>We are not convinced.&nbsp; The contract was between respondent and petitioner.&nbsp; It was petitioner which dealt with Continental Freight and not respondent, whose transaction was limited to petitioner.&nbsp; Respondent testified that he never contracted the services of Continental Freight and that it was petitioner which dealt with the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Respondent denied he ever authorized petitioner to ship his goods through Continental Freight and claimed that he only came to know about the said arrangement when he was given a copy of the bills of lading issued by Continental Freight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> For this reason, according to respondent, when he learned that the shipment never reached the consignee, he contacted petitioner instead of Continental Freight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondent’s testimony was confirmed by Minnie Almarines, petitioner’s account executive, who testified that she contacted Continental Freight regarding the details of the shipment of the cookies.&nbsp; When she was informed by respondent that the <i>broas</i> had not been received by the consignee in the U.S.A., she saw the manager of Continental Freight to follow up the shipments.<br><br>The claim of Almarines that she only acted as a representative of respondent as part of her company’s goodwill<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> is hard to believe.&nbsp; There is absolutely no evidence to support this allegation.&nbsp; Moreover, the business which respondent gave to petitioner is so inconsequential to merit the extensive services given free.&nbsp; Indeed, respondent denies he ever authorized petitioner to ship his goods through Continental Freight.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner’s claim that respondent asked Almarines to ship his goods through Continental Freight because of its lower freight rates, the evidence shows that Continental Freight in fact charged higher rates than petitioner.&nbsp; All these circumstances lead to the conclusion that it was petitioner which engaged the services of Continental Freight for the shipment of respondent’s goods, without the knowledge and consent of respondent and that, as far as the latter is concerned, his contract for “door-to-door” delivery service to the United States was with petitioner.<br><br><i>Third.</i>&nbsp; With regard to the awards to respondent, we find the award for actual damages to be excessive and that for moral and exemplary damages to be without basis.<br><br>Respondent testified that the price per tin can of <i>broas</i> was P51.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Since there were 18 cans per carton, the 44 cartons of <span style="font-style: italic;">broas</span> were worth P40,392.00 (44 cartons x 18 x P51.00).&nbsp; This is the amount of actual damages to which petitioner is entitled.&nbsp; The award of P575,518.15 as unrealized profit is based merely on the projection of income prepared by respondent’s accountant Felicisima Saria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The rule is that to be able to recover actual or compensatory damages, the amount of loss must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty, based on competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the award of moral and exemplary damages should be deleted.&nbsp; In view of Art. 2220 of the Civil Code, it has been held that “in <i>culpa contractual</i> or breach of contract, moral damages may be recovered when the defendant acted in bad faith or was guilty of gross negligence (amounting to bad faith) or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Since the law presumes good faith, the person claiming moral damages must prove bad faith or ill motive by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The evidence presented by respondent in this case is insufficient to overcome the presumption of good faith in favor of petitioner.<br><br>Neither is respondent entitled to exemplary damages.&nbsp; Under Art. 2232, such damages may be awarded in contracts and quasi-contracts if the defendant acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner.&nbsp; Respondent has not sufficiently established that petitioner acted in such manner as to warrant the grant of exemplary damages.<br><br>Anent the award for attorney’s fees and the cost of litigation in favor of respondent, we are in accord with the trial court and the appellate court that respondent is entitled to an award of these items.&nbsp; Respondent in this case was compelled to litigate and, as a result, incurred expenses in order protect his interests.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award of actual damages to respondent is reduced to P40,392.00, while the awards for moral and exemplary damages to him are deleted.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Bellosillo, (Chairman), Quisumbing</i>, and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>De Leon, Jr., J.</i>, abroad on official business.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Justice Renato C.
