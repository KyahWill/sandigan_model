				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Calbayog City, Branch 31, in Criminal Cases Nos. 3022, 3023 and 3024, finding accused-appellants Ronito Boller, Dianito Boller and Francisco Boller guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of Murder for the killing of Lolito dela Cruz, Jesus Orquin and Arsenio Orquin, sentencing each accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each count, and ordering them to indemnify, jointly and severally, the surviving heirs of the victims in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On December 22, 1995, accused-appellants were charged with Murder under three informations, similarly worded save for the name of the victim, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 27<sup>th</sup> day of October, 1995, at about 8:00 o’clock in the morning, at the coconut plantation of Barangay Hinayagan, Municipality of Gandara, Province of Samar, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, and shot one Lolito de la Cruz with the use of firearms (M-14 rifle, M-1 rifle and shotgun), which the accused conveniently provided themselves for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon the latter fatal gunshot wound on his body, which caused the untimely death of said Lolito de la Cruz.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>When arraigned, the three accused-appellants, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thereafter, the three cases were consolidated and tried jointly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>It appears that at 8:00 in the morning of October 27, 1995, brothers Jacinto and Jesus Orquin, their father Arsenio Orquin, and their uncle Lolito de la Cruz, were working at their copra kiln in Barangay Hinayagan, Gandara, Samar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> They heard dogs barking, so Jacinto went outside to see what was wrong.&nbsp; He saw accused-appellants Obat Boller, Nonoy Boller and Bayani Boller, about three meters away.&nbsp; Obat was holding an M-14 Garand, Bayani Boller was holding a shotgun, and Nonoy Boller was armed with a Garand.&nbsp; All of them were pointing their firearms at the copra kiln.&nbsp; Jacinto ran away.&nbsp; Accused-appellants opened fire at the copra kiln, hitting Arsenio Orquin, Jesus Orquin and Lolito de la Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As Jacinto was running across the river, he heard Jesus shout, “<i>Entoy, don’t leave me, I will die!</i>”&nbsp; Jacinto looked back and saw his brother in the water.&nbsp; Jacinto went back and brought Jesus to the river bank.&nbsp; He lay Jesus down and covered him with cogon grass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Jacinto proceeded towards Barangay Hinayan.&nbsp; As he was running, he met Roberto Tolin.&nbsp; Jacinto told Roberto that accused-appellants shot his brother, father and uncle, and asked him to go to the copra kiln and to save them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Moments later, Nixon de la Cruz reported to Barangay Captain Gutardo Berbis that his father, Lolito, was wounded and was in the house of Claro Arterio.&nbsp; Upon instruction of Berbis, Kagawad Pedro Sumagdon proceeded to the house of Arterio, bringing with him a pen and paper on which to write down any statement that Lolito would make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Sumagdon found Lolito lying on his right side.&nbsp; He asked Lolito, <i>“Why are you wounded?”</i>&nbsp; Lolito answered, “<i>I was shot by Obat Boller, Nonoy Boller and Bayani Boller.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Sumagdon wrote down the statement, which is translated in English as follows:<br><blockquote>Statement of Lolito de la Cruz who was shot and these were the persons whom he saw, Nonoy Boller, Obat Boller and Bayani Boller, and they were clothed with military uniforms and some of them are members of CHDF of Bu-aw and the place where the shooting incident took place is near the coconut plantation of Arsenio Orquin.</blockquote>Lolito’s declaration was witnessed and heard by Roberto Tolin and Ponciano Orquin.&nbsp; The written statement, entitled “Ante-Mortem,” was signed by Sumagdon, Tolin and Orquin.&nbsp; According to them, Lolito was unable to move his right hand at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Lolito was carried on a hammock and brought to Bu-aw for treatment, but he died before reaching the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Roberto Tolin and others went to the scene of the crime and found the lifeless body of Arsenio Orquin lying face up.&nbsp; Across the river, they found the corpse of Jesus Orquin.&nbsp; Roberto and his companions gathered several empty shells on the ground about five arms’ length from the copra kiln.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The bodies of Jesus and Arsenio Orquin were brought to Gandara for autopsy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Cresilda Teston-Aguilar of the Rural Health Unit of Gandara, Samar, who conducted the autopsy, reported the following findings:<br><blockquote><ol><li>On the victim Lolito de la Cruz: <br><br><ol type="a"> <li>Exhibit “D” – The Autopsy Report with the following physical findings:<br><blockquote>“A.
