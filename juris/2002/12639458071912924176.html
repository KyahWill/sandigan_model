				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">This refers to
the Second Motion for Reconsideration or Motion for Relief from Judgment dated
July 18, 2001,</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">filed by
respondents Sheriffs Antonio V. Leaño, Jr. and Rosbert M. Tuquero alleging that
they are not guilty of unreasonable delay in the execution of the writ of
demolition in Civil Case No. 5747, entitled: <i>“Lolita P. Casila Mendoza, rep.
by her Atty. -in-fact Orlando Mendoza vs. Maria Vda. Tolentino, Sps.</i> <i>Efren
Reyes and Magdalena Tolentino, Sps. Ricardo Pineda and Gloria Tolentino, Sps.
Eulogio Tolentino and Lucila Tolentino;” </i>that plaintiff cannot hold them
liable for the delay which he, himself, had caused; that the gap or distance
from June 13, 1994, the date when the Writ of Demolition was issued up to the
issuance of the second Alias Writ of Demolition on February 5, 1997 (or 2 years,
7 months and 5 days) was caused by plaintiff agreeing to the postponement of
the scheduled demolition; that their participation in the case started only in
the second alias writ of demolition which was issued on February 5, 1997; that
the first two (2) writs were personally handled by the late Sheriff Antonio Q.
Leaño, Sr. of the Office of the Clerk of Court whose assignment was to
implement all writs issued by the municipal courts within their jurisdiction,
as per agreement among the sheriffs in their court; that respondent Rosbert
Tuquero, sheriff of Branch 65 of the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac, whose duty
was to implement only writs issued by that court, only assisted the late
Antonio Q. Leaño, Sr. in the implementation of the original writ of demolition
upon the latter’s request; that Tuquero did not assist anymore in the
implementation of the alias writ of demolition because during those times he
was already busy implementing writs of demolition issued by the RTC of Tarlac
(Branch 65); that Leaño, Sr. died on May 19, 1996 without being able to submit
a sheriff’s return of service; that the second Alias Writ of Demolition dated
February 5, 1997 clearly shows that the first alias writ of demolition was not
implemented in view of the request of the defendants for time to voluntarily
remove their houses which, for humanitarian reasons, the plaintiff granted;
that the second alias writ of demolition was personally handled by respondent
sheriff Antonio Leaño, Jr. who succeeded and took the place of his late father
in the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC (Tarlac); that he was assisted
by respondent sheriff Tuquero; that the second alias writ of demolition was not
implemented because they received copies of summons and orders issued by Branch
63 of the RTC of Tarlac City in Civil Case No. 8323 regarding the prayer for
the issuance of a temporary restraining order and injunction against the
Presiding Judge of Branch 11, Municipal Trial Court, Tarlac City and the
Provincial Sheriff of Tarlac; that the third alias writ of demolition was
issued on April 18, 1997; that on the day set for the demolition, they were
ready with the laborers and policemen who were requested to maintain peace and
order; that the defendants requested Atty. Enrico Barin, counsel for the
plaintiffs, to give them a relocation site of the land in question and at the
same time they asked that the demolition of their houses be postponed pending
approval of the plaintiff, to which Atty. Barin agreed; that under the
circumstances, they submitted their sheriff’s return containing the said
information; that on June 19, 1997, plaintiff filed a motion for the issuance
of fourth alias writ of demolition confirming therein that the third alias writ
of demolition was postponed because defendants were negotiating for relocation
site of their lands; that they could not be blamed for the non-implementation
of the writ of demolition; that the third writ of demolition was issued only on
July 4, 1997 but they were not informed about its issuance by the plaintiff;
that instead of delivering to them a copy of said writ of demolition, plaintiff
Mendoza went directly to the Supreme Court to file the complaint against them
claiming that they were guilty of unreasonable delay in the implementation of
the writ of demolition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Attached to the
Second Motion for Reconsideration or Motion for Relief from Judgment is a
Motion for Reconsideration which appears to have been filed in the Office of
the Deputy Court Administrator and received by Docket and Clearance Division of
the Office of the Court Administrator on July 20, 2001. This motion was never
referred to the Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">After the
Resolution of the Court <i>en banc </i>promulgated on June 28, 2001, dismissing
both respondents sheriffs form service, complainant Orlando T. Mendoza filed a
manifestation with motion for clarification which the Court <i>en banc </i>merely
noted in its Resolution dated August 14, 2001. However, we observed that the
complainant, in his letter dated November 21, 1997, charged Atty. Roberto
Tuquero and not Rosbert Tuquero, herein respondent sheriff, with the manifest
negligence and from misfeasance of official functions and duties; and that it
was Atty. Roberto Tuquero who was impleaded in his original complaint because
Atty. Tuquero received the money supposed to be for payment of the demolition
crew and he is the person to blame in the delay of the implementation of the
writ of demolition. An examination of the record reveals that Atty. Roberto Tuquero
is the Clerk of Court and ex-oficio provincial sheriff of the RTC of Tarlac.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On September 14,
2001, complainant Mendoza filed an Affidavit which was received by the Docket
and Clearance Division, Office of the Court Administrator wherein he denies the
Affidavit</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">alleged to
have been executed by him, praying that the respondents sheriffs be relieved
from liability considering that they have already been placed possession of the
property. He claims that said affidavit does not bear his true signature and
that he did not see nor appear before the said notary public and prays that the
dismissal against sheriffs Tuquero and Leaño, Jr. shall remain and that Atty.
Roberto Tuquero be included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On October 2,
2001, the Court <i>en banc </i>issued a Resolution noting the affidavit of
complainant Mendoza and requesting respondents sheriffs to comment on said
affidavit within ten (10) days from notice. In compliance therewith, both
respondents filed their “Comment/Affidavit” maintaining that complainant
Mendoza actually signed the affidavit referred to by the latter and appeared
before Notary Public Godofredo Sabado, Jr.; that it is probable that Mendoza
executed said Affidavit dated August 15, 2001 because of their failure to give
him the One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php 100,000.00) he was asking for the
settlement of the case; that Atty. Roberto Tuquero had nothing to do with the
implementation of the writ of demolition issued in Civil Case No. 5745 by the
MTC, Tarlac City; that Atty. Tuquero did not issue any order in this case
except to implement the fourth alias writ of demolition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">On November 27,
2001, the Court <i>en banc </i>issued a resolution taking note only of the
Comment/Afffidavit filed by respondents sheriffs Leaño, Jr. and Tuquero and the
Second Motion for Reconsideration or Motion for Relief from Judgment of the <i>per
curiam </i>resolution of June 28, 2001 dismissing both respondents sheriffs
from service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">After a
painstaking examination of the second motion for reconsideration or motion for
relief from judgment together with the attachments thereto as well as the first
motion for reconsideration and as borne by the other portions of the rollo, we
find that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

1997, signed by both respondents sheriffs reporting that the second alias writ

signed by both respondents sheriffs reporting that the third alias writ of
demolition had already lapsed, duly served but unsatisfied because the counsel

demolition upon request of the defendants to give them a relocation site

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Clearly
therefrom, the second motion for reconsideration together with the first motion
for reconsideration should be granted insofar as respondent Sheriff Leaño, Jr.
is concerned. He was remiss of his duty to immediately implement the alias writ
of demolition issued by the trial court between the period starting from July
4, 1997 to March 2, 1998 or only eight (8) months. He failed to explain why no
action had been taken in-between said dates. For this reason, the resolution of
this Court dismissing respondent Sheriff Leaño, Jr. should be reconsidered and
he be imposed to suffer suspension for a period of fifteen (15) months; while
respondent Sheriff Rosbert Tuquero’s dismissal should be maintained as he
assisted in the implementation of the writ of execution since 1994 which
constituted gross neglect of duty and serious misconduct in office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The complaint of
Orlando T. Mendoza against Atty. Roberto Tuquero should be sent back to the OCA
for investigation, report and recommendation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, the first and second motions for
reconsideration are partly GRANTED. Respondent Sheriff Leaño, Jr. is found
guilty of negligence and imposed a penalty of suspension for a period of
fifteen (15) months effective date of receipt of copy of June 28, 2002
resolution of this Court. The motions are DENIED for lack of merit insofar as
Rosbert M. Tuquero is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
