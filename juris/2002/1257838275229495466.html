Macam and Zenaida R. Macam; two neighbors, Emiliano Abalos and Veronica Reyes; and Dr. Luisa Fernandez Cayabyab.<br><br>Testifying in her behalf, Zenaida told the court that at about 4:00 a.m. of February 22, 1998, she was awakened as she found accused-appellant on top of her and raping her.&nbsp; She did not tell her mother what had happened although the latter was sleeping beside her because accused-appellant threatened to kill her if she did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Mergie, narrating how she was abused by accused-appellant, testified as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At about 1:00 p.m., in March 1997, while she was washing clothes, her mother called her and told her to go upstairs because accused-appellant wanted to tell her something.&nbsp; When Mergie went to see accused-appellant, the latter pulled her towards him and forced her to lie down.&nbsp; Then he raped her.&nbsp; Mergie said she felt pain in her private parts while accused-appellant was forcing his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; She was crying and resisting accused-appellant, but her resistance proved to be futile.&nbsp; She could not shout as accused-appellant threatened her with a <i>balisong</i>.&nbsp; After the rape, she sat in a corner of the room and cried, and later went back to her work washing clothes.<br><br>Again, at about 2:00 p.m. on January 14, 1998, while she was alone in the house cooking food, she was raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; He threatened her with a knife if she did not yield to him.&nbsp; Complainant's mother was then in the market selling fish.&nbsp; Her younger sisters were in school while her younger brother was playing.<br><br>At about 11:00 a. m. of February 12, 1998, on the occasion of the third rape, complainant was alone in the house, her sister Jessica and her brother Jestoni having gone to their neighbors' houses to play while their mother was away.&nbsp; Complainant was washing clothes when accused-appellant called her.&nbsp; As she was approaching, accused-appellant immediately pulled her towards him and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him.&nbsp; Accused-appellant left the house thereafter, leaving Mergie crying.&nbsp; When Mergie took a bath, she felt a sticky substance inside her vagina.<br><br>On the fourth occasion Mergie said she was raped at about 12:00 noon of February 16, 1998.&nbsp; Her mother and her sister Zenaida had gone to the market, while her other siblings were playing in the neighbor's house.&nbsp; She was alone in the house taking a nap when she was awakened by accused-appellant, who tried to remove her clothes and forced her to have sexual intercourse again.&nbsp; Because of his threats, Mergie said she yielded to accused-appellant's advances.&nbsp; He left her crying.<br><br>Finally, at about 1:00 p.m. of February 23, 1998, while complainant was taking a bath, accused-appellant entered the bathroom and grabbed her towards him.&nbsp; When her mother saw her resisting, she told her to give in to the demands of accused-appellant, telling her that he was the provider of the family.&nbsp; Her mother watched as accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; Then, accused-appellant made her watch as he and her mother performed sexual intercourse.<br><br>The following day, February 24, 1998, at about 8:00 a.m., Mergie found her sister Zenaida crying.&nbsp; Zenaida told her that she had been raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; Mergie confided to Zenaida that she too had been raped several times by accused-appellant.&nbsp; The sisters embraced each other and cried together.&nbsp; Their neighbors, Emiliano Abalos (<i>Kuya Emy</i>) and Veronica Reyes (<i>Atchi Bing</i>), who happened to pass by their house, saw them crying and asked them what had happened.&nbsp; After learning that the two had been raped, Abalos and Reyes confronted the children's mother and accused-appellant about the matter, but both refused to talk as they went back inside the house.&nbsp; Abalos and Reyes later came back and accompanied the sisters to the DSWD and, later, to the Gov. Teofilo Sison Memorial Hospital in Dagupan City, where they were examined.&nbsp; The sisters later went to the police station where they gave their sworn statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> That&nbsp; afternoon, February 24, 1998, the police arrested accused-appellant.&nbsp; On that day, Mergie and Zenaida filed their respective criminal complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for rape against accused-appellant.<br><br>On February 24, 1998, Dr. Luisa Fernandez-Cayabyab, Medical Officer III of the Gov.

Casaclang denied that she was raped by her father Macario Macam.&nbsp; She said that her sister Mercedes and accused-appellant lived in the house of her father for seven months and he (accused-appellant) was in fact designated as a barangay tanod of Dorongan, Lingayen.&nbsp; She denied that her father had raped Mercedes.&nbsp; She said that Mercedes pleaded with her to withdraw the criminal complaints against accused-appellant but she turned her down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Nadie Muro testified that Jessica Macam, the younger sister of the two complainants, was also placed under the custody of the DSWD and that Jessica disclosed to her during one of the sessions that Mercedes told her that she would drown herself (<i>magpapakalunod siya sa dagat</i>) if accused-appellant was convicted.&nbsp; Because of this, Jessica agreed to testify that her grandfather (Macario) raped her sister Mergie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Complainant Mergie Macam was recalled to the stand.&nbsp; She denied that her grandfather had raped her.&nbsp; She said that the testimonies of her mother and accused-appellant that they were both either in Basista or Urbiztondo on the dates subject of the rape, were not true and that there were times when only her mother sold fish in the market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On July 23, 1999, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant guilty of six counts of rape.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its decision reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape, and accordingly:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5830, the death penalty is hereby imposed [upon the accused] and [for him] to indemnify Mergie Raoet Macam in the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5831, the death penalty is hereby imposed upon the accused and for him to indemnify Mergie Raoet Macam [in] the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5832, the death penalty is hereby imposed upon the accused and for him to indemnify Mergie Raoet Macam [in] the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5833, the death penalty is hereby imposed upon the accused and for him to indemnify Zenaida Raoet Macam [in] the amount of P75, 000.00;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5834, the death penalty is hereby imposed upon the accused and for him to indemnify Mergie Raoet Macam in the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5835, the death penalty is hereby imposed upon the accused and for him to indemnify Mergie Raoet Macam [in] the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br>and to pay moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00 to each of the [complainants], without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency with the accessory penalties provided by law.&nbsp; The accused is also ordered to pay the costs in each case.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><b>First.</b> Accused-appellant contends that the informations filed against him are defective because they failed to allege filial relationship between him and the victims.&nbsp; Indeed, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of R.A. No. 7659, provides that the death penalty shall be imposed in cases of rape if the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is the parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br><br>The minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender are thus qualifying circumstances which increase the penalty, as distinguished from a generic aggravating circumstance, which affects only the period of the penalty.&nbsp; As such, it should be alleged in the information as a requirement of the accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> These special qualifying circumstances must also be proved with certainty; otherwise, the penalty of death cannot be imposed upon the accused.&nbsp; Thus, should the information fail to allege any of these two qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship, the correct imposable penalty would be <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In these cases, while the informations alleged the exact ages of the two complainants at the time of the incidents, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, in all instances, below eighteen (18) years of age, the allegation of accused-appellant's relationship to them as their stepfather was erroneous.&nbsp; This is because accused-appellant is not the stepfather of the complainants, he and their mother never having been married and being merely engaged in a common-law relationship.&nbsp; The error in the designation of accused-appellant as the "stepfather" of the complainants is due to their mistaken belief that the fact the accused-appellant had been living with their mother made him "the husband of [our] mother."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Complainants'&nbsp; mother in fact testified that she and accused-appellant, a widower, decided not to get married even if they were capacitated to marry each other.&nbsp; She said this as a witness for the defense.<br><br>On the other hand, the trial court, although knowing accused-appellant to be merely "the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim," probably thought that, as in popular parlance, a common-law husband can be considered the stepfather of the children of his common-law wife.&nbsp; This is of course error because in law the term "stepparent" refers to an accused who is legally married to one of the parents of the victim.<br><br>Nevertheless, we hold that the penalty of death imposed in Criminal Case Nos. 5830, 5831, 5832, and 5835 by the trial court is proper.&nbsp; As earlier explained, the concurrence of both relationship and minority, partaking in the nature of special qualifying circumstances, must be alleged in the information and proved during the trial so that the death penalty can be imposed.&nbsp; When either one of the said circumstances is omitted or lacking, that which is pleaded in the information and proven by the evidence, like the minority of the complainants in these cases, may be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; The informations in the aforesaid cases alleged that in the commission of the rapes, accused-appellant was "armed with a&nbsp; <i>balisong</i>" (in Criminal Case No. 5830) or "armed with a knife" (in Criminal Case Nos. 5831, 5832, and 5835).&nbsp; These allegations were sufficiently proven during the trial.&nbsp; Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, in all cases in which the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, and the crime was committed with the presence of one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.&nbsp; Considering the presence in these cases of the aggravating circumstance of minority of the complainants, the proper penalty is death.<br><br><b>Second.</b>&nbsp; Accused-appellant claims that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial court erred in giving full weight and credence to the testimonies of complainants Mergie and Zenaida despite the fact that these were inconsistent and contradictory.<br><br>This contention has no merit.&nbsp; The conclusions of the trial court with respect to the credibility of the witnesses are in the first place generally accorded great respect by this Court because of the trial court's unique position which enables it to observe the demeanor of the witness on the stand.&nbsp;

done something to wake up the other members of the household.&nbsp; Zenaida's reaction was not unusual.&nbsp; Accused-appellant threatened to kill her if she shouted for help.&nbsp; In truth, as has been held, rape is no respecter of time and place.&nbsp; It is known to be committed in places ordinarily considered as unlikely.&nbsp; The scene of the rape is not always nor necessarily isolated or secluded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Rape can be committed in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house, and even in a room where other members of the family are also sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Among couples with large families who live in cramped quarters, the presence of other members of the family is not necessarily a deterrent to the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, it was not impossible for accused-appellant to have access to Zenaida, who was then sleeping beside him together with her other siblings.<br><br>Accused-appellant says that Mergie's delay in reporting the rape incidents to her relatives, school guidance counselor, police authorities, and her mother casts doubt on the truthfulness of her allegations.&nbsp; It has likewise been held, however, that delay in reporting the rapes does not prove that they have not been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Indeed, complainant Mergie's narration of her ordeal is straightforward.&nbsp; We reproduce here her testimony

It is a lame excuse on the part of accused-appellant that he was at the market selling fish during the subject dates when the rapes happened.&nbsp; Not even the corroborating testimonies of the other defense witnesses could help his cause.&nbsp; A bare denial, if unsupported by clear and convincing evidence, is self-serving and cannot be given greater evidentiary weight than the positive declarations of the complainants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time of the alleged crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Accused-appellant failed to establish that it was physically impossible for him to be at home at the subject dates when the rapes were allegedly committed.&nbsp; We find it incredible for defense witnesses, Corazon Bandong and Perla Ursua, to vividly remember the dates when they saw him in the market, <i>i.e.</i>, January 14, February 16 and 23, 1998, to show that accused-appellant could not have committed the rapes.<br><br><b>Third.</b>&nbsp; Accused-appellant makes much of the fact that, in Criminal Case No. 5830, the information did not state the time when the rape was allegedly committed.&nbsp; It merely alleged it was committed in the afternoon of January 14, 1998.&nbsp; Accused-appellant claims this is a violation of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and case of the accusation against him.<br><br>The precise time of the crime has no substantial bearing on its commission.&nbsp; As such, it is not essential that it be alleged in the information with ultimate precision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Section 11 of Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure provides that it is not necessary to state in the complaint or information the precise time at which the offense was committed except when time is a material ingredient of the offense,&nbsp; but that the act may be alleged to have been committed at any time as near to the actual date at which the offense was committed as the information or complaint will permit.<br><br>For the same reason, in Criminal Case No. 5835, it is not essential to allege the specific date when the crime was committed.&nbsp; It is sufficient to state that it was committed "in the month of March 1997."&nbsp; The exact date of the commission is not an essential element of the crime of rape, for the gravamen of the offense is carnal knowledge of a woman without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In this case, the fact of sexual intercourse by accused-appellant against the will of Mergie sometime in March 1997 was adequately proven by the prosecution.<br><br><b>Fourth.</b>&nbsp; With regard to the civil indemnity, the trial court awarded P75,000.00 to each of the complainants for each count of rape in view of the imposition of the penalty of death on accused-appellant.&nbsp;

In&nbsp; addition to such indemnity, the victim is also entitled to recover moral damages, pursuant to Article 2219 of the Civil Code, in such amount as the court deems just, without the necessity of pleading or proof of the basis thereof other than the fact of the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As regards exemplary damages, it was held in <i>People vs. Catubig</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> that if there is an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying, exemplary damages may be awarded to the offended party pursuant to Article 2230 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; Consequently, an award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is proper.<br><br>Thus, in Criminal Case Nos. 5830, 5831, 5832, and 5835, since accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of death, the complainant, Mergie Raoet Macam, should be indemnified in the amount of P75,000.00, or the total amount of P300,000.00, for each count of rape.&nbsp; Moreover, for each count of rape, the additional amounts of P50,000.00, or the total amount of P200,000.00, as moral damages and P25,000.00, or the total amount of P100,00.00, as exemplary damages should be awarded to her.<br><br>On the other hand, since in Criminal Case Nos. 5833 and 5834, accused-appellant is guilty only of simple rape, not in its qualified form, he should be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case and ordered to pay the offended parties, Zenaida Raoet Macam and Mergie Raoet Macam, the amount of P50,000.00 each, as civil indemnity, and the additional amount of P50,000.00 each, as moral damages.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 39, Lingayen, Pangasinan, finding accused-appellant Carlos Escaño guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged in Criminal Case Nos. 5830, 5831, 5832, 5833, 5834, and 5835, is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; In Criminal Case Nos. 5830, 5831, 5832, and 5835, accused-appellant is found guilty of qualified rape and is hereby sentenced to suffer in each case the penalty of death and ordered to pay the offended party, Mergie Raoet Macam, for each count of rape, the amount of P75,000.00 (or the total amount of P300,000.00) as civil indemnity, the additional amounts of P50,000.00 (or the total amount of P200,000.00) as moral damages, and P25,000.00 (or the total amount of P100,000.00), as exemplary damages; and<br><br>(2) In Criminal Case Nos. 5833 and 5834, accused-appellant is found guilty only of simple rape and is accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case and ordered to pay each of the offended parties, Zenaida Raoet Macam and Mergie Raoet Macam, the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and the additional amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>In accordance with Section 25 of R.A.
