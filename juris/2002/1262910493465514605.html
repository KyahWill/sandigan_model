Bandonill, the medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation-Cordillera Administrative Region (NBI-CAR);&nbsp; Mrs. Jean dela Cruz, mother of complainant and spouse of accused-appellant; and SPO2 Melchor Ong of the Baguio City Police.<br><br>The prosecution established that accused-appellant married Jean dela Cruz in civil rites on 14 April 1977 and again in Catholic rites on 27 December 1978.&nbsp; They begot four children, namely:&nbsp; Jeanie Ann (the private complainant), Divine Grace, Daniel Jay and Gerard Niño.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, a teacher, worked at the Don Bosco Technical Institute in Tarlac from 1978 to 1986.&nbsp; He transferred to the Don Bosco Elementary School in Baguio City sometime in 1986 and taught there until the following year.&nbsp; In 1987, he worked at the Saint Louis Center in Baguio City until his dismissal therefrom in 1993. Accused-appellant again taught at the Don Bosco Technical Institute in Tarlac from 1993 until his arrest in August 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> While working there, he and his son Daniel stayed in Sto. Cristo, Tarlac on weekdays and went home every 15 days or every payday.&nbsp; They would go home to Baguio City, where the rest of their family stayed, on Friday evening and return to Tarlac on Sunday afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Jeannie Ann dela Cruz (“Jeannie Ann”) testified that she was born to accused-appellant and Jean Aqui-dela Cruz on&nbsp; April 18, 1979 in Tarlac, Tarlac.&nbsp; Not long after her birth, her family transferred to the house of her maternal grandmother in No. 2 Sumulong Street, Baguio City.&nbsp; Her family lived in an extension of her grandmother’s house which had a basement, a second floor and an attic.&nbsp; The second floor had four rooms and a stairs leading to the attic, which served as a stockroom.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann’s parents and her two&nbsp; brothers, Daniel and Niño, stayed in the basement while she and her sister, Divine stayed in the second floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Jeannie Ann revealed that accused-appellant started molesting her when she was seven years old.&nbsp; While he helped do her homework at night, accused-appellant would on occasion make her hold his penis and masturbate him.&nbsp; There were also instances when he would put his penis inside her mouth and withdraw the same when a white liquid came out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Accused-appellant warned Jeannie Ann not to tell her mother what he was doing to her and told her that it was a normal thing between father&nbsp; and&nbsp; daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp; He further warned Jeannie Ann that her mother might kill them should she learn about the things that they did.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann believed accused-appellant and did not tell anyone about the sexual acts he performed on her.&nbsp; As she was growing up, accused-appellant continued to engage in the aforementioned sexual activities with her, and continuously threatened to hurt her, her siblings or her mother if she did not give in to his desires.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann still refrained from complaining because she was convinced by the accused-appellant that the sexual activities which he performed on her were proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She&nbsp; recounted before the trial court three particular occasions when accused-appellant molested her.<br><br>Jeannie Ann said that sometime in September 1990,&nbsp; she was sexually abused by accused-appellant in their house in No. 37 Leonard Wood Road, Baguio City. She was only 11 years old then.&nbsp; According to Jeannie Ann, their family had moved to said house when her grandmother’s house in Sumulong St. was destroyed in the July 16, 1990 earthquake that hit Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They occupied the basement of the house in Leonard Wood Road. The basement had two bedrooms, a comfort room and a living room.&nbsp; Nobody stayed in the second floor thereof but during the day they stayed in the main house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Sometime that month, Jeannie Ann, her three year-old brother Niño and accused-appellant were left in the house while her mother and her sister Divine went to market.&nbsp; She was in the living room with Niño when her father undressed her.&nbsp; Her father removed his pants and she was made to lie down on a cushion. Her father played with her genitalia and rubbed his penis against her private part until a white liquid came out of his penis.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann said that after said incident, she felt pain in her vagina whenever she would urinate (mahapdi).&nbsp; She did not resist because she thought that what her father was doing to her was a normal act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Jeannie Ann narrated that accused-appellant again abused her one night in July 1995 when she was 16 years old.&nbsp; She was watching television with her siblings in the living room. At that time, their mother was attending a meeting in church.&nbsp; Accused-appellant called her three times but she refused to respond to his call as she was watching television.&nbsp; Exasperated, accused-appellant pulled her inside one of the bedrooms and asked her to lie down on the bed saying, "This is only for a while."&nbsp; Accused-appellant then undressed her, removed his pants and underwear, inserted his finger inside her vagina, mashed her breasts and licked her vagina. Accused-appellant proceeded to rub his penis against her vagina and thereafter inserted his penis therein and kept it there until his semen started to come out.&nbsp; Accused-appellant placed his penis on Jeannie Ann’s stomach where he made his semen flow.&nbsp; While all this was happening, Jeannie Ann could only cry, as she was afraid of accused-appellant, because he threatened her that he would kill her or her mother and siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The third incident recounted by Jeannie&nbsp; Ann occurred in their house in No. 2 Sumulong Street, Baguio City on&nbsp; August 2,&nbsp; 1997.&nbsp; She was then 18 years old.&nbsp; When she came home at around 10:30 in the morning after her classes at Saint Louis University, she saw accused-appellant at the door.&nbsp; He told her to proceed to the attic shortly.&nbsp;&nbsp; She ignored him and went directly to her room and started cleaning the same.&nbsp; While she was cleaning the outer portion of her room, she saw accused-appellant go up the attic.&nbsp; While he was there, he repeatedly called her and asked her&nbsp; to go there.&nbsp; When Jeannie Ann remembered that her mother had earlier instructed her to clean the attic, she went up when she was done cleaning her room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant lay on the bed in the attic as Jeannie Ann swept the floor.&nbsp; When she was done, accused-appellant asked her to join him on the bed.&nbsp; He went near her and again asked her to sit on the bed when she refused to heed his call.&nbsp; Accused-appellant whispered to her that he was running out of time. He talked in whispers so that the other people in the house at that time would not be able to hear what he said. Sensing that accused-appellant would again molest her, Jeannie Ann became nervous and started to cry.&nbsp; He told her to stop crying and to relax, as what he was about to do would only take a while.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then lifted Jeannie Ann’s t-shirt and brassier, mashed her breasts with his left hand and inserted his right hand inside her pants.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann resisted, but accused-appellant proceeded to insert a finger of his right hand inside her vagina.&nbsp; While he performed the aforementioned acts on his daughter, accused-appellant told her, “I love you very much. Promise me that I will be the only one who will do this to you.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant only stopped what he was doing when he heard Aileen, a boarder in their house, calling Jeannie Ann.&nbsp; He immediately fixed her clothes and hair, then moved away from her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant instructed Jeannie Ann not to go down and to keep quiet about the incident.&nbsp; When accused-appellant noticed that&nbsp; Aileen had left because Jeannie Ann did not respond to her, accused-appellant embraced Jeannie Ann and said:&nbsp; "Please cooperate with me and trust me.&nbsp; I have given you my life.&nbsp; Promise that I will be the only one who will touch you."&nbsp; Accused-appellant began touching her again. He inserted his fingers inside her vagina.&nbsp; As he touched her, he said, “Please cooperate with me and trust me.&nbsp; This is for your own good and for the good of our family. If you will not follow me, you might regret it.&nbsp; I want you to have a bright future.&nbsp; And after you finish, I can already die and you will no longer have any problem.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Although Aileen, Divine, Niño and Rogel, another boarder in their house were also there at the time of the incident, Jeannie Ann did not have the courage to call for help because she was very much afraid of accused-appellant, and she saw anger in his eyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>When accused-appellant was done with her, Jeannie Ann insisted on going down.&nbsp; She cried as she returned to her room to fix herself.&nbsp; Thereafter, she went out of the house to deal with what had just happened to her.&nbsp; While walking outside toward the bridge,&nbsp; she saw a white L-300 van belonging to the police.&nbsp;&nbsp; She flagged down the vehicle and narrated to the&nbsp; two&nbsp; police officers riding therein, SPO2 Bravo and SPO2 Ong,&nbsp; what accused-appellant had just done to her.&nbsp; The policemen accompanied her back to their house where they met accused-appellant whom Jeannie Ann identified as the person who had raped her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant voluntarily went with the policemen to the Baguio City&nbsp; Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>When they arrived at the Baguio City Police Station, Jeannie Ann narrated her experience to the police officer stationed at the Women’s Desk.&nbsp; In her statement, Jeannie Ann described what accused-appellant did to her on August 2, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Jeannie Ann also denied accused-appellant’s claim that she had sexual relations with her boyfriend Charles, and that she accused her father of rape to get back at him for causing her breakup with Charles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Dr. Ronald R. Bandonill, the NBI-CAR medico-legal officer who conducted a physical examination of Jeannie Ann on August 8, 1997,&nbsp; testified that he found two old healed lacerations at 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock positions on Jeannie Ann’s hymen.&nbsp; He said that the lacerations could have been inflicted more than three months prior to the date of the examination and considering the proximity of their location, could have been inflicted at the same time.&nbsp; A hard rigid instrument like an erect male organ, a rigid wood or a finger could have caused these lacerations. Dr. Bandonill also opined that the positions of the lacerations did not rule out the possibility that the victim had sexual intercourse less than three months prior to his examination of her, since intercourse would not create further lacerations when done in the same position. He likewise noted that the vaginal walls were lax and the vaginal rugosities were slightly flattened and smoothed.&nbsp; The victim's hymenal orifice admitted a tube 2.4 cm. in diameter with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Bandonill said it was possible that penetration happened several times.&nbsp; He further testified that the frequent insertion of a finger or other rigid object, with a diameter of more than an inch, could cause the lacerations as well as the lax condition of vaginal walls.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Jean dela Cruz (“Mrs. dela Cruz”), Jeannie Ann’s mother and wife of accused-appellant, testified that she learned that accused-appellant had sexually abused their daughter Jeannie Ann on&nbsp; August 2, 1997 when she arrived at home after her marketing chores.&nbsp; She was told by her daughter Divine that accused-appellant was picked up by the police.&nbsp; Mrs. dela Cruz followed accused-appellant to the police station and found Jeanie Ann crying while the latter was reporting what had happened to her at the Women's Desk.&nbsp; Upon seeing her daughter, Mrs. dela Cruz hugged her and they cried together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Mrs. dela Cruz further stated that she was shocked upon hearing Jeannie Ann’s statement before the police that accused-appellant had been performing oral sex on their daughter Jeannie Ann since the latter was seven years old, as it was the first time that she learned about it.&nbsp; In her anger, she rushed to the other room where the accused-appellant was being questioned and slapped him, kicked him and scratched his face.&nbsp; She said accused-appellant denied all the accusations against him.&nbsp; When accused-appellant was already incarcerated, Mrs. dela Cruz received several letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> from him asking for forgiveness from her and from Jeannie Ann.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> She also informed the trial court that after accused-appellant’s incarceration, she went to Tarlac to get her husband's things since he usually stayed there on weekdays while he taught at Don Bosco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She discovered several love letters by a certain Emily addressed to accused-appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Emily’s photograph<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and accused-appellant’s draft love letters to Emily, dated March 21, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> September 4, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and March 7, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Mrs. dela Cruz also found a letter from a certain Maureen telling accused-appellant that he had a chance of winning her heart,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and a photograph of Maureen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> She said that the tenor of the letters indicated that accused-appellant was having relations with other women.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Mrs. dela Cruz also denied accused-appellant’s claims that she had a paramour and that she helped Jeannie Ann file the complaints against him because she (Mrs. dela Cruz) wanted to get back at him for being unfaithful to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Melchor Ong, the police officer assigned to the Baguio City Mobile Group, also testified that on August 2, 1997, between 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon, while he and his companion&nbsp; inside an L-300 van of the Baguio City police were passing along&nbsp; Sumulong St., Baguio City, they saw Jeannie Ann walking towards them.&nbsp; The latter stopped them and tearfully reported to them that her father had just sexually molested her.&nbsp; They accompanied Jeannie Ann to her house and there the latter pointed to accused-appellant as the person who mashed her breasts and inserted his finger inside her vagina.&nbsp; SPO2 Ong and his companion approached accused-appellant, introduced themselves as policemen and invited him to the police station.&nbsp; He said that accused-appellant readily agreed to go with them to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The defense presented as witnesses the accused-appellant, Camilo Estepa, Barangay Chairman of Barangay Holy Ghost, Baguio City, Fr.

Cristo, Tarlac, Tarlac and they would go home to their family in Baguio City every 15<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> of each month to give his salary to his wife.&nbsp; When these dates fell on a weekday, they would go home to Baguio City the following Friday and return to Tarlac on Sunday afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>He denied all the accusations hurled against him by his daughter Jeannie Ann.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> According to him, he tried to provide for the needs of his family, especially his wife whom he loved very much.&nbsp; He maintained that even when he was already in jail, he asked his mother and his sister to support his daughter's education.<br><br>He admitted to having gone home to Baguio City in the evening of August 1, 1997, which he recalled was a Friday.&nbsp; That night, his wife asked him to clean the attic the following day as there was a dead rat therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The following day, August 2, 1997, accused-appellant removed the decomposing body of the rat from the attic as requested by his wife.&nbsp; He called his daughter Jeannie Ann who was cleaning her room on the second floor of the house to come to the attic and help him.&nbsp; It took a while before Jeannie Ann heeded his call.&nbsp; When she finally went up, she merely swept one third of the floor area of the attic, away from where the dead rat was.&nbsp; When she was done sweeping the floor, accused-appellant asked her to come near him, as he wanted to apologize for having scolded her earlier and to remind her that she should not have ignored him when he commanded her to go up the attic, or to at least tell him that she could not obey his command immediately.&nbsp; While he was talking to her, they heard someone calling her name.&nbsp; Jeannie Ann told accused-appellant that that person was her classmate.&nbsp; She then went down while accused-appellant stayed on to fix the things in the attic.&nbsp; Not long afterwards, his daughter Divine informed him that they had some visitors downstairs.&nbsp; On his way down from the attic, he looked out of the window and saw&nbsp; Jeannie Ann walking beyond the bridge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant went down to meet the visitors who were looking for Rogel, one of their boarders.&nbsp; After leading these visitors to Rogel, two policemen arrived in their house with Jeannie Ann.&nbsp; Accused-appellant identified the policemen as SPO2 Leonardo Cruz Bravo and SPO2 Melchor Ong.&nbsp; The former asked for accused-appellant’s&nbsp; name and thereafter invited him to the police station.&nbsp; He freely went with them, without asking the purpose of the invitation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>At the station, SPO2 Leonardo Cruz Bravo interviewed accused-appellant.&nbsp; The interview was reduced to writing and he was asked to sign the same.&nbsp; He did not read the document, as he did not have his eyeglasses with him at that time.&nbsp; At first, accused-appellant refused to sign the document without the presence of his counsel.&nbsp; SPO2 Leonardo Cruz Bravo, however, told him that his refusal to sign the document may be interpreted as a sign of resistance on his part.

No. 7610 has been violated by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Moreover, it does not state the acts and omissions constituting the offense, or any special or aggravating circumstances attending the same, as required under the rules of criminal procedure.&nbsp; Section 8, Rule 110 thereof provides:<br><blockquote><i>Designation of the offense.</i> –The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.</blockquote>The allegation in the information that accused-appellant “willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit sexual abuse on his daughter [Jeannie Ann] either by raping her or committing acts of lasciviousness on her”&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a sufficient averment of the acts constituting the offense as required under Section 8, for these are conclusions of law, not facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The information in Criminal Case No. 15368-R is therefore void for being violative of the accused-appellant’s constitutionally-guaranteed right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Although accused-appellant failed to call&nbsp; the attention of both the trial court and this Court regarding the defects of the information in Criminal Case No. 15368-R, the Court may <i>motu proprio</i> dismiss said information at this stage, pursuant to its ruling in <i>Suy Sui vs. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> because the information is a patent violation of the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and of the basic principles of&nbsp; due process.&nbsp; Moreover, an appeal in a criminal proceeding throws the whole case open for review, and it is the duty of the appellate court to correct such errors as might be found in the appealed decision, whether these errors are assigned or not.<br><br>It is likewise necessary to increase the award of damages by the trial court. The lower court in its decision ordered accused-appellant to indemnify the complainant in the amount of&nbsp; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) only&nbsp; in each of the cases, representing moral damages.&nbsp; It failed to award the prescribed amounts for civil indemnity, the award of which is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> This civil liability <i>ex delicto</i> is equivalent to actual or compensatory damages in civil law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It is not to be confused with moral damages, which is awarded upon a showing that the victim endured physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation and similar injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Under prevailing jurisprudence, when the penalty imposed on the accused is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) should be awarded&nbsp; as&nbsp; civil&nbsp; indemnity to the rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, in Criminal Case Nos. 15163-R and 15164-R, an award of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity for each count of rape is proper.<br><br>In addition to civil indemnity, moral damages are automatically granted to the victim in rape cases without need of proof for it is assumed that the private complainant has sustained mental, physical and psychological suffering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The Court affirms the award by the trial court of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages in Criminal Cases&nbsp;
