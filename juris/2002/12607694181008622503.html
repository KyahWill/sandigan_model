				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The new year of 1996 never dawned on Melchor Decosto, Jr. as his life was snuffed by alone bullet a few minutes before midnight of December 31, 1995.<br><br>On January 22, 1996, an Information was filed before the Regional Trial Court of Barili, Cebu, Branch 60, charging Cristobal Gallarde, alias “Tobal”, with the crime of Murder, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 31<sup>st</sup> day of December 1995, at 11:50 o’clock in the evening, more or less, at Barangay Poblacion, Municipality of Moalboal, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, armed with a firearm of unknown caliber, with intent to kill and by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, without any provocation, ATTACK, ASSAULT AND SHOOT one MELCHOR DECOSTO, JR., hitting the latter on the head, thereby causing his death shortly thereafter.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>On July 23, 1996, Gallarde pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Trial ensued thereafter.<br><br>On December 31, 1995, at around 11:50 p.m., Edilfredo Decosto, his cousin Melchor Decosto, Jr., and several others were wandering around the wharf in Moalboal, Cebu, waiting for the New Year’s Eve mass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Cristobal Gallarde suddenly appeared and shot Melchor at close range at the back of the neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Melchor instantly fell to the ground and died. Gallarde quickly ran away without saying a word. Edilfredo asked one of their companions to inform Melchor’s parents and the police of the shooting incident.<br><br>Dr. Necitas Navarro, Municipal Health Officer of Moalboal, Cebu, who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> found the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest and hemorrhage due to the bullet wound on the head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused-appellant Cristobal Gallarde averred that around 11:50 p.m. on the eve of December 3 1995, he met Melchor Decosto, Jr: and his companions who were having a drinking spree. The group invited accused-appellant to drink. He initially refused, but finally acceded. Melchor jokingly pointed a gun at accused-appellant and asked him why he had earlier refused to drink with the group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Accused-appellant wrestled the pistol from Melchor. At that point, the other companions of Melchor kicked accused-appellant on the back. A struggle to gain possession of the gun ensued, in the course of which the gun went off and hit Melchor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Accused-appellant claims that the shooting was accidental and that it was Melchor who pulled the trigger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> After that, accused-appellant got the gun and ran away. He threw the gun into the sea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Armando Caramonte corroborated accused-appellant’s version of the events. He testified that on the date and time in question, he was waiting for his girlfriend in front of the Municipal Building of Moalboal. He saw several people on the wharf and overheard an altercation concerning an invitation to drink liquor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thereafter, the two persons involved in the altercation began wrestling with each other. Soon, he heard a gunshot and saw several people scamper away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented Genovevo Gallarde, father of accused-appellant. Genovevo testified that at around 11:50 p.m. of December 31, 1995, his son came home and told him that he met an accident with Melchor Decosto, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Upon hearing his son’s story, Genovevo decided to talk to the deceased’s parents in an attempt to have an amicable settlement of the controversy, inasmuch as the shooting was an accident. He alleged that Melchor’s parents agreed to settle the case for twenty thousand pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, Genovevo Gallarde was only able to raise fifteen thousand pesos and tendered the same as partial payment, but the Decosto family refused to accept it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, the case was filed against accused-appellant.<br><br>On July 9, 1998, the trial court rendered the appealed decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>Judgment is therefore rendered finding accused Cristobal Gallarde GUILTY of the crime of MURDER and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.<br><br>He is further ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victim the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>In this appeal, accused-appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER NOT WITHSTANDING THAT THE PROSECUTUION FAILED TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT, AND THE INCULPATORY FACTS CAN BE EXPLAINED IN SUCH A MANNER WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INNOCENCE OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT ACCORDING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO TUE CONTENTION OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT THAT THE DEATH OF THE VICTIM WAS PURELY ACCIDENTAL ALTHOUGH THE SAME IS CORROBORATED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO LIKEWISE ERRED IN. FINDING THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS EDILFREDO DECOSTO CREDIBLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT IS PREGNANT WITH FLAWS AND IS BIASED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV.<br></div><br>FINALLY, THE COURT A QUO ALSO ERRED IN FINDING THAT TREACHERY ATTENDED THE KILLING ALTHOUGH NO CREDIBLE AND COMPETENT EVIDENCE ON RECORD ESTABLISHES THIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>We are not persuaded.<br><br>In convicting accused-appellant, the trial court lent credence to the prosecution’s evidence over that of the defense. Once more, we reiterate that we will generally not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in passing upon the credibility of witnesses unless there appears on record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence which have been overlooked and if considered would affect the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> After all, trial courts are in a better position to gauge the reliability and trustworthiness of witnesses on the stand by numerous manifestations no longer capable of being revealed by mute case records elevated to an appellate court.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s theory that the gun accidentally fired during the struggle does not inspire belief. In this connection, we share the observation of the Solicitor General, thus:<br><blockquote>Based on the post-mortem examination conducted by Dr. Navarro, Rural Health Officer of Moalboal, Cebu, it was ascertained that Melchor suffered a gunshot wound with entry point at the left occipital region of the head. When he testified in court, Dr. Navarro demonstrated that the “left occipital region” pertains to the left dorsal portion of the skull.<br><br>The above finding contradicts the claim of appellant that the gun went off while he was grappling possession thereof with Melchor.<br><br>Proceeding from appellant’s version of the incident, appellant and Melchor must have been facing each other while struggling for control of the gun. In the ordinary course of things, the frontal portions of their bodies must have been the ones exposed to the barrel of the gun during the struggle. It is, therefore, inconceivable how the muzzle of the gun found its direction at the left dorsal part of the head of Melchor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, the records show that accused-appellant’s narration itself is replete with material inconsistencies which render his testimony unreliable. Initially, he averred that it was the victim’s younger brother, Toto, who pointed a gun at him, thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you were strolling at the bridge on December 31, 1995 at 11:50 o’clock p.m. and seeing the presence of the victim and his barkadas, could you recall what were these people doing during that time?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">They had a drinking session.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">When you saw them having a drinking session, what happened?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify"><strong>I was invited to drink for four times and for the fifth time I was called again and Toto leveled his gun at me.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>By Toto, whom are you referring to?<br> </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>I am referring to his younger brother.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Younger brother of whom?</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Of Melchor Decosto, Jr.</strong> (Emphasis ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Yet, later during the same direct examination, accused-appellant seems to have changed his mind and asserted that Toto was in fact Melchor Decosto, Jr., not his brother:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Who is bigger, yourself or the victim?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Toto is bigger than me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Are you referring to Toto who was in possession of the gun?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Are you referring to Toto as the one who was hit by the bullet of the gun?<br> </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><strong> Yes, sir.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify"><strong>Are you referring to Toto as Melchor Decosto, Jr.?</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Yes, sir.</strong> (Emphasis ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The prosecution, on the other hand, presented categorical evidence that accused-appellant approached Melchor from behind and shot him pointblank at the back of the neck. The witness who testified, Edilfredo Decosto, could not have been mistaken for he knew accused-appellant since they were children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, Edifredo was standing only a meter or less away from accused-appellant when he shot Melchor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The postmortem examination results support Edilfredo’ s testimony.<br><br>Accused-appellant also faults the trial court for not finding that the victim’s death was accidental.<br><br>The issue of the veracity of accused-appellant’s claim that the shooting was accidental boils down to a question of credibility of the witnesses. As we have stated, we find no reason to differ with the trial court’s factual findings. More specifically, it is not true that accused-appellant’s version of the incident was corroborated by Armando Caramonte. A careful reading of Caramonte’s testimony, however, reveals that he did not see the person who actually pulled the trigger nor witnessed how the trigger was accidentally pulled. In fact, Caramonte testified that he was not even sure who originally held the gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the third assignment of error, accused-appellant claims that the testimony of Edilfredo Decosto was flawed and biased. Accused-appellant refers to Edilfredo’s admission that he was talking to a companion named Jun-Jun when he saw the former point a gun at the victim. Thus, accused-appellant postulates that Edilfredo could not have witnessed what transpired prior to the shooting as he was then distracted and engaged in a conversation which renders his testimony unworthy of belief.<br><br>We disagree. Edilfredo Decosto. clearly narrated that he was standing behind Melchor when suddenly accused-appellant approached the latter from behind,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> brushed aside Edilfredo’s hand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and shot Melchor on the head.<br><br>Accused-appellant also ascribes bias on Edilfredo because he and the victim’s were first cousins.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As it has been consistently held, mere relationship of a witness to a party, without more, cannot impair the witness’ credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> On the contrary, a witness’ relationship to a victim of a crime would even make his or her testimony more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime to accuse thereof somebody other than the real culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is settled that in the absence of a showing of improper motive on the part of the witnesses, their testimonies are not affected by their relationship with the victim and must be accorded full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Hence, accused-appellant’s imputation of bias against prosecution witness Edilfredo Decosto must fail.<br><br>Finally, accused-appellant contends that there was no treachery involved in the killing because the victim turned his head and saw him coming prior to the shooting.<br><br>The argument is specious.<br><br>Contrary to the contention of accused-appellant, the records show that the victim never turned his head to look at him before the shooting took place. Rather, Edilfredo testified that the victim was about to turn and take a seat shortly before he was shot to death, thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">And while you were talking, standing, facing to the sea, waiting for the mass, what happened next?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Suddenly, Cristobal appeared and shot Decosto, Jr.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">How many times did Gallarde shoot the victim, Decosto, Jr.?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Once.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>What was the position of Melchor when shot by Gallarde?<br> </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><strong> He was <em>about</em> to turn sir, because he was <em>about </em>to sit down.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">(Emphasis ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>It is clear from the aforementioned excerpt of Edilfredo’s testimony that the victim did not see accused-appellant approach him from behind as he was <i>just about to turn and sit down</i> at the instant that he was shot.<br><br>The manner of attack indicates that accused-appellant employed treachery in killing Melchor. For treachery to be appreciated, it must be proved that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself and the offender consciously adopted the particular means, methods or form of attack employed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The elements of treachery are therefore: (1) that the malefactor employed means of execution that affords the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and (2) the said means of execution was deliberately and consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The evidence --- both testimonial and physical --- unequivocally shows that accused-appellant suddenly came from behind and shot the deceased pointblank at the back of the neck. The victim, at the time of the attack, was evidently oblivious to the impending danger as he had no reason whatsoever to expect any untoward incident. The victim was, after all, merely waiting for New Year’s Eve mass and enjoying the sea breeze on the wharf with his cousins. The assailant, in view of the position he took and the suddenness of his attack, afforded the victim no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate. The use of a deadly weapon - that of gun, and the location of the bullet wound - at the back of the neck, showed deliberate intent to kill the victim. Hence, the circumstance of treachery was evident, qualifying the crime to Murder:<br><br>As regards the civil aspect of the case at bar, accused-appellant should be made to pay, in line with current jurisprudence, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> in addition to the civil indemnity of P50,000.00 already awarded by the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Barili, Cebu City, Branch 60, finding accused-appellant Cristobal Gallarde beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> is hereby <b>AFFIRME</b>D with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that he is ordered to pay moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 in addition to civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 awarded by the trial court.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno,</i> and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, (Special Member), JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Kapunan</i>, and <i>Austria-Martinez, JJ.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p.2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> TSN, October 31, 1996, pp. 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 4 and 6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, October 15. 1998, p. 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Records, Exhibit B-2, p. 92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, March 17, 1998, p. 4 and 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 5 and 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, April 14, 1998, p.3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, May 21, 1998, p. 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p.4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rollo, pp. 55-61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 25: penned by Judge Ildefonso B.
