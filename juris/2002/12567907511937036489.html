Anent the professional fees, the Sandiganbayan held that “while the same may be considered as unlawful income, forfeiture thereof … or … of the properties equivalent to said amount is not part of the subject matter of the petition.”&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the amount of P63,862.50 alleged to have been his profits from stock transactions, the same turned out to be the tax paid on the gains realized by him in stock transactions in 1983 and, hence,&nbsp;&nbsp; not allowable as part of his income.&nbsp; Also excluded from his disposable funds were the alleged pensions from the U.S. and Philippine governments, since the evidence presented were merely checks dated 1 February 1990 in the amount of $38<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and 31 January 1990 in the amount of P220,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> respectively, albeit payable to Bugarin.&nbsp;&nbsp; It then summarized respondent’s lawful income and disposable funds, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="2"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="39%"><div align="center"><u><strong>Source of Income</strong></u></div></td> <td width="29%"><div align="center"><u></u></div></td> <td width="19%"><div align="center"><u><strong>Amount</strong></u></div></td> <td width="13%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salary, allowances and other emoluments of respondent as<br> NBI Director (not disputed by the petitioner)&nbsp; ………………</td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">P743,243.65</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceeds from sale of Quezon City lot<br> (Exhs. 35, 35-A and 36)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ………………..…………… .</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P300,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proceeds from sale of Iloilo City lot<br> (Exh. 3-B)……..………………………………………………….&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P15,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental Income earned by respondent from the lease of his houses in<br> Dasmariñas Village, Makati; Valle Verde, Pasig; and San Juan<br> (Exhs.39-A, 40-A, 41-A, 43-A and 44-A)………..................……</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P1,748,640.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">_____________</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Total lawful income earned by respondent from<br> 1967 – 1986&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ………………………………………………</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P2,806,883.65</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Outstanding loan balance re:<br> GSIS loan obtained by respondent in 1983,<br> representing additional disposable funds by him<br> (Exh. 2) …………………………………….........…………</td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">P775,073.38</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">_____________</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">Respondent’s total lawful income and additional disposable funds…………………………………………&nbsp; </td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P3,581,957.03<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Respondent’s real property acquisitions and investments were summarized by the Sandiganbayan as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="2"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="39%"><div align="center"><u>Real property acquisitions / Investments</u></div></td><td width="29%"><br></td><td width="19%"><div align="center"><u>Amount</u></div></td> <td width="13%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>1.

At the same time, he made tax payments of P497,094.00 and incurred an estimated family and personal expenses from 1967 to 1986 of P310,000.00. Summed up, respondent Bugarin’s total cash outflow from 1967 to 1986 amounted to P3,561,117.00 out of his lawful income and source of funds (or a total cash inflow) valued at&nbsp; P3,581,957.03. We therefore reach the inevitable conclusion that respondent Bugarin funded his real property acquisitions and business and other investments out of his lawful income as NBI Director and other legitimate sources of financing…. Respondent Bugarin was able to explain to the satisfaction of this Court that aside from his income as NBI Director, he also earned substantial amounts from the sale by his wife of two parcels of land, and rental income from the lease of his three residential houses in Makati, Pasig, and San Juan. He also obtained a loan from the GSIS. These fund, all lawfully acquired, were utilized by him in financing his various acquisitions and business undertakings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Based on these findings, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the petition for forfeiture on the ground of insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>Hence, this petition wherein petitioner maintains that the Sandiganbayan “seriously erred” in holding that<br><blockquote>WHILE THE AMOUNTS OF P490,000.00 (PROFESSIONAL FEES FROM THE SAN JUAN, AFRICA, GONZALES AND SAN AGUSTIN LAW OFFICE) AND P55,000.00 (PROFESSIONAL FEES CONTAINED IN THE STATEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1969) MAY BE CONSIDERED AS UNLAWFUL INCOME, FORFEITURE THEREOF OR OF RESPONDENT’S PROPERTIES EQUIVALENT TO SAID AMOUNT NOT BEING PART OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PETITION CANNOT BE GRANTED.<br><br>RESPONDENT’S OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE TO GSIS AMOUNTING TO P775,073.38 AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 1989, WHILE NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF HIS INCOME, CONSTITUTES PART OF THE AGGREGATE OF FUNDS USED BY HIM IN CAPITALIZING HIS PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS INVESTMENTS.<br><br>RESPONDENT’S TOTAL INCOME OF P1,748,640.00 FROM THE LEASE OF HIS HOUSES IN DASMARIÑAS VILLAGE, MAKATI, VALLE VERDE, PASIG, AND SAN JUAN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF HIS LAWFUL INCOME.<br><br>IT IS THE ACQUISITION COST OF THE PROPERTY OR BUSINESS INVESTMENT PURCHASED OR ACQUIRED AND NOT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THEREOF AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION WHICH SHOULD BE MADE THE BASIS IN DETERMINING THE VALUE OF RESPONDENT’S TOTAL ACQUISITION DURING THE PERIOD CONSIDERED.<br><br>RESPONDENT’S TOTAL FAMILY AND PERSONAL EXPENSES PER YEAR WOULD AMOUNT TO P15,500.00 ONLY.<br><br>RESPONDENT BUGARIN FUNDED HIS REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION AND BUSINESS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OUT OF HIS LAWFUL INCOME AS NBI DIRECTOR AND OTHER&nbsp; LEGITIMATE SOURCES OF FINANCING. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>It is well-settled that the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over decisions or final orders of the Sandiganbayan is limited only to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> A question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> A question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.

Basis for Determining the Value of Respondent’s Assets<br></div><br>In ascertaining the value of respondent’s properties and shareholdings, it is not the fair market value, as claimed by the petitioner, that should be made as basis thereof. Rather, as correctly held by the Sandiganbayan, it is the acquisition cost thereof, since it was the actual amount of money shelled out by respondent in acquiring them.&nbsp; It is the acquisition cost that must be charged against respondent’s lawful income and funds.<br><br>Neither can we sustain petitioner’s bare allegation that the cost or consideration of the subject properties stated in the contracts were understated for tax evasion purposes.&nbsp; Absent any evidence to support it, such claim deserves a short shrift for being merely speculative or conjectural.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V.&nbsp; Family and Personal Expenses<br></div><br>In coming out with the figure P310,000 representing his personal and family expenses during his tenure as NBI Director,&nbsp; respondent court adopted as basis those supplied by private respondent in his Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the period ending 31 December 1969, which were P15,000 for 1967 and P16,000 for 1968.&nbsp; It proceeded to extrapolate the total figure for the entire period material to the forfeiture proceeding by multiplying the resulting annual average of P15,500 by 20 years.<br><br>Owing to the inflation and consequent decline of the purchasing power of the Philippine peso throughout the period in question, Bugarin’s total family and personal expenses, as conceded by the Sandiganbayan, was extremely a conservative one.&nbsp; But, just like the Sandiganbayan, we can neither come up with a greater amount in the absence of any other evidence in support thereof.&nbsp; Indeed, the determination thereof cannot be left to conjecture or guesswork.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VI. Sufficiency of&nbsp; Respondent’s Explanation of His Property <br>Acquisitions<br></div><br>Section 2 of R.A. No. 1379 provides that whenever any public officer or employee has acquired during his incumbency property which is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer or employee and to his other lawful income and income from legitimately acquired property, the said property shall be presumed <i>prima facie</i> to have been unlawfully acquired.&nbsp; Section 5 thereof provides for a hearing during which the respondent is given an ample opportunity to explain, to the satisfaction of the court, how he has acquired the property in question.&nbsp; It is only when the respondent is unable to show that his asset acquisitions were lawfully made that such property shall be forfeited in favor of the State.<br><br>From the summary of Bugarin’s assets, it can readily be seen that all of his real properties were purchased or constructed, as the case may be, from 1968 to 1980.&nbsp; The total acquisition cost thereof was P1,705,583.&nbsp; With the exception of those that had been liquidated, those acquired from 1981 onward, and those whose year of acquisition could not be determined, his shareholdings in various corporations and other investments amounted to P464,580.&nbsp; Hence, for the period from 1968 to 1980, he amassed wealth in the amount of <i><b>P2,170,163.</b></i><br><br>On the other hand, his total income from 1967 to 1980 amounted only to <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">P766,548,</span> broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="2"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="53%">Professional fees reflected in his Statement<br> of Assets and Liabilities for 31 December 1969</td> <td width="15%">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom" width="19%"><div align="right">P55,000</div></td> <td width="13%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Professional fees from the Law Firm of San Juan,<br> Africa, Gonzales, and San Agustin from 1978 to<br> 1980 at the rate of P70,000 per annum</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P210,000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Proceeds from the sale of his lot in Iloilo City in 1968</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P15,000</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Salaries and Allowances from the NBI as reflected in his Income Statement (assuming that this is accurate) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">P486,548</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right"><b>_______________</b></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"><b><i>Total</i></b></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right"><b><i>P766,548</i></b></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>It bears repeating that the proceeds of the loan granted to him by the GSIS in 1983 and the rental income from 1981 to 1986, as well as the proceeds of the sale of his real property in 1984, could not have been utilized by him as his funds for the real properties and investments he acquired in 1980 and in the preceding years.&nbsp; His lawful income for the said period being only <b><i>P766,548</i></b>, the same was grossly insufficient to finance the acquisition of his assets for the said period whose aggregate cost was <b><i>P2,170,163</i></b>.&nbsp; This gross disparity would all the more be emphasized had there been evidence of his actual family and personal expenses and tax payments.<br><br>Premises considered, respondent’s properties acquired from 1968 to 1980 which were out of proportion to his lawful income for the said period should be forfeited in favor of the government for failure of the respondent to show, to the Court’s satisfaction, that the same were lawfully acquired.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of the Sandiganbayan is hereby&nbsp; <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

Outstanding balance of GSIS loan. --<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> states that the loan from the GSIS in the sum of P995,000.00 was granted only on 20 May 1983.&nbsp; And concluded that it could not be respondent’s source of funds in the construction of his house in North Greenhills which was undertaken in 1980.<br><br>It is a fact, however, that respondent Bugarin acquired the North Greenhills lot in 1973, with an area of 727 square meters for P87,288.00 from Ortigas and Co, Ltd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; He paid a downpayment of P17,448.00, in July 1973, the balance payable in monthly installments of P1,455.00 from July 1973 to September 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On July 10, 1973, respondent Bugarin obtained a loan from the GSIS in the amount of P230,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Surely, the installments could be paid with respondent’s salary and allowances. With the loan from the GSIS, it more than suffices to capitalize the acquisition of the lot at North Greenhills, San Juan, on installments.<br><br>II.&nbsp; Rental income, as disposable fund.--<br><br>I beg to disagree that respondent’s rental incomes from respondent’s realty at Dasmariñas Village (Makati) and Valle Verde 3, Pasig were not derived from lawful sources. I consider the property that produced the rental income as lawfully acquired, so the rentals were lawful incomes on which income taxes were paid. The houses at Dasmariñas Village and Valle Verde 3 Pasig were lawfully acquired, the rental incomes therefrom must be deemed lawful.<br><br>1). Lot and house at Palomaria St., Dasmarinas Village, Makati.<br><br>Respondent Bugarin acquired the Dasmariñas lot consisting of 651 square meters by purchase on October 1, 1968 from Ayala Corporation at P91,140.00 or P140.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He made a downpayment on October 1, 1968 of P27,342.00. On November 6, 1968, he paid an installment of P27,342.00. He paid the balance of P36,456.00 in October 1969.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He paid for this lot from available funds, savings, sale of assets and short term loans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As said, he had a loan of P100,000.00 from the GSIS obtained on April 23, 1969,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which could easily fund the purchase. In 1969, respondent had a residential house constructed on the above-mentioned lot at a cost of P175,900.00. The construction was financed by the loan from the GSIS in the amount of P100,000.00 and from short term loans from PCIB, PNB, and the proceeds of sale of assets. On July 10, 1973, he obtained a loan of P230,000.00 from the GSIS. He used the loan to repay the advances of the contractor and to repay the short term loans. Thereafter, the house was rented for a substantial amount, including advance rentals.<br><br>2). Lot at Ipil St., Valle Verde 3, Pasig.--<br><br>This lot with an area of 721 square meters was purchased from Ortigas &amp; Co., Ltd. on March 17, 1976,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> at P263,155.00 or P365.00 per square meter.<br><br>The downpayment was P83,000.00 paid on November 4, 1975, and the balance was paid on March 17, 1976. The fund used to acquire this lot came from savings and sale of investment. It will be noted that on July 10, 1973, respondent Bugarin obtained a loan of P230,000.00 from the GSIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On December 24, 1973, respondent Bugarin obtained a loan of P90,950.00 and on January 13, 1975, he obtained another loan of P90,000.00, both from the PCIBank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>3). Residential house at Valle Verde 3 lot.<br><br>In 1978, respondent Bugarin had a three-bedroom house with swimming pool constructed in the above lot. Construction cost was P250,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The construction was funded by a loan from the BPI on November 22, 1977 in the sum of P300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>4). Residential house at North Greenhills. --<br><br>This house was constructed in 1980 at a cost of P650,000.00 on the lot acquired in 1973 from Ortigas and Co., Ltd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The construction was financed from savings, proceeds of sale of investments and short term loans and advances. In 1983, respondent Bugarin was granted a loan of P995,000.00 by the GSIS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which he used to repay the advances of the contractor and other suppliers.<br><br>5). Residential lot at Quezon City, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 189558.--<br><br>This residential lot situated at Capitol District, Quezon City, with an area of 582 square meters, was purchased on March 20, 1973, from BF Homes, Inc. for P72,750.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This purchase was an installment sale. Respondent Bugarin paid P21,825.00 in cash and the balance amounting to P50,925.00 was paid in installments at P611.00 a month, later increased to P813.00, effective December 1, 1979.<br><br>Consequently, we take the view that respondent Bugarin was able to show by clear and convincing evidence that his acquisitions of the above realty were from lawful sources of funds—his salary and allowances, loans, sale of assets and other lawful transactions, and rentals from leased properties.<br><br>Finally, we come to the summation.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> concludes that from 1968 to <b>1980</b>, respondent Bugarin “amassed wealth in the amount of P2,170.163.00” (at p. 14, <i>ponencia</i>).
