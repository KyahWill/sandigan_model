Maricar Lilibeth P. Berco-Cabarriban, and furiously told us, ‘nakikita ninyo ba, nanginginig ako sa galit, baka atakihin ako sa puso dito.&nbsp; Inuulit ko, kapag hindi ka nag-transfer, mapipilitan akong gumawa ng paraan para mabakante ang puwesto mo at ng makakuha ako ng iba.&nbsp; Huwag ninyo akong subukan, dahil ginagawa ko ang sinasabi ko.&nbsp; Hindi ako katulad ng iba diyan.&nbsp; Hindi ko na hihintayin na ma-promote ako at kahit ma-promote ako sisiguraduhin ko na mawawala ka dito.’<br><br>“After the hearing, Judge Sayo, upon passing by my table on his way out, gave me a sarcastic look and asked me, ‘O, bakit . . .?’ I answered him, ‘nag-aayos pa ho ako ng gamit ko.’<br><br>“Since then, I have been deeply troubled by the way he treated me and the manner by which he forced me to leave Branch 45, which I have served diligently for the last 13 years.&nbsp; I have since been suffering from mental anguish and sleepless nights thinking that my reputation and good moral standing in said office has been besmirched considering that the public perception of employees being detailed to another Branch/Department poses a question on a person’s ability and competence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></div></blockquote>The second letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 23, 1999, was authored by Juanito Roxas, court legal researcher; Eufracio B.

Maricar P. Berco-Cabarriban stated that a few months after her appointment as clerk of court in respondent’s sala, she noticed that their branch would always be delayed in the submission of its monthly reports.&nbsp; She began to suspect that something irregular was going on.&nbsp; Her suspicions were later confirmed by Juanito Roxas, the court’s legal researcher, who stated in his affidavit dated January 3, 2000:<br><blockquote>“Judge Sayo also manipulates the preparation of Branch 45’s monthly reports.&nbsp; He would direct me to remove from the current month’s report the cases previously reported as submitted for decision notwithstanding the fact that these have not yet been decided despite the lapse of the reglementary period.&nbsp; This is his express order which is also known to Atty. Berco as I told her about it.&nbsp; Judge Sayo also gives me specific directions as to which cases should be included in the report and which should be excluded or removed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Atty. Berco-Cabarriban likewise revealed that, during the judicial audit, she was prevented by respondent from talking with the members of the team.&nbsp; Juanito Roxas was, instead, designated as the official spokesperson of Branch 45.&nbsp; To further ensure her silence, she was ordered to take a leave of absence during the duration of the audit.&nbsp; She added that her transfer to another court in Imus, Cavite, was brought about by the fact that she could no longer tolerate respondent’s abuses and harassment.<br><br>In his explanation dated March 31, 2000, respondent stated that draft decisions on ten (10) criminal cases and one (1) civil case listed in the OCA Report had already been prepared.&nbsp; However, he failed to finalize or sign them because of the following obstacles:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">“(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">I studied each and every case thoroughly and repeatedly especially during my first three (3) years as an RTC Judge, having assumed the position on November 18, 1996;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">I have many ailments such as hypertension, diabetes, high blood levels of cholesterol and uric acid, and I have prostate gland disease; and,</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“(c)</td> <td> <div align="justify">the repeatedly antagonistic and distracting attitude and actions of the employees in my Branch of the Court, such as Atty Maricar Berco (former Branch Clerk), Juanito R.

Berco (Cabarriban) or Mr. Roxas, I was not aware or did not realize that there were pending incidents to be decided or resolved.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>With respect to the cases with unverified status as stated in the OCA Report, respondent pointed out that there were no more undecided or unresolved pending incidents in those proceedings.&nbsp; Adding that he was not aware that the judicial audit team was looking for the records of the cases, he explained:<br><blockquote>“x x x.&nbsp; Had the Judicial Team asked or inquired from me, I would have helped find and present the said records to them.&nbsp; The Judicial Team dealt only with the employees of Branch 45, especially Atty. Berco (Cabarriban) and Mr. Roxas who was expected to know where to find the records.&nbsp; In fact, Atty. Berco (Cabarriban) and Mr. Roxas have failed to present to me for action many of the case records, just like what they did to the Honorable Supreme Court Judicial Audit Team.<br><br>“I also have the impression that some of the employees of Branch 45 are hiding some records from me.&nbsp; A few weeks after the audit of cases in Branch 45 by the Judicial Audit Team, this Court received a phone call reportedly from Atty. Cunanan of the Team and was verifying about a certain missing case record.&nbsp; When Atty. Maricar Berco, Christina Ursula Salvador, Merle&nbsp; Decena, and Norma Galicinao found out that another employee of Branch 45, Marcelina Sandoval reported to me the matter about the missing case record, they all got very angry at her and confronted her as to why she reported it to me.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Regarding Imelda Caling, respondent claimed that she had been working as his assistant and confidential secretary since 1987, during his days as Metropolitan Trial Court judge in Caloocan City.&nbsp; He said:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

She decided to resign and continued to work for me.<br><br>“Since I have trust and confidence in her, I dictate to her and have her type all my decisions and important orders in controversial cases.&nbsp; I have been doing this to safeguard the confidentiality of said decisions and orders which only c[o]me out of my chambers when they are to be mailed or promulgated.&nbsp; Being my confidential secretary, she naturally has access to the records which are under study.&nbsp; As confidential secretary, I pay her a monthly salary of P8,000.00 which I take out of my own salary.&nbsp; She knows how and often takes and monitors my blood pressure in the office as she had been a nursing student before.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Court Administrator’s Recommendation</b></u><br></div><br>Finding merit in the charges against respondent judge, the court administrator recommended the following:<br><blockquote>“(1)The Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court, Manila be directed to recall the detail of Mrs. Caling to Branch 45, RTC Manila;<br><br>(2) Judge Marcelino Sayo, Jr., be directed to observe strictly Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999;<br><br>(3) Judge Marcelino Sayo, Jr., be penalized to pay a fine of P50,000.00 for grave misconduct and oppression with a warning that repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely; and<br><br>(4) That Judge Marcelino Sayo, Jr., be detailed to another Branch of the Regional Trial Court in Manila.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>This Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>We agree with the court administrator’s recommendations, but with some modifications in the penalty, consistent with newly amended Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> requires a judge to dispose of the court’s business promptly by deciding cases and matters within the required period of ninety (90) days from the date of their submission for decision, as mandated by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>No Excuse <br>for Delay</i></b></u><br><br>Verily, it is the sworn duty of judges to administer justice without undue delay under the time-honored precept that justice delayed is justice denied.&nbsp; The present clogged dockets on all levels of our judicial system cannot be cleared, unless each and every magistrate earnestly, painstakingly and faithfully complies with the mandate of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Judges should act with dispatch in resolving pending incidents, so as not to frustrate and delay the satisfaction of a judgment.&nbsp; Their inaction or procrastination to act one way or another gives room for suspicion that they are biased.&nbsp; As dispensers of justice, they should act in such a manner as to avoid suspicion, so that faith in the administration of justice may be preserved.&nbsp; Delay in resolving motions and incidents within the reglementary period of 90 days fixed by the Constitution and the law cannot be excused or condoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In his defense, His Honor explains that he studies each and every case thoroughly and repeatedly.&nbsp; He adds that his several ailments and the antagonistic attitude of his staff contribute to the delay in deciding the cases before him.<br><br>This explanation is not acceptable.&nbsp; As a member of the judiciary, he must display diligence and competence despite illness and other adversities.&nbsp; The Code of Judicial Conduct admonishes judges to remain faithful to the law and to be professionally competent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, they should live up to their oath of office and keep up with developments in law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Respondent assumed his position in November 1996 as presiding judge of Branch 45.&nbsp; Prior to that, he had served as a metropolitan trial court judge in Caloocan City.&nbsp; Thus, he is not a neophyte in the judiciary.&nbsp; Surely, judges who have served as members of the judiciary for several years should have no trouble disposing of the court’s business and deciding cases promptly within the required period.&nbsp; If they cannot do so, they should seek extensions from this Court to avoid administrative liability.&nbsp; Any delay in the resolution of a case is ultimately a delay of justice and, thus, a denial thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the multiple ailments claimed by respondent have not been proven.&nbsp; As stated in the OCA Report, he never presented any record of his diagnosed ailments.&nbsp; If indeed these ailments were of such serious nature as would prevent him from performing his duties, he should retire from the service so as not to prejudice the litigants’ right to a speedy trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Staff’s Inefficiency<br>&nbsp;Not Acceptable</i></b></u><br><br>Likewise, respondent cannot use the alleged inefficiency and antagonistic attitude of his staff towards him as a defense.&nbsp; The Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, as well as to observe high standards of public service and fidelity at all times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The inability of respondent to control and discipline his staff demonstrates his weakness in administrative supervision, an undesirable trait frowned upon by this Court.<br><br>Judges should manage their courts with a view to a prompt and convenient disposition of their business.&nbsp; They should not tolerate abuse, indifference or neglect by clerks, sheriffs and other officers of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This is because the slightest semblance of impropriety on the part of judicial employees in the performance of their official duties stirs ripples of public suspicion and public distrust of judicial administrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In the present case, instead of just forcing members of his staff to transfer to other courts or offices without informing them of the just causes of their transfer, respondent should have used the proper venues and procedures for instilling discipline among them.<br><br>Implausible is the explanation of respondent that he was unaware of pending incidents to be decided or resolved with respect to Criminal Case Nos. 96-148413, 96-148428, 94-135745, 94-132812 and 97-159547; and Civil Case Nos. 98-89416, 97-86684, 88-45926 and 98-87200, because the records of these cases had allegedly not been presented to him by Atty. Berco-Cabarriban and the court’s legal researcher, Juanito Roxas.<br><br>Considering that they are mandated to submit certificates of service every month, judges ought to know the cases submitted to them for decision.&nbsp; Elementary court management practice requires them to keep their own records and notes of the cases before them, particularly those pending for more than ninety (90) days, so that they can act on them promptly and without delay.&nbsp; They cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency of the court personnel.&nbsp; Proper court management for the effective discharge of their official functions is their direct responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Falsification of <br>Certificates of Service</i></b></u><br><br>With respect to the falsification by respondent of his Certificates of Service and manipulation of his monthly reports, he allegedly thought the cases in question had been finished because there were already draft decisions.&nbsp; This explanation is not acceptable.<br><br>It is not enough for judges to just pen the draft of a decision.&nbsp; They can readily change, alter, revise, or modify it while under their personal control and custody.&nbsp; It is the filing of the decision with the clerk of court -- not merely its writing and signing -- that is the essential act that constitutes its rendition and gives it validity and binding effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>This Court has held in numerous cases that judges are expected to be more diligent and vigilant in attending to cases submitted for decision, as well as in preparing their monthly certificates of service, by verifying every now and then whether there are cases pending decision for more than ninety days.&nbsp; Indeed, they are accountable for any error or falsification in their certificates.&nbsp; Respondent cannot be excused by the fact that the case records were not presented to him by his clerk of court or legal researcher, since he need not have been reminded by his subordinates of his deadlines and responsibilities.&nbsp; Court employees are not the guardians of a judge’s responsibilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Moreover, his falsification of his Certificate of Service amounted to serious misconduct.&nbsp; Being a grave and willful transgression committed by an officer of the judiciary, the Court cannot treat it lightly as a trifling matter.<br><br><u><b><i>Impropriety and <br>Appearance of Impropriety</i></b></u><br><br>This Court cannot accept the explanation of respondent judge regarding the constant presence of Imelda Caling in his chambers.&nbsp; We agree with the OCA’s point that allowing any person who is not a regular court employee to type decisions and to have access to court records should not be tolerated.&nbsp; Said the court administrator:<br><blockquote>“x x x.&nbsp; Court records are public documents which must be handled only by persons who could be held accountable if anything&nbsp; happens to the records, such as loss or destruction.&nbsp; Respondent circumvented the resolution of the Third Division of the Supreme Court which directed Imelda Caling to DISCONTINUE reporting to Branch 45, RTC Manila by allowing her to be detailed in his court after she was appointed Utility Worker I in the Office of the City Sheriff.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>“Another scenario that could happen if Ms. Caling would again be allowed to handle court records and type decisions is the probability that the decisions may be sold to the highest bidders.&nbsp; Ms. Caling’s loyalty is not to the court but to respondent who appears helpless without her.&nbsp; She has no security of tenure to protect because she is not a regular employee of the court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Furthermore, Caling who was neither a relative nor a court employee was constantly present in respondent’s closed chambers, thus, inevitably inviting doubts about His Honor’s propriety and moral integrity.&nbsp; The Code of Judicial Conduct mandates judges to behave at all times in such a manner as to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They must avoid all impropriety and even the appearance of impropriety.<br><br>Being the subject of constant public scrutiny, members of the bench should freely and willingly accept behavioral restrictions that may be viewed by ordinary citizens as burdensome.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Their personal and official actuations must be above reproach and suspicion.&nbsp; The faith and confidence of the public in the administration of justice cannot be maintained if those who dispense it obtusely continue to affront public decency.&nbsp; In the judiciary, moral integrity is more than a cardinal virtue; it is a necessity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Habitual Tardiness</i></b></u><br><br>With respect to respondent judge’s habitual tardiness, this Court has held that punctuality in the holding of scheduled hearings is imperative.&nbsp; Trial judges should strictly observe the requirement of at least eight hours of service a day, six hours of which should be devoted to trial -- specifically from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. -- as required by paragraph 5 of the Interim Rules issued by the Supreme Court on January 11, 1983, pursuant to Section 13 of BP 129.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Penalty</i></b></u><br><br>As can be gleaned from the above discussion, respondent judge committed gross misconduct constituting violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, a serious charge under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; as well as inefficiency and undue delay in rendering decisions and making untruthful statements in his Certificate of Service -- all less serious charges under the said Rule.<br><br>Section 11 of Rule 140 provides the sanctions for an erring judge guilty of a serious charge or a less serious charge, as follows:<br><blockquote>“SEC. 11.&nbsp; <i>Sanctions.</i> – A.&nbsp; If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions may be imposed:<br><blockquote>‘1. Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.&nbsp; <i>Provided,</i> however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br>‘2. Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br>‘3. A fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.’</blockquote>“B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the respondent is guilty of a less serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:<br><blockquote>‘1. Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) months; or<br><br>‘2&nbsp; A fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x”</div></blockquote>WHEREFORE, Judge Marcelino L.
