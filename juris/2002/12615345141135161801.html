				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 88, Cavite City, sentencing Gerrico Vallejo y Samartino to death and ordering him to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P100,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for the rape-slaying of a 9-year old child, Daisy Diolola, in Rosario, Cavite on July 10, 1999.<br><br>The Information charging accused-appellant Gerrico Vallejo with the crime of Rape with Homicide alleged:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 10th day of July 1999, in Barangay Ligtong I, Municipality of Rosario, Province of Cavite, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Trial Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with DAISY DIOLOLA Y DITALO, a nine-year old child against the latter’s will and while raping the said victim, said accused strangled her to death.”<br><br>“CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant was arraigned on July 26, 1999 and, with the assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged, whereupon trial ensued.<br><br>Ten (10) witnesses testified for the prosecution, namely, Ma. Nida Diolola, the victim’s mother; Dr. Antonio S. Vertido, medico-legal officer of the NBI; Atty. Lupo Leyva; Mayor Renato Abutan of Rosario, Cavite; Atty. Sikat Agbunag of the Public Attorney’s Office; Pet Byron Buan, NBI Forensic Biologist; Aida Viloria-Magsipoc, NBI Forensic Chemist; SPO1 Arnel Cuevas of the Rosario, Cavite police station; and Jessiemin Mataverde and Charito Paras-Yepes, both neighbors of the victim.<br><br>The victim’s mother, Ma. Nida Diolola, testified that at around 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon of July 10, 1999, she sent her 9-year old daughter Daisy Diolola to their neighbor’s house in Pilapil, Ligtong I, Rosario, Cavite, so that Aimee Vallejo, the sister of accused-appellant, could help Daisy with her lessons.&nbsp; Aimee’s house, where accused-appellant was also staying, is about four to five meters away from Daisy’s house.&nbsp; Ma. Nida saw her daughter go to the house of her tutor.&nbsp; She was wearing pink short pants and a white sleeveless shirt.&nbsp; An hour later, Daisy came back with accused-appellant.&nbsp; They were looking for a book which accused-appellant could copy to make a drawing or a poster that Daisy would submit to her teacher.&nbsp; After finding the book, Daisy and accused-appellant went back to the latter’s house.&nbsp; When Ma. Nida woke up at about 5:30 o’clock after an afternoon nap, she noticed that Daisy was not yet home.&nbsp; She started looking for her daughter and proceeded to the house of Aimee, Daisy’s tutor.&nbsp; Aimee’s mother told Ma. Nida that Daisy was not there and that Aimee was not able to help Daisy with her lessons because Aimee was not feeling well as she had her menstrual period.&nbsp; Ma. Nida looked for Daisy in her brother’s and sister’s houses, but she was not there, either.&nbsp; At about 7:00 o’clock that evening, Ma. Nida went back to her neighbor’s house, and there saw accused-appellant, who told her that Daisy had gone to her classmate’s house to borrow a book.&nbsp; But, when Ma. Nida went there, she was told that Daisy had not been there.&nbsp; Ma. Nida went to the dike and was told that they saw Daisy playing at about 3:30 o’clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; Jessiemin Mataverde also told Ma. Nida that Daisy was playing in front of her house that afternoon and even watched television in her house, but that Daisy later left with accused-appellant.<br><br>Ma. Nida and her brother and sister searched for Daisy the whole evening of June 10, 1999, a Saturday, until the early morning of the following day, June 11, 1999, a Sunday, but their search proved fruitless.&nbsp; Then, at about 10:00 o’clock in the morning of June 11, 1999, she was informed that the dead body of her daughter was found tied to the root of an aroma tree by the river after the “compuerta” by a certain Freddie Quinto.&nbsp; The body was already in the barangay hall when Ma. Nida saw her daughter.&nbsp; Daisy was wearing her pink short pants with her sleeveless shirt tied around her neck.&nbsp; Barangay Councilmen Raul Ricasa and Calring Purihin reported the incident to the Rosario police.&nbsp; The other barangay officers fetched accused-appellant from his house and took him to the barangay hall.&nbsp; At the barangay hall, Ma. Nida pointed to accused-appellant Gerrico Vallejo as the probable suspect since he was with the victim when she was last seen alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Another witness, Jessiemin Mataverde, testified that at around 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon of that day, she saw Daisy playing with other children outside her house.&nbsp; She asked Daisy and her playmates to stop playing as their noise was keeping Jessiemin’s one-year old baby awake.&nbsp; Daisy relented and watched television instead from the door of Jessiemin’s house.&nbsp; About five minutes later, accused-appellant came to the house and told Daisy something, as a result of which she went with him and the two proceeded towards the “compuerta.”<br><br>Jessiemin testified that at around 5:00 o’clock that afternoon, while she and her daughter were in front of a store across the street from her house, accused-appellant arrived to buy a stick of Marlboro cigarette.&nbsp; Accused-appellant had only his basketball shorts on and was just holding his shirt.&nbsp; They noticed both his shorts and his shirt were wet.&nbsp; After lighting his cigarette, accused-appellant left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Charito Yepes, another neighbor of Ma. Nida, also testified.&nbsp; She said that at about 4:30 o’clock in the afternoon of July 10, 1999, while she and her husband and children were walking towards the “compuerta” near the seashore of Ligtong, Rosario, Cavite, they met a fisherman named Herminio who said that it was a good day for catching milkfish (<span style="font-style: italic;">bangus</span>).&nbsp; For this reason, according to this witness, they decided to get some fishing implements.&nbsp; She said they met accused-appellant Gerrico Vallejo near the seashore and noticed that he was uneasy and looked troubled.&nbsp; Charito said that accused-appellant did not even greet them, which was unusual.&nbsp; She also testified that accused-appellant’s shorts and shirt (<i>sando</i>) were wet, but his face and hair were not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Arnel Cuevas testified that upon receipt of the report, Rosario Police Chief Ricardo B. de la Cruz, Jr. responded to the call together with his men, PO2 Garcia, SPO1 Araracap and PO2 Lariza.&nbsp; When they arrived, Daisy’s body was already in the barangay hall.&nbsp; SPO1 Cuevas took photographs of the body.&nbsp; At that time, Daisy was wearing pink short pants and a dirty white panty with a dirty white sleeveless shirt wrapped around her neck.&nbsp; The body was afterwards taken to the Samson Funeral Parlor in Rosario, Cavite.&nbsp; The inquiries conducted by the police showed that one Freddie Quinto was fishing near the compuerta when he accidentally hit the body of Daisy, which was in the mud and tied to the root of an aroma tree.<br><br>Accused-appellant was invited by the policemen for questioning.&nbsp; Two others, a certain Raymond and Esting, were also taken into custody because they were seen with accused-appellant in front of the store in the late afternoon of July 10 1999.&nbsp; Later, however, the two were released.&nbsp; Based on the statements of Jessiemin Mataverde and Charito Paras-Yepes, the policemen went to the house of accused-appellant at about 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon of July 11, 1999 and recovered the white basketball shirt, with the name Samartino and No. 13 printed at the back, and the violet basketball shorts, with the number 9 printed on it, worn by accused-appellant the day before.&nbsp; The shirt and shorts, which were bloodstained, were turned over to the NBI for laboratory examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Dr. Antonio S. Vertido, NBI Medico-Legal Officer, testified that at about 9:00 o’clock in the evening of July 11, 1999, he conducted a physical examination of accused-appellant.&nbsp; His findings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> showed the following:<br><blockquote>“PHYSICAL FINDINGS:<br><br>“Abrasions: thigh, right, antero-lateral aspect, lower 3<sup>rd</sup> 5.0 x 0.1 cm., knee, left, 7.0 x 6.0 cm. legs, right anterior aspect, 28.0 x 8.0 cms., left anterior aspect, 24.0 x 10.0 cms., feet, plantar aspects; right, 9.0 x 3.0 cms. and left, 13.0 x 5.0 cms.<br>“Hematoma, left ring finger, posterior aspect, 1.0 x 0.5 cm.<br>“Lacerations, left ring finger, posterior aspect, 0.3 cm.<br>“(Living Case No. BMP-9902, p. 101, records)”</blockquote>At about 10:00 o’clock in the evening, Dr. Vertido went to the Samson Funeral Parlor in Rosario, Cavite for an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim Daisy Diolola.&nbsp; The autopsy revealed the following postmortem findings:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote>“Body in early stage of postmortem decomposition characterized by foul odor, eyes and tongue protruding, bloating of the face and blister formation.<br>“Washerwoman’s hands and feet.<br>“Contusion, (pinkish) face, right, 14.0 x 10.0 cms. and left, 13.0 x 6.0 cms.

Lupo Leyva, a resident of Rosario, as his lawyer.&nbsp; When accused-appellant said he did, Mayor Abutan fetched Atty. Leyva from his house and took him to the police station about 11:00 o’clock that evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Atty. Lupo Leyva corroborated Mayor Abutan’s testimony.&nbsp; He said that upon arriving at the police station, he asked accused-appellant if he wanted his services as counsel in the investigation.&nbsp; After accused-appellant assented, Atty. Leyva testified that he “sort of discouraged” the former from making statements as anything he said could be used against him.&nbsp; But, as accused-appellant was willing to be investigated, Atty. Leyva said he advised him to tell the truth.&nbsp; PO2 Garcia, the investigator, informed accused-appellant of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to be assisted by counsel and warned him that any answer he gave could and might be used against him in a court of law.&nbsp; PO2 Garcia asked questions from accused-appellant, who gave his answers in the presence of Atty. Leyva.&nbsp; After the statement was taken, Atty. Leyva and accused-appellant read it and afterwards signed it.&nbsp; Atty. Leyva testified that he did not see or notice any indication that accused-appellant had been maltreated by the police.&nbsp; In his sworn statement (Exh. M), accused-appellant confessed to killing the victim by strangling her to death, but denied having molested her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pet Byron Buan, Forensic Biologist of the NBI, testified that on July 12, 1999, he took blood samples from accused-appellant in his office for laboratory examination to determine his blood type.&nbsp; Likewise, the basketball shorts and shirt worn by accused-appellant on the day the victim was missing and the victim’s clothing were turned over to the Forensic Chemistry Division of the NBI by PO1 Amoranto of the Rosario, Cavite police for the purpose of determining the presence of human blood and its groups.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The results of the examinations conducted by Pet Byron T. Buan showed accused-appellant to belong to Group “O”.&nbsp; The following specimens: (1) one (1) white no. 13 athletic basketball shirt, with patches “Grizzlies” in front and “SAMARTINO” at the back; (2) one (1) violet no. 9 athletic basketball short pants; (3) one (1) white small “Hello Kitty” T-shirt with reddish brown stains; (4) one (1) “cut” pink short pants with reddish brown stains; (5) one (1) “cut” dirty white small panty with reddish brown stains, were all positive for the presence of human blood showing the reactions of Group “A”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Pet Byron Buan also testified that before he took the blood samples, he had a conversation with accused-appellant during which the latter admitted that he had raped and later killed the victim by strangulation and stated that he was willing to accept the punishment that would be meted out on him because of the grievous offense he had committed.&nbsp; Mr. Buan observed that accused-appellant was remorseful and was crying when he made the confession in the presence of SPO1 Amoranto at the NBI laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>When accused-appellant was brought before Inquest Prosecutor Elpidia J. Itoc at around noon of July 13, 1999 in Cavite City, accused-appellant had with him a handwritten confession which he had executed inside his cell at the Municipal Jail of Rosario.&nbsp; In his confession, accused-appellant admitted not only that he killed the victim but that he had before that raped her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said he laid down the victim on a grassy area near the dike.&nbsp; He claimed that she did not resist when he removed her undergarments but that when he tried to insert his penis into the victim’s vagina, she struggled and resisted.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said he panicked and killed the child.&nbsp; He then dumped her body in the shallow river near the “compuerta” and went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Atty. Sikat Agbunag, a lawyer from the Public Attorney’s Office, testified that at noon of July 13, 1999, while she was in their office in Cavite City, Prosecutor Itoc came together with accused-appellant and some policemen.&nbsp; Prosecutor Itoc asked Atty. Agbunag to assist accused-appellant about his confession.&nbsp; Atty. Agbunag read the document, informed accused-appellant of his constitutional rights, and warned him that the document could be used against him and that he could be convicted of the case against him, but, according to her, accused-appellant said that he had freely and voluntarily executed the document because he was bothered by his conscience.&nbsp; Accused-appellant, assisted by Atty. Agbunag, then affixed his signature to the document and swore to it before Prosecutor Itoc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At the instance of City Prosecutor Agapito S. Lu of Cavite City, NBI Forensic Biologist Pet Byron Buan took buccal swabs and hair samples from accused-appellant, as well as buccal swabs and hair samples from the parents of the victim, namely, Ma. Nida Diolola and Arnulfo Diolola.&nbsp; The samples were submitted to the DNA Laboratory of the NBI for examination.<br><br>Aida Viloria-Magsipoc, Forensic Chemist of the NBI, conducted DNA tests on the specimens collected by Dr. Vertido.&nbsp; She testified that the vaginal swabs of the victim taken by Dr. Vertido during the autopsy contained the DNA profiles of accused-appellant and the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The defense then presented as witnesses accused-appellant Gerrico Vallejo and his sister Aimee Vallejo.&nbsp; Their testimonies show that at about 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon of July 10, 1999, accused-appellant, Aimee, and their sister Abigail were in their house in Barangay Talisay, Ligtong I, Rosario, Cavite when Daisy Diolola came to ask accused-appellant to draw her school project.&nbsp; After making the request, Daisy left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accused-appellant did not immediately make the drawing because he was watching television.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said that he finished the drawing at about 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon and gave it to the victim’s aunt, Glory.&nbsp; He then returned home to watch television again.&nbsp; He claimed he did not go out of the house until 7:00 o’clock in the evening when he saw Ma. Nida, who was looking for her daughter.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said he told her that he had not seen Daisy.&nbsp; After that, accused-appellant said he went to the “pilapil” and talked with some friends, and, at about 8:00 o’clock that evening, he went home.<br><br>At 9:00 o’clock in the morning of July 11, 1999, barangay officials fetched accused-appellant from his house and took him to the barangay hall, where he was asked about the disappearance of Daisy.&nbsp; He claimed that he did not know anything about it.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was allowed to go home, but, at 11:00 o’clock that morning, policemen came and invited him to the police headquarters for questioning.&nbsp; His mother went with him to the police station.&nbsp; There, accused-appellant was asked whether he had something to do with the rape and killing of Daisy.&nbsp; He denied knowledge of the crime.<br><br>At 4:00 o’clock that afternoon, accused-appellant accompanied the police to his house to get the basketball shorts and shirt he was wearing the day before, which were placed together with other dirty clothes at the back of their house.&nbsp; According to accused-appellant, the police forced him to admit that he had raped and killed Daisy and that he admitted having committed the crime to stop them from beating him up.&nbsp; Accused-appellant claimed the police even burned his penis with a lighted cigarette and pricked it with a needle.<br><br>Accused-appellant confirmed that Mayor Renato Abutan and Atty. Lupo Leyva went to see him in the investigation room of the police station and told him that they would help him if he told the truth.&nbsp; Atty. Leyva asked him whether he wanted him to be his counsel, and accused-appellant said he answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; He said Atty. Leyva informed him of his constitutional rights.&nbsp; Accused-appellant claimed that, although he admitted to Mayor Abutan and Atty. Leyva the commission of the crime, this was because the police had maltreated him.&nbsp; Accused-appellant said he did not tell the mayor or Atty. Leyva that he had been tortured because the policemen were around and he was afraid of them.&nbsp; It appears that the family of accused-appellant transferred their residence to Laguna on July 12, 1999 because of fear of reprisal by residents of their barangay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> According to accused-appellant, Mayor Abutan and Atty. Leyva were not present when he gave his confession to the police and signed the same.&nbsp; Accused-appellant claims that although Exhibit “N” was in his own handwriting, he merely copied the contents thereof from a pattern given to him by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 2000, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant guilty of the offense charged.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its decision reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the Court finds the accused Gerrico Vallejo y Samartino GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape with Homicide, as charged in the Information, accordingly hereby sentences him to the supreme penalty of DEATH.&nbsp; The accused is directed to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P100,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Hence this appeal.&nbsp; Accused-appellant contends that:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">“I.</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF RAPE WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY AND WEAKNESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“II.</td> <td> <div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT TO THE ALLEGED ORAL CONFESSIONS OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE ITS BEING HEARSAY IN NATURE.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“III.</td> <td> <div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN GIVING PROBATIVE VALUE TO THE WRITTEN EXTRA-JUDICIAL CONFESSION OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAME WAS OBTAINED THROUGH FORCE AND INTIMIDATION AND THAT THE LAWYER WHO ASSISTED HIM DURING HIS CUSTODIAL INVESTIGATION DID NOT AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY GIVE HIM EFFECTIVE LEGAL ASSISTANCE.”</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>We find accused-appellant’s contentions to be without merit.<br><br><b>First.</b>&nbsp; An accused can be convicted even if no eyewitness is available, provided sufficient circumstantial evidence is presented by the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In rape with homicide, the evidence against an accused is more often than not circumstantial.&nbsp; This is because the nature of the crime, where only the victim and the rapist would have been present at the time of its commission, makes the prosecution of the offense particularly difficult since the victim could no longer testify against the perpetrator.&nbsp; Resort to circumstantial evidence is inevitable and to demand direct evidence proving the modality of the offense and the identity of the perpetrator is unreasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Under Rule 133, section 4 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction if:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">“(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">there is more than one circumstance;</div></td> </tr>  <tr valign="top"> <td>“(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven;

After getting the book, they proceeded to accused-appellant’s residence.<br><br></li><li>From accused-appellant’s house, Daisy then went to the house of Jessiemin Mataverde where she watched television.&nbsp; Accused-appellant thereafter arrived and whispered something to Daisy, and the latter went with him towards the “compuerta.”<br><br></li><li>At about 4:30 o’clock in the afternoon, the spouses Iluminado and Charito Yepes saw accused-appellant coming out of the “compuerta,” with his clothes, basketball shorts, and t-shirt wet, although his face and hair were not.&nbsp; According to these witnesses, he looked pale, uneasy, and troubled (<i>balisa</i>).&nbsp; He kept looking around and did not even greet them as was his custom to do so.<br><br></li><li>The fishing boat which accused-appellant used as a bomber (a boat for catching fish with dynamite) was docked by the seashore.<br><br></li><li>A little before 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon, Jessiemin Mataverde also saw accused-appellant buying a Marlboro cigarette from a store.&nbsp;

Leyva has already been discussed.&nbsp; On the other hand, the questions put by Mr. Buan to accused-appellant were asked out of mere personal curiosity and clearly not as part of his tasks.&nbsp; As Buan testified:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“PROSECUTOR LU:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">What was the subject of your conversation with him?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">It is customary when we examine the accused.&nbsp; During the examination, we talk to them for me to add knowledge on the case, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">What did you talk about during your conversation?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">I asked him if he was the one who did the killing on this victim, Daisy Diolola, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">And what was the reply of the accused?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">He said yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">What else did you ask the accused?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">I remember that while asking him, he was crying as if feeling remorse on the killing, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">. . . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">And it was you who initiated the conversation?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Do you usually do that?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, Sir.&nbsp; We usually do that.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td><div align="justify"><u>Is that part of your procedure?</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify"><u>It is not SOP.&nbsp; But for me alone, I want to know more about the case, Sir.&nbsp; And any information either on the victim or from the suspect will help me personally.&nbsp; It’s not an SOP, Sir</u>.”</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The confession, thus, can be likened to one freely and voluntarily given to an ordinary individual and is, therefore, admissible as evidence.<br><br><b>Third.</b>&nbsp; The admissibility of the extrajudicial confessions of accused-appellant is also attacked on the ground that these were extracted from him by means of torture, beatings, and threats to his life.&nbsp; The bare assertions of maltreatment by the police authorities in extracting confessions from the accused are not sufficient.&nbsp; The standing rule is that “where the defendants did not present evidence of compulsion, or duress nor violence on their person; where they failed to complain to the officer who administered their oaths; where they did not institute any criminal or administrative action against their alleged intimidators for maltreatment; where there appeared to be no marks of violence on their bodies; and where they did not have themselves examined by a reputable physician to buttress their claim,” all these will be considered as indicating voluntariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Indeed, extrajudicial confessions are presumed to be voluntary, and, in the absence of conclusive evidence showing that the declarant’s consent in executing the same has been vitiated, the confession will be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant’s claim that he was tortured and subjected to beatings by policemen in order to extract the said confession from him is unsupported by any proof:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><em>“ATTY.
