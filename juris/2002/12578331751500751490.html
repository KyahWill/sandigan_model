Emeterio Barcelon has spoken that it is their family that bought the shares as restitutions from the old regime. This share purchase was approved by the highly respected former PCGG Chairman Jovito Salonga. Why not ask the former OPMC Director and EVP, Oscar Manuel? He has a very telling role on what really happened about the 999 Million shares.<br><br>and through the aforequoted defamatory imputations, had thus imputed against ALFONSO YUCHENGCO, the commission of a vice, defects and/or acts, condition, status or circumstances which have undermined his integrity and caused his dishonor and discredit, to the damage and prejudice of said Alfonso Yuchengco.<br><br>Contrary to law.</blockquote>Upon being arraigned on March 23, 1995, the accused, assisted by counsel, separately entered the plea of “Not guilty” to the charge in the Information.<br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 145, rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> on July 10, 1997 in Criminal Case No. 93-10985 finding both accused, herein private respondents Robert Coyiuto, Jr. and Jaime Ledesma, guilty of the crime of libel, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ROBERTO COYIUTO, JR., and JAIME LEDESMA to be GUILTY as charged with (sic) the offense of LIBEL.<br><br>Accordingly, accused Roberto Coyuito, Jr., is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a term not less than TWO (2) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <u>arresto mayor</u> nor more than ONE (1) YEAR, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and TWENTY-ONE (21) DAYS of <u>prision correccional</u>, as well as the penalties accessory thereto.<br><br>Accused Jaime L. Ledesma is in turn sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a term of not less than FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <u>arresto mayor</u> and not more than TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and TEN (10) DAYS of <u>prision correccional</u> and the penalties accessory thereto.<br><br>Further, the accused are hereby ordered to pay the complainant, Alfonso Yuchengco, jointly and severally:<br><ol><li>The sum of ONE (1) PESO as nominal damages;</li><li>The sum of ONE MILLION (1,000,000.00) PESOS as exemplary damages; and</li><li>The sum of ONE MILLION (1,000,000.00) PESOS as reasonable attorney’s fees.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals reversed the said decision of the trial court, upon its finding that the questioned publications are not libelous <i>per se</i>, the same being neither malicious nor defamatory. The dispositive portion of the assailed judgment acquitting both accused, reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision, dated July 10, 1997, of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 145) in Makati City in Criminal Case No. 93-10985 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, this Court finding accused-appellants Robert Coyuito, Jr. and Jaime Ledesma NOT GUILTY of the offense charged- hence,&nbsp; acquitted. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>The subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner, Alfonso Yuchengco, was merely noted by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution of July 26, 1999 and thus, it is deemed denied even by the petitioner in the instant petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which is anchored on the following grounds, to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT THE PUBLICATIONS WERE NOT LIBELOUS PER SE AND THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PROVE MALICE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THAT THE PETITIONER WAS NOT A CANDIDATE TO THE OPMC BOARD AND THAT THEREFORE THERE WAS NO REASON TO MALIGN PETITIONER.</blockquote>Petitioner Alfonso Yuchengco alleges in essence that the contents of the two (2) published articles, subject of the Information, which branded and portrayed him as a “gadfly,” a “corporate raider” and a “crony” of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos were derogatory and libelous per se, hence, malice need not be proved since the same is presumed pursuant to Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code. Likewise, the derogatory publications cannot be considered as privileged communications as no public interest could be served by maligning him since he was neither a candidate nor did he campaign for any of the candidates in the June 29, 1993 elections for OPMC Board of Directors. In addition, the appellate court’s adoption of the opinion of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 139, in its decision in Criminal Case Nos. 93-10988 and 93-10989 is highly irregular for the reason that the latter is an inferior court and that the complainant in said criminal cases was Atty. Leonardo Siguion-Reyna, who was a candidate in the then forthcoming elections of the board of directors of the OPMC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents contend, in substance, that the instant petition merely raised possible errors of law and misappreciation of evidence committed by the respondent appellate court in acquitting them, which are outside the province of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court. Besides, the questioned decision of the Court of Appeals is in accordance with the evidence adduced by the parties to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated June 29, 1998, in lieu of Appellee’s Brief, recommending that the assailed decision of respondent appellate court be upheld principally on the ground that the alleged guilt of the respondents was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>We stress that a judgment of acquittal in criminal proceedings is final and unappealable whether it happens at the trial court level or before the Court of Appeals. This means that a review of alleged errors in the said judgment arising from misappreciation of facts and the evidence adduced cannot be made without trampling upon the right of the accused against double jeopardy which is firmly established in this jurisdiction.<br><br>The rule on double jeopardy, which basically means that no person shall be put on trial twice for the same offense, was introduced by the United States into the country through the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the Jones Law of 1916. It was later embodied in the 1935 and 1973 Philippine constitutions and the same was reproduced <i>verbatim</i> under Section 21, Article III of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense. If an act is punished by a law and an ordinance, conviction or acquittal under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the same act.</blockquote>The Rules of Court on Criminal Procedure relative to double jeopardy strictly adheres to the above constitutional provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Rule 117, Section 7 thereof, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7. <i>Former conviction or acquittal; double jeopardy.</i>- When an accused has been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction and after the accused had pleaded to the charge, the conviction or acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></blockquote>Thus, since the landmark case of <i><b>U.S. v. Kepner</b></i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court, in a string of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> consistently thwarted persistent attempts at reviewing judgments of acquittal in criminal cases in view of the rule on double jeopardy.<br><br>By way of exception, a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case may be assailed in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court but only upon a clear showing by the petitioner that the lower court, in acquitting the accused, committed not merely reversible errors of judgment but also grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction or a denial of due process, thus rendering the assailed judgment void. In which event, the accused cannot be considered at risk of double jeopardy which has the following essential elements: 1) the accused is charged under a complaint or an information sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction; 2) the court has jurisdiction; 3) the accused has been arraigned and he has pleaded; and 4) he is convicted or acquitted, or the case is dismissed without his express consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It is not disputed that herein private respondents were charged with the crime of libel upon a valid Information in Criminal Case No. 93-10985 before a competent court. After having been duly arraigned, trial on the merits ensued that led to their conviction by the trial court. On appeal, the judgment rendered by the trial court was reversed by the Court of Appeals. The petitioner in this petition now questions the jurisdiction of respondent appellate court for having allegedly committed grave abuse of discretion when it acquitted the private respondents.<br><br>We note, however, that the allegations of the petitioner in his petition for certiorari merely raised possible errors in the appreciation of evidence purportedly committed by the respondent appellate court. The issues on whether or not the published articles, subject of the Information in Criminal Case No. 93-10985, are libelous per se or privileged communication involve questions of fact which require evaluation of the evidence adduced by the parties.<br><br>Factual matters cannot be inquired into by this Court in a certiorari proceeding. We can no longer be tasked to go over the proofs presented by the parties and analyze, assess and weigh them again to ascertain if the trial court and the appellate court were correct in according superior credit to this or that piece of evidence of one party or the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The sole office of a writ of certiorari is the correction of errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, and does not include the review of public respondent’s evaluation of the evidence and the factual findings based thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> We reiterated the said principle in the case of <b><i>People v. Court of Appeals and Maquiling</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>It is quite obvious from the foregoing allegations that petitioner imputed grave abuse of discretion to Respondent Court because of the latter’s supposed misappreciation and wrongful assessment of <i>factual evidence</i>. However, as earlier stressed, the present recourse is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65. It is a fundamental aphorism in law that a review of facts and evidence is not the province of the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>, which is <i>extra ordinem</i> beyond the ambit of appeal. Stated elsewise, factual matters cannot normally be inquired into by the Supreme Court in a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding. This Court cannot be tasked to go over the proofs presented by the parties and analyze, assess and weigh them again, in order to ascertain if the trial and the appellate courts were correct in according superior credit to this or that piece of evidence of one party or the other.</blockquote>Besides, a mistake in the judgment acquitting the accused of the crime charged occasioned by misappreciation of evidence or errors of law does not necessarily nullify the decision. What may vitiate a decision are jurisdictional errors arising from the court’s commission of grave abuse of discretion or denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In which event, the factual circumstances constituting grave abuse of discretion or denial of due process must be shown as patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>However, the petitioner failed to cite any circumstance clearly indicative of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent appellate court such as, for instance, the assailed judgment’s alleged lack of basis in law or supporting evidence. Petitioner also failed to show that the state was deprived of a fair opportunity to prosecute and prove its case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or the occurrence of mistrial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> resulting in a denial of due process, thus rendering the assailed judgment void.<br><br>Aside from the aforecited factual issues, the petition alleged that respondent Court of Appeals adopted in its assailed decision the opinion of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 139, in Criminal Case Nos. 93-10988 and 93-10989, which is not quite correct. The Court of Appeals merely adverted to the decision of the trial court in the said cases initiated by Atty. Leonardo Siguion-Reyna against herein private respondents involving the article published in the Inquirer on June 23, 1993, subject of the Information, insofar as the term “gadfly” was pronounced therein as not libelous per se.<br><br>Parenthetically, the challenged decision of respondent Court of Appeals in this case is based on its own independent appreciation of the evidence and the pertinent laws including the recommendation of the Office of the Solicitor General for the acquittal of herein private respondents of the crime of libel on the ground of reasonable doubt, to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>Under Article 354(1) of the Revised Penal Code, malice is not presumed and must therefore be proved where the alleged libelous communication is qualifiedly privileged. In such instance, the burden of proof to establish malice on the part of the accused is on the plaintiff or the prosecution xxx. The prosecution failed to discharge such <i>onus probandi</i>. To be more specific, no culpability could be imputed to the accused-appellants for the alleged offending publication without doing violence to the precept of privileged communication implicit in the freedom of the press.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>The alleged libelous articles were published as an offshoot of the corporate struggle for control of the management of Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corporation (OPMC).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>The existence of actual government investment in OPMC imbued the aforementioned corporate struggle with significant public interest that can be best protected if such controversy is made transparent for public opinion. It need not be gainsaid that a desire to generate public opinion against a particular transaction on a matter of public interest is not only a social duty but a right protected by the Constitution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>[T]he appellants were not harbingers of doom who opened Pandora’s box in order to promote their selfish ends. Rather, the <i>raison d'tre</i> which propelled them to sound the clarion call for vigilance was succinctly stated as follows:<br><blockquote><b>“The overriding intent of the publications was to criticize the highly irregular sale of government assets, which was performed by and between public officials, supposedly in the exercise of their public duties, and a large, nationwide bank, and to remind the OPMC stockholders of these very important facts.”</b></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>We hasten to add that We were also persuaded by the posture adopted by the Solicitor General who “after a conscientious study of the instant case,” recommended “the acquittal of appellants on the ground that their alleged crime was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.”<br><br>To be sure, the Solicitor General represents the People of the Philippines on appeal. Nevertheless, it is not unusual for the Solicitor General to take a position adverse to the People or the prosecution. The reason, as explained by the Supreme Court xxx, is that as the lawyer of the government, its agencies and instrumentalities, the Solicitor General has the duty to “see to it that the best interest of the government is upheld within the limits set by law xxx. It is incumbent upon him to present to the court what he considers would legally uphold the best interest of the government although it may run counter to a client’s position.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> xxx<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx </div></blockquote> In any event, we find that the appellate court committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in rendering its assailed decision in the case at bar. All the evidence adduced and the issues and arguments raised by the parties in their respective pleadings were exhaustively and correctly addressed by the appellate court in its 54-page assailed decision. Consequently, the said judgment of the Court of Appeals acquitting herein private respondents of the crime of libel in Criminal Case No. 93-10985 may not be reviewed, much less reversed, without violating their constitutional right against double jeopardy as enshrined in Section 21, Article III of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In view of all the foregoing, it is our considered opinion and we hold that the instant petition is not meritorious, and that the same should be dismissed.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the instant petition for certiorari is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
