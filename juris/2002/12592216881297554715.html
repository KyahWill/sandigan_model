				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Appellants Roger Segun and Josephine Clam were charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iligan City with violating Article 38 of the Labor Code, as amended, in an information reading:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of March, 1993 and for sometime thereafter, at Linamon, Lanao del Norte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously canvass, enlist, contract, transport and recruit for employment the following persons, namely:<br><ol><li>Mario Tambacan;</li><li>Mary Jane Cantil;</li><li>Richard Arañas;</li><li>Victoria Collantes;</li><li>Christine Collantes;</li><li>Rogelio Collantes;</li><li>Luther Caban;</li><li>Loreta Caban;</li><li>Jonard Genemelo;</li><li>Jhonely Genemelo;</li><li>Pedro Ozarraga;</li><li>Pablo Ozarraga; and</li><li>Pacifico Villaver,</li></ol>Without any license and/or authority to engage in recruitment and placement of workers from the Department of Labor and Employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Upon arraignment, appellants pleaded not guilty to the above charges.<br><br>The prosecution presented eight (8) witnesses, namely, Francita L. Manequis, Conchita Tambacan, Josephine Aba, Melecio Ababa, Rogelio Collantes, Loreta Caban, Christine Collantes and Elena Arañas.<br><br>Manequis, Employment Officer III and Administrative Officer of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), identified two certifications issued by Allan Macaraya, then DOLE Director for Region XII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The first Certification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 7, 1993, stated that “per records available in this Office” appellants were “neither licensed nor authorized by this Department to recruit workers for overseas employment.”&nbsp; The second,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated May 17, 1993, was “issued upon the request of [the] Honorable Mayor of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, Mayor Alejandro C. Alfeche.” It stated that appellants, “per records of this Office,” were “not authorized to conduct recruitment for local and overseas employment.”<br><br>Conchita Tambacan, 50, married, a tobacco vendor and a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte testified that her son Mario, then 17, was “recruited” by appellants on March 6, 1993 and brought to Manila.&nbsp; She knew that he was recruited only because “many told [her].” Her son did not consult her regarding the recruitment.&nbsp; At the time of her testimony, her son had sent her only two letters from Cabanatuan City but had not returned home to Linamon, Lanao del Norte.<br><br>After learning of her son’s recruitment, Mrs. Tambacan went to the Mayor of Linamon who, in turn, verified from DOLE whether appellants had any authority to undertake recruitment.&nbsp; Subsequently, the mayor handed Mrs. Tambacan the certification dated May 17, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Josephine Ozarraga Aba, 28, married, a housekeeper, and a resident of Linamon, is the aunt of twins Pedro and Pablo Ozarraga.&nbsp; Pedro and Pablo, then 18, are the sons of her deceased sister.&nbsp; Mrs. Aba testified that sometime in March or April 1993 her nephews told her that they wanted to go to Manila and that they were “recruited.” Her nephews were then jobless and were looking for work.&nbsp; Mrs. Aba went to appellants’ house to inquire from appellants, who were her neighbors, if what her nephews told her was true.&nbsp; In appellants’ house, she saw appellants, her nephews, among others.&nbsp; Appellants told her that her nephews would be given free fare to Manila, free meals and good wages.&nbsp; These they also promised her nephews.&nbsp; Mrs. Aba claimed that appellants brought one of the twins to Cabanatuan and the other to Bulacan.&nbsp; When she testified, her nephews had not yet returned to Linamon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Melecio Ababa, 64, married, a fish vendor, and a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, is the grandfather of Jhonely and Jonard Genemelo.&nbsp; Sometime in April 1992, Ababa learned that appellants had “recruited” his grandsons.&nbsp; Ababa asked his grandsons, “Why will you work there [in Cabanatuan City] [when] in fact you can find jobs here?”&nbsp; Ababa went to the house of appellants who assured him that the transportation to Manila was free, and that his grandsons were to be provided free meals and paid good wages.&nbsp; Because of these promises, he acquiesced to the recruitment.&nbsp; At the time of his testimony, Ababa’s grandsons had not returned to Linamon.&nbsp; All he received from them were two letters but no money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Another complainant, Rogelio Collantes, 44, jobless and a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, is the husband of Victoria Collantes and the father of Christine, then 13, and Rogelio, Jr., then 6.&nbsp; Sometime in April 1993, Rogelio learned that appellants had “recruited” Victoria, Christine and Roger.&nbsp; Rogelio talked to appellants who promised that his wife and children’s transportation to Manila and meals will be free and that they will receive good wages.&nbsp; Victoria, Christine and Rogelio, Jr., who were then looking for jobs, were then brought to Cabanatuan City.<br><br>At the time of his testimony, Rogelio’s children had already returned to Linamon, traveling home with appellant Josephine Clam.&nbsp; Collantes’ wife, though, was still in Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; She had sent letters to Rogelio thrice, and money twice, once in the amount of P1,000.00 and the other time P800.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also presented Rogelio’s daughter Christine, who was among those allegedly recruited by appellants.&nbsp; Christine said her parents were jobless during the months of March and April 1993 and were looking for work.&nbsp; Upon the invitation of appellants, she and her mother went to the house of appellants on March 26, 1993.&nbsp; Appellants offered her mother a job.&nbsp; Christine went with her mother to Cabanatuan City where her mother forced her to work.&nbsp; According to Christine, those “recruited” totaled thirteen, including her mother and her brother.&nbsp; She and the others took a boat to Manila and Cabanatuan City.&nbsp; Appellants shouldered the transportation expenses.<br><br>In Cabanatuan, Christine did housework for a certain Engr. Sy for seven (7) months.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was paid P500.00 a month.&nbsp; She returned home in Linamon on December 4, 1993.&nbsp; Neri Clam, Josephine’s sister, paid for her fare to Manila.<br><br>Like Christine, her mother Victoria also performed housework in Cabanatuan City for a certain Mabini Llanera.&nbsp; Her brother, Rogelio, Jr., was not able to find work because he was still a child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Loreta Cavan,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</span></sup> 14, and also a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, testified that sometime in March 1993, she was “recruited” by appellants and brought to Manila then to Cabanatuan City.&nbsp; She related that she met appellants in the house of Josephine Clam, where she was recruited.&nbsp; Appellants told her that Cabanatuan City was a “good place” “because the salary [was] big.” Loreta agreed to go.&nbsp; Loreta further stated that those “recruited” by the couple totaled thirteen, including the twin brothers Pedro and Pablo, a certain woman named Pasbel, a certain Johnny, and Loreta’s sister Luther.<br><br>At Cabanatuan City, Loreta was able to work for a certain Barangay Captain Centioco for three (3) months for P600.00 a month.&nbsp; Loreta purportedly was not paid for her services since her two months’ salary was supposed to pay for her fare to Manila.<br><br>Loreta denied that she went to the house of appellants to seek their help.&nbsp; Rather, appellants allegedly offered her a job.&nbsp; Appellants invited her to go to their house on March 27, 1993.&nbsp; Loreta learned from her sister Luther that appellants were recruiting.<br><br>Loreta’s sister Luther, who was among those listed in the information as having been recruited by appellants, went to Manila to work but her job was not provided by appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also offered the testimony of Ester Cavan, the mother of Loreta Cavan, to corroborate the latter’s testimony.&nbsp; The same was dispensed with, however, the corroborative nature thereof having been admitted by counsel for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finally, Elena Arañas, mother of Richard Arañas, related that on March 6, 1993 appellants brought her son, then 19, to Cabanatuan City.&nbsp; Her son, who was then looking for work, was promised that he would be given a good salary.&nbsp; She learned of the promise when she went to appellants’ house where she saw appellants, her son, among others.&nbsp; Elena claimed that she was present when appellants approached her son and offered him work in Cabanatuan City.&nbsp; Elena agreed to the recruitment of her son because of the promise of a good salary.&nbsp; However, she has not heard from her son since he left nor had she received any money from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellants’ defense was predicated on denial.&nbsp; They presented five witnesses to support their case.<br><br>Myrna Sasil, 35, married, a housekeeper and a resident of Iligan City, testified that in March 1993 she went to the appellants’ residence to ask them to find a job in Manila for her daughter Margie.&nbsp; Prior to that, Myrna had known appellants for almost a year.&nbsp; She knew that appellants could help their daughter find work in Manila because they just came from Manila themselves.&nbsp; She said that before she went to appellants’ house, she did not know that appellants were sending people to Manila for work.&nbsp; As Myrna’s family was then suffering from financial difficulties, Josephine agreed to find work for Myrna’s daughter.<br><br>According to Myrna, Margie left with the thirteen persons listed in the information as having been recruited by appellants.&nbsp; Appellants paid for Margie’s fare to Manila, which she reimbursed from her salary.&nbsp; At the time of Myrna’s testimony, Margie was still working in Cabanatuan City and was sending Myrna money from her salary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Losendo Servano, 50, married, a farmer and a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, is a neighbor of appellants as well as those of the thirteen persons they allegedly recruited.&nbsp; Losendo had known Josephine Clam since she was born, and Roger Segun when the latter and Josephine got married.<br><br>Losendo testified that his son Ruel did not have work in Linamon.&nbsp; If Ruel stayed in Linamon, Losendo said he would become a hoodlum or a delinquent.&nbsp; His son thus requested appellants to take him with them to Manila and find work for him, saying “Manang, Manong, I just go with you to Manila.”<br><br>In April 1993, Ruel, appellants and thirteen others left for Manila by boat.&nbsp; Appellants shouldered Ruel’s expenses in going to Manila.&nbsp; When Ruel was able to find work, he paid appellants by installment.&nbsp; Losendo claims that his son found work through the help of appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Virgincita Ozarraga, 30, a housekeeper and a resident of Linamon, Lanao del Norte, is the sister of appellant Josephine Clam.&nbsp; She is also the aunt of the twins Pedro and Pablo Ozarraga and a neighbor of the thirteen persons allegedly recruited by appellants.<br><br>According to Virgincita, Josephine Clam went to Nueva Ecija in 1991 but transferred in 1992 to Dagupan City.&nbsp; In both places, Josephine worked as a house helper.&nbsp; Roger Segun, on the other hand, worked as liaison officer for Rolmar Employment Services.<br><br>Virgincita disputed Conchita Tambacan’s testimony that appellants recruited the latter’s son Mario.&nbsp; She said that Mario went to appellants’ house.&nbsp; Josephine did not promise him a job because they were not recruiters although appellants assured him they would help him find a job.<br><br>Virgincita further testified that in March 1993 Pedro and Pablo Ozarraga also went to the house of Virgincita’s mother to ask appellants to help them find work because there were times they could not eat.&nbsp; Josephine allegedly told the twins that she was not a recruiter but she would help them find work.&nbsp; She purportedly said the same thing to Jhonely and Jonard Genemelo, Victoria and Christine Collantes, and Loreta and Luther Cavan.&nbsp; Josephine also told them that she was not promising them anything.<br><br>Appellants and the thirteen persons they purportedly recruited left for Manila by boat.&nbsp; Appellants paid for their fare and were able to find work for them in Manila, Cabanatuan and other places in Luzon.&nbsp; Thereafter, appellants returned to Linamon.&nbsp; To Virgincita’s knowledge, no people sought their help to find them jobs after the couple returned from Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Appellant Roger Segun, 34, single, is an employee of the Rolmar Employment Services.&nbsp; As the liaison officer of the agency, appellant undertakes the processing of the papers for the agency’s license.<br><br>According to appellant, around April and May of 1993, the thirteen persons listed in the information went to the house of Josephine Clam to ask her to help them find jobs in Cabanatuan City.&nbsp; Their neighbors knew that Josephine used to work in Cabanatuan City, Pangasinan and Dagupan City.&nbsp; Josephine told them that she was not a recruiter although she would help them find work.<br><br>Appellants accompanied the thirteen to Manila as they (appellants) were going there anyway.&nbsp; Appellants shouldered their neighbors’ transportation and other expenses from Linamon to Cabanatuan City upon the promise that they (appellants) would be paid back.&nbsp; Eventually, some paid while others did not.&nbsp; Roger did not bother to ask for payment from those who did not pay.&nbsp; He claimed he was able to help find jobs for their neighbors by recommending them to friends who needed helpers and workers.&nbsp; Until they were able to find jobs, the thirteen stayed in Roger’s house in Cabanatuan City.<br><br>Roger admitted that neither he nor Josephine Clam had a license to recruit.&nbsp; He said he was not a recruiter.&nbsp; He also revealed that after he brought the thirteen to Manila, he tried to secure a license to recruit but his application was disapproved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Appellant Josephine Clam, 28, single, and residing at Linamon, Lanao del Norte, used to work as a house helper in Pangasinan and Bulacan for a year after which she returned to Linamon.<br><br>Around March and April 1993, the thirteen persons listed in the information went to her house to ask her help to find them work.&nbsp; They knew that Josephine used to work in Pangasinan and Dagupan.&nbsp; She told them she would try her best to help them but informed them that she was not a recruiter.<br><br>Roger and Josephine shouldered their neighbors’ transportation and food expenses on the condition that their neighbors reimburse appellants once they found jobs.&nbsp; Some of them eventually paid them back although others did not.&nbsp; Appellants were able to find jobs for the thirteen since Roger had many friends.<br><br>Josephine admitted that she did not have any license to recruit since she was not a recruiter.&nbsp; She and Roger helped their neighbors find jobs because she took pity on them when they begged her to help them find jobs.&nbsp; She even spent her and Roger’s joint savings to answer for her neighbors’ expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing evidence, the Iligan City RTC convicted appellants for violating Article 38 of the Labor Code, as amended:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment of the 13 persons mentioned in the information, namely: Mario Tambacan, Mary Jane Cantil, Richard Aranas, Victoria Collantes, Christine Collantes, Rogelio Collantes, Luther Caban, Loreta Caban, Jonard Genemilo, Jhonely Genemilo, Pedro Ozarraga, Pablo Ozarraga and Pacifico Villaver in a large scale, the accused are hereby sentenced to suffer a penalty of life imprisonment for each of them and to pay a fine of P100,000.00 each.&nbsp; The bail bond put up by the accused is hereby ordered cancelled, in view of the penalty imposed by this Court of life imprisonment, which is a nonbailable offense.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Appellants contend that their guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; They maintain that it was their neighbors who approached them in the house of Josephine Clam’s mother and solicited their assistance in their (the neighbors’) desire to go to Manila.&nbsp; Josephine Clam had a history of employment in Luzon and had just returned to Linamon.&nbsp; In Josephine, the neighbors saw an opportunity to taste economic progress and escape poverty and stagnation.&nbsp; Appellants took pity on them and helped them find jobs, even defraying their neighbors’ travel expenses.&nbsp; They submit, therefore, that they were not engaged in the recruitment of persons for employment but in pursuit of a lawful and noble endeavor for the benefit of the less fortunate.&nbsp; They neither collected nor received any consideration for their efforts.&nbsp; Appellants point out that of the 13 allegedly recruited only Christine Collantes and Loreta Cavan testified against them.&nbsp; Considering these circumstances, appellants submit that the evidence against them is at most ambiguous and inconclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The crime of illegal recruitment in large scale is committed when three elements concur.&nbsp; First, the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable one to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers.&nbsp; Second, he or she undertakes either any activity within the meaning of “recruitment and placement” defined under Article 13 (b), or any prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; Third, the offender commits said acts against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>There is no dispute that the first element is present in this case.&nbsp; The certification dated May 17, 1993 and issued by DOLE Region XII Director Allen Macaraya, states that appellants “were not authorized to conduct recruitment for local and overseas employment.” Both appellants conceded they have no license to recruit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The next question is whether appellants undertook any activity constituting recruitment and placement as defined by Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code, which states:<br><blockquote>“Recruitment and Placement” refers to any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, That any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.</blockquote>Did the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants canvassed, enlisted, contracted and transported the thirteen persons listed in the information?&nbsp; In examining the prosecution’s evidence, we bear in mind that a conviction for large scale illegal recruitment must be based on a finding <b>in each case</b> of illegal recruitment of three (3) or more persons whether individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> While the law does not require that at least three (3) victims testify at the trial, it is necessary that there is sufficient evidence proving that the offense was committed against three (3) or more persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>There is no evidence that appellant undertook the recruitment of Mary Jane Cantil and Pacifico Villaver.&nbsp; Neither Cantil nor Villaver testified in court.&nbsp; No witness testified as to the fact of their recruitment.<br><br>As regards Mario Tambacan, his mother Conchita testified that she learned of his recruitment only from other persons.&nbsp; On direct examination she said:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"><u>How did you know that he was recruited?</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify"><u>Many told me.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On cross-examination, she further revealed:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You claimed that he was recruited but you did not see the recruitment?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">This Josephine Clam and a companion recruited my son because <u>many saw them</u>.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

Tambacan’s recruitment beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>We now examine the evidence offered to prove the recruitment of the Collanteses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prosecution’s evidence consists of the testimonies of Rogelio Collantes and his daughter Christine.&nbsp; Rogelio testified that his wife and children were “recruited” by appellants, that appellants promised that his wife and children were to be provided free meals and transportation to Manila and good wages, and that appellants brought his wife and children to Manila.<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr

term “recruit” which is a conclusion of law; the prosecution did not elicit from him the specific act constituting the recruitment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 36, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states that a witness can testify only to those <b>facts</b> which he knows of his personal knowledge.&nbsp; He is not permitted to testify as to a conclusion of law.&nbsp; Law in the sense here used embraces whatever conclusions belong properly to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, it has been held that the bare statements of a rape victim that she was “sexually assaulted” or “raped” by the accused are not sufficient to establish the accused’s guilt for the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Testimony constituting conclusions of law has no probative value and is not binding upon the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Rogelio also said that appellants made certain promises but it is not clear if these were made to Rogelio or to his wife and children.&nbsp; That appellants “brought” them to Manila does not necessarily mean that they were “transported” in the context of Article 13 (b) for if we subscribe to the defense’s account, appellants merely accompanied Rogelio’s family to Manila.&nbsp; If two inculpatory facts are capable of two different interpretations, that which would favor the accused should be adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Christine Collantes testified on direct examination:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr

Christine explicitly stated that appellants offered her mother a job and told them that they “would be given work.” Victoria thus agreed to appellants’ “proposal” that she would be given a job in Cabanatuan City.<br><br>However, there is reasonable doubt whether appellants actually recruited Christine herself since Christine said that she “was forced by [her] mother to work in Cabanatuan City.”<br><br>The Court also entertains grave doubts regarding the alleged recruitment of Christine’s brother Rogelio, Jr., who, according to Christine, went with their mother and was not able to work because, at 6, he was “still a child.” Did Rogelio, Jr. go to Cabanatuan City to work or did he just go together with his mother so she could look after him?&nbsp; The former is unlikely while the latter is not farfetched since the child was too young to work and still needed looking after.<br><br>The prosecution, however, succeeded in proving that appellants recruited Loreta Cavan.&nbsp;

held earlier, “recruit” is a legal conclusion.&nbsp; The witness must testify as to the <i>facts</i> that would prove recruitment.&nbsp; It does not suffice that the witness simply state that the accused “recruited” the “victim.” Hence, the testimony of Josephine Aba that appellants “recruited” her nephews is, by itself, insufficient to convict appellants for the recruitment of Pedro and Pablo Ozarraga.<br><br>That appellants allegedly told <b>Josephine Aba</b> that her nephews would be given free fare and meals is not inconsistent with appellants’ account that they paid for their neighbors’ expenses.&nbsp; The same holds true for the claim that appellants brought the twins to Cabanatuan and Bulacan.&nbsp; According to appellants, they accompanied the thirteen persons to help them find work.&nbsp; The reference to good wages could mean that the rates of compensation in Cabanatuan or Bulacan are relatively high compared to those in Lanao del Norte.&nbsp; These circumstances do not necessarily mean that appellants recruited Pedro and Pablo Ozarraga.<br><br>We cannot give much credence to Josephine’s statement that appellants also promised free fare and meals, and good wages to her <b>nephews</b> since the prosecution did not show that Josephine was present when appellants made this supposed promise to her nephews.<br><br>Neither did the prosecution prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellants recruited Jhonely and Jonard Genemelo.&nbsp; Melecio Ababa, grandfather of Jhonely and Jonard testified on direct examination:<br><blockquote><table border="0"
