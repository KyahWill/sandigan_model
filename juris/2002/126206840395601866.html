(DARBCI for brevity), an agrarian reform cooperative that owns 8,860 hectares of land in Polomolok, South Cotabato, several complaints alleging mismanagement and/or misappropriation of funds of DARBCI by the then incumbent officers and members of the board of directors of the cooperative, some of whom are herein private respondents.<br><br>Acting on the complaints docketed as CDA-CO Case No. 97-011, CDA Executive Director Candelario L. Verzosa, Jr. issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated December 8, 1997 directing the private respondents to file their answer within ten (10) days from receipt thereof.<br><br>Before the private respondents could file their answer, however, CDA Administrator Alberto P.

Verzosa, Jr. and Alberto P. Zingapan, including the DOLE Philippines Inc. before the Regional Trial Court (RTC for brevity) of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39.&nbsp; The petition which was docketed as SP Civil Case No. 25, primarily questioned the jurisdiction of the CDA to resolve the complaints against the private respondents, specifically with respect to the authority of the CDA to issue the “freeze order” and to create a management committee that would run the affairs of DARBCI.<br><br>On February 24, 1998, CDA Chairman Jose C. Medina, Jr. issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> in CDA-CO Case No. 97-011 placing the private respondents under preventive suspension, hence, paving the way for the newly-created management committee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to assume office on March 10, 1998.<br><br>On March 27, 1998, the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39, issued a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (TRO), initially for seventy-two (72) hours and subsequently extended to twenty (20) days, in an Order dated March 31, 1998.&nbsp; The temporary restraining order, in effect, directed the parties to restore status quo <span style="font-style: italic;">ante</span>, thereby enabling the private respondents to reassume the management of DARBCI.<br><br>The CDA questioned the propriety of the temporary restraining order issued by the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato on March 27, 1998 through a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, 12<sup>th</sup> Division, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 47318.<br><br>On April 21, 1998, the Court of Appeals, 12<sup>th</sup> Division, issued a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 47318 enjoining the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39, from enforcing the restraining order which the latter court issued on March 27, 1998, and ordered that the proceedings in SP Civil Case No. 25 be held in abeyance.<br><br>Consequently, the CDA continued with the proceedings in CDA-CO Case No. 97-011.&nbsp; On May 26, 1998 CDA Administrator Arcadio S. Lozada issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which directed the holding of a special general assembly of the members of DARBCI and the creation of an <i>ad hoc</i> election committee to supervise the election of officers and members of the board of directors of DARBCI scheduled on June 14, 1998.<br><br>The said resolution of the CDA, issued on May 26, 1998 prompted the private respondents to file on June 8, 1998 a Petition for Prohibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> with a prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction and temporary restraining order with the Court of Appeals, 13<sup>th</sup> Division, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 47933.&nbsp; On June 10, 1998, the appellate court issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> restraining the CDA and its administrator, Arcadio S. Lozada, the three (3) members of the <i>ad hoc</i> election committee or any and all persons acting in their behalf from proceeding with the election of officers and members of the board of directors of DARBCI scheduled on June 14, 1998.<br><br>Incidentally, on the same date that the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order in CA-G.R. SP No. 47933 on June 10, 1998, a corporation by the name of Investa Land Corporation (Investa for brevity) which allegedly executed a “Lease Agreement with Joint Venture” with DARBCI filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39, docketed as SP Civil Case No. 28, essentially seeking the annulment of orders and resolutions issued by the CDA in CDA-CO Case No. 97-011 with a prayer for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.&nbsp; On the following day, June 11, 1998, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> enjoining the respondents therein from proceeding with the scheduled special general assembly and the elections of officers and members of the board of directors of DARBCI on June 14, 1998.&nbsp; Thereafter, it also issued a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>With the issuance of the two (2) restraining orders by the Court of Appeals, 13<sup>th</sup> Division, and the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39, on June 10 and 11, 1998, respectively, the scheduled special general assembly and the election of officers and members of the board of directors of DARBCI on June 14, 1998 did not take place.<br><br>Nevertheless, on July 12, 1998, the majority of the 7,511 members of DARBCI, on their own initiative, convened a general assembly and held an election of the members of the board of directors and officers of the cooperative, thereby effectively replacing the private respondents.&nbsp; Hence, the private respondents filed a Twin Motions for Contempt of Court and to Nullify Proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 47933.<br><br>On September 9, 1998 the Court of Appeals, 13th Division, promulgated its subject appealed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> granting the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 47933, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>Wherefore, the foregoing considered, the Petition is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; The Orders of the respondent Cooperative Development Authority in CDA-CO case No. 97-011 dated 08 December 1997, 15 December 1997, 26 January 1998, 24 February 1998, 03 March 1998, and the Resolution dated 26 May 1998, are hereby declared NULL AND VOID and of no legal force and effect.<br><br>Further, the respondents are hereby ORDERED to perpetually CEASE AND DESIST from taking any further proceedings in CDA-CO Case No. 97-011.<br><br>Lastly, the respondent CDA is hereby ORDERED to REINSTATE the Board of Directors of DARBCI who were ousted by virtue of the questioned Orders, and to RESTORE the <i>status quo</i> prior to the filing of CDA-CO Case No. 97-011.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>The CDA filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 47933 but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated February 9, 1999, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for being patently without merit.<br><br>MOREOVER, acting on petitioners’ Twin Motion, and in view of the&nbsp; Decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case dated 09, September 1998, the tenor of which gives it legal effect <i>nunc pro tunc</i>.&nbsp; We therefore hold the 12 July 1998 election&nbsp; of&nbsp; officers,&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolutions&nbsp; passed during the said assembly, and the subsequent oath-taking of the officers elected therein, and all actions taken during the said meeting, being in blatant defiance of a valid restraining order issued by this Court, to be NULL AND VOID <i>AB INITIO</i> AND OF NO LEGAL FORCE AND EFFECT.<br><br>FURTHERMORE, the private respondents are hereby given thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution within which to explain in writing why they should not be held in contempt of this Court for having openly defied the restraining order dated 10 July 1998.&nbsp; The Hon. Jose C. Medina of the CDA is given a like period to explain in writing why he should not be cited in contempt for having administered the oath of the “Board of Officers” pending the effectivity of the restraining order.&nbsp; The respondent Arcadio S. Lozada, Administrator of the CDA, is likewise given the same period to explain why he should not be held in contempt for issuing a resolution on 21 July 1998 validating the proceedings of the assembly, and another resolution on 28 August 1998 confirming the election of the officers thereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Hence, the instant petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> for review which raises the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, IN NULLIFYING THE ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS OF THE COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY IN CDA CO CASE NO. 97-011, DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE THAT IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT APPLYING THE RULE ON FORUM-SHOPPING.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RENDERING A DECISION ON THE BASIS OF PURE CONJECTURES AND SURMISES AND HAS DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS WHICH CALL FOR AN EXERCISE OF THIS HONORABLE COURT’S SUPERVISION.</blockquote>Petitioner CDA claims that it is vested with quasi-judicial authority to adjudicate cooperative disputes in view of its powers, functions and responsibilities under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 6939.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The quasi-judicial nature of its powers and functions was confirmed by the Department of Justice, through the then Acting Secretary of Justice Demetrio G. Demetria, in DOJ Opinion No. 10, Series of 1995, which was issued in response to a query of&nbsp; the then Chairman Edna E. Aberina of the CDA, to wit:<br><blockquote>Applying the foregoing, the express powers of the CDA to cancel certificates of registration of cooperatives for non-compliance with administrative requirements or in cases of voluntary dissolution under Section 3(g), and to mandate and conciliate disputes within a cooperative or between cooperatives under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6939, may be deemed quasi-judicial in nature.<br><br>The reason is that – in the performance of its functions such as cancellation of certificate of registration, it is necessary to establish non-compliance or violation of administrative requirement.&nbsp; To do so, there arises an indispensable need to hold hearings, investigate or ascertain facts that possibly constitute non-compliance or violation and, based on the facts investigated or ascertained, it becomes incumbent upon the CDA to use its official discretion whether or not to cancel a cooperative’s certificate of registration, thus, clearly revealing the quasi-judicial nature of the said function.&nbsp; When the CDA acts as a conciliatory body pursuant to Section 8 of R.A. No. 6939, it in effect performs the functions of an arbitrator.&nbsp; Arbitrators are by the nature of their functions act in quasi-judicial capacity xxx.<br><br>The quasi-judicial nature of the foregoing functions is bolstered by the provisions of Sections 3(o) of R.A. No. 6939 which grants CDA on (sic) the exercise of other functions as may be necessary to implement the provisions of cooperative laws, the power to summarily punish for direct contempt any person guilty of misconduct in the presence thereof who seriously interrupts any hearing or inquiry with a fine or imprisonment prescribed therein, a power usually granted to make effective the exercise of quasi-judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Likewise, the Office of the President, through the then Deputy Executive Secretary, Hon. Leonardo A. Quisumbing, espoused the same view in the case of <i>Alberto Ang, et al. v. The Board of Directors, Metro Valenzuela Transport Services Cooperative, Inc.</i>, O.P. Case No. 51111, when it declared and ruled that:<br><blockquote>Concededly, Section 3(o) of R.A. No. 6939 and Article 35(4) of R.A. 6938, may not be relied upon by the CDA as authority to resolve internal conflicts of cooperatives, they being general provisions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this does not preclude the CDA from resolving the instant case.&nbsp; The assumption of jurisdiction by the CDA on matters which partake of cooperative disputes is a logical, necessary and direct consequence of its authority to register cooperatives.&nbsp; Before a cooperative can acquire juridical personality, registration thereof is a condition sine qua non, and until and unless the CDA issues a certificate of registration under its official seal, any cooperative for that matter cannot be considered as having been legally constituted.&nbsp; <u>To our mind, the grant of this power impliedly carries with it the visitorial power to entertain cooperative conflicts, a lesser power compared to its authority to cancel registration certificates when, in its opinion, the cooperative fails to comply with some administrative requirements (Sec. 2(g), R.A. No. 6939).</u>&nbsp; Evidently, respondents-appellants’ claim that the CDA is limited to conciliation and mediation proceedings is bereft of legal basis.&nbsp; Simply stated, the CDA, in the exercise of ‘such other function’ and in keeping with the mandate of the law, could render the decisions and/or resolutions as long as they pertain to the internal affairs of the public service cooperative, such as the rights and privileges of its members, the rules and procedures for meetings of the general assembly, Board of Directors and committees, election and qualifications of officers, directors and committee members, and allocation and distribution of surpluses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>The petitioner avers that when an administrative agency is conferred with quasi-judicial powers and functions, such as the CDA, all controversies relating to the subject matter pertaining to its specialization are deemed to be covered within the jurisdiction of said administrative agency.&nbsp; The courts will not interfere in matters which are addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted with the regulation of activities undertaken upon their special technical knowledge and training.<br><br>The petitioner added that the decision in the case of <i>CANORECO v. Hon. Ruben D. Torres,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> affirmed the adjudicatory powers and functions of CDA contrary to the view held by the Court of Appeals, when the Supreme Court upheld therein the ruling of the CDA annulling the election of therein respondents Norberto Ochoa, <i>et al.</i> as officers of&nbsp; the Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative.<br><br>Petitioner CDA also claims that herein private respondents are guilty of forum-shopping by filing cases in three (3) different fora seeking the same relief.&nbsp; Petitioner pointed out that private respondents originally filed a petition with a prayer for preliminary injunction dated December 17, 1997 before the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato which was docketed as SP Civil Case No. 25.&nbsp; Subsequently, the same private respondents filed another petition with a prayer for preliminary injunction with the Court of Appeals, 13<sup>th</sup> Division, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 47933.&nbsp; Thereafter, Investa, also represented by the same counsel of private respondents, Atty. Reni Dublin, filed another case with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, docketed as SP Civil Case No. 28, likewise praying, among others, for the issuance of preliminary injunction and an application for a temporary restraining order.&nbsp; In effect, petitioner was confronted with three (3) TRO’s issued in three (3) separate actions enjoining it from enforcing its orders and resolutions in CDA-CO Case No. 97-011.<br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> private respondents contend that the instant petition for review on certiorari filed by CDA Administrator Alberto Zingapan should be dismissed and struck down as a mere scrap of paper for lack of authority to file the same from the Office of the Solicitor General and for having been filed without approval from the Board of Administrators of CDA.<br><br>The private respondents also contend that, contrary to the claim of the petitioner, the powers, functions and responsibilities of the CDA show that it was merely granted regulatory or supervisory powers over cooperatives in addition to its authority to mediate and conciliate between parties involving the settlement of cooperative disputes.<br><br>Private respondents denied that they are guilty of forum-shopping.&nbsp; They clarified that the case filed with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39, docketed as SP Civil Case No. 25, was a petition for certiorari.&nbsp; On the other hand, the case that they filed with the Court of Appeals, 13th Division, docketed therein as CA-G.R. SP No. 47933, was a petition for prohibition to stop the holding of a special general assembly and the election of a new set of DARBCI officers on June 14, 1998 as ordered by the petitioner CDA on May 26, 1998, which events have not yet occurred at the time the petition for certiorari was filed by the private respondents with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, Branch 39.<br><br>Private respondents also denied that the filing by Investa of the petition for the declaration of nullity of the orders and resolutions of petitioner CDA, with a prayer for temporary restraining order with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato, docketed therein as SP Civil Case No. 28, constituted forum-shopping on their part.&nbsp; They pointed out that Investa has a separate juridical personality from DARBCI and that, contrary to the claim of petitioner CDA, the former is not represented by the lawyer of the private respondents.<br><br>By way of reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> petitioner claims that Atty. Rogelio P. Madriaga was properly deputized, among other lawyers, as Special Attorney by the Office of the Solicitor General to represent the CDA in the instant petition pursuant to the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of Assistant Solicitor General Carlos N. Ortega addressed to CDA Chairman Jose C. Medina, Jr. dated April 8, 1999.&nbsp; Likewise, the filing of the instant petition was an official act of CDA Administrator Alberto P. Zingapan who was duly appointed by the CDA Board of Administrators as chairman of the Oversight Committee on Legal Matters per Resolution No. 201, S-1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on March 26, 1999, certain persons alleging to be incumbent officers and members of the board of directors of DARBCI filed a motion to intervene in the instant petition which was granted by this Court per its Resolution dated July 7, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the same resolution, this Court required both petitioner CDA and the private respondents in this case to file their respective comments to the petition-in-intervention within ten (10) days from notice, but both parties failed to comply to do so up to the present.<br><br>We note that the instant petition for review on certiorari suffers from a basic infirmity for lack of the requisite imprimatur from the Office of the Solicitor General, hence, it is dismissible on that ground.&nbsp; The general rule is that only the Solicitor General can bring or defend actions on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines and that actions filed in the name of the Republic, or its agencies and instrumentalities for that matter, if not initiated by the Solicitor General, will be summarily dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The authority of the Office of the Solicitor General to represent the Republic of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities, is embodied under Section 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987 which provides that:<br><blockquote>SEC. 35.&nbsp; <i>Powers and Functions</i>.—The Office of the Solicitor General shall represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and intrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of lawyers.&nbsp; When authorized by the President or head of the office concerned, it shall also represent government owned or controlled corporations.&nbsp; The Office of the Solicitor General shall constitute the law office of the Government and, as such, shall discharge duties requiring the services of lawyers.&nbsp; It shall have the following specific powers and functions:<br><blockquote>(1) Represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings; represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.</blockquote></blockquote>The import of the above-quoted provision of the Administrative Code of 1987 is to impose upon the Office of the Solicitor General the duty to appear as counsel for the Government, its agencies and instrumentalites and its officials and agents before the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and all other courts and tribunals in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer.&nbsp; Its mandatory character was emphasized by this Court in the case of <i>Gonzales v. Chavez,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>It is patent that the intent of the lawmaker was to give the designated official, the Solicitor General, in this case, the unequivocal mandate to appear for the government in legal proceedings.&nbsp; Spread out in the laws creating the office is the discernible intent which may be gathered from the term “shall”, which is invariably employed, from Act No. 136 (1901) to the more recent Executive Order No. 292 (1987).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>The decision of this Court as early as 1910 with respect to the duties of the Attorney-General well applies to the Solicitor General under the facts of the present case.&nbsp; The Court then declared: <br><blockquote>In this jurisdiction, it is the duty of the Attorney General ‘to perform the duties imposed upon him by law’ and ‘he shall prosecute all causes, civil and criminal, to which the Government of the Philippine Islands, or any officer thereof, in his official capacity, is a party’ xxx.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>The Court is firmly convinced that considering the spirit and the letter of the law, there can be no other logical interpretation of Sec. 35 of the Administrative Code than that it is, indeed, mandatory upon the OSG to “represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer.”</blockquote>As an exception to the general rule, the Solicitor General, in providing legal representation for the government, is empowered under Section 35(8), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987 to “deputize legal officers of government departments, bureaus, agencies and offices to assist the Solicitor General and appear or represent the Government in cases involving their respective offices, brought before the courts and exercise supervision and control over such legal officers with respect to such cases.”<br><br>Petitioner claims that its counsel of record, Atty. Rogelio P. Madriaga, was deputized by the Solicitor General to represent the CDA in the instant petition.&nbsp; To prove its claim, the petitioner attached to its Reply to the Comment dated January 31, 2000, a photocopy of the alleged deputation letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> from the Office of the Solicitor General signed by Hon. Carlos N. Ortega, Assistant Solicitor General, addressed to CDA Chairman Jose C. Medina, Jr.<br><br>A close scrutiny of the alleged deputation letter from the Office of the Solicitor General shows, however, that said counsel for the petitioner was only “authorized to appear as counsel in all civil cases <i>in the lower courts (RTCs and MTCs) wherein the CDA is a party-litigant</i>”.&nbsp; Likewise, the same letter appears to be dated April 8, 1999 while the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the petitioner was dated February 26, 1999.&nbsp; Clearly then, when the petition was filed with this Court on March 3, 1999, Atty. Rogelio P. Madriaga was not yet deputized by the Office of the Solicitor General to represent the CDA.<br><br>Even on the assumption that the alleged letter from the Office of the Solicitor General was intended to validate or ratify the authority of counsel to represent the petitioner in this case, the same contains certain conditions, one of which is that petitioner “shall submit to the Solicitor General, for <i>review, approval</i> and <i>signature</i>, all important pleadings and motions, including motions to withdraw complaints or appeals, as well as compromise agreements.” Significantly, one of the major pleadings filed subsequently by the petitioner in this case namely, the Reply to the Respondent’s Comment on the Petition dated January 31, 2000, does not have any indication that the same was previously submitted to the Office of the Solicitor General for review or approval, much less bear the requisite signature of the Solicitor General as required in the alleged deputation letter.<br><br>Nonetheless, in view of the novelty of the main issue raised in this petition concerning the nature and scope of jurisdiction of the CDA in the settlement of cooperative disputes as well as the long standing legal battle involving the management of DARBCI between two (2) opposing factions that inevitably threatens the very existence of one of the country’s major cooperatives, this Court has decided to act on and determine the merits of the instant petition.<br><br>Section 3 of R.A.

No. 6939 that the authority of the CDA is to discharge purely administrative functions which consist of policy-making, registration, fiscal and technical assistance to cooperatives and implementation of cooperative laws.&nbsp; Nowhere in the said law can it be found any express grant to the CDA of authority to adjudicate cooperative disputes.&nbsp; At most, Section 8 of the same law provides that “upon request of either or both parties, the Authority shall mediate and conciliate disputes with a cooperative or between cooperatives” however, with a restriction “that if no mediation or conciliation succeeds within three (3) months from request thereof, <i>a certificate of non-resolution shall be issued by the commission prior to the filing of appropriate action before the proper courts</i>”.&nbsp; Being an administrative agency, the CDA has only such powers as are expressly granted to it by law and those which are necessarily implied in the exercise thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner CDA, however, insists that its authority to conduct hearings or inquiries and the express grant to it of contempt powers under Section 3, paragraphs (g) and (o) of R.

ALVAREZ.&nbsp; On page 3, between lines 5 and 6, if I may, insert the following as one of the powers:&nbsp; CONDUCT INQUIRIES, STUDIES, HEARINGS AND INVESTIGATIONS AND ISSUE ORDERS, DECISIONS AND CIRCULARS AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT ALL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO COOPERATIVES.&nbsp; THE AGENCY MAY SUMMARILY PUNISH FOR CONTEMPT BY A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200.00) OR IMPRISONMENT NOT EXCEEDING TEN (10) DAYS, OR BOTH, ANY PERSONS GUILTY OF SUCH MISCONDUCT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE AGENCY WHICH SERIOUSLY INTERRUPTS ANY HEARING OR INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING WILFULL FAILURE OR REFUSAL, WITHOUT JUST CAUSE, COMPLY WITH A SUMMONS, SUBPOENA, SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM, DECISION OR ORDER, RULE OR REGULATION, OR, BEING PRESENT AT A HEARING OR INVESTIGATION, REFUSES TO BE SWORN IN AS A WITNESS OR TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR TO FURNISH INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE AGENCY.&nbsp; THE SHERIFF AND/OR POLICE AGENCIES OF THE PLACE WHERE THE HEARING OR INVESTIGATION IS CONDUCTED SHALL, UPON REQUEST OF THE AGENCY, ASSIST IT TO ENFORCE THE PENALTY.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT.

AQUINO.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. President, conceptually, we do not like the agency to have quasi-judicial powers.&nbsp; And, we are afraid that if we empower the agency to conduct inquiries, studies, hearings and investigations, it might interfere in the autonomous character of cooperatives.&nbsp; So, I am sorry Mr. President, we don’t accept the amendment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>The decision to withhold quasi-judicial powers from the CDA is in accordance with the policy of the government granting autonomy to cooperatives.&nbsp; It was noted that in the past 75 years cooperativism failed to flourish in the Philippines.&nbsp; Of the 23,000 cooperatives organized under P.D. No. 175, only 10 to 15 percent remained operational while the rest became dormant.&nbsp; The dismal failure of cooperativism in the Philippines was attributed mainly to the stifling attitude of the government toward cooperatives.&nbsp; While the government wished to help, it invariably wanted to control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Also, in its anxious efforts&nbsp; to&nbsp; push&nbsp; cooperativism, it smothered cooperatives with so much help that&nbsp; they failed to develop self-reliance.&nbsp; As one cooperative expert put it, “The strong embrace of government ends with a kiss of death for cooperatives.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>But then, acknowledging the role of cooperatives as instruments of national development, the framers of the 1987 Constitution directed Congress under Article XII, Section 15 thereof to create a centralized agency that shall promote the viability and growth of cooperatives.&nbsp; Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, the Congress approved on March 10, 1990 Republic Act No. 6939 which is the organic law creating the Cooperative Development Authority.&nbsp; Apparently cognizant of the errors in the past, Congress declared in an unequivocal language that the state shall “maintain the policy of non-interference in the management and operation of cooperatives.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>After ascertaining the clear legislative intent underlying R.A. No. 6939, effect should be given to it by the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Consequently, we hold and rule that the CDA is devoid of any quasi-judicial authority to adjudicate intra-cooperative disputes and more particularly disputes as regards the election of the members of the Board of Directors and officers of cooperatives.&nbsp; The authority to conduct hearings or inquiries and the power to hold any person in contempt may be exercised by the CDA only in the performance of its administrative functions under R.A. No. 6939.<br><br>The petitioner’s reliance on the case of CANORECO is misplaced for the reason that the central issue raised therein was whether or not the Office of the President has the authority to supplant or reverse the resolution of an administrative agency, specifically the CDA, that had long became final and on which issue we ruled in the negative.&nbsp; In fact, this Court declared in the said case that the CDA has no jurisdiction to adjudicate intra-cooperative disputes thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>Obviously there was a clear case of intra-cooperative dispute.&nbsp; Article 121 of the Cooperative Code is explicit on how the dispute should be resolved; thus:<br><br>ART. 121. <i>Settlement of Disputes.</i> – Disputes among members, officers, directors, and committee members, and intra-cooperative disputes shall, as far as practicable, be settled amicably in accordance with the conciliation or mediation mechanisms embodied in the by-laws of the cooperative, and in applicable laws.<br><br>Should such a conciliation/mediation proceeding fail, the matter shall be settled in a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>Complementing this Article is Section 8 of R.A.

SP No. 47318 issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the proceedings in Special Civil Case No. 25 and for the parties therein to maintain the status quo.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the private respondents could not seek immediate relief before the trial court and hence, they had to seek recourse before the Court of Appeals via a petition for prohibition with a prayer for preliminary injunction to forestall the impending damage and injury to them in view of the order issued by the petitioner on May 26, 1998.<br><br>The filing of Special Civil Case No. 28 with the RTC of Polomolok, South Cotabato does not also constitute forum-shopping on the part of the private respondents.&nbsp; Therein petitioner Investa, which claims to have a subsisting lease agreement and a joint venture with DARBCI, is an entity whose juridical personality is separate and distinct from that of private respondent cooperative or herein individual private respondents and that they have totally different interests in the subject matter of the case.&nbsp; Moreover, it was incorrect for the petitioner to charge the private respondents with forum-shopping partly based on its erroneous claim that DARBCI and Investa were both represented by the same counsel.&nbsp; A charge of forum-shopping may not be anchored simply on the fact that the counsel for different petitioners in two (2) cases is one and the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Besides, a review of the records of this case shows that the counsel of record of Investa in Special Civil Case No. 28 is a certain Atty.
