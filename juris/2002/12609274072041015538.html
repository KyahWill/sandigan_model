No. 130612, May 11, 1999, a very recent case, the Supreme Court ruled:<br><blockquote>“We agree with the Solicitor General, however, that accused-appellant’s confession to the radio reporter, Celso Manuel is admissible.&nbsp; In People vs. Andan, the accused in a rape with homicide case confessed to the crime during interviews with the media.&nbsp; In holding the confession admissible, despite the fact that the accused gave his answers without the assistance of counsel, this court said:<br><br>“[A]ppellant’s [oral] confessions to the newsmen are not covered by Section 12(1) and (3) of Article III of the Constitution.&nbsp; The Bill of Rights does not concern itself with the relation between a private individual and another individual.&nbsp; It governs the relationship between the individual and the State.&nbsp; The prohibitions therein are primarily addressed to the State and its agents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Jimenez was competent to testify only as to the substance of what he had heard, but not as to the truth thereof.&nbsp; However, despite its ruling during trial that it is admitting Jimenez’s account as an independently relevant statement, the trial court considered the substance of accused-appellant’s alleged statements to Jimenez as true and then proceeded to justify conviction of accused-appellant on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; In its consideration of the contents of accused-appellant’s alleged statements to Jimenez, the trial court treated them as an extrajudicial confession made to a private party, and not just as an independent relevant statement. This is error. As previously noted, Jimenez admitted on cross-examination that there was bad blood between him and accused-appellant.&nbsp; It was, therefore, improbable that accused-appellant went to Jimenez’s house for the birthday of the latter’s son, on the occasion of which accused-appellant confessed to the crime.&nbsp; It is even more improbable that accused-appellant confessed to the crime. It is even moe improbable that accused-appellant made his confession in the presence of other people.&nbsp; Jimenez named three persons as being allegedly present when accused-appellant made his confession.&nbsp; These were Garcia Payot, Donita Payot, and Orlando Mojado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, not one of this persons was presented to corroborate Jimenez’s claim.<br><br>We are more inclined to believe accused-appellant’s claim that on the date in question he was in his house in Kapayawi, Libungan, Cotabato and that he had never gone to Sitio Mapurok, Alamada, Cotabato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Accused-appellant denied Constancio Jimenez’s allegation that he had transferred residence several times, as well as Onotan Tomas’ allegation that accused-appellant was his neighbor in Sitio Mapurok, Alamada, Cotabato.&nbsp; Accused-appellant maintained that he had been a resident of Kapayawi, Libungan, Cotabato since his childhood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><i>Second.</i> There is no evidence that the victim was raped.&nbsp; However, in finding that the victim had been raped, the trial court stated:<br><blockquote>Dr. Demetillo testified that he also examined the [genitalia] of the victim but he did not enter any finding in the report as he did not find any (TSN, October 29, 1998, pp. 12-13).<br><br>The Supreme Court consistently ruled that a medical certificate is not [indispensable] to prove the commission of rape (People vs. Quaimco, 268 SCRA 516; People vs. Ederalino, 271 SCRA 189; People vs. Bugarin, 273 SCRA 384; People vs. Zaballero, 274 SCRA 627).&nbsp; The Highest Court also consistently ruled that lack of lacerated wounds does not negate sexual intercourse (People vs. San Juan, 270 SCRA 693; People vs. Erardo, 277 SCRA 643; People vs. Gabayron, 278 SCRA 78; People vs. Betonio, 279 SCRA 532; People vs. Oliva, 282 SCRA 470).</blockquote>The trial court is correct in ruling tht the absence of lacerated wounds in the genitalia does not necessarily mean that rape had not been committed. Rape, however, is never presumed.&nbsp; We agree with the Solicitor General, who recommends that accused-appellant be absolved of the charge of rape, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that there must at least be some evidence of finger grips and contusion on the body of the victims, torn garment, and lacerations, redness, and swelling, especially of the genital area, to prove rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Indeed, not only is there no proof of rape in this case but the witness for the prosecution who conducted the necropsy categorically stated that he did not have any findings concerning victim’s genitalia.<br><br><i>Third.</i> Nor can accused-appellant be held responsible for the death of the victim. Evidence showing a mere possibility of guilt is insufficient to warrant a conviction. In this case, the trial court stated —<br><blockquote>Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (a) There is more than one circumstance; (b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>From the very start of the investigation, accused Silvano was the principal suspect (Opposition to Motion to Quash, p. 27, Record).&nbsp; After the incident, the accused left Macabasa, Alamada and transferred his residence to Midsayap, Cotabato and finally at Libungan, Cotabato where he was arrested.&nbsp; The accused’s flight is a strong indication of guilt (People vs. Vitor, 245 SCRA 620) for flight evidences culpability and a guilty conscience, and it strongly indicates a guilty mind or betrays the existence of a guilty conscience (People vs. Salvame, 270 SCRA 766).&nbsp; The accused never explained why he fled after the incident took place.&nbsp; The accused’s admission is corroborated by evidence of corpus delicti e.g. the corpse of victim Maramanay Tomas.&nbsp; The accused’s admission that he stabbed and killed the victim is further corroborated by the findings of Dr. Ebenezer Demetillo that the victim sustained twenty-one (21) stab wounds.&nbsp; (TSN, October 29, 1998, p. 8; Exhibits “B-4” and “B-5”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>There is no circumstantial evidence to show accused-appellant's guilt: <ol> <li>Disregarding&nbsp; accused-appellant’s alleged admission, the only factual circumstance left is that of flight.&nbsp; Even this is in question in the face of accused-appellant’s assertion that he is actually a resident of Brgy. Kapayawi, Libungan, Cotabato since childhood.<br><br></li><li>The assertion that accused-appellant was a principal suspect from the start of the investigation is not corroborated by evidence.<br><br></li><li>There is no proof that accused-appellant was, or could have been, in the place and at the time of the commission of the crime in question.<br><br></li><li>The injuries sustained by the victim Maramanay Tomas, do not indicate the probability that accused-appellant raped and killed her, if at all.<br><br></li><li>The <i>tubao</i> allegedly found near the cadaver of the victim and turned over to the police was not identified, marked, and offered as evidence nor in any case shown to belong to accused-appellant. </li></ol> As we have held:<br><blockquote>Accused-appellant’s conviction by the trial court hinged on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; To validly invoke circumstantial evidence, it must be shown that there is more than one circumstance and the facts from which the inferences derived are proven.&nbsp; The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The circumstances must constitute an unbroken chain of events that can reasonably lead to the conclusion pointing to the accused to the exclusion of all others as the author of the crime. . . . Like a tapestry made of strands which create a pattern when interwoven, a judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence can be upheld only if the circumstances proved constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><i>Fourth.</i> The prosecution thus failed to prove accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. To secure a conviction, it is not enough that the evidence establishes a strong suspicion or even a probability of guilt. Moral certainty that the accused committed the crime is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> That alibi (which accused-appellant invokes) is the weakest defense is irrelevant.&nbsp; For when the prosecution fails to discharge its burden, an accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 18, Midsayap, Cotabato, finding accused-appellant Antonio Silvano guilty of the crime of rape with homicide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of the victim Maramanay Tomas P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Accused-appellant ANTONIO SILVANO is ACQUITTED on ground of reasonable doubt and is ordered immediately released unless he is lawfully held in custody for another cause.<br><br>The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is directed to implement this Decision and to report to this Court the action taken hereon within 5 days upon receipt hereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Bellosillo, (Chairman), Quisumbing, De Leon, Jr.</i>, and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Judge Rasad G.
