of the Regional Trial Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 15, Tabaco, 
Albay, finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime of Rape with Homicide and imposing upon him the supreme 
penalty of death.</p>
  <p> The Information reads as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That in the evening of December 25, 1996, at Barangay 
Jonop, 
Municipality of Malinao, Province of Albay, Philippines and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd
 design and by means of violence, force and intimidation, did then and 
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with 
MERLINDA CALLADA, against her will and consent, and by reason and on the
 occasion thereof, accused with intent to kill, with treachery and 
taking advantage of nighttime, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously assault, attack, wound, injure and box afore-named 
Merlinda Callada on the different parts of her body, which caused her 
death, to the damage and prejudice of her legal heirs. </p>
    <p>ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Upon arraignment on June 16, 1997, the accused-appellant 
pleaded 
not guilty. Trial thereby ensued where the prosecution presented seven 
(7) witnesses. The accused-appellant testified on his own behalf. 
</p>
  <p>The facts as presented by the Office of the Solicitor General
 (OSG) are as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>At about 1:23 in the afternoon of December 26, 1996, 
Lorenzo 
Bongkingki, the barangay captain of Jonop, municipality of Malinao, 
Albay, was informed by Domingo Cierva that there was a body of a naked 
woman lying on her back in a canal. Lorenzo immediately proceeded to the
 place mentioned. There he saw the cadaver of the woman confirming 
Domingo Cierva’s report. Lorenzo immediately reported the matter to the 
police department (TSN, pp. 3-8, July 30, 1997). </p>
    <p>Accompanied by Barangay Captain Lorenzo Bongkingki, a 
police team
 was dispatched to Barangay Jonop to investigate. When the police 
arrived, they saw the cadaver of a woman lying on her back with her face
 up in the shallow waters of a river. SPO2 Salvador Cestina, a member of
 the police team, conducted an ocular investigation at the scene. The 
cadaver was photographed. SPO2 Cestina observed that the dead woman had 
injuries and bruises on her arms and elbows. She wore a T-shirt which 
was rolled up to her neck. She had no panty. The police brought the 
cadaver to the ground. They later placed the cadaver inside the jeep and
 brought it to the Municipal Health Office of Malinao, Albay (TSN, pp. 
7-11, July 14, 1997; TSN, pp. 6-9, July 30, 1997). </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, at about 1:00 in the afternoon of December 26, 
1996, 
while Manuel Callada was at home tending their store, he heard a 
commotion outside about a dead woman who was found naked in the river. 
Curious, Manuel went out and proceeded to the place where the dead woman
 was found. Manuel Callada was shocked by what he saw. The dead woman 
was his wife, Merlinda Callada. He recognized his wife because of the 
mole on the middle of her upper lip. After identifying his wife, Manuel 
proceeded to the police headquarters. A police team was dispatched to 
the crime scene (TSN, pp. 2-4, August 18, 1997). </p>
    <p>The cadaver of Merlinda Callada was brought to a funeral 
parlor 
for autopsy. Dr. Dante B. Bausa, Municipal Health Officer of Malinao, 
Albay, conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim. Dr. Bausa 
prepared an Autopsy Report (Exh. “A”, p. 2, Record) which shows the 
following findings: </p>

evidence of intravaginal bleeding. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>LABORATORY EXAMINATION: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- vaginal smear and vaginal washing result: negative for 
spermatozoa </p>

    <p>CAUSE OF DEATH: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- ASPHYXIA SECONDARY TO UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION 
SECONDARY TO TRAUMATIC INJURY, FACE. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On the basis of the genital examination conducted on the 
victim, 
Dr. Bausa concluded that the victim was raped because of the presence of
 “hyperemia with abrasion and minimal bleeding located from 6:00 o’clock
 and 9:00 o’clock of the vaginal vestibule” (TSN, p. 18, 1997; TSN, pp. 
11-12, July 1, 1997). Dr. Bausa testified that at the time he examined 
the victim he found the wounds on her body still fresh with minimal 
bleeding. He found no seminal fluid inside the inner vaginal canal, 
i.e., it was negative for spermatozoa upon smear examination. Dr. Bausa 
opined that the sexual act might have been aborted and the suspect 
failed to ejaculate due to some distractions or disturbances by the 
presence of some passersby (TSN, p. 15, July 1, 1997). </p>
    <p>On December 29, 1996, SPO4 Antonio Camano, a member of the 
investigating team, went home to Barangay Jonop, Malinao, Albay. SPO4 
Camano learned from the people there that one Jose Canicula (i.e., 
appellant) had left the place carrying with him all his belongings, 
including household items. SPO4 Camano relayed the information to the 
police headquarters. SPO4 Camano and some policemen rushed to the house 
of appellant’s wife in the nearby town of Malilipot. In Malilipot, 
appellant’s wife told the police team that her husband was working in 
Basud, Tabaco, Albay. The police proceeded to Basud. When SPO4 Camano 
saw appellant, he (SPO4 Camano) alighted from the car and approached 
him. Upon seeing SPO4 Camano, whose wife was his (appellant’s) relative,
 appellant told SPO4 Camano that he would go with him. Appellant was 
brought to the police station of Malinao, Albay, for investigation (TSN,
 pp. 14-17, July 30, 1997). </p>
    <p>During the investigation, appellant broke down and 
confessed to 
the crime. SPO4 Salvador Cestina was assigned to take appellant’s sworn 
statement. Before taking appellant’s extra-judicial confession, SPO4 
Cestina apprised him of his constitutional rights to remain silent, to 
be assisted by counsel of his choice and if he did not have any, to be 
provided with one. Since appellant did not have a lawyer of his choice, 
SPO4 Cestina propounded questions to appellant in the Bicolano dialect 
to which appellant answered in the same dialect. Atty. Brotamonte was 
present throughout the proceedings. The questions and answers were 
translated into the English language (TSN, pp. 14-17, June 14, 1997; 
TSN, pp. 23-24, August 18, 1997). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On October 7, 1997, the RTC rendered a decision with the 
following dispositive portion: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Premises considered, the Court having been convinced that 
proof 
beyond reasonable doubt has been established against the accused the 
Court finds him guilty of the crime of Rape with Homicide penalized 
under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended and hereby 
sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH and to pay the heirs of 
Merlinda Callada the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity for her death. 
</p>
    <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In this appeal, the accused-appellant raise the following 
assignment of errors: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.  The Court a quo gravely erred in finding the accused 
appellant guilty for the crime charge on the basis of unsupported 
suspicion of private complainant Manuel Callada. </p>
    <p>2.  The Court a quo gravely erred by holding the 
accused-appellant guilty based on his eight (8) uncorroborated 
circumstances. </p>
    <p>3.  The Court a quo gravely erred by imposing the capital 
penalty
 of death to the accused-appellant and to pay indemnity of P50,000.00 to
 the heirs of the deceased, based on the extrajudicial statement and 
admission by the appellant; and </p>
    <p>4. The Court a quo gravely erred by disregarding totally 
appellant’s defenses of denial of the crime charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to the accused-appellant’s contention, the trial 
court did
 not merely rely on the testimonies of private complainant Manuel 
Callada and SPO4 Antonio Camano who allegedly pointed at the 
accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime because of his sudden 
flight from the place. While it is true that the accused-appellant’s 
sudden flight was quite suspicious, there were other evidences 
considered which point to him as the author of the crime. </p>
  <p>The accused-appellant and the victim were both residents of 
Barangay Jonop, Malinao, Albay. After the commission of the crime, the 
residents noticed that the accused-appellant left the place bringing 
with him all his belongings. This sudden flight aroused the curiosity of
 the police who in turn tried to pursue the accused-appellant in order 
to find out if he had anything to do with the death of the victim. The 
police learned that the accused-appellant was merely in the next 
barangay. Upon seeing the police, the accused-appellant recognized SPO4 
Camano who was a relative of his wife, and voluntarily went with them. 
At the police station, the accused-appellant executed a sworn statement 
before SPO1 Salvador Cestina with the assistance of counsel where he 
stated that: </p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  </p>
  <p>The trial court admitted the extrajudicial statement executed
 by 
the accused-appellant on December 29, 1996 and found it not to be 
vitiated. The accused-appellant was duly assisted at that time by a 
competent counsel in the person of Atty. Danilo Brotamonte from the 
Public Attorney’s Office (PAO). When called to testify in court for the 
prosecution, Atty. Brotamonte asserted that he was called by the police 
to assist the accused-appellant when the latter’s statement was taken. 
He made sure that the contents thereof were duly explained and 
understood by the accused-appellant before his signature was 
affixed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 The extrajudicial statement is tantamount to a confession voluntarily 
given by the accused where the recitals therein are his own and contains
 details which the accused-appellant is in a position to know.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 A confession is evidence of the highest order because it is supported 
by the strong presumption that no person of normal mind could 
deliberately and knowingly confess to a crime unless he is prompted by 
truth and conscience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The presumption of spontaneity and voluntariness
 stands unless the defense proves otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  </p>
  <p>By the extrajudicial statement, the accused-appellant readily
 
admitted that he was at the scene of the crime with the victim. While 
walking towards Jonop at 7:15 in the evening of December 25, 1996, he 
was following a woman until he caught up with her. He suddenly boxed her
 four times which caused the victim to fall into the river. He 
recognized the victim to be Merly Callada because he recognized her 
voice when she allegedly shouted back at him. The next day, the victim 
was discovered dead and naked. The autopsy report sufficiently reveals 
that the victim suffered serious injuries on her head and face which 
proved to be fatal. </p>
  <p>The extrajudicial statement coupled with the <em>corpus
 delicti</em> and the autopsy report lead to the conclusion that 
the accused-appellant is responsible for the death of the victim. 
</p>
  <p>The Court, however, finds that the prosecution has not 
presented 
that standard of proof required a law in proving the crime of rape. The 
extrajudicial statement of the accused-appellant does not mention that 
he raped the victim. The accused-appellant merely admitted that he boxed
 the victim four times until the victim fell into the river. The medical
 report categorically states that there is no finding of spermatozoa in 
the victim’s vagina. While the medical report states that there are 
fresh wounds and minimal bleeding found, this does not, however, prove 
that it was the accused-appellant’s penis which was inserted in the 
victim’s vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Absent any
 conclusive and categorical evidence that the laceration on the victim’s
 vagina was caused by a male organ, the accused-appellant can not be 
held for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>There is, however, sufficient evidence to hold the 
accused-appellant liable for the crime of homicide. He admitted that he 
was drunk at that time when he boxed the victim four times which caused 
her to fall into the river. The medical report clearly points that the 
victim had numerous contusions on the head and face of the victim. It 
can be safely assumed that the death was the result of the 
accused-appellant’s physical assault on the victim. </p>
  <p>The Court, therefore, finds the accused-appellant guilty for 
homicide only which is punished with <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>.
 There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances proven in court,
 the maximum penalty under the Indeterminate Sentence Law shall be 
imposed in its medium period which is 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17
 years and 4 months, while the minimum shall be within the range of the 
penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the 
offense which is prision mayor or 6 years and 1 day to 12 years. 
</p>
  <p>In addition to the award of P50,000.00, as civil indemnity 
for the 
death of Merlinda Callada, the Court also finds that the 
accused-appellant should be made to pay moral damages of P50,000.00 
which is awarded without need of proof, and the amount of P40,600.00 as 
actual damages for funeral and burial expenses which have been 
substantiated and duly proven in Court. Manuel Callada also testified 
that his wife was working as a bodegera in the warehouse of Royal 
Grocery in Tabaco, Albay receiving P3,000.00 a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 Thus, the heirs of the victim is also entitled to an award for the loss
 of Merlinda Callada’s earning capacity which shall be computed as 
follows: </p>
  <p>Net earning capacity = Life expectancy x [Gross Annual Income
 – 
Living Expenses (50% of gross annual income)], where life expectancy = 
2/3 (80- the age of the deceased).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>X = [2(80-37)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> ] x [(P3,000 x 12)- P18,000] </p>

  <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the Decision of the 
Regional Trial 
Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 15, Tabaco, Albay in Criminal Case 
No. T-2817 is hereby MODIFIED. The Accused-appellant, Jose Canicula is
