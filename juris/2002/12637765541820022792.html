  <p>On appeal is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  dated April 15, 1997, of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch
 14, in Criminal Case No. CBU-41810, finding accused-appellant Manuel 
Ylanan guilty of rape and sentencing him to reclusion perpetua.  
</p>
  <p>On August 14, 1996, a complaint was filed by Rosemarie 
Monopolio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
accusing appellant of rape. The complaint reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That on or about the 13th day of August, 1996, at about 
3:00 
A.M., more or less, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, entered the room
 of the undersigned, and by means of force and intimidation, willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously did lie and succeeded in having carnal 
knowledge of said Rosemarie Monopolio. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On arraignment, assisted by counsel, appellant pleaded not 
guilty. </p>
  <p>During trial, the prosecution presented complaining witness 
ROSEMARIE MONOPOLIO, a 15-year-old maiden from Zamboanga. She testified 
that she had worked for about a week as an all-around helper in the 
kitchenette of appellant Manuel Ylanan located at Mabolo Street, Cebu 
City. On August 13, 1996, at around 3:00 A.M., she said she was raped by
 appellant. While in the makeshift room in the kitchenette where she and
 her sister slept, according to her, she was awakened when appellant 
entered the room and clamped his hand on her mouth, then placed a pillow
 against her face. She slapped appellant and pleaded for him to stop his
 advances. However, appellant persisted and succeeded to mount her from 
behind. He locked her arms and neck in a “full nelson hold,” rendering 
her immobile and unable to resist. While mounting her, appellant 
threatened to kill her. He then inserted his penis inside her vagina. 
Rosemarie reported the rape to her aunt Leticia Agustin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> who came to the 
kitchenette that morning. This was around 9:00 A.M. Together, they 
reported the incident to the <em>barangay</em> and to the 
Mabolo police station. Rosemarie was then brought to the Cebu City 
Hospital where she was medically examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Dr. ESTERLITA FIEL, resident physician of Cebu City Medical 
Center,
 testified that she examined Rosemarie Monopolio on August 13, 1996 at 
around 10:30 A.M. and found fresh lacerations on her hymen at 2:00 
o’clock and 10:00 o’clock positions. She opined that these lacerations 
could have been caused by sexual intercourse, bicycle riding, ballet 
dancing, horseback riding, and masturbation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>    </p>
  <p>SPO1 ELBERT FLORES, SR. testified that he was assigned at 
Precinct 
No. 4 of Mabolo, Cebu City. He stated that he was one of those who 
invited appellant to their station for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>    </p>
  <p>LETICIA AGUSTIN, Rosemarie’s maternal aunt, testified that 
she accompanied Rosemarie to the <em>barangay</em>
 and the police station, as well as to the hospital after Rosemarie told
 her that Manuel raped her. She also testified that Manuel and Rosemarie
 were sweethearts, and that she did not understand the affidavit she 
signed at the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>    </p>
  <p>The first defense witness was appellant MANUEL YLANAN. He 
admitted 
having copulated with private complainant, but denied raping her. For 
according to him, she consented to the sexual intercourse on August 13, 
1996. He alleged that he was a widower and that he was attracted to 
Rosemarie and courted her. He even had plans of marrying 
Rosemarie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>A son of Manuel, MANOLINE CINCO FLORES, 10 years old, was 
also 
presented as witness for the defense. He testified that Rosemarie was 
introduced to him and his siblings by their father as their new mother. 
He also alleged that Rosemarie even took them out to a mall to win their
 affection. He said Rosemarie slept on the same bed with Manuel in the 
kitchenette.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  
  </p>
  <p>On February 13, 1997, the prosecution presented JULIE FE 
MONOPOLIO 
as rebuttal witness. She denied that her sister Rosemarie and appellant 
Manuel were lovers. She claimed they were not close to their aunt 
Leticia. </p>
  <p>After Julie’s testimony, the court required that Rosemarie be
 
placed again on the witness stand, to the consternation and objection of
 the prosecution. She reiterated her testimony that she was raped by 
appellant. She denied that they were lovers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>    </p>
  <p>AVELINA BOHOL was presented by the defense as sur-rebuttal 
witness.
 She testified that she was a housekeeper/helper of Manuel Ylanan. 
According to her, Rosemarie and Manuel were sweethearts as she would see
 Manuel kiss Rosemarie and the latter would not resist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>    </p>
  <p>The last witness presented was BERNARDITA FAMUDULAN of the 
Institute of Religion and Culture (IRC) in Cebu City. She was identified
 as the custodian or guardian of Rosemarie. She testified that she works
 for the IRC as a seminar house staff. According to her, the IRC is a 
religious organization that aids abused victims. She testified that 
Rosemarie and her family were under IRC’s custody while her case was 
pending trial. Aside from IRC, LIHOK FILIPINA also helped 
Rosemarie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>On April 15, 1997, the trial court rendered its assailed 
decision disposing as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby finds the 
accused Manuel Ylanan guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the
 rape and violation of the complainant Rosemarie Miaga Monopolio that 
evening of August 13, 1996 at Mabolo District in this city. He is hereby
 sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the complainant in the
 amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) in concept of moral 
and exemplary damages. </p>
    <p>The costs of these proceedings shall also be taxed against 
the accused. </p>
    <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In this appeal, appellant alleges that the trial court erred,
 </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I. … IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE 
COMPLAINANT. </p>
    <p>II. … IN NOT GIVING THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHILD WITNESS FOR 
THE DEFENSE EVIDENTIARY WEIGHT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Essentially, the issue is one of witnesses’ credibility. 
</p>
  <p>Appellant contends that the testimony of Rosemarie does not 
deserve
 credence. For one, appellant points out that Rosemarie did not even 
attempt to shout to get the attention of her sister who was sleeping 
nearby, although there were opportunities for her to do so. He casts 
doubts on her allegations, that (1) she slapped him despite her arms 
being locked by him; (2) she watched him rest and put on his clothes 
right after the alleged rape, which is not a normal response of a woman 
who had just been raped; and, (3) appellant was able to enter her from 
behind. He says this was incredible since it would be difficult for a 
man to enter a woman from behind, sexually, without her cooperation and 
consent. </p>
  <p>Appellant also assails the trial court’s failure to 
appreciate the 
testimonies of the following witnesses: (1) Leticia, Rosemarie’s own 
aunt who testified that Rosemarie and appellant were sweethearts; (2) 
Dr. Fiel, the doctor who said that there were no hematomas on any part 
of Rosemarie’s body, indicating that there was no force inflicted upon 
her; and, (3) Manoline, a young and naïve witness, whose testimony in 
court deserves full credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>    </p>
  <p>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for the appellee, 
argues
 that the trial court did not commit any error in giving credence to the
 testimony of the prosecution witnesses. The OSG avers that the 
seemingly unnatural response of Rosemarie after the rape should not 
affect her credibility as there is no standard set of behavior when one 
is confronted by a startling experience. It also emphasizes that the 
absence of any hematoma or any external sign of injury does not 
necessarily negate rape. It dismisses appellant’s contention that 
Rosemarie and he were sweethearts and even if they were indeed 
sweethearts, this does not necessarily mean appellant did not rape her. 
There are such things as marital and date rapes. Finally, the OSG argues
 that penetration from behind was not sexually impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Time and again, the Court has consistently followed three 
guiding 
principles in reviewing rape cases: (1) an accusation of rape can be 
made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is
 even more difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to 
disprove; (2) considering the intrinsic nature of the crime, only two 
persons being usually involved, the testimony of the complainant should 
be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the 
prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit, and cannot be allowed 
to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the 
defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> These
 are the guidelines that we utilized, and we are convinced that the 
present appeal has no merit. </p>
  <p>On the issue concerning the credibility of witnesses, we have
 also 
consistently ruled that it is best left to the trial courts’ 
determination since, more often than not, they are in the unique 
position to physically observe closely the witnesses while testifying, 
an opportunity denied the appellate courts which usually rely on the 
cold pages of the mute records of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 In this case, after observing the complainant, the appellant, and their
 respective witnesses as to their demeanor, gestures, their voices and 
their conduct on the witness stand, the trial judge arrived at a 
favorable assessment of Rosemarie’s testimony. Judge Renato Dacudao 
found her version of the incident to be more credible than that of the 
appellant. On review, we find nothing on record to show that the trial 
judge overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated certain facts and 
circumstances, which if considered would have altered the outcome of the
 case. We find that the trial court’s ruling on the issue of credibility
 worth savoring: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The cold and barren words of the pertinent stenographic 
records, 
heretofore quoted, can hardly present in faithful and genuine 
perspective, the pain, suffering and anguish that were written over the 
face and form of complainant as she related on the witness box, at times
 in halting tones that reek with pathos and anger, the heart-rendering 
story of her ravishment and despoliation by the accused that evening of 
August 13, 1996. Indeed, as the poet says, they breathe truth who 
breathe their words in pain. For throughout her testimony the 
complainant was sobbing and wailing in pain (which, in the perception of
 the Court could not have been a sham or made-up act) when she narrated 
how the accused that evening in question, with his ungovernable libido, 
tiptoed into her makeshift bed, pushed her face down on the bed with his
 powerful hands, and when she slapped him, threatened to kill her and 
told her to shut up, then clamped his hand on her mouth; and then 
proceeded to lock his arms around her neck totally immobilizing her, and
 rendering her hors de combat; after which he pushed down with his feet 
and legs her shorts and panties, and then proceeded to penetrate her 
from behind with his male member. </p>
    <p>It is of course true that the accused’s system is not 
exactly the
 normal way to copulate with a girl, even in a rape. But then truth is 
sometimes stranger than fiction, just as there is method even in 
madness. And, in the case at bench, the Court wishes to point this out, 
indeed the Court must will out with this, that the accused herein was 
literally smirking and smacking, with more than a dash of mischief in 
his eyes, as he sought to regale and tantalize the Court (and the people
 at the gallery, too) with his unusual sexual exhibition, evidently 
relishing and savoring every bit and morsel of his perverted and twisted
 machismo. (Rollo, pp. 133-134). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Appellant’s main defense is the trite “sweetheart theory”. 
In <em>People vs. Domended</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> we said that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“…we cannot imagine that a countrified lass, barely in her 
teens,
 will have the courage to engage in sexual intercourse with her 
middle-aged employer a week after commencing with her employment.”    
</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Similarities of this case to Domended are striking. First, 
both 
complainants were 15-year-old girls who hailed from a distant rural 
area. They went to the city, wanting to try their luck and earn a 
living. Second, complainants were ravished by their middle-aged 
employers barely a week after they commenced their employment. Third, 
appellants in each case averred that the sexual encounters were borne 
out of mutual lust and desire, if not love. In Domended, we struck down 
appellant’s “sweetheart theory”. We can do no less in this case. 
</p>
  <p>For, the contention of appellant that he and Rosemarie were 
lovers 
does not square with the facts. It is a worn-out concoction which we 
find all too often in analogous cases. It is aimed to be a cover-up for 
what is now patent sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace. In 
People vs. Cambi<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we said: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Also of additional significance is the fact that the 
appellant 
was Margie’s employer. Thus, appellant’s contention that there was no 
intimidation prior to the commission of the alleged carnal act is simply
 not true. Time and again this Court has held that intimidation must be 
viewed in the light of the victim’s perception and judgment at the time 
of the commission of the crime and not by any hard and fast rule. This 
Court is not blind to Margie’s unfortunate predicament of having been 
subjected to the unbridled lust of one who provided her and her siblings
 with a much needed source of livelihood. That appellant took advantage 
of his moral influence over his fifteen-year old worker cannot be 
denied. We more than understand, we sympathize with the plight of this 
poverty stricken barrio lass who must have agonized over the loss of her
 innocence but also feared the very thought of losing the hand that 
feeds her. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, even if arguendo Rosemarie and appellant were 
indeed 
lovers, such a relationship does not necessarily negate the commission 
of rape. The gravamen of the crime of rape is sexual congress of a man 
with a woman without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 Love is not a license for carnal intercourse through force or 
intimidation. A sweetheart cannot be forced to have sex against her 
will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>Appellant’s reliance on Leticia’s and Avelina’s testimonies 
as well
 as that of his son, Manoline, does not serve him well. On Leticia’s 
testimony, the trial court keenly observed: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To be sure, the Court had taken stock of the rather 
unfavorable 
[to the complainant] testimony of Leticia Agustin. But Leticia Agustin 
is definitely not a loyal aunt, one who is expected to root for 
Rosemarie or to be protective of her. For in her very straitened 
circumstances (Julie Fe Monopolio told the Court that during their brief
 sojourn with Leticia, she and Rosemarie were given food but once a 
day), it is quite understandable that Leticia would wish to rid herself 
of two additional mouths to feed and two free lodgers in her shanty, 
whilst pining for a slice of the cake which a settlement of the rape 
case would fetch (The evidence shows that she went with the accused’s 
son, “Boy” to Zamboanga to work out some kind of settlement of the rape 
case with Rosemarie’s parents, offering to that end the sum of 
P50,000.00). At the same time, the Court can not be unaware of the fact 
that Leticia was a former employee of the accused, and that she must owe
 him gratitude. In any event, the Court noticed that Rosemarie’s mother 
and Leticia, who are virtual look-alikes, traded baleful glances after 
Leticia stepped down from the witness box. Obviously there was no love 
lost between the two sisters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Needless to stress, in Manoline’s testimony we see a young 
son 
trying to protect his father and keep him away from jail. How and why in
 so short time as one week, with long working hours, the private 
complainant would find time to ingratiate herself as a new “mother” to 
appellant’s children had been left unexplained. This tale is unworthy of
 belief. </p>
  <p>Appellant asserts that the absence of any physical injury on 
the 
victim meant that no force or intimidation was employed on Rosemarie. 
However, force and intimidation depend on perception. What may 
constitute force or intimidation differs from person to person. 
Rosemarie categorically testified that she resisted appellant, but he 
was just too strong. He also rendered her immobile. No doubt he enjoyed 
moral ascendancy as employer over his new employee. Aside from this, he 
threatened to kill her. These circumstances more than suffice to sustain
 a finding that force and intimidation existed in this case. Besides, 
the absence of any hematoma or marks on Rosemarie’s body does not mean 
that she consented to the sexual act. Much less could one draw from that
 negative fact the conclusion that no force or intimidation was used 
against her. Proof of injuries is not indispensable in prosecutions for 
rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> 
<em>In People vs. Dreu,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> we held: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is of no moment either that the medical certificate 
fails to 
show that Josephine suffered any contusion or abrasion. Although the 
results of a medical examination may be considered strong evidence to 
prove that the victim was raped, such evidence is not indispensable in 
establishing accused-appellant’s guilt or innocence…    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Rosemarie’s inability to scream to get the attention of her 
sister 
did not positively indicate willingness on her part to have sex with 
appellant. As she claimed, appellant was nearly suffocating her with a 
pillow and she was stricken with fear, which paralyzed and silenced her 
to suffer rather than risk more harm. </p>
  <p>Appellant further claims that Rosemarie’s silence after the 
rape 
was unnatural and indicated her consent to the sexual act. Nothing is 
farther from the truth. Rosemarie’s reactions could indicate shock and 
fear. But note that immediately thereafter she reported the incident to 
her aunt. The very same day, they reported the rape to the 
<em>barangay</em>
 officials and to the police. She also willingly subjected herself to a 
medical examination. That she remained motionless after the rape and 
watched appellant dress did not mean consent. After having just 
undergone a traumatic experience she was naturally unnerved, even 
shocked to inaction. We have noted in a number of cases that there is no
 uniform reaction for persons subjected to sexual assault. Some may 
shout, some may faint, some may be shocked into insensibility, while 
others may openly welcome the intrusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>    </p>
  <p>We cannot likewise give any merit to appellant’s contention 
that 
Rosemarie’s testimony is inconsistent and incredible. We find her 
testimony straightforward, spontaneous and consistent even in the face 
of a long and grueling interrogation from the defense counsel. The rule 
is that when a rape victim’s testimony is straightforward and candid, 
unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed by inconsistencies or 
contradictions in its material points, it must be given full faith and 
credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>Appellant’s assertion that it is impossible for Rosemarie to 
have 
slapped him after he had held her hands is misleading. What she said is 
that she slapped him after she was awakened by his unwanted touch and 
before she was rendered immobile.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Contrary to appellant’s defense, having carnal knowledge of a
 woman
 from behind without the latter’s consent is not impossible. Complainant
 testified that appellant mounted her and held her in such a way as to 
render her immobile, removed her shorts and undergarments and forcefully
 spread her legs with the use of his feet and proceeded to insert his 
penis into her private parts from behind. She testified that she was 
penetrated for she felt stinging pain on that part of her 
anatomy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 Moreover, the prosecution presented Dr. Fiel, who testified that the 
victim suffered several lacerations on her private parts. They show that
 she had indeed been sexually abused, but more important, that she 
struggled against forcible coitus. These facts were not successfully 
rebutted by appellant. </p>
  <p>Appellant’s contention that it would have been impossible for
 him 
to rape Rosemarie without waking up Julie Fe who was sleeping nearby 
also deserves scant consideration. Julie Fe explained she was in a deep 
slumber due to lack of sleep and fatigue the previous days. We also note
 that even appellant admits that it was possible for him and Rosemarie 
to engage in sex without disturbing Julie Fe. The smallness of the 
make-shift room did not mean that rape was impossible. Lust is no 
respecter of time or place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Rape may be committed in the most unlikely 
places such as a small room where other family members also 
slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>In sum, we agree with the trial court in giving credence to 
the 
testimony of Rosemarie and the prosecution witnesses. Given the natural 
modesty and shyness of a 15-year-old barrio lass, in our view, Rosemarie
 would not fabricate a rape charge, expose herself to the rigors and 
intrusions of a medical examination, as well as the scandal of a public 
trial, if said charge were not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 Appellant also failed to establish any reason or motive why Rosemarie 
would falsely testify against him. Absent any showing of ill motive on 
her part, Rosemarie’s testimony deserves utmost weight and 
credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> And 
considering all the evidence on record, we agree that the appellant is 
guilty as charged. </p>
  <p>However, we note that the trial court awarded P100,000 for 
moral 
and exemplary damages. This is not accurate, for the trial court should 
have specified which amount referred to what damages. Pursuant to 
current jurisprudence, as civil indemnity, P50,000 should be awarded in a
 rape case, but moral damages should also be awarded to the victim in 
the amount of P50,000. To discourage the abuse of young girls, 
especially by their elders, such as employers, the amount of P25,000 
could also be awarded as exemplary damages. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the decision of the 
Regional Trial 
Court of Cebu City in Criminal Case No. CBU-41810, finding 
accused-appellant MANUEL YLANAN guilty of rape is AFFIRMED with 
MODIFICATION. He is sentenced to reclusion perpetua, and ordered to pay 
the victim, Rosemarie Monopolio, the following: (1) civil indemnity of 
P50,000; (2) moral damages fixed at P50,000; and (3) exemplary damages 
in the amount of P25,000, together with the costs. </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED. </p>
