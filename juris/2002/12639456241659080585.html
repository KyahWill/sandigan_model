				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Before the Court
on automatic review is the conviction of appellant Jethro Nierras for the crime
of Kidnapping for Ransom, penalized under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7659
with Death. His co-accused, Benjamin Nolasco and Ernesto Vallejo, were
acquitted on grounds of reasonable doubt and lack of evidence, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Information
filed against these three (3) accused, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-49442,
charged them with the commission of the crime, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“That on or about the 21st day of

feloniously kidnap and detain one JOSE LI Y TAN, for the purpose of extorting
P1.5 Million from the family of Mr. Li, thereby depriving said JOSE LI Y TAN of
his liberty against his will.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">CONTRARY TO LAW.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">During
arraignment, all three (3) accused pleaded not guilty to the charge, after
which, the prosecution and the defense presented their respective evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The victim in
this case is 60-year old Filipino-Chinese businessman Jose Li y Tan. Unlike
other unfortunate kidnap victims, Li managed to escape his abductors, and lived
to tell the tale. He narrated that at around 7:15 a.m. of September 21, 1995,
he was walking along A. Mabini St. in Caloocan City when three (3) armed men
waylaid him and forcibly pulled him inside a gray-colored car. He described his
abductors as dark-skinned and wearing baseball caps and dark glasses. Inside
the car, the accused demanded Three Million Pesos (<s>P</s>3,000.000.00);
otherwise, he will be killed. The vehicle then proceeded to travel along the
highway and after five (5) hours, stopped for refueling. Although his face was
covered with a hat, he was able to see as the hat sometimes fell off. After a
lengthy travel, he was brought into a shanty where he was kept for fourteen
(14) days. During his captivity, he was being fed, and was not blindfolded. He
was also asked to sign and fill up three (3) blank cheques that appellant
Nierras took from his pocket, in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>100,000.00),
One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>150,000.00) and Two Hundred Thousand
Pesos (<s>P</s>200,000.00). One day, at around 5:00 a.m., he saw his chance to
escape when he noticed that the door was unlocked and his abductors were not
around. He opened the door and ran until he saw a passenger jeepney that
brought him to Tarlac. The day was October 5, 1995. He then went to the house
of his brother-in-law Uy Eng Chong where he called up his wife, Felicing.
Accompanied by Capt. Ricardo Martin of the Task Force Dragon, his wife went to
Tarlac to fetch him but he opted to stay behind because he was weak and wanted
to rest. Then, on October 9, 1995, his wife and Capt. Martin again fetched and
brought him to Camp Crame where he gave his sworn statement. Finally, on
October 11, 1995, he went back to Camp Crame together with his wife, and son
Richard Li. There, he identified the three (3) accused, Jethro Nierras,
Benjamin Nolasco and Ernesto Vallejo, as the malefactors.</span><a style="" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Carlos Aquino, a
watchman posted at the Caloocan City Hospital located in A. Mabini St.,
corroborated the fact of Li’s abduction, as well as the identity of appellant
Nierras. Aquino recounted that at around 7:15 a.m. of September 21, 1995, he
was doing a roving inspection when he noticed a “suspicious-looking” man in
front of the Iglesia ni Kristo church, about fifteen (15) meters away from
where he was. Thereafter, the man, who was holding a gun, blocked another
person who was walking in front of the church, and forced said person to get
inside a gray Toyota Corolla. After several seconds, the car, which had two (2)
more people inside, left. He then called the police who arrived with the wife
and son of the person abducted whom he later learned to be Jose Li. He told
them what he saw and they eventually went to the Northern Police District
Command to have the incident entered on the police blotter. He also executed a
sworn statement in Camp Crame on October 11, 1995, and identified appellant
Nierras as the person who forced Jose Li to get inside the car.</span><a style="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile,
Richard Li, son of Jose Li, testified that in the morning of September 21,
1995, his brother informed him that their father was kidnapped. At around 3:00
p.m. of the same day, he received a call from his father’s kidnappers who
demanded a ransom of four (4) million pesos, and warned him not to tell the
authorities or they will harm his father. Richard Li told the caller that they
do not have such amount on hand but given several days, they can raise the
amount. A few hours after, or at 5:00 p.m., the caller phoned again and asked
for an advance of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>500,000.00), to be
placed inside a garbage can at the Caloocan City Hall, which they did. After
waiting for several hours, no one came to pick up the money so they went home
and retrieved the money. The caller contacted him again the next day and told
him that he was not able to get the money because there were policemen in the
area, and that the ransom money was again raised to Four Million Pesos (<s>P</s>4,000,000.00).
The day after, or on September 23, 1995, he was instructed by the kidnapper to
drive his owner-type jeep and bring Two Million Pesos (<s>P</s>2,000,000.00) to
Moncada, Tarlac. When he replied that he couldn’t raise such amount at such
short notice, the caller got angry and cursed him, but later, it was agreed
that he would bring the money to Moncada the following Monday or Tuesday thereafter.
After several calls and negotiations with the kidnapper, the ransom money was
reduced to One Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (<s>P</s>1,500,000.00), to
be placed inside a garbage can at the Malabon Zoo on October 10, 1995. At that
time, his father had already escaped, and his talks with the kidnappers were
being made in coordination with the Task Force Dragon. On October 10, 1995, he
did as he was instructed, and the next day, he was informed that his father’s
abductors have already been apprehended. Together with his father, mother and
other brother, they went to Camp Crame where his father identified the three
(3) accused in a police line-up.</span><a style="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Several police
officers, on the other hand, testified on the entrapment operation sprung on
appellant Nierras and his co-accused Benjamin Nolasco. Posing as a houseboy in
the Li household, Sr. Inspector Ricardo Martin, then Assistant Operations
Officer of the Task Force Dragon, testified that he assisted and acted as the
close-in security of the Li family during the negotiations with the kidnappers,
instructing the Li family to keep Jose Li’s escape under wraps. He also
prepared the fake or boodle money which he placed inside a Zesto box, to be
delivered to the designated place on October 10, 1995. He monitored the entire
sting operation at the Li residence through his radio, and he stated that they
went through the entrapment operation despite Jose Li’s escape because they
believed that the kidnappers had a “problem” and were not aware of the escape.</span><a style="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">P/Supt. Charles
Calima was the supervisor of the entrapment and arresting team;</span><a style="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Sr. Insp.
Jerito Avela Adique was the team leader;</span><a style="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">and SPO2
Ernesto Arcilla was a member of the Task Force Dragon who was given
instructions by P/Supt. Calima to arrest the suspects.</span><a style="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The three
(3) officers, together with other police personnel, were strategically
positioned within the pick- up point. P/Supt. Calima was inside a vehicle
parked 200 meters away from the garbage pile where the money was left. Sr.
Insp. Adique who was posted 25 meters away from the site, saw a Toyota Corona
with license plate no. UCM-717 parked on the opposite side of the road at
around 11:00 p.m. After a few minutes, two (2) men approached the site and
picked up the boodle money. Immediately, they arrested the two (2) men, who
later turned out to be appellant Nierras and Benjamin Nolasco, and confiscated
from appellant Nierras, Jose Li’s calling card. The two (2) were then subjected
to a tactical interrogation for 30 minutes inside a L-300 van, and according to
SPO2 Arcilla, appellant Nierras admitted his complicity in the crime, and
pinpointed to his co-accused Ernesto Vallejo and a certain “Lirio” as his
cronies, and “Mike” as the brains. Ernesto Vallejo was subsequently arrested in
his residence in Valenzuela on a follow-up operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Criminal
Investigator Carmelo Catbagan was tasked with the investigation of the case. On
October 11, 1995, at around 10 p.m., he took the sworn statement of appellant
Nierras wherein the latter admitted his participation in the crime, and
implicated the other two (2) co-accused. He also testified that he informed
appellant Nierras of his constitutional rights, but despite this, the latter
waived his right to counsel. Nevertheless, upon the request of Chief Legal
Officer, Aurelio Trampe, Jr. of Task Force Dragon, Atty. Geminiano Yabut, Jr.
assisted appellant Nierras.</span><a style="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Interestingly,
the defense of the three (3) accused were mere bare denials of their
involvement in the crime. They did not present any evidence as to their whereabouts
on September 21, 1995, the day the kidnapping was committed. Instead, appellant
Nierras and Benjamin Nolasco, as well as their corroborative witness Remedios
Cueva,</span><a style="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">
concentrated on the day of October 10, 1995, the day the two (2) were arrested
and questioned by police operatives, while Ernesto Vallejo’s testimony revolved
on the day he was arrested, October 11, 1995.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Both appellant
Nierras</span><a style="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">and accused Benjamin Nolasco</span><a style="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">substantially
testified that on October 10, 1995, at around 10 p.m., while they were chatting
at the latter’s place of work at a fish compound in Malabon, armed men in
civilian clothes arrived and asked them to get inside their vehicle. They were
eventually brought to Victoria Court in Valenzuela where they were kept apart
and tortured into confession. The next day, they were brought to Camp Crame and
appellant Nierras was made to execute a sworn statement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">For his part,
Ernesto Vallejo related that on October 11<i>, </i>1995, he was in his house in
Valenzuela resting, when members of the Task Force Dragon entered and searched
the premises for shabu. Finding none, he was taken to Camp Crame. There he saw
Benjamin Nolasco for the first time and appellant Nierras whom he knew as they
usually see each other at a taxi wash, both being cab drivers, and it was only
from appellant Nierras that he learned that he was being charged with
kidnapping. They were made to stay in Camp Crame until the next day and it was
then that Jose Li identified them as his abductors.</span><a style="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Weighing the
evidence before it, the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City (Branch 129)
rendered its Decision dated September 4, 1997, convicting appellant Jethro
Nierras of the crime charged, and acquitting Benjamin Nolasco and Ernesto
Vallejo. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“WHEREFORE, premises considered,

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Now before the
Court for review, appellant Nierras submits that the trial court committed the

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Appellant
Nierras assails the trial court for giving weight and credence to the
testimonies of Jose Li and Carlos Aquino, contending that they were
inconsistent, vague and inconclusive. He maintains these witnesses were not
able to positively identify the abductors, more particularly Jose Li, who
admitted in court that he was not able to recognize them because they were
wearing sunglasses and caps.</span><a style="" href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">A review of the testimonies
of these two (2) witnesses, however, does not show any inconsistency, vagueness
or inconclusiveness. In fact, the testimonies of Jose Li and Carlos Aquino
identifying appellant and relating the kidnapping incident were positive,
consistent and categorical. Despite the fact that the abductor was wearing a
baseball cap and sunglasses, still, witness Carlos Aquino testified with
certainty that he was able to identify the person as appellant Nierras, <i>viz.:<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Court finds
no reason to disbelieve or doubt the identification made by Aquino absent any
ill-motive on the latter’s part to falsely testify and implicate a stranger in
such a grave offense, if it were not true. Where there is no evidence to show
that a witness was actuated by improper motive, his identification of appellant
as the perpetrator should be given full faith and credit.</span><a style="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition,
just because the perpetrator was wearing shades and a baseball cap on the day
Jose Li was abducted does not foreclose any other opportunity for Li to see his
face and recognize him. In his testimony, Li related that he was not
blindfolded during his captivity, as his kidnappers fed him.</span><a style="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> Also,
appellant Nierras took the three (3) blank cheques in his pocket and asked him

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Clearly, appellant Nierras’s denials cannot overcome the firm and clear
declarations of Jose Li and Carlos Aquino, identifying him as the abductor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Appellant
Nierras also argues that it was “illogical” for the kidnappers to demand the
ransom money after Jose Li had already escaped; that the kidnappers would have
used a vehicle instead of just walking to the drop-off point; and that
appellant Nierras and Benjamin Nolasco are innocent passers-by who curiously
picked up the Zesto box. These arguments, however, are mere empty conjectures
that do not detract from the fact of the commission of the crime. As stated by
the trial court, <i>viz.:<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial;">“Admittedly, the victim had already
escaped from his kidnappers 5 days before the ransom demand culminated at the
Malabon Zoo on October 10, 1995. Nonetheless, and even though the demanded
ransom turned out to be a dreaded phantom, the fact remains that the
complaining witness was kidnapped not for a joy ride to the far North but for
the purpose of obtaining a huge amount of ransom. Simply stated, the
kidnappers’ naivette <i>(sic) </i>and greed are no reason to downgrade the
seriousness of the indictment.”</span><a style="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Besides, it bears no relevance or weight since the prosecution has
adequately established appellant Nierras’s identity and participation in the
crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Even appellant’s
initial defense of alibi cannot prosper. As earlier noted, his alibi pertains
to October 10, 1995, the day he was allegedly picked up by agents of the Task
Force Dragon, and not September 21, 1995, when Jose Li was abducted. The trial
court rejected his claim as he failed to demonstrate the physical impossibility
of him being at the scene of the crime.</span><a style="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Indeed, as
against the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses, and the
fact that it was not physically impossible for appellant Nierras to be at
Malabon Zoo during the entrapment operation, his alibi cannot be given
credence.</span><a style="" href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: red;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The elements of
the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code,
as amended by R.A. No. 7659 having been sufficiently proven, and appellant
Nierras having been clearly identified, not only by the kidnap victim but also
by other prosecution witnesses, the Court affirms the trial court’s finding of
appellant’s guilt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
