				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is is an automatic review of the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated October 26, 1998, of the Regional Trial Court, Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 32, San Pablo City, finding&nbsp; accused-appellant guilty of the complex crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death and to pay damages to the heirs&nbsp; of the victim Pampilo Aclan.<br><br>Accused-appellant Jimmy Marquez, together with four John Does, was charged with Robbery with Homicide under Art. 294, par. 1, in an information docketed as Criminal Case No. 10069-SP, in which it was alleged —<br><blockquote>That on or about September 22, 1995, in the City of San Pablo, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused above-named, with intent to gain, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away jewelries worth P2.5 million and cash of P300,000.00, Philippine Currency, belonging to one PAMPILO ACLAN, and that in furtherance of and on the occasion of said robbery to accused the taking of said items, accused with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and [shoot] Pampilo Aclan with a gun, with which the accused were then conveniently provided, thereby inflicting mortal wounds upon said offended party which caused his immediate death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant was likewise charged with violation of Presidential Decree No. 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition) under a separate information docketed as Criminal Case No. 10193-SP.<br><br>When arraigned&nbsp; on August 29, 1996, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty, whereupon a joint trial of the two cases was held.<br><br>The prosecution presented four witnesses: Rizza Cervantes and Jerwin Aclan, eyewitnesses; SPO2 Rolito Alinea, the investigating policeman; and Dr. Azucena I. Bandoy, Assistant City Health Officer of San Pablo City, who prepared the Necropsy Report.&nbsp; Their testimonies are as follows:<br><br>The victim, Pampilo Aclan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> was a businessman engaged in the buying and selling of jewelry, for which he had a store in the market of San Pablo City. Before leaving for home at around 5:00 p.m. on September 22, 1995, Aclan placed the jewelry in two (2) boxes. Then, with his son Jerwin<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and salesgirl Rizza Cervantes, he went home carrying the two boxes and a shoulder bag containing cash. The three took a tricycle driven by Jimmy Soriso.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Aclan, who held the two boxes, occupied the main seat inside the tricycle, while Rizza sat on the small seat to the left of the main seat.&nbsp; Jerwin took a seat behind Jimmy.&nbsp; As the tricycle was negotiating a curve near the entrance to their residence in Francisco Terrace, it was blocked by five armed men, who ordered the driver to stop.&nbsp; Stating that it was a hold-up, accused-appellant pointed his gun at Aclan and demanded that he hand over the bag.&nbsp; When Aclan refused to part with the bag, one of the hold-uppers grabbed it, and a struggle ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Rizza tried to help the victim keep the bag, but one of the hold-uppers pushed her inside the tricycle and succeeded in getting the bag.&nbsp; When the victim tried to run after the hold-upper, accused-appellant shot him.&nbsp; The victim fell to the ground, and the hold-uppers fled with the bag and the two boxes on board the tricycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Jerwin Aclan testified that a hold-upper poked a fan knife (balisong) at his back.&nbsp; When his attacker was distracted, he punched him, but in the course of the fight he was stabbed on the right arm.&nbsp; Jerwin said he ran to the nearest store, leaving his father and one of the hold-uppers fighting for the possession of the bag. Then a shot rang out.&nbsp; When he turned around, Jerwin said he saw accused-appellant with his gun, standing over the fallen body of his father.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then fled on board the tricycle with his companions, carrying with them the two boxes containing the jewelry and his father’s bag.&nbsp; Jerwin rushed to his father and, with the help of his elder brother Jomar, took him to the hospital.&nbsp; However, Pampilo Aclan died shortly after.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Rolito Alinea, leader of the investigating team, testified that accused-appellant was apprehended in Batangas City and taken to the Batangas City Provincial Command where he was identified by both Rizza Cervantes and Jerwin Aclan from a police line-up, consisting of accused-appellant and four civilian employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Azucena I. Bandoy prepared a Necropsy Report (Exh.

On September 18, 1995, he said he went to his brother Arcadio Marquez’s house in Taguig, Metro Manila to borrow money because he needed capital in buying and selling of fruits. Arcadio allegedly told him that the money would come from his wife’s salary which would be paid on September 24, 1995 yet.&nbsp; Accused-appellant, therefore, decided to stay and in the meantime help his brother in the construction of a septic tank. Jimmy Marquez stayed in his brother’s house from September 18 to September 25, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> After receiving the money from his brother, accused-appellant said he left for Mabini, Batangas.<br><br>To reinforce his alibi, accused-appellant claimed that while in Taguig on September 22, 1995, the date of the crime in question, he in fact participated in the settlement of a case between the spouses Marayan. Although he was not a member of the Barangay Council, accused-appellant said he acted as one of the witnesses in the settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Barangay officials and other individuals who, together with accused-appellant, claimed to have participated in the settlement of dispute in their barangay corroborated accused-appellant’s alibi. Cesar Gobrin, purok leader and member of the Lupong Tagapamayapa of Western Bicutan, Taguig, and Clemente de Latade testified that accused-appellant was present during the signing of the settlement between the Marayan spouses.&nbsp; In fact, he said accused-appellant was the only person who was not a member of the team in their place who signed as a witness to the document.&nbsp; However, Gobrin admitted that there was no logbook where settlements are entered but only a compilation of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On the other hand, Mariano Aclan testified that accused-appellant talked to him on October 26, 1997 and asked him to testify that accused-appellant was in Taguig on September 25, 1995.&nbsp; Mariano Aclan said he saw the document, which he signed, only when he was brought to Court when he attended the hearing prior to the one wherein he gave his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Rodolfo Guiyab, barangay chairman of Western Bicutan, Taguig, testified that the alleged document of settlement in the case in which accused-appellant allegedly acted as a witness, was submitted to him unsigned by the secretary, Jesus Sarcilla.&nbsp; From September 22, 1995 up to the time he testified, Guiyab said he never checked his office files to see if such a document had been filed in the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Jesus Sarcilla, the barangay secretary, identified a document as the document of settlement between the Marayan spouses.&nbsp; He said the document was executed by the parties on September 26, 1995 and that he signed it.&nbsp; He gave a photocopy of the document to accused-appellant’s brother upon the latter’s&nbsp; request.&nbsp; However, Sarcilla could not vouch for the integrity of the document as he could not recall when he parted with the original copy of the subject document nor the person to whom he gave it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Arcadio Marquez, accused-appellant’s elder brother, also testified to corroborate accused-appellant’s alibi.&nbsp; He confirmed accused-appellant’s testimony regarding his participation in the repair of the septic tank and in the settlement of a case in their barangay between a couple as well as on the alleged physical abuse of his brother by the Batangas City police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He explained that although, to his knowledge, other cases for frustrated homicide had been filed against his brother by Luisito Dueñas in Sariaya, Quezon and for murder by Virgilio Zaballero in Lucena City, the cases had been dismissed either because of desistance or because of failure of the complainant to appear at the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Atty. Mario Panganiban testified that he was the lawyer who assisted the accused-appellant while the latter was detained at the PNP office in Batangas City. He claimed that accused-appellant had complained of having been maltreated by the policemen, although the accused-appellant did not name those who had maltreated him.&nbsp; Atty. Panganiban said that although he told accused-appellant to see a physician for a physical examination, he did not know whether this was done by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After trial, judgment was rendered finding accused-appellant guilty of robbery with homicide in Criminal Case No. 10069-SP but acquitting him of the charge of violation of P.D. No. 1866 in Criminal Case No. 10193-SP.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the trial court’s decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the court finds the accused JIMMY MARQUEZ y BACAY guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide defined and penalized under Article 294, par. 5, and Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code and he is hereby sentenced the supreme and capital penalty of DEATH, with costs.<br><br>He is further sentenced to pay the heirs of the deceased:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">(a) </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">The sum of P50,00.00 as death indemnity;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The sum of P2 million representing stolen cash and the cost of the pieces of jewelry;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(c) </td> <td><div align="justify">The sum of P250,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(d) </td> <td><div align="justify">The sum of P80,000.00 representing burial and other expenses of the victim.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>For failure of the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused in Crim. Case No. 10193-SP for Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition, above-named accused JIMMY MARQUEZ Y BACAY is pronounced ACQUITTED, without costs.<br><br>As the four (4) John Does have not been identified as of this time, the prosecution arm is hereby ordered to take extra effort in bringing to the bar of justice the said four (4) suspects to be dealt with accordingly.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE AND SENTENCING HIM TO THE PENALTY OF DEATH.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RELYING ON THE UNRELIABLE TESTIMONY OF TWO (2) BIASED WITNESSES.</li></ol></blockquote>As a preliminary matter, accused-appellant says that the use of DNA testing would prove his innocence.&nbsp; The fact, however, is that there was no DNA test to prove accused-appellant’s innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the evidence on record fully supports the trial court’s judgment of conviction.&nbsp; A conviction for robbery with homicide requires proof of the following elements: (a) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons or with force upon things; (b) the property taken belongs to another; (c) the taking be done with <i>animus lucrandi</i> (intent to gain); and (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, homicide in its generic sense was committed. The offense becomes the special complex crime of robbery with homicide under Art. 294 (1) of Revised Penal Code if the victim is killed on the occasion or by reason of the robbery.<br><br>Accused-appellant sought to discredit the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses Rizza Cervantes, salesgirl of the victim, and Jerwin Aclan, the victim’s son, and by offering denial and alibi as defense.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s claims are unconvincing.&nbsp; In challenging the finding of the trial court as to the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses, the burden is on the accused to show that the testimonies are untrustworthy.&nbsp; This Court has consistently ruled that in the absence of any fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been misconstrued by the trial court, appellate courts will not set aside the evaluation of the evidence made by the trial court considering that it has heard the witnesses and observed their deportment during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this case, there is no showing that the trial court overlooked substantial facts so as to justify this Court in setting aside the evaluation of the evidence made by the trial court.<br><br>Indeed, prosecution witnesses positively and categorically identified accused-appellant as one of the five armed men who held them up on September 22, 1995 and killed the victim. Rizza Cervantes testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Alright, you claimed that you were [held-up] when you were on board the tricycle, please tell the Court what transpired on that particular date and time when you were [held-up] while on board a tricycle?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">We were about to go home and we were [held-up] at San Francisco Terrace by five (5) persons and I recognized only one among them, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">. . . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

Yet accused-appellant does not say his brother’s testimony should not be given weight.<br><br>Indeed, the relationship <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> of the prosecution witnesses to the victim does not give rise to a presumption of bias nor does it <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> impair their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> There is no legal provision which disqualifies relatives of the victim of a crime from testifying, if they are competent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> On the contrary, a relative like Jerwin Aclan should be considered especially qualified because he has an interest in securing the conviction of those who are truly guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> What will it profit him if the one convicted is innocent?<br><br>Indeed, in the absence of proof that a witness is moved by improper motive, it is presumed that he was not so moved and, therefore, his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> That presumption has not been overcome in this case, thus Jerwin’s identification of accused-appellant as the killer of his father stands.&nbsp; It should also be stressed that the motive for the killing is not important when there is no doubt as to the identity of the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Here, however, the motive is plain:&nbsp; the victim was killed to rob him of his jewelry and his money.<br><br>Accused-appellant likewise contends that the mention of the mole on his chin as an identifying mark during the trial of the case was an afterthought since no such mention was made when the prosecution eyewitnesses identified him in the police line-up.&nbsp; As the Solicitor-General contends, however —<br><blockquote>The mole on the chin is just one of appellant’s distinctive features.&nbsp; It is not constitutive of his physical appearance.&nbsp; What is significant is that appellant was positively and categorically identified by the prosecution witnesses as the gunwielder.&nbsp; Appellant need not be described in every detail.&nbsp; The main substance of the testimony of Rizza Cervantes and Jerwin Aclan that they saw accused-appellant shoot the victim remains untouched and unaffected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant also questions the prosecution’s non-presentation of Jimmy Soriso, the tricycle driver.&nbsp; He contends that this must be because his testimony would be adverse if produced.&nbsp; The prosecution evidence, however, was more than sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, the question is not one of number, but of the quality of the testimonies offered.<br><br>In truth, it is the testimonies of the defense witnesses, despite their number, that the Court finds not credible.&nbsp; Most of them merely repeated in court what they had been instructed by Arcadio Marquez, accused-appellant’s brother.&nbsp; This is fairly evident from the following testimonies of the defense witnesses:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><u>Testimony of Cesar Gobrin</u>:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td

by clear and convincing evidence, as in this case, are negative and self-serving, and cannot be given greater evidentiary weight over the positive testimonies of credible witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It has been held that where an accused’s alibi is only confirmed by close relatives, who induced others to testify on something they knew nothing about, such denial deserves scant consideration, especially in the face of affirmative testimonies of credible prosecution witnesses as to his presence in the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

provides that “[t]he penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, where by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed. . .” shall be imposed.&nbsp; In this case, in sentencing accused-appellant to death for the crime of robbery with homicide, the trial court took into account the aggravating circumstance of commission of the crime by a band and/or armed malefactors.&nbsp; However, this circumstance was not alleged in the information filed against accused-appellant.&nbsp; Rule 110, §8 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (effective December 1, 2000), now provides:<br><blockquote><i>Designation of the offense.</i> -- The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omission constituting the offense, <u>and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances</u>.&nbsp; If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.

Similarly, as there is no uniform amount for the award of moral damages in cases for robbery with homicide but, considering the circumstances of this case as already discussed, the amount awarded to the heirs of Pampilo Aclan should be reduced to P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In accordance with <i>People v.
