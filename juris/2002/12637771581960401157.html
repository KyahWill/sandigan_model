<blockquote><u>“Criminal Cases No.
5059-98-C and 6060-98-C<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sometime in February 1996, Marilyn Bernardo, who was then fifteen
(15) years old, and her eleven-year brother Jose Bernardo were entrusted by
their mother to the care of appellant, their mother’s godson.  Their mother left their house in
Centerville, Calamba, Laguna to visit her relatives in Batangas.  Their father was not living with them,
having separated from their mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Around 1:00 o’clock in the morning, Marilyn, who was then sleeping
in her mother’s room together with her younger brother Jose, was roused from
her sleep when she felt somebody, who turned out to be appellant, touching her
body.  Appellant threatened Marilyn not
to move or shout or tell anyone what was happening or else he would shoot
her.  Marilyn felt a gun pointed at her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellant inserted his finger into Marilyn’s private part and
ordered her to remove her clothes.  Out
of fear, Marilyn removed her clothing.  When appellant went on top of her, Marilyn tried to resist by boxing
appellant but she was eventually overpowered by the former who succeeded in
inserting his penis into her organ.  The
frightened victim felt pain and could only cry as she was being defiled by appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Jose was awakened by the resistance put up by Marilyn and saw
appellant on top of [his] sister.  He
was however too afraid to do anything because appellant threatened to kill him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Before leaving, appellant warned Marilyn and Jose not to tell anyone
otherwise he would kill them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When her mother arrived in the afternoon of the following day,
Marilyn did not report the incident because she was frightened of appellant’s
threat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This sexual outrage was repeated sometime in March 1997 when at
around 2:00 o’clock in the morning, appellant entered Marilyn’s room, poked
something at her back, and warned her that if she shouted, he would shoot
her.  Appellant then inserted his finger
into her private part.  Marilyn boxed
appellant and pleaded with him.   Appellant ignored her plea and went on top of her saying, ‘Umayos
ka, umayos ka’.  Notwithstanding the
resistance put up by Marilyn, appellant succeeded in consummating his lust.  Before leaving, appellant warned Marilyn not
to tell anyone, otherwise he would kill her and her family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Again, Jose was awakened by the resistance put up by [his] sister
and tried to leave the room.  Appellant
pulled his arms and told him to stay.  Frightened and intimidated, he went back to sleep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The siblings’ mother was not in their house when appellant
repeated his sexual assault on Marilyn.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sometime in the early part of 1998, Marilyn revealed to her mother
that she was sexually assaulted by appellant.  Ruben Cabatbat, a barriomate and a fellow member of the victim’s mother
in a religious organization, learned about the incident from the victim and
assisted her and her mother in prosecuting appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On June 15, 1998, Marilyn was examined by Dr. Lorna P. Sta.
Maria.  The medical examination revealed
that Marilyn’s hymen had ‘old-healed lacerations at 3 o’clock and 6 o’clock
position.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On June 18, 1998, Marilyn was emboldened to report to the
authorities the sexual assaults committed against her by appellant after
learning that Jennifer Fernandez had already filed a similar case against
appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>“Criminal Case No.
6060-98-C<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Around 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon of March 25, 1998, Jennifer
Fernandez was on her way to school at Pulo National High School when she saw
appellant waiting for her at the corner of Centerville which was near her house
in Barangay Paciano Rizal, Calamba, Laguna.  Appellant told Jennifer to go with him.  When Jennifer refused, appellant threatened her by saying that something
would happen to her.  Frightened,
Jennifer went with appellant who held her arms.  Jennifer tried to resist by boxing appellant to no avail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellant forced Jennifer to board a passenger jeep where they
were the only passengers.  They alighted
at Parian, Calamba, Laguna, where a tricycle was already waiting for them.  Jennifer was made to board the tricycle
which brought them to Riverview Hotel.  At the hotel premises, appellant left her inside the tricycle.  Jennifer did not run nor shout as she was
very frightened of appellant.  She also
heard appellant telling the tricycle driver to guard her otherwise he would
hold the driver accountable. </blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellant subsequently returned and dragged Jennifer inside one of
the rooms of the hotel.  Once inside the
room, appellant ordered Jennifer to undress.  When she refused, appellant slapped her three times and threatened her,
‘Kung hindi ka papayag, papatayin kita.’  Frightened Jennifer undressed and appellant kissed her private
parts.  Jennifer tried to resist by
boxing appellant.  She also cried and
pleaded with appellant to desist from what he was doing. Appellant responded by
boxing Jennifer on the stomach, causing the latter to twist in pain.  Appellant then mounted her and inserted his
manhood into her private part.  After
appellant had ejaculated inside Jennifer, he took a towel and wiped the semen
on his organ.  He told Jennifer to
dress-up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After appellant and Jennifer had left the room and were outside of
the hotel, Jennifer ran away and boarded a jeep.  She proceeded to her school where her crying drew queries from
her classmates but she did not reveal to them the reason for her tears as she
was afraid of the threat made by appellant.  Jennifer went home at around 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon and just
stayed in her room where she continued crying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sometime in the early part of 1998, Jennifer revealed to her
parents that she was sexually assaulted by appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On June 2, 1998, Dr. Charisa Juangco examined Jennifer.  The medical examination revealed that
Jennifer had an old healed laceration at 5:00 o’clock and 7:00 o’clock position.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On June 3, 1998, Jennifer reported her ordeal to the
authorities.  She was afraid to report
it earlier because appellant threatened to kill her and her family.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><u>Version of the Defense<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied the charges.  Before the RTC, he testified that Marilyn Bernardo had filed the cases
against him as an offshoot of a quarrel.  That quarrel was supposedly between his wife, Fely; and Marilyn’s
mother, Prescilla Bernardo<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> -- a
preacher herself, who belonged to the same religious group as he.  He said that when <span style="">Prescilla advised him to leave Fely, he ignored said advice and
thereafter absented himself from the preaching activities of the group.  His acts allegedly enraged Prescilla, who
then concocted the charges against him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He averred further that he hardly left his

<p class="BODY">As regards the rape charge of Jennifer Fernandez, appellant
alleged that on March 25, 1998, he attended the birthday party of his neighbor
and friend, Mario Manaig.  He was in
Mario’s house from ten o’clock in the morning of that day until two o’clock the
next morning, March 26, 1998.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of appellant was corroborated by his wife, Fely
Mendoza; as well as by Mario Manaig and Cecille Manaig.  Cecille and Fely further testified that
Jennifer Fernandez confided to them that she had been raped by her own brother,
Ricardo Salazar.  Allegedly, she did not
file a complaint against him for fear that he might eject her from his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another witness, Maria Lydia Borlongan, resident manager of the
Riverview Resort and Hotel, testified that during her 24-hour duty on March 25,
1998, she could not recall any rape that had taken place in one of the hotel
rooms.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Trial Court’s Ruling<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The RTC gave credence to the clear and positive testimonies of
private complainants.  It said:
“Complaining witnesses in the cases at bar are both minors x x x [a]nd this
circumstance, standing alone, overwhelms the constitutional presumption of innocence
in favor of the accused.  And ranged
against the positive clear testimonies of the complaining witnesses, the
defense of alibi and fabrication invoked by the accused cannot hope to
succeed.”<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Issues<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Brief, appellant submits the following assignment of
errors for our consideration:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“I.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred in holding
that the fact of minority of both complaining witnesses in Criminal Cases Nos.
6059-98-C, 6060-98-C and 6061-98-C standing alone, overwhelms the
constitutional presumption of the innocence of the accused.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“II.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred in holding
that the delay of the disclosure of the complaining witnesses to disclose the
fact of rape cannot reverse the wheels of guilt of the accused.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“III.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred when it failed
to consider and appreciate evidence for the appellant that the incident of rape
against Jennifer Fernandez was allegedly committed inside a hotel, or that the
alleged assault against Marilyn Bernardo was committed inside a room in the
company of the victim’s brother.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“IV.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred in holding
that the inconsistency in the sworn statement of Marilyn Buno Bernardo against
her declaration in Court do[es] not unnecessarily discredit her.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“V.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred in holding
that appellant is guilty of the crime punished under Article 335 in Criminal
Case No. 6061-98-C in the judgment received on March 31, 2001.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“VI.</p>

<blockquote>“The trial court gravely erred in holding
[that] the appellant is guilty of the crime of rape as defined and penalized
under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in
Criminal Case No. 6060-98-C in the judgment received on April 6, 2000.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the main, this Court is being asked to reverse the lower court
on two grounds: (1) the incredible testimony of complainants and (2) the
prosecution’s failure to rebut the constitutional presumption of innocence in
favor of appellant.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>The Court’s Ruling<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is partly meritorious.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><u>First
Issue:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top: 0in;"><i style=""><u>Credibility of Private Complainants<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant faults private complainants for their long delay in
reporting the alleged crimes.  He
asserts that it was unnatural for Marilyn Bernardo to wait for two years after
the supposed first rape before filing the charges.  He also casts doubts on her credibility by citing material
inconsistencies between her Sworn Statement and her <span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">testimony.  </span>Finally, he
contends that it was improbable for him to have raped Marilyn inside a bedroom
she shared with her brother.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.  When it
comes to the issue of credibility of witnesses, we generally defer to the
assessment of the trial court, because it had the singular opportunity to
observe their demeanor.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, its findings are conclusive, unless it is shown that certain facts of
substance and value have been plainly overlooked.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><sup>
</sup>  In the present case, a review of
the records and the transcripts shows that the RTC had ample opportunity to
examine the testimony of the complaining witnesses.  Appellant has not given us sufficient reason to overturn the
lower court’s factual findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the prosecution of rape cases, it is well-settled
that long silence and delay in reporting the crime cannot detract from the
victim's credibility,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><sup>
</sup>especially where the delay is satisfactorily explained.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In Jennifer’s case, reporting the crime four months after it
occurred is hardly unreasonable.  Meanwhile, in the case of Marilyn, the fact that she waited two years
before she reported the dastardly deeds was justified by her fear.  She explained as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“</span>FISCAL: <span style=""> </span></blockquote>

appellant wants us to disregard the testimony of Marilyn because of the alleged
“substantial inconsistency” between her Sworn Statement and her open court
testimony.  In the former, she alleged

is misplaced.  That case pertains to two
different Sworn Statements executed a day apart.  The first affidavit charged the accused with attempted rape; the
second, with consummated rape.  The
latter Statement resulted in the filing of an amended Complaint changing the
charge from attempted to consummated rape.  No plausible explanation was offered by the victim for the sudden
change.  Moreover, the physical evidence
did not corroborate the allegation.  Hence, the accusation was deemed unworthy of credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, we find nothing suspicious that would lead
us to believe that the charges were fabricated.  The inconsistency cited does not by itself destroy the
credibility of Marilyn as to what transpired in February 1996 and March
1997.  She ably clarified this seeming
inconsistency during her testimony when she explained that in February 1996,
appellant had not been able to insert his penis fully into her vagina after
placing his finger inside, but succeeded later in March 1997.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">As to the improbability of committing rape in a public place as

<p class="BODY">The words of Marilyn -- “<i style="">nakapatong

certainty that appellant should be held liable for consummated rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, her testimony regarding the March 1997 incident
indicated certainty that the penis of appellant penetrated her vagina.  Her consistent and firm declaration “<i style="">Nakuha na niya ang pagkababae ko</i>” meant
that he was able to insert his penis fully into her vagina.  Recounting her ordeal, she testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did he tell you why he
wanted you to go with him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did he tell you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He just told me to go
with him and if I will not, something will happen to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he said if you will
not go something will happen to you, what did you feel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was afraid sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what did you do after
you were threatened by the accused that if you will not go with him something
will happen to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because I was very
afraid I just went with him but I was fighting him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How were you fighting
him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While he was holding my
arm, I was boxing him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And where were you
brought by the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He boarded me in a
passenger jeep and brought me to Riverview Hotel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That passenger jeep where
you said you were made to ride, was there any passenger at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know the driver of
the jeep?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know if the driver
is known to the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said you were brought
by the accused to Riverview, where is that Riverview where you said you were
brought by the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Parian when we
alighted from the passenger jeep there was already a tricycle waiting for us
and he made [m]e board the tricycle and the driver of the tricycle brought us
inside the Riverview and he left me inside the tricycle and took a number and
brought me inside the room.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When you were left inside the tricycle why
did you not run and shout?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because he is known to the tricycle driver
and he told the tricycle driver to guard me and I was very afr[a]id.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the accused left
and g[o]t a number, was there any conversation between the tricycle driver and
the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How were you able to say
that the driver of the tricycle is known to the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the accused told
the tricycle driver to guard me ‘at kung may mangyari diyan, mananagot ka sa
akin.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said you were brought
and dragged inside the room by the accused, can you demonstrate how you were
dragged by the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was holding my arms
telling me to enter the room but I answered him I do not want to enter the room
but he pulled and dragged me until I was able to enter the room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inside the room, what did
the accused do to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inside the room he
ordered me to undress myself and I answered I do not want, he was forcing me, I
was fighting him so finally I removed my clothes against my will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said the accused was
forcing you to remove your clothes, how was he forcing you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was pushing me sir
while I was moving backwards and then he slapped me and he also told me ‘Kung
hindi ka papayag, papatayin kita.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How many times were you
slapped by the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three times sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the accused told you
if you will not agree he will kill you, what did you feel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was afraid sir, ‘kaya
wala na akong nagawa’.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said finally you
undressed yourself, after you have undressed yourself out of fear what did the
accused do to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He kissed my body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what portion of your
body were you kissed by the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My private part sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did you do when the
accused was kissing your private part?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>‘Nandidiri ako.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aside from that what did
you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was fighting him and
requested him to stop.  (Witness is
crying)</blockquote>

<blockquote>I was requesting him to stop but it seems
that he did not hear me.  He just told
me to stop crying.  I was just crying
then.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said you were
fighting him also when he was kissing your private part, how were you fighting?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was boxing him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(The witness is demonstrating by swaying
her hand closed fist)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did you do after the
accused was kissing your private part and on your part you were trying to box
him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He boxed me on my
stomach.  ‘Namimilipit ako sa
sakit.’  I said ‘Aray ko,’ and I told
him to stop but he continued inserting his private part into my private part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was his position in
relation to you at the time you said he was inserting his private part into
your private part?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was on my top.  ‘Nakadagan siya.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the accused was
inserting his private part into your organ, what were you doing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was moving backwards
and told him to stop because it was very painful but he did not stop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And he did not stop
despite your pleas?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>‘Noong nilabasan na siya
itinigil na niya ang pagganon sa akin.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now after he stopped what
did he do next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He took the towel and
wiped yong lumabas sa kanya and told me to dress myself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After you were told to
dress yourself, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So I dressed up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After you dressed up
after you were told by the accused, what did you do next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I told him that I will
be going out and he told me not to go out and wait for him because I do not
know how to open the door which was locked.  I was not able to go out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But finally, were you
able to go out of the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened after you
were asked by the accused to wait for him so you can go out?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So I waited inside the
room and was crying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After you waited for him,
what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So he opened the door
and we went outside.  I ran away from
him inside and boarded the jeep and proceeded to the school.  In the school I continued crying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How about the accused
where did he go?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not know sir
because I left him inside the motel, I did not mind him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tell us why you proceeded
to the school?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because I was afraid to
go home sir because he might go to our house because his house is near our
house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the school what did
you do there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I only cried.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened after you
said you continued to cry in the school?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My classmates were
asking me why, I was crying and answered them ‘nothing’.  That’s my problem.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why did you not tell your
classmates?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Afraid of him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From Tasyo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why were you afraid of
Tasyo?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of his threat.”<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Jennifer’s testimony is strongly supported by the
medical findings conducted by the medicolegal expert<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
three months after the incident.  The
Medical Report showed that the victim had old healed lacerations at the five
o’clock and the seven o’clock positions.  This finding is consistent with penile invasion.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the victim’s claim of rape is corroborated by the physical findings of
penetration, there exists sufficient basis for concluding that sexual
intercourse did take place.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><i><u>Defense of Denial and
Alibi<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">As consistently held by this Court, alibi and denial cannot
prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of
the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must establish clearly and
convincingly that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the
crime scene when it happened.  In the
present case, appellant failed to show, by clear and convincing proof, that it
was physically impossible for him to have been at the <i style="">loci criminis</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can we accept the theory of appellant that it was
Prescilla Bernardo, his godmother and Marilyn’s mother, who instigated her
daughter to file the charges.  We
reiterate that it is unnatural for a mother to use her daughter as an engine of
malice, especially if it will subject her offspring to embarrassment and
lifelong stigma.  A mother would not
sacrifice the honor of her daughter to give vent to a grudge that would tarnish
the latter’s reputation forever.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the trial court erred in ruling that the acts committed
by appellant in Criminal Case No. 6060-98-C were covered by Articles 266-a and
266-b of the Revised Penal Code. Republic Act No. 8353 or “The Anti-Rape Law of
1997” reclassified the crime of rape as a crime against person and renumbered
it from Article 335 to Articles 226-A to 226-B of the Revised Penal Code.  The amendment took effect on October 22,
1997.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the crime charged herein was committed in February
1996.  Hence, appellant can only be held
liable under the old Article 335<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a> of
the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 6 in relation to Article 335 of the Revised Penal
Code, rape is merely attempted when the offender commences the commission of
the crime directly by overt acts, but does not perform all the acts of
execution by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous
desistance.  The penalty is two (2)
degrees lower than the imposable penalty of <i style="">reclusion
perpetua</i>.  Two (2) degrees lower is <i style="">prision mayor</i>, the range of which is six
(6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and in the absence of
any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the maximum of the penalty to be
imposed upon the accused shall be taken from the medium period of <i style="">prision mayor</i>, the range of which is
eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years; while the minimum shall be
taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is <i style="">prision correccional</i>, the range of which is from six months and one
(1) day to six (6) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, <s>P</s>50,000 is
awarded to the victim as indemnity <i style="">ex
delicto</i> for each count of consummated rape,<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a> and <s>P</s>30,000
for the attempted rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a> In
addition, moral damages in the amount of <s>P</s>50,000<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
is awarded to her for the consummated rape and <s>P</s>15,000<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
for the attempted rape.</p>
