The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape committed in April, 1994, Grim.

At that time, appellant was in need of someone to work as a househelper. Having agreed to the proposal to work for appellant, Merly was fetched by Marissa from Carmen, Davao del Norte and taken to Barangay Bolod, Panglao, Bohol where she was to reside with appellant, Nila and Nila’s grandmother, Isidra Dominguez, at the latter’s house. Merly’s duties as a househelper included cooking, fetching water, washing clothes and general house cleaning.<br><br>“Barely three (3) weeks after Merly’s arrival, or sometime in April 1994, appellant, who had come from Tagbilaran City where Nila was expecting the delivery of their child, told her to stop working for the day and invited her to rest in the room and bed of Isidra. Isidra and appellant’s son had been sent by appellant to buy something in Barangay Camayaan. While Merly was resting, appellant, who was half-naked, started to touch her body and breast, kissed her on the neck, face and lips and removed her dress and panty. Merly shouted to attract attention from neighbors but appellant covered her mouth with dirty clothes, pointed a knife to the right side of her body and warned her to stop moving or be killed. Thus subdued, Merly could only watch appellant go on top of her, insert his penis into her vagina, and rape her. When he finished, appellant warned Merly not to tell anybody about the incident[;] otherwise, he would not hesitate to kill her, adding that he was a lieutenant in the Coast Guard, his father a judge, his mother a physician, his uncle an NBI man, his aunt a lawyer and that she would be declared as ‘missing in action.’ When Isidra arrived that afternoon, Merly just kept quiet out of fear.<br><br>“Sometime in March 1995, around midnight, Merly was sleeping in the kitchen of the same house, about five (5) to six (6) meters from where Isidra was sleeping and about nine (9) to ten (10) meters from the room where appellant and Nila were sleeping. When she noticed appellant approach her, Merly shouted, but appellant immediately covered her mouth with his hand and brandished a pistol. Appellant then lifted her skirt, removed her panty, placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. After satisfying his lust, appellant stood up and threatened her with bodily harm if she told anybody of the incident.<br><br>“Cowed by appellant’s threats, Merly did not report the rape incidents until May 1995, when she chanced upon one Arquilao Dominguez at the well where the latter regularly fetched water. Having told him of the rape incidents, Arquilao advised her to report the matter to the parish priest or to the teacher of the San Agustin Academy where she and A[r]quilao’s daughter were studying.<br><br>“When Merly subsequently enrolled at the school as a fourth year high school student, she reported the incidents to the parish priest, Father Crispin Varquez, through the confessional box. Fr. Varquez called a meeting of all the teachers of the school and informed them of Merly’s confession. Upon instructions from Fr. Varquez, Merly came back the following day to the convent and met Helen Ho, a Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) officer, and some teachers. In the meantime, Merly left Isidra’s house and stayed temporarily with Helen Ho.<br><br>“On August 16, 1995, Merly was examined by Dr. Marivic D. Nazareno at the Governor Celestino Gallanes Memorial Hospital. On August 18, 1995, Merly, assisted by Helen Ho, filed two (2) complaints for rape with the Panglao police authorities. Subsequently, the complaints were subscribed before Judge Felisa Vaño of the Panglao Municipal Trial Court. Subsequently, two (2) complaints for rape were filed with the Regional Trial Court in Tagbilaran City.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></u><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant narrates the facts in the following manner:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>“That he met the complaining witness Merly Papellero at Carmen, Davao del Norte, as she was introduced to him by Marissa Dominguez, the sister of his wife. He was informed that she (Merly) was interested to serve as a working student since she wanted to finish her studies. Whereupon it was agreed that she may be accepted either as a house helper [for] which she will be paid a monthly salary, or just be a working student whose school bills will be paid plus allowances and things for personal use. Coming to terms with [her,] accused brought her together with his sister-in-law from Carmen, Davao del Norte to Bolod, Panglao, Bohol, which is the residence of his wife Nila Dominguez. In view of the fact that he was in need of a helper his wife being pregnant at that time and was about to deliver she was hired first as a helper from the end of March 1994 to the end of April 1994. Later on because she wanted to pursue her schooling she opted to serve as a working student.<br><br>“To be prepared for any eventuality, considering that the means of transportation from Bolod, Panglao, Bohol, to Tagbilaran City, [was] very scarce, accused took the necessary precaution of bringing his infanticipating wife to Tagbilaran City to be near x x x the hospital therein, as early as April 6, 1994. During this time Merly Papellero stayed in Panglao, and served as the runner, whose task was to [bring food] and get the used clothes to be laundered at Bolod, Panglao, Bohol.<br><br>“Of course there were times that accused will go to Panglao, Bohol, yet he will not leave his wife unless Merly will arrive and replace him in watching his wife who was expecting childbirth. Thus there was never a time that he saw the complainant in Panglao in the month of April 1994, as they only met in Tagbilaran City. This [held] even more true during the third week of April 1994, as his wife actually delivered on April 21, 1994, at the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital in Tagbilaran City and accused as a devoted husband was always at her side.<br><br>“Although she often went to the barangay officials of Bolod, Panglao, on errands of the accused and the fact that she represented the latter [i]n a road training, she did not file any complaint against him and neither was the latter summoned to appear before any barangay official.<br><br>“The accused further stated that complainant also often went to the police station of Panglao, Bohol, even in 1994 yet. Matter of factly she went there sometime in May 1994, to report a stoning incident of the house of Isidra Dominguez, where a certain SPO3 Proculo Bunao responded. Then in August of that same year during the fiesta of Panglao, she again went to the police station to ask for police assistance as the sons and daughters and relatives of a certain Mesagrande [were] causing trouble at the house of Isidra Dominguez. The last time that she went to the said office was on July 15, 1995, when she was commanded to report the los[s] of accused[‘s] piglet in order that the incident will be blottered.<br><br>“To manifest that nothing untoward occurred to Merly Papellero in the month of April 1994, she opted in the following month of May 1994, to be just a working student and had herself enrolled by the accused at the St. Augustine Academy in Panglao, Bohol, in the third year high school in June 1994. Being so, she continued to reside therefor with the accused at the house of Isidra Dominguez, without reservations nor gripes or complain[t]s.<br><br>“Having been enrolled at the St. Augustine Academy, Panglao, Bohol, in June 1994, together with accused[‘s] wife Nila, and her sister Marissa, naturally she ha[d] to go to school daily and had to pass by the police station of Panglao, Bohol, as it was the regular route from Bolod to the Poblacion, Panglao, Bohol. In school she became familiar even with teachers and with classmates. She attended a different section from Nila and Marissa, which made it difficult for the latter to monitor her movements while in school. She finished the 1994 school year as the working student of the accused and did not have any gripes nor complain[t]s against the latter. The inevitable conclusion would be that probably she liked staying with the accused as her employer or guardian for she even enrolled in the 1995 school year, again through the latter’s auspices.<br><br>“<u>Through all [that] time which lasted for more than a year</u> it should be noted with emphasis that complainant never reported any sexual abuse that she allegedly experienced from the hands of herein accused, either to the barangay officials of Bolod, Panglao, Bohol, or to the police authorities of Panglao, Bohol, much less to her mentors in school, who could have easily extended protection.<br><br>“In the meantime, in November 1994 Merly went back to her place in Carmen, Davao del Norte presumably to visit her parents. Taking advantage of the fact that she will be in Davao del Norte, she was commanded to deliver P20,000.00, to the parents-in-law of the accused Ponferio Dominguez in Tagum, Davao del Norte, which was supposed to be his share in the transaction concerning a parcel of land of which he ha[d] a right. Unfortunately, the amount did not reach Porferio, as she was accordingly swindled at the bus terminal in B[u]tuan City on the way to Tagum, Davao del Norte. When pressed for further explanation on the fiasco, she merely stated that the money got lost along the way.<br><br>“In order that accused can have some explanation in case the relatives of his wife will come to claim the lost money Menly Papellero on December 4, 1994, voluntarily signed a Promissory Note, which runs this wise:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">PROMISSORY NOTE<br></div><br>‘I do promise to pay, Mamerto (Dennis) Edem Jr, and his family the amount of (P20,000.00) twenty thousand pesos only, excluding the amount of groceries and some valuables that [were] lost last November 24 up to 27, 1994 at Butuan City, estimated of (P2,000) two thousand pesos, more or less in terms of monthly installment basis of (P2,000) two thousand pesos only, effective December 19, 1994 and every 19th of the month thereafter.<br><br>‘This promissory note is being executed in consideration of my failure to deliver the above-mentioned amount, groceries and some valuables to Mr. Porferio Dominguez of Tagum, Davao del Norte, thru negl[i]gence and carelessness on my way.<br><br>‘It is my free and voluntary act and deed in executing this affidavit.<br><br>‘Done [on the] 4<sup>th</sup> day of December, 1994, Panglao, Bohol, Philippines.’</blockquote>“And to complement the foregoing she even executed in her own handwritting an unsigned note dated December 22, 1994, which contains a confirmation that she did execute the aforequoted promissory note. It should be observed that those documents were properly marked as Exhibits ‘3’, ‘3-A’, and ‘3-B’, and ‘4’ for the accused.<br><br>“To put a serious doubt on the credibility and veracity of the malicious accusations against the accused, Merly without any compunctions and second thoughts voluntarily, freely, and eagerly acceded to stand as the sponsor or godparent of the accused son Nial Carlo Alvin D. Edem, at his baptism at the Joseph’s Cathedral in Tagbilaran City, on June 17, 1995. She even serenely and gladly posed in the pictorial made after that solemn event. Be it noted that these assertions are aptly supported [by] the admission of complainant and by competent and convincing evidence for the accused marked as Exhs. ‘5’, ‘8’, and ‘9’ and its sub-markings.<br><br>“Emphatically, worthwhile mentioning here is the fact that the accused was able to explain the reason why this ignominious case was filed against him. As can be drawn from his answer to the question: ‘what is the reason why she filed a case against you?’ In a voice reverberating with sincerity he stated: ‘Because of the fear of the los[s] of money and refusal to stop study[ing] and look for another job, to transfer to a landlord especially to Constaniana (supposed to be Justiniana) Mesagrande’, who is not in good terms with the accused .“<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>Disregarding appellant’s denial, the court <i>a quo</i> gave full credence to the testimony of complainant.

Javier</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court held that a charge is not undermined by a delay in filing it, particularly if it is grounded on death threats from the accused. Jurisprudence on the matter further states:<br><blockquote>“Delay in reporting the rape incidents, in the face of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>“It is not uncommon for a young girl at the tender age of 1<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[8]</span> years to be intimidated into silence and conceal for some time the violation of her honor, even by the mildest of threat against her life.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>“Delay in reporting an incident of rape does not create any doubt over the credibility of the complainant nor can it be taken against her.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>Complainant is a young, unsophisticated barrio lass living far away from home with no close relatives around. Aside from the threats on her life and her status as a working student, she was not given any salary for her work in the household of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Understandably, running away from him to return home to Davao was not an immediately feasible or even affordable option.<br><br>Appellant then points to the Medical Certificate which states:&nbsp; “Genitals = grossly normal.” He posits that the absence of a finding of hymenal lacerations and wounds in complainant’s vagina negates the rapes.<br><br>His contention has no merit. Medical findings of injuries in the victim’s genitalia are not essential to a rape conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Furthermore, contrary to allegations of the defense, the findings of the medicolegal officer support the charge that complainant was sexually violated. The former explained in open court that the latter’s hymen was no longer intact and could no longer be identified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The doctor further said that such a state could have been the result of the insertion of a male sex organ into complainant’s vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Also, the absence of any sign of external injuries does not negate rape in these cases, which were filed more than a year after the first and five months after the latest incident. “Absence of external signs or physical injuries on the victim does not negate the commission of rape, specifically in a situation where complainant filed the rape case a year after the incident, when the injuries have healed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The alibi of appellant -- that he was in Tagbilaran City -- cannot stand against the positive identification made by complainant. Also, the record fails to disclose even a shred of evidence to corroborate the alibi. Since it was established solely by the accused himself, it becomes even less worthy of credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Furthermore, as admitted by him in his “Manifestation of Personal Sentiments x x x” it takes only 25 minutes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> more or less, to travel from Tagbilaran City to the house of Isidra in Bolod, Panglao.<br><br>For the defense of alibi to be given weight, it must be shown that it was impossible for the accused to have been present at the place where the crime was perpetrated at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In the instant case, it was not impossible for appellant to have been in Bolod that fateful noontime in April, as credibly testified to by complainant. He could have easily gone from Tagbilaran to Bolod, assaulted complainant, then gone back to Tagbilaran -- all within a short span of time. Hence, the RTC was correct in disregarding his alibi.<br><br>As for the rape committed in March 1995, appellant merely proffered an unsubstantiated denial. Denial, like alibi, if not supported by clear and convincing evidence, is negative and self-serving and bears no weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It is a time-honored principle that between the positive and categorical testimony of a rape victim on the one hand and the accused’s bare denial on the other, the former generally prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Proper Penalty</i></b></u><br></div><br>The trial court erred in imposing the penalty of “<i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death” for each crime. Although that is the penalty prescribed by law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> for rape committed with the use of a deadly weapon, the trial court cannot just impose the whole range as penalty. It is tasked to go further. After taking into account the presence or absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, it must determine what specific penalty, within the range prescribed by law, to impose. Furthermore, the presence of these circumstances must both be alleged in the information and proven during the trial.<br><br>The Complaint in Criminal Case No. 9509 does not mention any aggravating or qualifying circumstance. In fact, none was proven. Hence, the crime is simple, not qualified, rape. The penalty is thus <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>The Complaint in Criminal Case No. 9510 states that the rape was committed with the aid of a knife, a contention that was proven beyond reasonable doubt during the trial. Hence, we apply paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, which prescribes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>In this case, the Complaint further alleges that the victim “at the time of the commission of the crime was still minor.” However, this circumstance alone, without the concurrent allegation and proof of her relationship to the appellant, is not recognized by law as a qualifying circumstance. Neither is the mere minority of the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> included in the enumeration of aggravating circumstances under Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code. Hence, the allegation and proof of minority by itself without the allegation and proof of relationship cannot justify the imposition of the death penalty.<br><br>Neither can the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength be appreciated, because “the use of the knife x x x already absorbed abuse of superior strength:”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><blockquote>“Since the rape was committed with the use of a knife, a deadly weapon, the crime is therefore punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. The aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength stated in the Information cannot increase the imposable penalty to death. Taking advantage of superior strength or abuse of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means available to the person attacked. It is abuse of superior numbers or employment of means to weaken the defense. This circumstance is always considered whenever there is notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority notoriously advantageous [to] the aggressor [and] deliberately chosen by him in the commission of the crime. To properly appreciate it, it is necessary to evaluate not only the physical condition of the parties and the arms or objects employed but the incidents in the total development of the case as well.<br><br>“That accused-appellant deliberately took advantage of his superior strength by using excessive force on his victim has not been proven. The use of the knife already qualified the rape; and this absorbed the generic aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength. Moreover, like the crime of parricide by a husband on his wife, abuse of superior strength is inherent in rape. It is generally accepted that under normal circumstances a man who commits rape [against] a woman is physically stronger than the latter. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance in the instant case, the penalty to be imposed should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote>All told, under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, the imposable penalty in Criminal Case No. 9510 is also <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, not death.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Civil Liability</i></b></u><br></div><br>The RTC also erred in not awarding damages to private complainant. In <i>People v. Catubig</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court validated the grant of moral damages to the rape victims in the amount of P50,000 and explained that the “award rests on the jural foundation that the crime of rape necessarily brings with it shame, mental anguish,. besmirched reputation, moral shock and social humiliation to the offended party.” In each of the two cases at bar, the offended party also deserves to receive the amount of P50,000 civil indemnity, the equivalent of compensatory damages; and in Criminal Case No. 9510, exemplary damages (on account of the use of a deadly weapon) in the amount of P25,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision in Criminal Cases Nos. 9509 and 9510 is <i><b>MODIFIED</b></i>. In both proceedings, appellant is found <i><b>GUILTY</b></i> of simple, not qualified, rape. Accordingly, in each case, he is sentenced to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the victim P50,000 as indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> and P50,000 as moral damages. In addition, he shall pay P25,000 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. 9510 in view of the use of a deadly weapon in that case.
