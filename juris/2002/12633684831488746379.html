CASE NO. U-9811, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of aggravated rape, an offense punishable under Art. 266-A, R.A. 8353, in relation to R.A. 7659, the Court sentences Rogelio Barrozo to suffer the penalty of DEATH, to be implemented in the manner provided by law; ordering the accused to indemnify Rowena Barrozo the sum of P75,000.00 for moral damages, further sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages and other accessory penalties of the law.<br><br>“For failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of Rogelio Barrozo beyond reasonable doubt in CRIM.

Mary Gwendolyn Luna, c/o Region I Medical Center, Dagupan City, medically examined Rowena Barrozo.&nbsp; She (the doctor) testified further that the victim intimated to her that her father had abused her before, sometime in January 1996, when she was only twelve (12) years old.&nbsp; Her findings were incorporated in the Medical Certificate she issued, the text of which reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">‘MEDICO-LEGAL CERTIFICATE<br></div><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">- </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Allegedly sexually abused by own father she was 12 years old</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>- </td> <td><div align="justify">Abuse was repeated August 16 (Sunday) 1998 at 10:00 A.M. in Mermer, Manaoag, Pangasinan</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Conscious, coherent, ambulatory, no signs of physical injuries</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Menarche – 12 years old</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">IMP-August 2<sup>nd</sup> week 1998 – 4 days (August 15-18)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Breast – with breast buds</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Genitalia – with healed lacerations at 5, 6 o’clock, vagina admits 1 finger with ease two fingers with slight difficulty and pain</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>- </td> <td><div align="justify">Cervix closed, uterus small, adnexae free whitish discharge</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>- </td> <td><div align="justify">Smear for presence of spermatozoa</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Vaginal smear result: Negative for spermatozoa’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Citations omitted)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></u><br></div><br>Appellant, on the other hand, narrates his version of the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>“ROGELIO BARROZO is the father of the complainant.&nbsp; He testified that he was never married to complainant’s mother.&nbsp; They separated when complainant was one year old.&nbsp; He left their only daughter in the custody of his in-laws.&nbsp; He said that complainant is mentally ill because he saw her burning her clothes for three times.&nbsp; One time, he saw her pouring kerosene over cooked rice.<br><br>“Accused-appellant denied having raped his daughter.&nbsp; He said that it was only a ‘solsol’ by the group of Jerry Cercado with whom he had a fight.&nbsp; Jerry’s group instigated the filing of the rape case against him to eliminate him or as a revenge.&nbsp; He belied that he had carnal knowledge with his daughter who was no longer living with him at the time of the alleged incident.&nbsp; Prior to August 28, 1998, Rowena was living with del Rosario.&nbsp; That was in June 1998.&nbsp; He loved his daughter and wanted her to have good things in life.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>In convicting appellant of “aggravated rape,” the RTC gave full faith and credence to the testimony of complainant.&nbsp; The trial judge ruled:<br><blockquote>“The detailed and specific narration of Rowena, how she was sexually abused and assaulted by her father, prevailed over the timid denial and negative assertions of [appellant]. Denial can easily be fabricated and made. It cannot outweigh and prevail over the positive and clear assertions of Rowena of what transpired on&nbsp; August 16, 1998 as their house at Mermer, Manaoag. The testimony of Rowena is most credible and to the mind of the Court, had actually happened to the exclusion of any other presumption.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Appellant submits for our consideration the following alleged errors committed by the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“I<br></div><br>The trial court gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“II<br></div><br>The trial court gravely erred in not considering the defense interposed by accused-appellant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.&nbsp; Because of the prosecution’s failure to prove the victim’s minority when the rape was committed, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> -- not death -- is the proper penalty.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>First Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></b></u><br></div><br>After a thorough review of the records of the case, we are convinced that the RTC did not err in giving credence to the testimony of the victim and the other prosecution witnesses.<br><br>In a prosecution for rape, the Court is always guided by the following principles: (a) an accusation for rape can be made easily, but to disprove it can be difficult though the accused may be innocent; (b) in view of the nature of the crime which usually involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution&nbsp; must stand or fall on its own merits and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The testimony of the victim, narrating how she was raped by her own father on August 16, 1998, was clear and convincing.&nbsp; It proceeded thus:<blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%"><div align="center">DIRECT EXAMINATION</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">FISCAL RESTITUTO A.
