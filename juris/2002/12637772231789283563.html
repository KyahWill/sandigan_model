<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the three cases are interrelated, involving the same
parties and similar causes of action, they were consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 18, 1995 appellant was arraigned, and with the
assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty.  A joint trial on the merits ensued thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented complaining witnesses, Rodrigo Abagat
and Norma David Abagat.</p>

<p class="BODY">RODRIGO ABAGAT testified that he is engaged in the business of
supplying dry goods, such as materials for building construction as well as
communication parts, to the Philippine Air Force.  In the morning of May 10, 1994, he narrated that he was at the
Villamor Airbase together with his wife, Norma David Abagat, and appellant Rica
Cuyugan.  He and his wife met with
appellant at the Villamor Golf Club to discuss the matter of appellant’s dire
need for money on account of the supplies she wanted to buy for the Philippine
Armed Forces.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></b></span></a>
He said that they gave appellant, on staggered basis, the amount totaling to <s>P</s>855,000.  They agreed to give her the amount provided
that appellant would issue checks to cover the value of the money given her.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the checks were presented for payment, they were all
dishonored either on account of DAIF (drawn against insufficient funds) or for
reason of ACCOUNT CLOSED.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></b></span></a>
He forthwith informed appellant of the dishonor of the checks by sending her a
demand letter on January 12, 1995.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></b></span></a>
Despite repeated demands, appellant failed to make good the checks, which
constrained the Abagat spouses to file in May 1995 a complaint for estafa against
appellant.  It was only then that they
filed the complaint as they gave appellant an opportunity to settle her
obligations to no avail.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Rodrigo admitted that appellant is a family
friend and is in fact related by affinity to his wife.  He likewise admitted that he received from
appellant the sum of <s>P</s>100,000 applied against the check drawn in his
favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">NORMA DAVID ABAGAT substantially corroborated the testimony of
her husband.  She accompanied her
husband when he met with appellant and witnessed the exchange of money and
checks between them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination Norma admitted that the checks issued by
appellant were mere guarantees for the return of their money.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented appellant RICA G. CUYUGAN.  She testified that she is a businesswoman
who furnished the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) with office supplies,
construction materials, and signal and communication spare parts.  She had been engaged in this business since
1977.  She affirmed that her husband is
the cousin of private complainant Norma Abagat.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant stated that it was Norma Abagat who requested that the
Abagats participate in the big supply project for the Philippine Army.  The Abagat spouses gave her <s>P</s>150,000
which represented the <s>P</s>135,000 principal as partner for that
construction project with the Philippine Army and the remaining <s>P</s>15,000
representing the 10% profit share.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></b></span></a>
In return, she issued a postdated check covering the <s>P</s>150,000 as proof
that the Abagat spouses had invested their money with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She claimed that she was the industrial partner as she did all
the legwork in getting the projects.  They then shared in the profits after deducting all the miscellaneous
expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">She issued another postdated check worth <s>P</s>360,000 in
exchange for the <s>P</s>270,000 that Norma Abagat gave her, less expenses and
profit share.  She also issued another
check for <s>P</s>36,000 representing interest for four months at <s>P</s>9,000
per month.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></b></span></a>
On account of another deal she closed with the Philippine Army, she issued to
Norma another check worth <s>P</s>300,000 as the latter’s share in said deal,
and a check worth <s>P</s>9,000 as interest for the former.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant made payments to the Abagat spouses by depositing the
total amount of <s>P</s>575,000 in the latter’s bank account with Maybank (formerly
Philippine Republic Bank).<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She further testified on cross-examination that when the checks
bounced, she issued four replacement checks in the sala of the trial judge but
these checks also bounced.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">ADELARDO GUEVARRA, bank account analyst at Maybank Philippines,
Villamor Airbase branch, testified that as part of his duties and functions he
posted and recorded deposit accounts and withdrawals.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></b></span></a>
He claimed to be familiar with the Maybank account of Rodrigo Abagat and that
deposits were made in said account but he had no knowledge who deposited these
amounts.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">LT. COL. RAMOS L. AQUINO, Logistics Supply Officer of the
Philippine Army, was the final witness for the defense.  He testified that he knew appellant quite
well and the latter had introduced him to Norma Abagat who owned NDA
Trading.  He also affirmed that
appellant dealt with the Philippine Army in supplying it with materials for
certain projects.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
estafa committed by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior
to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, that is by postdating a
check or issuing a check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no
funds in the bank, or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover
the amount of the check.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal where appellant assigns the lone error that:</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED
APPELLANT RICA G. CUYUGAN GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THREE (3) COUNTS OF
ESTAFA.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the trial court erred in convicting
appellant for three counts of estafa and sentencing her pursuant to Article
315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code as amended by P.D. No. 818.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that the agreement entered into by her and the
Abagat spouses was for a partnership transaction for the supply of materials
for the Armed Forces.  She further
asserts that the Abagat spouses had known her for a long time and had previous
business dealings with her.  It was
actually on account of her good credit standing that they were convinced to
become her partners.  She issued the
subject checks as mere guarantees, according to appellant, hence they were
postdated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, appellant also assails the penalty imposed by the
trial court on the ground that it violates the constitutional provision on
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment.  Considering that this appeal could be decided on other grounds, however,
we need not now pursue the issue of unconstitutionality of P.D. No. 818, which
amended Article 315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code, as earlier amended by
R.A. No. 4885.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the appellee, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)
states that although appellant incurred criminal liability, she should only be
penalized for violation of BP 22 and not for estafa because the prosecution
failed to establish fraud.  According to
the OSG, contrary to appellant’s claim that the sum of <s>P</s>855,000 given to
her by the Abagat spouses represented the latter’s investment in a supposed
partnership, the evidence clearly established that the <s>P</s>855,000 was a
loan extended by the spouses to appellant.  However, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt fraud
or bad faith on the part of appellant in issuing the postdated checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, findings and conclusion of the trial court are binding
upon us in the absence of a clear showing of arbitrariness or palpable error<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></b></span></a>
or unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that,
if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the OSG that the prosecution failed to discharge
its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the offense of estafa as
defined by the Revised Penal Code in Article 315, 2 (d), was committed by the
appellant.  More particularly, the
prosecution did not prove the existence of fraud to constitute the issuance of
the check as fraud contemplated by the law on estafa.  As we previously held:</p>

<blockquote>To constitute estafa under this provision the act of postdating or
issuing a check in payment of an obligation must be the efficient cause of
defraudation, and as such it should be either prior to, or simultaneous with
the act of fraud.  The offender must be
able to obtain money or property from the offended party because of the issuance
of a check whether postdated or not.  That is, the latter would not have parted with his money or other
property were it not for the issuance of the check.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></b></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the trial court failed to consider the testimonies
of both the private complainants with respect to the agreement that the checks
issued by appellant shall be mere guarantees for the eventual payment of the
money given to appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly pointed out by the OSG, Norma Abagat admitted on
cross-examination that the checks that appellant issued merely guaranteed the
payment of the loan.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></b></span></a>
Rodrigo Abagat likewise admitted as much and even testified on
cross-examination that he intended to impose a monthly interest at the rate of
5% on the amount lent.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></b></span></a>
The OSG observed that it was not the issuance of the checks that prompted the
Abagat spouses to part with their money but rather, the liberality to help
appellant who is the wife of Norma’s cousin, as well as the expectation to
collect interest payment for the loan extended to appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The transaction between appellant and the Abagat spouses, in our
view, was one for a loan of money to be used by appellant in her business and
she issued checks to guarantee the payment of the loan.  As such, she has the obligation to make good
the payment of the money borrowed by her.  But such obligation is civil in character and in the absence of fraud,
no criminal liability under the Revised Penal Code arises from the mere
issuance of postdated checks as a guarantee of repayment.  We find appellant’s allegation, that the
Abagat spouses entered into a joint venture agreement with her for the supply
of materials with the AFP, is self-serving.  But we also note that the trial court convicted appellant on a general
allegation that all the elements of estafa under Article 315, 2 (d) of the
Revised Penal Code had been proved by the prosecution without making any
reference to or giving any proof of the actual fraud that appellant allegedly
committed to make her liable for estafa.  It is elementary that where an allegation in the information is an
essential element of the crime, the same must be proved beyond reasonable doubt
to sustain a conviction.  In this case,
the prosecution did not establish specifically and conclusively the fraud
alleged as an element of the offenses charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the informations against appellant involved
violation of Art. 315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code, we take exception to
the OSG’s recommendation<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></b></span></a>
that appellant should be held liable for violations of BP 22.  Appellant cannot be convicted of a crime for
which she was not properly charged, for that would violate appellant’s
constitutional right to be informed of the accusation against her.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></b></span></a>
The purpose of the constitutional guarantee that a person accused of an offense
be informed of the accusation against him is (a) to furnish the accused with
such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his
defense; (b) to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal, for protection
against a further prosecution for the same cause; and (c) to inform the court
of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law
to support a conviction, if one should be had.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The informations filed with the regional trial court were for
three counts of estafa.  Earlier, the
informations for BP 22 covering the same checks filed with the Metropolitan
Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 44, were provisionally dismissed on November
13, 1996.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></b></span></a>
These cases were not re-filed nor consolidated with the informations for estafa
before the RTC of Pasay.  Accordingly,
appellant was never apprised of the fact that she may still be held liable for
BP 22 and so never had an opportunity to defend herself against an accusation
for an offense under the special law.  BP 22 cannot be deemed necessarily included in the crime of estafa under
RPC, Article 315, 2 (d).  The offense of
fraud defined under the Revised Penal Code is <i>malum in se, </i>whereas BP
22, also known as Bouncing Checks Law, is a special law which punishes the
issuance of bouncing checks, a <i>malum prohibitum</i>.  Fraud or estafa under the Revised Penal Code
is a distinct offense from the violation of the Bouncing Checks Law.  They are different offenses, having
different elements.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></b></span></a>
In this case, since appellant is accused of violating a particular provision of
the Revised Penal Code on estafa, she may not be convicted for violation of BP
22 without trenching on fundamental fairness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found sufficient evidence that appellant already
paid the amount of <s>P</s>425,000 out of her total indebtedness of <s>P</s>855,000.  Apparently, appellant made a belated effort
to make good her obligation.  Be that as
it may, there is a remaining balance of her obligation in the amount of <s>P</s>430,000
as the difference between <s>P</s>855,000 less <s>P</s>425,000.  This amount of <s>P</s>430,000 should be
paid by appellant as a just obligation owing to the spouses Rodrigo and Norma
Abagat.  In addition, interest of 12
percent per annum, to be computed in accordance with Article 1169,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></b></span></a>
should also be paid by her.  For where
the debtor incurs in delay, he has to pay interest by way of damages, in
conformity with our ruling in <i style="">Eastern
Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></b></span></a></p>
