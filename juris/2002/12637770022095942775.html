				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 16 July 2000, Valentin Arnante, his son Domingo Arnante, and other relatives were celebrating the birth anniversary of Christopher Arnante, another son of Valentin and brother of Domingo, at their residence in Sto. Domingo, Iriga City. Shortly after lunch, the group started having drinks in the living room of the Arnante residence. At around six o’clock in the evening, Valentin and his son Domingo, by then already both drunk, came to a heated argument. Domingo told his father to stop embarrassing him in front of guests but the latter still went on berating his son. Feeling ignored, Domingo stood up, proceeded to his room, followed by his brother Christopher, and took hold of a handgun. Domingo fired the gun towards the ground scaring the people in the house and prompting them to rush out through the front door. Domingo went out of the house through the kitchen door. His father Valentin followed until he was fired at and shot twice by Domingo. The victim was not able to make it to the hospital. <p> Domingo Arnante y Dacpano was indicted for parricide in an information that read –&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “That at about 6:00 o’clock in the evening of July 16, 2000 at their residence at Zone 5, Mabunga St., Sto. Domingo, Iriga City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, shoot his own father, Valentin Arnante y Tabayag twice with a handgun hitting his stomach and left arm which directly caused his instantaneous death”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> -</p></blockquote><p> to which charge he pleaded “not guilty” when arraigned.</p><p> Elena Arnante, the wife of the victim and mother of Domingo, testified that she was in the living room when she heard two gunshots. She dashed out from the room and she saw near the kitchen her husband down on the floor with gunshot wounds and her son Domingo standing by the kitchen door still holding the handgun. She immediately called for help and brought Valentin to the Our Lady of Mediatrix Hospital where her husband was declared “dead on arrival.”</p><p> Christopher Arnante stated that he tried to caution his brother Domingo when the latter got hold of the handgun but his brother would not hear of it. Domingo went out of the house through the kitchen door. Valentin followed. Christopher then heard two gunshots. He did not see where the first shot was directed at but he saw the second shot being aimed at his father. Entering the house, he saw his father bleeding and about to fall to the ground. When he tried to assist his father, Domingo also fired at him but missed. Christopher hurriedly went to the house of a neighbor to call for help. Failing to contact any police officer, he personally went to the police station where, not long after, he was informed that his father was dead on arrival at the hospital.</p><p> Dr. Pablo Filio, Jr., the Assistant City Health Officer of Iriga City, conducted a postmortem examination on the cadaver of Valentin Arnante about six hours after the latter’s death. The physician’s postmortem report indicated that the victim suffered two (2) gunshot wounds – one on the left arm which penetrated 2 inches below the armpit and another gunshot wound on the umbilical region, 3 inches below the umbilicus – the second wound being fatal and the immediate cause of death of the victim. He also testified that from the entry and direction of the wound, it would appear that the assailant was in front of the victim.</p><p> Domingo Arnante admitted having shot his own father twice but sought to justify his misdeed. He said that during the celebration of his brother’s birthday, his father, without any apparent reason, got mad at him and started scolding him. He told his father to stop humiliating him in front of all the guests but the victim persisted. He left the group and went to his room to get his gun. He fired the gun downwards to make his father stop censuring him. He then went out of the house through the kitchen door but his father still followed and threatened to hack him with a bolo. He was so embarrassed that he lost control of himself and shot his father twice. He promptly left the scene but soon thereafter surrendered to the police authorities.</p><p> The Regional Trial Court of Iriga City, Branch 35, which had tried the case, rendered a decision, on 09 February 2001, rejecting the plea of self-defense and convicting Domingo Arnante; it held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “WHEREFORE, finding the accused DOMINGO ARNANTE guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide defined and penalized under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code, he is sentenced to a penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, pay the indemnity of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p></blockquote><p> In its brief for appellant, the defense raised a lone assignment of error to the effect that the “the trial court erred in convicting accused-appellant despite the fact that he (had) acted in legitimate self-defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p> The claim of self-defense is untenable. When an accused admits killing the victim but invokes self-defense to escape criminal liability, he assumes the burden to establish his plea by credible, clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In order that the plea of self-defense can prevail, three basic conditions must concur, i.e., (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it, and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Unlawful aggression presupposes an actual, sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger on the life and limb of a person defending himself<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude. The aggression must be real and not just imaginary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> The testimony of appellant himself easily negates any showing of unlawful aggression on the part of his father. Observe his testimony -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="6%">"Q.</td><td width="94%"><div align="justify"> On July 16, 2000 at or about 6:00 o’clock in the evening at Sto.

A mere perception of an impending attack is not sufficient to constitute unlawful aggression, and neither is an intimidating or threatening attitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> The trial court correctly appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Verily, appellant voluntarily surrendered himself to the authorities shortly after the shooting incident.</p><p> Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, prescribes the penalty of<em> reclusion perpetua</em> to death for the crime of parricide. The attendance of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender justifies the imposition of the lesser penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> In addition to the civil liability of P50,000.00, appellant must also be made to account for P50,000.00 moral damages for wounded feelings and moral shock suffered by the heirs of the victim and P25,000.00 exemplary damages on account of relationship, a qualifying circumstance, which was alleged and proved, to the crime of parricide.</p><p>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Iriga City, Branch 35, in Criminal Case No. IR-5300, finding DOMINGO ARNANTE y DACPANO guilty of the crime of parricide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of<em> reclusion perpetua</em>, as well as to pay P50,000.00 civil indemnity, is AFFIRMED with modification in that appellant is likewise hereby ordered to pay P50,000.00 moral damages and P25,000.00 exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim.
