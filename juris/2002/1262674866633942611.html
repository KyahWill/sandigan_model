Instinctively, Clara stood up and took out a flashlight.&nbsp; She immediately gave it to her husband, who was then armed with a bolo [‘panabas’], to aid him in checking out the disturbance.<br><br>“Valentin ha[d] not walked far from the house when three (3) men suddenly entered the compound while two (2) others stayed outside.&nbsp; The men, initially identifying themselves as members of the New People’s Army (NPA), ferociously asked Valentin for money.&nbsp; Turned off by the demand, Valentin at once retorted that they could not be members of the NPAs as NPAs do not ask for money.<br><br>“The men, however, were unmasked.&nbsp; Valentin instantly recognized their faces as that of appellant and his co-accused.&nbsp; It was easy for Valentin to recognize appellant, having known him for the past ten (10) years, as the latter usually pass[ed] by their house when he [went] fishing.&nbsp; Appellant and his co-accused were each armed with a piece of wood.<br><br>“Unruffled by Valentin’s response, appellant and his co-accused nonetheless persisted.&nbsp; They demanded x x x guns and documents or certificates for the large cattle and asked who the owner of the cows was.<br><br>“Valentin, however, attempted to ward off the impending danger now reposed [i]n him.&nbsp; He promptly hacked one of the men [identified as Joel Temporal] on his right arm. A struggle ensued.&nbsp; Valentin, however, was easily outnumbered by the intruders as the latter clubbed him at the same time.&nbsp; Valentin soon let go of his defense when the intruders attempted to hurt his son.<br><br>“At this time, Clara sensed an intense level of fear as she stood frozen beside a table where a kerosene lamp was lighted.&nbsp; It only took a few minutes when Joel Temporal barged in, struck the kerosene lamp and ominously threatened, ‘I will kill you if you will not give me what I want.’<br><br>“Joel Temporal thereafter pulled Clara out of the house where she was forcibly laid on the cogon grass.<br><br>“Meantime, Valentin could only watch his wife being pulled away as he was rendered weak and immobile at the clubbing he received at a moment’s resistance. Jessing Valdez and Heherson Rivera stood guard.&nbsp; His attempt to rescue his wife was overtaken by the necessity to protect the son he was now embracing lest the intruders vent their rage on him.<br><br>“Clara’s dress [duster] and panty were torn away.&nbsp; Her hands were held by appellant and her feet also held by Benedicto Pedro.&nbsp; Joel Temporal put himself on top of Clara and went inside her.&nbsp; After he consummated his lust, appellant came in next. Benedicto Pedro also took his turn.&nbsp; For his part, Jessing Valdez left Valentin and his son and rushed in to satiate, too, his carnal desire.&nbsp; Once finished, all four (4) men checked on Valentin but came back to see Clara, stepping on her vagina in the process. Agonized, Clara could only utter, ‘Don’t you have pity on me, you people from Bannawag?’<br><br>“Appellant and his co-accused thereafter left, bringing with them two (2) chickens and nine (9) turkeys which were carried around their necks.<br><br>“Valentin rushed to his wife’s side and could only embrace her.&nbsp; A few minutes, later, neighbors and friends Leonardo Palafox and Celestino Capa came to their succor. At this time, Valentin had difficulty breathing.&nbsp; He could not be rushed to the hospital immediately because there was no transport available.<br><br>“Valentin and Clara had to content themselves to await the dawn.&nbsp; Back at the house, however, money worth the amount of P5,350.00 and a Seiko gold-plated watch worth P2,000.00 [were] found missing [from] Clara’s bag.<br><br>“At 8:00 a.m. the following morning, Valentin was admitted [to] the Cagayan Valley Sanitarium and Hospital for multiple physical injuries secondary to mauling.&nbsp; His diagnosis revealed the following injuries:<br><blockquote>‘1. 2 cm. Hematoma on R and L temporal area<br>&nbsp;2. 2 cm. Hematoma on L che[e]k area<br>&nbsp;3. [Multiple] Incomplete fracture of 8th and 9th ribs R side.’ </blockquote> “Clara, on the other hand, was examined at the Outpatient Department.&nbsp; She sustained ‘multiple scratch marks, inner thigh-bilateral, and multiple abraided areas per labia minora.’ The certification further indicated:<br><blockquote>‘Specular exam.
