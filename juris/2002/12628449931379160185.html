Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>We agree with petitioner.&nbsp; Sections 1 and 2, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court provide an answer to the issue of venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Actions affecting title to or possession of real property or an interest therein (real actions), shall be commenced and tried in the proper court that has territorial jurisdiction over the area where the real property is situated.&nbsp; On the other hand, all other actions, (personal actions) shall be commenced and tried in the proper courts where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides.<br><br>In <i>Commodities Storage</i> cited earlier, petitioner spouses obtained a loan secured by a mortgage over their land and ice plant in Sta. Maria, Bulacan.&nbsp; Because they had failed to pay the loan, the mortgage was foreclosed and the ice plant auctioned.&nbsp; Before the RTC of Manila, they sued the bank for damages and for the fixing of the redemption period. Since the spouses ultimately sought redemption of the mortgaged property, the action affected the mortgage debtor’s title to the foreclosed property; hence, it was a real action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Where the action affects title to the property, it should be instituted in the trial court where the property is situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In <i>National Steel Corp. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court held that “an action in which petitioner seeks the execution of a deed of sale of a parcel of land in his favor x x x has been held to be for the recovery of the real property and not for specific performance since his primary objective is to regain the ownership and possession of the parcel of land.”<br><br>However, in <i>La Tondeña Distillers, Inc. v. Ponferrada,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> private respondents filed an action for specific performance with damages before the RTC of Bacolod City.&nbsp; The defendants allegedly reneged on their contract to sell to them a parcel of land located in Bago City - - a piece of property which the latter sold to petitioner while the case was pending before the said RTC.&nbsp; Private respondent did not claim ownership but, by annotating a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> on the title, recognized defendants’ ownership thereof. This Court ruled that the venue had properly been laid in the RTC of Bacolod, even if the property was situated in Bago.<br><br>In <i>Siasoco v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> private respondent filed a case for specific performance with damages before the RTC of Quezon City.&nbsp; It alleged that after it accepted the offer of petitioners, they sold to a third person several parcels of land located in Montalban, Rizal.&nbsp; The Supreme Court sustained the trial court’s order allowing an amendment of the original Complaint for specific performance with damages. Contrary to petitioners’ position that the RTC of Quezon City had no jurisdiction over the case, as the subject lots were located in Montalban, Rizal, the said RTC had jurisdiction over the original Complaint.&nbsp; The Court reiterated the rule that a case for specific performance with damages is a personal action which may be filed in a court where any of the parties reside.<br><br>A close scrutiny of <i>National Steel</i> and <i>Ruiz</i> reveals that the prayers for the execution of a Deed of Sale were not in any way connected to a contract, like the Undertaking in this case.&nbsp; Hence, even if there were prayers for the execution of a deed of sale, the actions filed in the said cases were not for specific performance.<br><br>In the present case, petitioner seeks payment of her services in accordance with the undertaking the parties signed.&nbsp; Breach of contract gives rise to a cause of action for specific performance or for rescission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> If petitioner had filed an action <i>in rem</i> for the conveyance of real property, the dismissal of the case would have been proper on the ground of lack of cause of action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Second Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Non-Joinder of Proper Parties</i></b></u><br></div><br>Petitioner claims that she was duly authorized and empowered to represent the members of her group and to prosecute their claims on their behalf via a Special Power of Attorney executed by Forro, Radan and Anave.&nbsp; Besides, she argues that the omission of her companions as plaintiffs did not prevent the RTC from proceeding with the action, because whatever judgment would be rendered would be without prejudice to their rights. In the alternative, she avers that the trial court may add or drop a party or parties at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.<br><br>The RTC ruled that there was no allegation anywhere in the records that petitioner had been authorized to represent Forro, Radan and Anave, who were real parties-in-interest with respect to their respective shares of the 36.5 percent claim.&nbsp; Such being the case, the trial court never acquired jurisdiction over the subject matter of their claims.<br><br>Again, we side with petitioner.&nbsp; Neither a misjoinder nor a non-joinder of parties is a ground for the dismissal of an action.&nbsp; Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court, on motion of any party or on the court’s own initiative at any stage of the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The RTC should have ordered the joinder of such party, and noncompliance with the said order would have been ground for dismissal of the action.<br><br>Although the Complaint prayed for the conveyance of the whole 36.5 percent claim without impleading the companions of petitioner as party-litigants, the RTC could have separately proceeded with the case as far as her 20 percent share in the claim was concerned, independent of the other 16.5 percent.&nbsp; This fact means that her companions are not indispensable parties without whom no final determination can be had.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> At best, they are mere necessary parties who ought to be impleaded for a complete determination or settlement of the claim subject of the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The non-inclusion of a necessary party does not prevent the court from proceeding with the action, and the judgment rendered therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Third Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Correct Docket Fees</i></b></u><br></div><br>Petitioner insists that the value of the real property, which was the subject of the contract, has nothing to do with the determination of the correct docket or filing fees.<br><br>The RTC ruled that although the amount of damages sought had not been specified in the body of the Complaint, one can infer from the assessed value of the disputed land that it would amount to P50 million.&nbsp; Hence, when compared to this figure, the P210 paid as docket fees would appear paltry.<br><br>We hold that the trial court and respondent used technicalities to avoid the resolution of the case and to trifle with the law.&nbsp; True, Section 5, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court requires that the assessed value of the real estate, subject of an action, should be considered in computing the filing fees.&nbsp; But the Court has already clarified that the Rule does not apply to an action for specific performance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which is classified as an action not capable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Besides, if during the course of the trial, petitioner’s 20 percent claim on the Fourth Estate Subdivision can no longer be satisfied and the payment of its monetary equivalent is the only solution left, <i>Sunlife Insurance Office, Ltd. v.
