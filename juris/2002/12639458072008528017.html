<p>On May 28, 1997, the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City, Branch 
31, rendered a decision against the defendants in Civil Case No. 14303, entitled 
Praxedes Pacquing Flores vs. Winnie Bajet, et al., a case for forcible entry. 
The MeTC ordered the defendants to vacate the two parcels of land they were 
occupying; to jointly and severally pay plaintiff the sum of P3,000.00 a month 
as reasonable compensation for the use of the premises, starting from the date 
of the first demand until such time defendants shall have vacated the premises; 
and to pay the plaintiff the sum of P3,000.00 as attorney’s fees plus cost of 
suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>The defendants elevated the case to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon 
City. The case was docketed therein as Civil Case No. Q-97-31799 and was raffled 
to Branch 77 thereof, then presided by Judge Normandie B. Pizarro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>On September 11, 1997, the plaintiff-appellees filed a Motion for Execution 
pending appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> alleging that the 
defendants-appellants failed to file a supersedeas bond and to deposit with the 
RTC the amount of rent due. However, counsel for defendants-appellants failed to 
appear on the date set for the hearing on the motion. Thus, Judge Pizarro issued 
an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> considering the motion 
submitted for resolution.</p>
<p>On October 9, 1997, Judge Pizarro issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> directing the issuance of a writ of 
execution.</p>
<p>On October 20, 1997, the defendants-appellants Winnie Bajet, et al. filed an 
Urgent Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of 
the Order of October 9, 1997 granting the motion for execution. 
Defendant-appellants claimed that the motion for execution did not contain proof 
of service to them.</p>
<p>Judge Pizarro, in an Order dated November 11, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> denied the defendants-appellants’ motion 
for reconsideration for lack of merit.</p>
<p>On November 25, 1997, the Branch Clerk of Court issued a Writ of 
Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> pursuant to the Order dated 
October 9, 1997.</p>
<p>On November 28, 1997, the defendants-appellants filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> praying for the recall or suspension of 
the implementation of the writ of execution, reiterating that the motion for 
execution did not contain any proof of service.</p>
<p>In the meantime, respondent Judge Vivencio S. Baclig was assigned presiding 
judge of Branch 77 vice Judge Pizarro. Respondent judge denied the Omnibus 
Motion in an Order dated May 29, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p>Subsequently, defendants-appellants filed with the Court of Appeals a 
petition for certiorari with prayer for a temporary restraining order and writ 
of preliminary injunction. Petitioners (defendants-appellants) challenged the 
RTC Order dated October 9, 1997, directing the issuance of a writ of execution 
pending appeal; the Order dated November 11, 1997, denying the 
defendants-appellants’ motion for reconsideration; and the Order dated May 29, 
1998, denying the defendants-appellants’ Omnibus Motion. Petitioners alleged 
that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it acted upon the motion 
for execution pending appeal without proof of actual receipt of the copy of said 
motion by petitioners.</p>
<p>On October 9, 1998, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dismissing the petition for certiorari. 
The court held that while indeed the motion for execution did not contain any 
proof of service, petitioners were not deprived of due process since they were 
heard on motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p>On November 9, 1998, the plaintiffs-appellees filed an Ex Parte Motion for 
Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
which respondent judge granted in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated November 12, 1998. The motion did 
not contain any proof of service on the defendants-appellants.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the case was re-raffled to Branch 84 of the Quezon City RTC 
after respondent judge inhibited himself. Judge Areola, on May 31, 1999, issued 
an Order denying complainant’s motion for reconsideration and/or to quash/lift 
alias writ of execution. On July 16, 1999, Judge Areola ordered the issuance of 
another Alias Writ of Execution. Subsequently, Judge Mariflor P. Punzalan 
Castillo rendered a decision affirming the decision of the Quezon City MeTC, 
Branch 31.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p>On January 28, 1999, the Office of the Ombudsman received a criminal 
complaint from Winnie Bajet, one of the defendants-appellants in Civil Case No. 
Q-97-31799, charging Judge Vivencio S. Baclig with violating the Anti-Graft and 
Corrupt Practices Act. Complainant added that the charge also served as her 
administrative complaint against respondent judge.</p>
<p>On February 12, 1999, the Office of the Ombudsman referred the complaint to 
the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), which required respondent judge to 
comment.</p>
<p>Complainant accuses respondent judge of giving “unwarranted benefits, 
advantage or preference” to the plaintiff-appellant, of “manifest partiality, 
evident bad faith or inexcusable negligence.” She also charges him with “serious 
neglect of duties, gross incompetence and oppression.” Specifically, complainant 
faults respondent judge for entertaining the ex parte motion for issuance of 
alias writ of execution despite lack of proof of service. This is purportedly in 
violation of Section 4, Rule 15 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 4. Hearing of motion. – Except for motions which the court may act upon 
without prejudicing the rights of the adverse party, every written motion shall 
be set for hearing by the applicant.</p>
<p>Every written motion required to be heard and the notice of the hearing 
thereof shall be served in such a manner as to ensure its receipt by the other 
party at least three (3) days before the date of hearing, unless the court for 
good cause sets the hearing on shorter notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>More to the point, Section 6 of the same Rule provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 6. Proof of service necessary. – No written motion set for hearing shall 
be acted upon by the court without proof of service thereof.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, respondent judge allegedly failed to decide the case within the 
period prescribed by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p>Respondent judge claims that he acted within the bounds of law in granting 
the Ex Parte Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution even though the 
motion did not contain any proof of service. He argues that since the 
defendants-appellants failed to file a supersedeas bond and to deposit the 
rentals, “it [was] mandatory for the regional trial court to order execution of 
the appealed judgment. Its duty to do so is ministerial and imperative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p>
<p>It bears clarifying that respondent judge is charged not with entertaining 
the motion for the original issuance of a writ of execution but with issuing the 
alias writ of execution, the motion for which did not contain any proof of 
service.</p>
<p>Alias writs of execution are usually issued in lieu of the original writ of 
execution that had already lapsed. Before the 1997 revision to the Rules of 
Civil Procedure, the lifetime of a writ of execution, under then Section 11, 
Rule 39 “was 60 days from its receipt by the officer required to enforce the 
same and after said period, the writ becomes functus officio.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 11. <em>Return of writ of execution</em>. – The writ of execution may be 
made returnable, to the clerk or judge of the court issuing it, at any time not 
less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days after its receipt by the 
officer who must set forth in writing on its back the whole of his proceedings 
by virtue thereof, and file it with the clerk or judge to be preserved with the 
other papers in the case. A certified copy of the record, in the execution book 
kept by the clerk, of an execution by virtue of which real property has been 
sold, or of the officer’s return thereon, shall be evidence of the contents of 
the originals whenever they, or any part thereof, have been lost or 
destroyed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, plaintiffs-appellees in Civil Case No. Q-97-31799 were of the 
impression that the writ of execution issued on November 25, 1997 had already 
lapsed when they filed their motion for an alias writ on November 9, 1998.</p>
<p>However, it must be noted that under the present Section 14, Rule 39, the 
lifetime of the writ of execution is no longer 60 days but “during the period 
within which the judgment may be enforced by motion, that is, within 5 years 
from entry thereof.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 14. <em>Return of writ of execution</em>. – The writ of execution shall 
be returnable to the court issuing it immediately after the judgment has been 
satisfied in part or in full. If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within 
thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the 
court and state the reason therefor. Such writ shall continue in effect during 
the period within which the judgment may be enforced by motion. The officer 
shall make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings taken 
thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full, or its effectivity expires. The 
returns or the periodic reports shall set forth the whole of the proceedings 
taken, and shall be filed with the court and copies thereof promptly furnished 
the parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the original writ of execution, which was issued on November 25, 1997, 
was still effective when plaintiff-appellee filed his motion for issuance of 
alias writ of execution on November 9, 1998. The alias writ was superfluous; 
there was no need for respondent judge to issue one.</p>
<p>Viewed in this light, the motion in question was nothing more than a mode by 
which the plaintiff-appellee informed or reminded the court that the writ had 
not yet been implemented. Likewise, the “alias” writ of execution may be 
construed as an order directing the sheriff to implement the “original” writ. 
The motion need not be litigated since the court “may act upon the same without 
prejudicing the rights of the adverse party.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The prejudice to the 
defendants-appellants that would result from an order directing the 
implementation of the writ would have been no greater than the previous issuance 
of the “original” writ. As there was no need for a hearing on the motion, the 
provisions of Sections 4 and 6 of Rule 15 – in particular, that of proof of 
service to the adverse party – are inapplicable.</p>
<p>Defendants-appellants could not have successfully argued that they were 
deprived of due process as a result of the ex parte issuance of the “alias” 
writ. First, they were already heard on motion for reconsideration after the 
court issued the “original” writ. Second, if defendants-appellants wished to 
stay execution because of, say, “supervening circumstances”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> or some other ground, they could have 
filed a motion to that effect. The “original” writ, to repeat, was still in 
effect and had not expired.</p>
<p>While respondent judge’s rationale for issuing the “alias” writ is based on 
grounds different from those stated herein, in the end, he did not commit error 
in granting the motion ex parte. In any case, to justify the taking of drastic 
disciplinary action, the law requires that the error or mistake, should there be 
any, must be gross or patent, malicious, deliberate or in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Court does not discern any 
inclination on his part to give “unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference” 
to the plaintiff-appellant or of any “manifest partiality, evident bad faith or 
inexcusable negligence” when he issued the order granting the alias writ.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, respondent judge is administratively liable for the delay in 
deciding Civil Case No. Q-97-31799. Indeed, he admitted the delay and “some sort 
of administrative lapse” on his part, and “plead[s] on bended knees for… 
understanding, compassion and mercy.” He explained that his heavy workload 
caused him to rely greatly on his subordinate, who inadvertently failed to 
include Civil Case No. Q-97-31799 in the list of cases submitted for 
decision.</p>
<p>(a) At the time of my appointment as Presiding Judge of the RTC, Branch 77, 
Quezon City, in November 1997, I was on detail at the RTC, Branch 17, Manila. 
And having been previously detailed for more than 2-1/2 years at the RTC, Branch 
157, Pasig City, I had to continue hearing the cases which I have started in 
Pasig City by virtue of an existing Supreme Court Circular mandating it. So in 
the early months of my stint in the RTC of Quezon City, I was hearing cases in 
three (3) different courts: in RTC, Branch 77, Quezon City, in RTC, Branch 157, 
Pasig City, and in RTC, Branch 17, Manila. I heard cases in Quezon City in the 
morning, and held sessions in Pasig City and Manila alternately in the 
afternoon. Because of such tight schedule, I devised a simple system by which I 
could be reminded of the cases for decision in Quezon City. I caused the posting 
of two (2) white boards, wherein, upon my instruction, the Branch Clerk of 
Court, Atty. Jennifer A. Pilar, listed all the cases submitted for decision and 
stating therein the dates of submission for decision and the due dates for 
deciding them. But they inadvertently failed to include the subject appealed 
ejectment case in the list, as has been attested to by Atty. Jennifer A. Pilar 
in her attached Affidavit which has been marked as Annex “O”;</p>
<p>(b) In or about March, 1997, I was directed to continue handling the election 
protest, entitled “Alan Peter Cayetano vs. Loida Labao”, in Branch 157, RTC, 
Pasig City, wherein I had previously inhibited myself on the ground of 
<strong>delicadeza extremada.</strong> I had to personally open about seven 
hundred 700 ballot boxes and, in doing so, I had to go to Pasig City every 
afternoon, I think, for more than two (2) months and toiled into the late 
afternoon and even early evening to complete the examination of the ballots in 
about 700 ballot boxes in Taguig, Metro Manila.</p>
<p>(c) After I decided the election protest sometime in June, 1998, I studied 
the records of five (5) inherited cases which were sent to me by the Office of 
the Court Administrator for decision. Although, I believed that these cases 
should have been decided by the new Presiding Judge of the RTC, Branch 157, 
Pasig City, I dutifully decided the cases, which were old cases with voluminous 
records, and submitted my decisions to the Office of the Court Management, 
Office of the Court Administrator sometime in September, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p>
<p>The Court finds the foregoing explanation unacceptable. A judge is mandated 
to render judgment not more than ninety (90) days from the time the case is 
submitted for decision and his inability to decide a case within the required 
period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p>
<p>Respondent judge’s reliance on the branch clerk of court whose alleged 
carelessness caused the delay does not excuse him from liability. As the OCA, in 
its Report, pointed out, “a judge ought to know the cases submitted to him for 
decision or resolution and is expected to keep his own record of cases so that 
he may act on them promptly.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
Ultimately, the administrative responsibility for the prompt and speedy 
disposition of cases rests on the judge’s shoulders. The Code of Judicial 
Conduct requires judges to organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure 
the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all times the 
observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The same Code charges him with the duty 
of diligently discharging administrative responsibilities, maintaining 
professional competence in court management, and facilitating the performance of 
the administrative functions of other judges and court personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p>
<p>Respondent’s undisputed claim that he resolved all other cases within the 
90-day period, his candor in acknowledging the delay, and the lack of undue 
damage upon complainant caused by the delay, however, serve to mitigate his 
liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Court Administrator 
Alfredo L. Benipayo recommended that respondent be fined the amount of One 
Thousand Pesos.</p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the Court finds respondent Judge Vivencio S. 
Baclig of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City administratively liable for 
gross inefficiency. He is ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of One Thousand 
Pesos (P1,000.00) and WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar act shall 
be dealt with more severely.</p>
