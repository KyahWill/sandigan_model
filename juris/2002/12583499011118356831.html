				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A law may not be constitutionally infirm but its application to a particular party may be unconstitutional.&nbsp; This is the submission of the petitioner who invokes the equal protection clause of the Constitution in his bid to be excluded from the charge of plunder filed against him by the respondent Ombudsman.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>In November 2000, as an offshoot of the impeachment proceedings against Joseph Ejercito Estrada, then President of the Republic of the Philippines, five criminal complaints against the former President and members of his family, his associates, friends and conspirators were filed with the respondent Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>On April 4, 2001, the respondent Ombudsman issued a Joint Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> finding probable cause warranting the filing with the Sandiganbayan of several criminal Informations against the former President and the other respondents therein. One of the Informations was for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080 and among the respondents was herein petitioner Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, then mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila.<br><br>The Information was amended and filed on April 18, 2001.&nbsp; Docketed as Criminal Case No. 26558, the case was assigned to respondent Third Division of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; The arraignment of the accused was set on July 10, 2001 and no bail for petitioner’s provisional liberty was fixed.<br><br>On April 24, 2001, petitioner filed a “Motion to Quash or Suspend” the Amended Information on the ground that the Anti-Plunder Law, R.A. No. 7080, is unconstitutional and that it charged more than one offense.&nbsp; Respondent Ombudsman opposed the motion.<br><br>On April 25, 2001, the respondent court issued a warrant of arrest for petitioner and his co-accused.&nbsp; On its basis, petitioner and his co-accused were placed in custody of the law.<br><br>On April 30, 2001, petitioner filed a “Very Urgent Omnibus Motion”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> alleging that: (1) no probable cause exists to put him on trial and hold him liable for plunder, it appearing that he was only allegedly involved in illegal gambling and not in a “series or combination of overt or criminal acts” as required in R.A. No. 7080; and (2) he is entitled to bail as a matter of right.&nbsp; Petitioner prayed that he be excluded from the Amended Information and be discharged from custody.&nbsp; In the alternative, petitioner also prayed that he be allowed to post bail in an amount to be fixed by respondent court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 2001, petitioner filed a “Motion to Resolve Mayor Jose ‘Jinggoy’ Estrada’s Motion To Fix Bail On Grounds That An Outgoing Mayor Loses Clout An Incumbent Has And That On Its Face, the Facts Charged In The Information Do Not Make Out A Non-Bailable Offense As To Him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On July 3, 2001, petitioner filed a “Motion to Strike Out So-Called ‘Entry of Appearance,’ To Direct Ombudsman To Explain Why He Attributes Impropriety To The Defense And To Resolve Pending Incidents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 9, 2001, respondent Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying petitioner’s “Motion to Quash and Suspend” and “Very Urgent Omnibus Motion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petitioner’s alternative prayer to post bail was set for hearing after arraignment of all accused.&nbsp; The court held:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby DENIES for lack of merit the following: (1) MOTION TO QUASH AND SUSPEND dated April 24, 2001 filed by accused Jose ‘Jinggoy’ Estrada; (2) MOTION TO QUASH dated June 7, 2001 filed by accused Joseph Ejercito Estrada; and (3) MOTION TO QUASH (Re: Amended Information dated 18 April 2001) dated June 26, 2001 filed by accused Edward S. Serapio.<br><br>Considering the denial of the MOTION TO QUASH AND SUSPEND of accused Jose ‘Jinggoy’ Estrada, his VERY URGENT OMNIBUS MOTION, praying that he be: (1) dropped from the information for plunder for want of probable cause and (2) discharged from custody immediately which is based on the same grounds mentioned in this MOTION TO QUASH AND SUSPEND is hereby DENIED.&nbsp; Let his alternative prayer in said OMNIBUS MOTION that he be allowed to post bail be SET for hearing together with the petition for bail of accused Edward S. Serapio scheduled for July 10, 2001, at 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon after the arraignment of all the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The following day, July 10, 2001, petitioner moved for reconsideration of the Resolution.&nbsp; Respondent court denied the motion and proceeded to arraign petitioner.&nbsp; Petitioner refused to make his plea prompting respondent court to enter a plea of “not guilty” for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.&nbsp; Petitioner claims that respondent Sandiganbayan acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in:<br><blockquote>“1) not declaring that R.A. No. 7080 is unconstitutional on its face and, as applied to petitioner, and denying him the equal protection of the laws;<br><br>2) not holding that the Plunder Law does not provide complete and sufficient standards;<br><br>3) sustaining the charge against petitioner for alleged offenses, and with alleged conspirators, with which and with whom he is not even remotely connected - contrary to the dictum that criminal liability is personal, not vicarious - results in the denial of substantive due process;<br><br>4) not fixing bail for petitioner for alleged involvement in jueteng in one count of the information which amounts to cruel and unusual punishment totally in defiance of the principle of proportionality.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>We shall resolve the arguments of petitioner <i>in seriatim</i>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>Petitioner contends that R.A.

No. 7080 is unconstitutional as applied to him is principally perched on the premise that the Amended Information charged him with only one act or one offense which cannot constitute plunder.&nbsp; He then assails the denial of his right to bail.<br><br>Petitioner’s premise is patently false.&nbsp; A careful examination of the Amended Information will show that it is divided into three (3) parts: (1) the first paragraph charges former President Joseph E. Estrada with the crime of plunder together with petitioner Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, Charlie “Atong” Ang, Edward Serapio, Yolanda Ricaforte and others; (2) the second paragraph spells out in general terms how the accused conspired in committing the crime of plunder; and (3) the following four sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) describe in detail the predicate acts constitutive of the crime of plunder pursuant to items (1) to (6) of R.A. No. 7080, and state the names of the accused who committed each act.<br><br><b>Pertinent to the case at bar is the predicate act alleged in sub-paragraph (a) of the Amended Information</b> which is of “receiving or collecting, directly or indirectly, <b>on several instances,</b> money in the aggregate amount of P545,000,000.00 for illegal gambling in the form of gift, share, percentage, kickback or any form of pecuniary benefit x x x.” In this sub-paragraph (a), petitioner, in conspiracy with former President Estrada, is charged with the act of receiving or collecting money from illegal gambling amounting to P545 million.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner’s posture, the allegation is that he received or collected money from illegal gambling <b>“on several instances.” The phrase “on several instances” means the petitioner committed the predicate act in series.</b>&nbsp; To insist that the Amended Information charged the petitioner with the commission of only one act or offense despite the phrase “several instances” is to indulge in a twisted, nay, “pretzel” interpretation.<br><br>It matters little that sub-paragraph (a) did not utilize the exact words “combination” or “series” as they appear in R.A. No. 7080.&nbsp; For in <b>Estrada v. Sandiganbayan,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we held that where these two terms are to be taken in their popular, not technical, meaning, the word “series” is synonymous with the clause “on several instances.” “Series” refers to a repetition of the same predicate act in any of the items in Section 1 (d) of the law.&nbsp; The word “combination” contemplates the commission of at least any two different predicate acts in any of said items.&nbsp; <b>Plainly, sub-paragraph (a) of the Amended Information charges petitioner with plunder committed by a series of the same predicate act under Section 1 (d) (2) of the law.</b><br><br>Similarly misleading is petitioner’s stand that in the Ombudsman Resolution of April 4, 2001 finding probable cause to charge him with plunder together with the other accused, he was alleged to have received only the sum of P2 million, which amount is way below the minimum of P50 million required under R.A. No. 7080.&nbsp; The submission is not borne out by the April 4, 2001 Resolution of the Ombudsman, recommending the filing of charges against petitioner and his co-accused, which in pertinent part reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Respondent Jose ‘Jinggoy’ Estrada, the present Mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila, appears to have also surreptitious collection of protection money from jueteng operations in Bulacan.&nbsp; This is gleaned from the statements of Gov. Singson himself and the fact that Mayor Estrada, <b>on at least two occasions,</b> turned over to a certain Emma Lim, an emissary of the respondent governor, jueteng haul totalling P2 million, i.e., P1 million in January, 2000 and another P1 million in February, 2000. An alleged “<i>listahan</i>” of jueteng recipients listed him as one “Jingle Bell,” as affirmed by Singson [TSN 8 &amp; Dec. 2000 SICt/17 Oct. 2000 SBRC/SCI].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>Hence, contrary to the representations of the petitioner, the Ombudsman made the finding that P2 million was delivered to petitioner as “jueteng haul” on “<b>at least two occasions.</b>” The P2 million is, therefore, <b>not the entire sum</b> with which petitioner is specifically charged.&nbsp; This is further confirmed by the conclusion of the Ombudsman that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>It is clear that Joseph Ejercito Estrada, in confabulation with Jose ‘Jinggoy’ Estrada, Atty. Edward Serapio and Yolanda Ricaforte, demanded and received, as bribe money, the aggregate sum of P545 million from jueteng collections of the operators thereof, channeled thru Gov. Luis ‘Chavit’ Singson, in exchange for protection from arrest or interference by law enforcers; x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>To be sure, it is too late in the day for the petitioner to argue that the Ombudsman failed to establish any probable cause against him for plunder.&nbsp; The respondent Sandiganbayan itself has found probable cause against the petitioner for which reason it issued a warrant of arrest against him.&nbsp; Petitioner then underwent arraignment and is now on trial.&nbsp; The time to assail the finding of probable cause by the Ombudsman has long passed.&nbsp; The issue cannot be resurrected in this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II.</b><br></div><br>Next, petitioner contends that “the plunder law does not provide sufficient and complete standards to guide the courts in dealing with accused alleged to have contributed to the offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, he posits the following questions:<br><blockquote>“For example, in an Information for plunder which cites at least ten criminal acts, what penalty do we impose on one who is clearly involved in only one such criminal act?&nbsp; Is it <i>reclusion perpetua</i>? Or should it be a lesser penalty? What if another accused is shown to have participated in three of the ten specifications, what would be the penalty imposable, compared to one who may have been involved in five or seven of the specifications?&nbsp; The law does not provide the standard or specify the penalties and the courts are left to guess.&nbsp; In other words, the courts are called to say what the law is rather than to apply what the lawmaker is supposed to have intended.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner raises these hypothetical questions for he labors hard under the impression that: (1) he is charged with only one act or offense and (2) he has not conspired with the other accused named in sub-paragraphs (b) to (d) of the Amended Information, <i>ergo</i>, the penalty imposable on him ought to be different from <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; R.A. No. 7080, he bewails, is cloudy on the imposable penalty on an accused similarly situated as he is.&nbsp; Petitioner, however, overlooks that the second paragraph of the Amended Information charges him to have conspired with former President Estrada in committing the crime of plunder.&nbsp; His alleged participation consists in the commission of the predicate acts specified in sub-paragraph (a) of the Amended Information.&nbsp; If these allegations are proven, the penalty of petitioner cannot be unclear.&nbsp; It will be no different&nbsp; from that of the former President for in conspiracy, the act of one is the act of the other.&nbsp; The imposable penalty is provided in Section 2 of R.A. No. 7080, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“<i>Section 2.</i> Any public officer who, by himself <b>or in connivance</b> with the members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of&nbsp; overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and <b>shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death</b>.&nbsp; Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense.&nbsp; In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court.”</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III.</b><br></div><br>Petitioner also faults the respondent Sandiganbayan for “sustaining the charge against petitioner for alleged offenses and with alleged conspirators, with which and with whom he is not even remotely connected – contrary to the dictum that criminal liability is personal, not vicarious – results in the denial of substantive due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General argues, on the other hand, that petitioner is charged not only with the predicate act in sub-paragraph (a) but also with the other predicate acts in sub-paragraphs (b), (c) &amp; (d) because he is indicted as a principal and as co-conspirator of the former President.&nbsp; This is purportedly clear from the first and second paragraphs of the Amended Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>For better focus, there is a need to examine again the allegations of the Amended Information <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provisions of R.A. No. 7080.<br><br>The Amended Information, in its first two paragraphs, charges petitioner and his other co-accused with the crime of plunder.&nbsp; The first paragraph names all the accused, while the second paragraph describes in general how plunder was committed&nbsp; and lays down most of the elements of the crime itself.&nbsp; <b>Sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) describe in detail the predicate acts that constitute the crime and name in particular the co-conspirators of former President Estrada in each predicate act.&nbsp; The predicate acts alleged in the said four sub-paragraphs correspond to the items enumerated in Section 1 (d) of R.A. No. 7080.</b>&nbsp; Sub-paragraph (a) alleged the predicate act of receiving, on several instances, money from illegal gambling, in consideration of toleration or protection of illegal gambling, and expressly names petitioner as one of those who conspired with former President Estrada in committing the offense.&nbsp; This predicate act corresponds with the offense described in item <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the enumeration in Section 1 (d) of R.A. No. 7080.&nbsp; Sub-paragraph (b) alleged the predicate act of diverting, receiving or misappropriating a portion of the tobacco excise tax share allocated for the province of Ilocos Sur, which act is the offense described in item <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in the enumeration in Section 1 (d) of the law.&nbsp; This sub-paragraph does not mention petitioner but instead names other conspirators of the former President. Sub-paragraph (c) alleged two predicate acts - that of ordering the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS) to purchase shares of stock of Belle Corporation, and collecting or receiving commissions from such purchase from the Belle Corporation which became part of the deposit in the “Jose Velarde” account at the Equitable-PCI Bank.&nbsp; These two predicate acts fall under items [2] and [3] in the enumeration of R.A. No. 7080, and was allegedly committed by the former President in connivance with John Does and Jane Does.&nbsp; Finally, sub-paragraph (d) alleged the predicate act that the former President unjustly enriched himself from commissions, gifts, kickbacks, in connivance with John Does and Jane Does, and deposited the same under his account name “Jose Velarde” at the Equitable-PCI Bank. This act corresponds to the offense under item [6] in the enumeration of Section 1 (d) of R.A. No. 7080.<br><br>From the foregoing allegations of the Amended Information, it is clear that all the accused named in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d), thru their individual acts, <b>conspired with former President Estrada</b> to enable the latter to amass, accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount of P4,097,804,173.17.&nbsp; As the Amended Information <b>is worded</b>, however, it is not certain whether the accused in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) <b>conspired with each other</b> to enable the former President to amass the subject ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; In light of this lack of clarity, petitioner cannot be penalized for the conspiracy entered into by the other accused with the former President as related in the second paragraph of the Amended Information in relation to its sub-paragraphs (b) to (d).&nbsp; We hold that petitioner can be held accountable <b>only</b> for the predicate acts he allegedly committed as related in sub-paragraph (a) of the Amended Information which were allegedly done in conspiracy with the former President whose design was to amass ill-gotten wealth amounting to more than P4 billion.<br><br><b>We hasten to add, however, that the respondent Ombudsman cannot be faulted for including the predicate acts alleged in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of the Amended Information in one, and not in four, separate Informations</b>.&nbsp; A study of the history of R.A. No. 7080 will show that the law was crafted to avoid the mischief and folly of filing multiple informations.&nbsp; The Anti-Plunder Law was enacted in the aftermath of the <b>Marcos regime</b> where charges of ill-gotten wealth were filed against former President Marcos and his alleged cronies. <b>Government prosecutors found no appropriate law to deal with the multitude and magnitude of the acts allegedly committed by the former President to acquire illegal wealth.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> They also found that under the then existing laws such as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the Revised Penal Code and other special laws, the acts involved different transactions, different time and different personalities.&nbsp; <b>Every transaction constituted a separate crime and required a separate case and the over-all conspiracy had to be broken down into several criminal and graft charges.</b>&nbsp; The preparation of multiple Informations was a legal nightmare but eventually, thirty-nine (39) separate and independent cases were filed against&nbsp; practically the same accused before the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> R.A. No. 7080 or the Anti-Plunder Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> was enacted precisely to address this procedural problem.&nbsp; This is pellucid in the Explanatory Note to Senate Bill No. 733, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>“Plunder, a term chosen from other equally apt terminologies like kleptocracy and economic treason, punishes the use of high office for personal enrichment, committed thru a series of acts done not in the public eye but in stealth and secrecy over a period of time, that may involve so many persons, here and abroad, and which touch so many states and territorial units.&nbsp; <b>The acts and/or omissions sought to be penalized do not involve simple cases of malversation of public funds, bribery, extortion, theft and graft but constitute plunder of an entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy.</b>&nbsp; The above-described crime does not yet exist in Philippine statute books.&nbsp; Thus, the need to come up with a legislation as a safeguard against the possible recurrence of the depravities of the previous regime and as a deterrent to those with similar inclination to succumb to the corrupting influence of power.”</blockquote>There is no denying the fact that the “plunder of an entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy” is made up of a complex and manifold network of crimes.&nbsp;

Sec. 1961 <i>et seq.</i>).&nbsp; Under the RICO, it is “unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.” “Racketeering activity” includes a great variety of serious criminal conduct, such as murder, kidnapping, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion and drug dealing, and for there to be a “pattern” there must be at least two such acts within a 10-year span.&nbsp; The RICO has its own conspiracy provision.<br><br>In <b>United States v. Elliot</b>, 571 F 2d 880 [5th Cir. 1978], it was held that the RICO created a substantive offense by tying together diverse parties and crimes.&nbsp; It is irrelevant that each defendant participated in the enterprise’s affairs through different, even unrelated crimes, so long as it may be reasonably inferred that each crime was intended to further the enterprise’s affairs (at 902-903).&nbsp; The <b>Elliot</b> approach has been sharply criticized by legal commentators.&nbsp; <b>Elliot</b> made certain affairs of an enterprise a new substantive offense in addition to the underlying racketeering activity.&nbsp; The requirement remains that the activities making up a multiple criminal conspiracy must be connected, and the term ‘enterprise’ as applied by <b>Elliot</b> did not supply the connection.&nbsp; Recent trend rejects the ideas espoused in <b>Elliot</b> and returns to traditional conspiracy principles in determining complicity in multi-defendant RICO prosecutions.—LaFave &amp; Scott, <i>supra</i> at 554 citing United States v.

and (2) be discharged from custody immediately since he was being charged only with illegal gambling under first specification of the accusatory Information or, in the alternative, be allowed to post bail.<br><br>In its resolution of 09 July 2001, the Sandiganbayan denied the motion to quash, which was consolidated with similar motions filed by Mr. Joseph Estrada and Mr. Edward Serapio, and set the hearing for bail on 10 July 2001.<br><br>On the day the hearing for bail was set, petitioner filed his “Urgent Motion for Reconsideration,” stressing that his urgent omnibus motion had specifically asked the Sandiganbayan to fix bail.&nbsp; On 10 July 2001, the Sandiganbayan denied the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, the recourse to this Court where he contends that -<br><blockquote>"RESPONDENT COURT (HAS) ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION IN-<br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="center">"1)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">NOT DECLARING THAT R.A. 7080 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AND, AS APPLIED TO PETITIONER, AND DENYING HIM THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">"2) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">NOT HOLDING THAT THE PLUNDER LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE COMPLETE AND SUFFICIENT STANDARDS.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">"3) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">SUSTAINING THE CHARGE AGAINST PETITIONER FOR ALLEGED OFFENSES, AND WITH ALLEGED CONSPIRATORS, WITH WHICH AND WITH WHOM HE IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY CONNECTED-CONTRARY TO THE DICTUM THAT CRIMINAL LIABILITY IS PERSONAL, NOT VICARIOUS- RESULTS IN THE DENIAL OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">"4) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">NOT FIXING BAIL FOR PETITIONER FOR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN JUETENG IN ONE COUNT OF THE INFORMATION WHICH AMOUNTS TO CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT TOTALLY IN DEFIANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY."</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>According to petitioner, considering that he is said to have been involved, per the accusatory&nbsp;

It is solely in the context bearing on the extent of the alleged "conspiracy" involving petitioner in the charge of plunder under the statute that I am expressing this separate opinion.&nbsp; The issue I propose to instead submit is whether or not the allegations against petitioner in the accusatory Information would suffice to suit the “series” or the “combination” contemplated in, and understood by the Court in upholding the constitutionality of, the plunder law.<br><br>Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>“SEC. 2.&nbsp; Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties.&nbsp; – Any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof, in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense.&nbsp; In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court.&nbsp; The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State.”</blockquote>Plunder may be committed by any public officer either by himself or “in connivance” with other persons; it may also be committed by a person who participates with a public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder.&nbsp; A person may thus be held accountable under the law by conniving with the principal co-accused or by <b>participating</b> in the commission of “an offense” contributing to the crime of plunder.&nbsp; The term "in connivance" would suggest an agreement or consent to commit an unlawful act or deed with or by another, to <i>connive</i> being to cooperate secretly or privily with another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Upon the other hand, to <i>participate</i> is to have a part or a share in conjunction with another of the proceeds of the unlawful act or deed.<br><br>The amended Information alleged "connivance" and would assume that petitioner and his co-accused had a common design in perpetrating the violations complained of constitutive of "plunder."<br><br>The Supreme Court in Estrada vs. Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> has declared the anti-plunder law constitutional for being neither vague nor ambiguous on the thesis that the terms "series" and "combination" are not unsusceptible to firm understanding. “Series” refers to <b>two or more acts</b> falling under the same category of the enumerated acts provided in Section 1(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the statute;

Nowhere in the charge sheet would it appear that petitioner was likewise being indicted for any of the other charges contained in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of that information.&nbsp; Relative to paragraph (a), the accusation of conspiracy between petitioner and the former President was, per the records of the case, evidently and for all intents and purposes, confined to the alleged collections in Bulacan of jueteng money, specifically, in the sum of <b>P2,000,000.00</b>, far too short of the statutory minimum of P50,000,000.00 under the law, that was then turned over to an acknowledged emissary of Mr. Luis Singson.&nbsp; The accusatory information, aforequoted, was filed on the basis of the Joint Resolution, dated 04 April 2001, of the Office of the Ombudsman; to wit:<br><blockquote>"Respondent Jose `Jinggoy' Estrada, the present Mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila, appears to have also surreptitious collection of protection money from jueteng operations in Bulacan.&nbsp; This is gleaned from the statement of Gov. Singson himself and the fact that Mayor Estrada, on at least two occasions, turned over to a certain Emma Lim, an emissary of the respondent governor, jueteng haul totaling P2 million i.e., P1 million in January, 2000 and another P1 million in February, 2000.&nbsp; An alleged `<u>listahan</u>' of jueteng recipients listed him as one `Jingle Bell,' as affirmed by Singson.&nbsp; (TSN, 8 &amp; 11 Dec. 2000 SICt/17 Oct. 2000 SBRC/SCJ).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>"Thus, Gov. Luis `Chavit' Singson effected the collection of jueteng money from the jueteng operators in the northern provinces after getting the job from Charlie `Atong' Ang on direct orders of then President Estrada; Yolanda Ricaforte saw to it the excess collection moneys were deposited in her account on behalf or the former president, aside from the latter directly received from Singson; Edward Serapio put up the Muslim Youth Foundation, Inc. wherein P200 million from the jueteng collection was channeled by Gov. Singson, through Ricaforte, Designed the eventually reach Erap Estrada, with the organization serving only as a money laundering front; and, as part of the whole operation, Mayor Jinggoy Estrada collected money in Bulacan, code named `Jingle Bell,' and known to have turned over P2 million to Emma Lim, Singson's acknowledged emissary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The government argues that the illegal act ascribed to petitioner is a part of the chain that links the various acts of plunder by the principal accused.&nbsp; It seems to suggest that a mere allegation of conspiracy is quite enough to hold petitioner equally liable with the principal accused for the latter's other acts, even if unknown to him, in paragraph (a) of the indictment.&nbsp; This contention is a glaring bent.&nbsp; It is, to my mind, utterly unacceptable, neither right nor just, to cast criminal liability on one for the acts or deeds of plunder that may have been committed by another or others over which he has not consented or acceded to, participated in, or even in fact been aware of.&nbsp; Such vicarious criminal liability is never to be taken lightly but must always be made explicit not merely at the trial but likewise, and no less important, in the complaint or information itself in order to meet the fundamental right of an accused to be fully informed of the charge against him.&nbsp; It is a requirement that cannot be dispensed with if he were to be meaningfully assured that he truly has a right to defend himself.&nbsp; Indeed, an unwarranted generalization on the scope of the anti-plunder law would be a fatal blow to maintaining its constitutionality given the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in the pronouncement heretofore made by the Court upholding the validity of the statute.<br><br>Given the foregoing exegesis, the petitioner, although ineffectively charged in the Amended Information for plunder, could still be prosecuted and tried for a lesser offense, for it is a recognized rule that an accused shall not be discharged even when a mistake has been made in charging the proper offense if he may still be held accountable for any other offense necessarily included in the crime being charged.&nbsp; It is, however, the Sandiganbayan, not this Court, which must make this determination on the basis of its own findings.<br><br>WHEREFORE, I vote for the remand of the case to the Sandiganbayan for further proceedings on the merits thereof with instructions that it shall, forthwith, consider the plea for bail of petitioner.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> GR.

(b) the designation of the offense given by the statute; (c) the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; (d) the name of the offended party; (e) the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and (4) the place where the offense was committed.&nbsp; When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Regarding the designation of the offense, Section 8, Rule 110 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8.&nbsp;

If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.</blockquote>Section 9, Rule 110, governing the cause of the accusation, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 9. <i>Cause of the accusation</i>. – The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and enable the court to pronounce judgment.</blockquote>While Section 8 requires that the complaint or information state the designation of the offense given by the statute or, if there be no such designation, make reference to the section or subsection to the statute punishing it, such designation or reference is not controlling.&nbsp; The nature and character of the crime charged is determined not by the specification of the provision of the law alleged to have been violated but by the facts alleged in the indictment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Justice Trent, in <i>United States vs. Lim San</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> expounded on the rationale behind the rule:<br><blockquote>x x x.&nbsp; Notwithstanding apparent contradiction between caption and body, we believe that we ought to say and hold that the characterization of the crime by the fiscal in the caption of the information is immaterial and purposeless, and that the facts stated in the body of the pleading must determine the crime of which the defendant stands charged and for which he must be tried.&nbsp; The establishment of this doctrine is permitted by the Code of Criminal Procedure, and is thoroughly in accord with common sense and with the requirements of plain justice.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>From a legal point of view, and in a very real sense, it is of no concern to the accused what is the technical name of the crime of which he stands charged.&nbsp;&nbsp; It in no way aids him in a defense on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; That to which his attention should be directed, and in which he, above all things else, should be most interested, are the facts alleged.&nbsp; The real question is not did he commit a crime given in the law some technical and specific name, but did he perform the acts alleged in the body of the information in the manner therein set forth.&nbsp; If he did, it is of no consequence to him, either as a matter of procedure or of substantive right, how the law denominates the crime which those acts constitute.&nbsp; The designation of the crime by name in the caption of the information from the facts alleged in the body of that pleading is a conclusion of law made by the fiscal.&nbsp; In the designation of the crime the accused never has a real interest until the trial has ended.&nbsp; For his full and complete defense he need not know the name of the crime at all.&nbsp; It is of no consequence whatever for the protection of his substantial rights.&nbsp; The real and important question to him is, “Did you perform the acts alleged in the manner alleged?”&nbsp;&nbsp; If he performed the acts alleged, in the manner stated, the law determines what the name of the crime is and fixes the penalty therefor.&nbsp; It is the province of the court alone to say what the crime is or what it is named.&nbsp; x x x.</blockquote>In short, the complaint or information must allege facts, not conclusions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The majority holds that since conspiracy is not the gravamen of plunder, but relates to the manner of committing the crime, its particularities need not be alleged in the information.&nbsp; The <i>ponencia</i> cites <i>People vs. Quitlong,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> where it was held that the information <b>must</b> be alleged in the information in order that an accused may be held liable for the acts of his co-accused:<br><blockquote>x x x.&nbsp; In embodying the essential elements of the crime charged, <b>the information must set forth the facts and circumstances that have a bearing on the culpability and liability of the accused so that the accused can properly prepare for and undertake his defense.&nbsp; One such fact or circumstance in a complaint against two or more accused persons is that of conspiracy.</b>&nbsp; Quite unlike the omission of an ordinary recital of fact which, if not excepted from or objected to during trial, may be corrected or supplied by competent proof, <b>an allegation, however, of conspiracy, or one that would impute criminal liability to an accused for the act of another or others, is indispensable in order to hold such person, regardless of the nature and extent of his own participation, equally guilty with the other or others in the commission of the crime.</b>&nbsp; Where conspiracy exists and can rightly be appreciated, the individual acts done to perpetrate the felony becomes of secondary importance, the act of one being imputable to all the others.&nbsp; [Citing People vs. Ilano, 313 SCRA 442.]&nbsp; <b>Verily, an accused must know from the information whether he faces a criminal responsibility not only for his acts but also for the acts of his co-accused as well.</b></blockquote><i>Quitlong</i> first broadly described how conspiracy should be alleged in the complaint or information:<br><blockquote>A conspiracy indictment need not, of course aver all the components of conspiracy or allege all the details thereof like the part that each of the parties therein have performed, the evidence proving the common design or the facts connecting all the accused with one another in the web of the conspiracy.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary to describe conspiracy with the same degree of particularity required in describing a substantive offense.&nbsp; <b>It is enough that the indictment contains a statement of the facts relied upon to be constitutive of the offense in ordinary and concise language, with as much certainty as the nature of the case will admit, in a manner that can enable a person of common understanding to know what is intended, and with such precision that the accused may plead his acquittal or conviction to a subsequent indictment based on the same facts.</b>&nbsp; It is said, generally, that an indictment may be held sufficient “if it follows the words of the character of the offense he is charged with conspiring to commit, or, following the language of the statute, contains a sufficient statement of an overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy, or alleges both the contemplated crime in the language of the statutes defining them.”&nbsp; [Citing 15A, C.J.S., 842-844.]</blockquote>It bears noting that the foregoing paragraph cites Corpus Juris Secundum, an American authority.&nbsp; A perusal thereof reveals that the “conspiracy” it refers to is conspiracy as a <i>crime</i>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> as a <i>mode</i> of committing the crime, which concepts the <i>ponencia</i> has taken pains to distinguish.<br><br><i>Quitlong</i> then went on to illustrate how conspiracy should be specifically alleged:<br><blockquote>x x x.&nbsp; Conspiracy arises when two or more persons come into agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.&nbsp; Conspiracy comes to life at the very instant the plotters agree, expressly or impliedly, to commit the felony and forthwith to actually pursue it.&nbsp; [Citing Article 8, Revised Penal Code; People vs. Mirabete, 318 Phil. 146 (1995).]&nbsp; Verily, <b>the information must state that the accused have confederated to commit the crime or that there has been a community of design, a unity of purpose or an agreement to commit the felony among the accused.&nbsp; Such an allegation, in the absence of the usual usage of the words, “conspired” or “confederated” or the phrase “acting in conspiracy,” must aptly appear in the information in the form of definitive acts constituting conspiracy.&nbsp; In fine, the agreement to commit the crime, the unity or purpose or the community of design among the accused must be conveyed such as <i>either</i> by the use of the term “conspire” or its derivatives and synonyms <i>or</i> by allegations of basic facts constituting the conspiracy.</b>&nbsp; Conspiracy must be alleged, not just inferred, in the information on which basis an accused can aptly enter his plea, a matter that is not to be confused with or likened to the adequacy or evidence that may be required to prove it.&nbsp; In establishing conspiracy when properly alleged, the evidence to support it need not necessarily be shown by direct proof but may be <i>inferred</i> from shown acts and conduct of the accused.</blockquote>The aforequoted portion would seem to imply that conspiracy may be alleged in the information <b>either</b> by (1) use of the word “conspire,” or its derivatives and synonyms, or (2) allegations of basic facts constituting the conspiracy.&nbsp; It creates the impression that conspiracy is deemed sufficiently alleged by the mere use of the word “conspire,” or its derivatives and synonyms.&nbsp; Curiously enough, the passage does not cite any basis for the pronouncement.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if I read <i>Quitlong</i> correctly, the overall thrust and logic of the ruling, citing authoritatively Article III of the 1987 Constitution, Section 1(b) of Rule 115, Sections 6 and 8 of Rule 110, all of the Revised Rules of Court, <i>U.S. v. Karelsen</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and <i>Pecho v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the mandatory rule still remains that, in the very words of <i>Quitlong</i> itself –<br><blockquote>the information must set forth the <b>facts and circumstances</b> that have a bearing on the culpability and liability of the accused so that the accused can properly prepare for and undertake his defense.&nbsp; One such fact or circumstance in a complaint against two or more accused persons is conspiracy</blockquote>– in order that<br><blockquote>an accused [may] know from the information whether he faces a criminal responsibility not only for his acts but also for the acts of his co-accused as well.<br><br>Thus, we quote from the other portions of <i>Quitlong</i>:<br><br>sOverwhelming, such as it may have been thought of by the trial court, evidence of conspiracy is not enough for an accused to bear and to respond to all its grave legal consequences; it is equally essential that such accused has been apprised when the charge is made conformably with prevailing substantive and procedural requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article III, Section 14, of the 1987 Constitution, in particular, mandates that no person shall be held answerable for a criminal offense without due process of law and that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall first be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.&nbsp; The right to be informed of any such indictment is likewise explicit in procedural rules.&nbsp; The practice and object of informing an accused in writing of the charges against him has been explained as early as the 1904 decision of the Court in <i>U.S. vs Karelsen; viz</i>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">First.&nbsp;&nbsp; To furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defense; and second, to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause; and third, to inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction, if one should be had.&nbsp; (United States vs. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542).&nbsp; In order that this requirement may be satisfied, <b>facts must be stated, not conclusions of law.</b>&nbsp; Every crime is made up of certain acts and intent; these must be set forth in the complaint with reasonable particularity of time, place, names (plaintiff and defendant), and circumstances.&nbsp; In short, the complaint must contain a specific allegation of every fact and circumstances necessary to constitute the crime charged.<br></div><br>An information, in order to ensure that the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of his accusation is not violated, must state the name of the accused; the designation given to the offense by the statute; a statement of the acts or omissions so complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time and date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense has been committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In embodying the essential elements of the crime charged, <b>the information must set forth the facts and circumstances that have a bearing on the culpability and liability of the accused so that the accused can properly prepare for and undertake his defense.</b></blockquote>To allege that the accused “conspired” or “connived” with one another or, that they acted, in the words of the subject information, in “connivance/conspiracy,” is to make a conclusion of law, not a statement of fact.&nbsp; While it may be argued that the information sufficiently charges conspiracy since it uses the term “connivance,” which is the same term used in Section 2 of R.A. No. 7080, this does not make it less a conclusion of law.&nbsp; The terms “connivance” and “conspiracy” are thus superfluous and should not be considered as written in the information.<br><br>It is true that conspiracy does not constitute an element of plunder.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if jurisprudence is to be consistent with the rationale in <i>Lim San, supra</i>, and subsequent cases, the information should allege facts, not conclusions of law <b>regardles</b>s of whether the allegation relates to the acts constituting the offense or to the manner of its commission.&nbsp; The purpose of the information is to <i>inform</i> the accused and it does not help him any if it states conclusions of law unfamiliar to a “person of common understanding.”<br><br>“Conspiracy” is a technical term with a precise meaning in law.&nbsp; Article 7 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a conspiracy exists when two or more persons come into agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.&nbsp; Jurisprudence also holds that it is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense, the accused had the same purpose and were united in its execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Conspiracy requires concurrence of wills or unity of action or purpose, or common and joint purpose and design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The information at bar does not allege that former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada and petitioner came into agreement concerning the commission of plunder and decided to commit it.&nbsp; It does not say that they shared the same purpose or had a “concurrence of wills” or a “common and joint purpose and design” to amass ill-gotten wealth, etc.<br><br>As conspiracy was not adequately alleged, the acts stated in sub-paragraph (a) of the information, <b>standing alone</b>, would not constitute the crime of plunder, the elements of which are:<br><blockquote>(1) That the offender is a <b>public officer</b> who acts by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons;<br><br>(2) That he amassed, accumulated or acquired ill-gotten wealth through <b>a combination or series of the following overt or criminal acts:</b><br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="center">(a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">through misappropriation, conversion, misuse, malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b> by receiving directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickback or any other form of pecuniary benefits from any person and/or entity in connection with any government contract or project by reason of the office or position of the public officer;</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(c) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">by the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the National Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities of government owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">by obtaining, receiving or accepting any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest of participation, including the promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(e)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">by establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combinations and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular persons or special interests;

The only “public officer” expressly mentioned in the information is former President Estrada whose links with petitioner in the alleged plunder has been severed because of the failure to sufficiently allege conspiracy.<br><br>Second, the information does not adequately allege acts constituting the second means by which plunder may be committed.&nbsp; It does not state that petitioner received or collected money “in connection with any government contract or project by reason of the office or position of the public officer.”<br><br>It also bears noting that the information also suffers from ambiguity as to the element that there be “a combination or series of overt or criminal acts.” The information charges petitioner with receiving or collecting money “on several instances” but this does not necessarily amount to an allegation that petitioner performed a combination or series of overt or criminal acts.&nbsp; It is entirely possible that the receipt or collection of money was made “on several instances,” but such transactions were impelled by a single criminal resolution and, therefore, pertain only to a single “overt or criminal act,” not to a series or combination of acts.<br><br>Third, ambiguity also results from the insufficiency of the allegation of “connivance,” a legal conclusion also found in sub-paragraph (a).&nbsp; Absent an allegation of conspiracy, each of the co-accused may be held liable for his own acts and not for those of his co-accused.&nbsp; The question then arises, what amount did each of the co-accused in sub-paragraph (a) receive or collect?&nbsp; Did petitioner, by himself, receive or collect at least P50,000,000.00?&nbsp; The Resolution of the Ombudsman recommending the filing of charges against petitioner indicates otherwise:<br><blockquote>Respondent Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada, the present Mayor of San Juan, Metro Manila, appears to have also surreptitious collection of protection money from jueteng operations in Bulacan.&nbsp; This is gleaned from the statements of Gov. Singson himself and the fact that Mayor Estrada, on at least two occasions, turned over to a certain Emma Lim, an emissary of the respondent governor, jueteng haul totalling P2 million, i.e., P1 million in January, 2000 and another P1 million in February, 2000.&nbsp; An alleged “<i>listahan</i>” of jueteng recipients listed him as one “Jingle Bell,” as affirmed by Singson.</blockquote>The Ombudsman merely alleged that P2 million was delivered to petitioner on “at least two occasions” the “jueteng haul;” P1 million in January 2000 and another P1 million in February 2000.&nbsp; There was no mention at all as to what were the other occasions and how much were delivered on those other occasions so as to reach the aggregate amount of P50,000,000.00.&nbsp; The failure to state such basic facts would yield to no other conclusion that only P2 million was involved in the jueteng transaction involving petitioner.&nbsp; To assume otherwise would deprive him of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<br><br>The Rules of Court were designed to give flesh to the right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.&nbsp; As noted earlier, the Rules demand that the complaint or information be in writing.&nbsp; It also prescribes certain requirements for the complaint or information to be deemed sufficient.&nbsp; The Rules further provide that, upon arraignment, the accused be furnished with a copy of the complaint or information, which is then to be read in the language or dialect known to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> These provisions would be rendered inutile if the complaint or information contains meaningless legal conclusions and ambiguous factual allegations that leave the accused wondering what exactly is being charged.<br><br>The foregoing discussion, to me, is more than a fanciful splitting of legal hairs.&nbsp; As this Court said in <i>People vs. Perez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>It may be contended that such a rule, if applied to the instant case would appear to be unduly resorting to sheer technicality.&nbsp; The requirement for complete allegations on the particulars of the indictment is based on the right of the accused to be fully informed of the nature of the charge against him, so that he may adequately prepare for this defense pursuant to the due process clause of the Constitution.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>The fact, however, is that it is the prosecution which determines the charges to be filed and how the legal and factual elements in the case shall be utilized as components of the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not for the accused, usually a layman, to speculate upon the purposes and strategy of the prosecution and be thereafter prejudiced through erroneous guesswork.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, since the People dictate what he should be charged with, fairness demands that he should not be convicted of a crime with which he is not charged or which is not necessarily included therein.&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; Law, after all, is a technical science; it must perforce observe the necessary technicalities to avoid an injustice.</blockquote>The constitutional rights of the accused are for the protection of the guilty and of the innocent alike.&nbsp;

Estrada is <b>“TOLERATION OF ILLEGAL GAMBLING,”</b> nothing else.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> His father, the former President, is the principal who is accused of having committed three (3) additional series or combinations of criminal acts, namely (1) misappropriating P130 million of the tobacco excise tax share of Ilocos Sur; (2) receiving a commission of P189,700.00 from the purchase by GSIS and SSS of P1,847,578,057.50 worth of Belle Corporation stocks; and (3) unlawfully enriching himself from commissions and kickbacks in the amount of P3,233,104,173.17.<br><br>Significantly, the name of Jose E. Estrada appears only in the illegal gambling charge under Paragraph “a” of the Amended Information and not in any of the three (3) other charges.&nbsp; As far as I can gather, the alleged act of receiving or collecting money from illegal gambling was only on one occasion, when Jose Estrada supposedly received jueteng money from Gov. Chavit Singson for delivery to his father, the then President Joseph E. Estrada.<br><br>The Anti-Plunder Law clearly described the offense of Plunder as committed through a combination of series of overt or criminal acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Jose Estrada did not participate in three (3) out of the four (4) acts for which his father is charged.&nbsp; In the acts of illegal-gambling, there is only one instance of his alleged participation.&nbsp; Under the factual averments of the Information, there is no series or combination of overt or criminal acts allegedly committed by Jose E. Estrada.&nbsp; How can an accused be guilty of plunder if he is supposed to have committed a single act in only one (1) of four (4) of the series or combination of acts for which his father is accused?&nbsp; Assuming, he committed the act attributed to him, the offense is some other crime.&nbsp; It cannot be plunder.<br><br>Last November 19, 2001, I dissented from this Court’s legitimation of Republic Act No. 7080, the Anti-Plunder Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> I felt that under its loose, vague, and overbroad terminology, an ordinary offense like illegal gambling which should be prosecuted under the Revised Penal Code as amended by P.D. No. 1602<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> becomes a death penalty offense of plunder if the prosecution so decides.&nbsp; As worded, the law allows selective law enforcement depending on who is the accused.<br><br>The unfortunates who happen to be the objects of political vindictiveness and, worse, their children and close relatives are prosecuted not for ordinary or common offenses, but for the singular crime of plunder.<br><br>The Court has declared the Anti-Plunder Law valid and constitutional.&nbsp; I disagree with the Court’s conclusion but like all law-abiding Filipinos, I am bound by its consequences.&nbsp; Unless the Court reconsiders its decision in a future case where the tensions and pressures are less pronounced, we all must respect it.<br><br>I respectfully submit, however, that because of the controversial nature of the Anti-Plunder Law, extra care must be exercised in its enforcement and implementation.&nbsp; During our deliberations on the main Plunder Case, G.R. No. 148560, some members of the Court believed that the law is valid because any possible vagueness or overbreadth in the way it is enacted would be remedied through judicial construction.&nbsp; Under that theory, any unconstitutionality is not in the broad wording of the law but in its implementation.&nbsp; In other words, it was propounded that the time to declare any invalidity is when the Anti-Plunder Law is enforced in an unconstitutional manner.<br><br>If the alleged amassing of P545,000,000.00 out of illegal gambling or jueteng under par. “a” of the amended information is correct, there must have been dozens if not hundreds of jueteng collectors and jueteng lords who together gathered the money for the principal accused.&nbsp; I venture to say that not one of them will be prosecuted for plunder.&nbsp; Any possible charges would be under the Revised Penal Code as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>It is an established principle of Statutory Construction that penal laws are strictly construed against the State and liberally in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A penal law cannot be enlarged or broadened by intendment, implication, or equitable consideration in order to prosecute or convict an accused whose criminal participation under the strict terminology of the law is doubtful or non-existent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> No accused who is not clearly, within the verbatim, direct, and exact terms of the penal law should be brought under it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>I agree with Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez in her Dissenting Opinion that “the essence of the law on plunder lies in the phrase combination or series of overt or criminal acts” and that “the determining factor of Rep. Act 7080 as can be gleaned from the Records of the Senate is the plurality of the overt or criminal acts under a grand scheme or conspiracy to amass ill-gotten wealth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Comment of the Ombudsman on this particular issue of expanding the coverage of a criminal statute befuddles and blurs the meaning of the law.&nbsp; It neither elucidates nor enlightens.&nbsp; Instead of clarifying, it confuses.&nbsp; The Ombudsman states:<br><blockquote>Verily, although the act attributable to petitioner is only under paragraph (a) of the Amended Information, the said act comprises the combination of overt acts committed by former President Estrada to constitute the crime of plunder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>“Comprises” means to be made up of or to include or contain.&nbsp; The Ombudsman correctly states that under the Amended Information, petitioner Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada committed only one act or “the said act.” The reasoning of the Ombudsman is, however, beyond comprehension.&nbsp; How can one act become a combination of overt acts, not of the petitioner Mayor Estrada but of his father, former President Estrada?&nbsp; The issue in this case is whether Mayor Estrada should be prosecuted for his one single act under the Anti-Plunder Law or under some other statute.&nbsp; This petition does not refer to the alleged combination or series of overt or criminal acts allegedly committed by the father.&nbsp; If the former President may be prosecuted of plunder because he is alleged to have committed a combination or series of criminal acts, it does not follow that his son who committed a single act converts that solo act into a series or combination of acts.<br><br>The Prosecution adverts to the intent of the framers as gathered from their deliberations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Not one of the Congressmen or Senators cited from the Records ever mentioned anything about one act being a combination of series of acts.&nbsp; All of them explained that two or more acts are required.&nbsp; The quoted discussion refers to whether a “combination” refers to two acts of one enumerated means of the offense or there must be at least two acts of two or more of the different enumerated methods of committing the offense.&nbsp; There was discussion on whether or not “series” can refer to two or more repetitions of the same means or methods of the offense, not necessarily to two enumerated but separate methods.&nbsp; Not once did any Senator or Congressman refer to a single act as a combination or series.<br><br>True, the amended information alleges that accused Joseph Ejercito Estrada acted in connivance or conspiracy with his co-accused.&nbsp; However, conspiracy in this case, bears all the earmarks of a term carelessly thrown into the amended information, a practice common to all prosecutors who tend to automatically include the word “conspiracy” whenever they prosecute one crime but want to embrace within it at least two or more persons.<br><br>There is nothing in the amended information nor in the Ombudsman’s comment to explain that conspiracy was committed.&nbsp; A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The usual phraseology employed to characterize conspiracy includes concurrence of wills, unity of action and purpose, common and joint purpose and design, previous concert of criminal design or united and concerted action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Jose Estrada is not included in the misappropriation of the tobacco excise tax share of Ilocos Sur nor in the Belle Corporation scandal nor in the fourth accusation of having unexplained wealth.&nbsp; There is absolutely no insinuation that he committed any specific act with closeness and coordination under Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), of the amended information.&nbsp; There is no unmistakable indication of a common purpose or design to commit the three offenses under these latter paragraphs which would make him a co-conspirator in the crime of plunder.&nbsp; And since he committed only one alleged act of illegal gambling, there can be no conspiracy in a crime where a combination or series of criminal acts is essential.<br><br>There is no showing in the records that Mayor Estrada consciously adopted a common plan or joined in concerted action with President Estrada and Governor Singson to commit any two of the four criminal acts in the amended information or conspired to commit more than once the receipt and transmission of jueteng money.<br><br>If the petitioner was aware that the money entrusted to him for delivery came from illegal gambling, it is established that “mere knowledge, acquiescence, or agreement to cooperate (in the transmission of jueteng funds in this case) is not enough to constitute one as a conspirator of the crime (in this case, plunder) with a view to a furtherance of the common design and purpose.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Petitioner states that he is linked to only P2,000,000.00 of jueteng money but the Ombudsman seeks to hold him responsible with his father for the aggregate amount of P4,097,804,173.17 of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; Petitioner’s criminal act is alleged to be “contributing to the crime of plunder.”&nbsp; This construction of the law by the Prosecution is dangerous if not ominous.<br><br>To illustrate:&nbsp; a jueteng collector turns over to the provincial gambling lord only P100.00 of jueteng share but the latter added the amount to the P2,000,000.00 he turned over to Mayor Estrada.&nbsp; This, in turn, is added to the P545,000,000.00 accumulated from national illegal gambling by President Estrada as alleged in the amended information which the Ombudsman refuses to treat separately but includes in the more than P4 Billion amassed through the four (4) criminal acts stated as President Estrada’s alleged criminal acts.&nbsp; This small jueteng collector is equally guilty of Plunder because he contributed P100.00 to the P4 Billion alleged unexplained wealth of President Estrada.&nbsp; The absurdity of the Prosecution’s interpretation of the Plunder Law is readily apparent.<br><br>This Court has a history of ruling against the use by Government of the strong arm of the law to oppress or persecute.&nbsp; Under the rule of law, the most unpopular person and even the wretched and unloved, are all the more, given the mantle of protection of due process and the other protections of the Bill of Rights.&nbsp; In <i>Salonga v. Hon. Ernani Cruz Paño, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court stated that “infinitely more important than conventional adherence to general rules of procedure is respect for the citizen’s right to be free not only from arbitrary arrest and punishment but also from unwarranted and vexatious prosecution.&nbsp; The integrity of a democratic society is corrupted if a person is carelessly included in the trial of (many) persons when on the very face of the record no evidence linking him to the alleged conspiracy exists.”<br><br>In this case, the petitioner is charged with a capital offense when at the very most, only the offense of illegal gambling can be deduced from the alleged criminal acts.<br><br>In <i>Hashim v.

This is not the way I understand the language of the Amended Information.&nbsp; Each paragraph expressly uses the word "<span style="font-weight: bold;">in connivance."</span> This presupposes that each paragraph covers a separate conspiracy and petitioner is not a co-conspirator with respect to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).&nbsp; Thus, Justice&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; C. Vitug, in his separate opinion, correctly observes:<br><blockquote>"The records would show that petitioner was charged with having been in connivance with the former President, <span style="font-weight: bold;">only in reference to paragraph (a)</span> of the accusatory information.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nowhere in the charge sheet would it appear that petitioner was likewise being indicted for any of the other charges contained in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of that information."</span> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> People <span style="font-style: italic;">v.</span> Court of First Instance of Quezon, 206 SCRA 187 (1992).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> G.R.
