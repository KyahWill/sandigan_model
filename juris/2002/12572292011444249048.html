				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The above-named accused were charged with the crime of Murder, allegedly committed as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>“That on or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day of August, 1991, in the municipality of Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one another, with intent to kill, treachery and evident premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength and armed with deadly weapons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence against the person of Enrico Gaon, by then and there stabbing him on the different parts of his body, as result of which, the said Enrico Gaon sustained mortal wounds which caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.”</blockquote>All the accused pleaded not guilty when arraigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Trial ensued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, the trial court rendered its decision, acquitting accused Diego Esguerra and Ben Priela and convicting accused-appellant Ramil Marquina of the crime of Murder.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the trial court’s decision reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered convicting accused Ramil Marquina of the crime of Murder of Enrico Gaon qualified by treachery, defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentences (sic) him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00&nbsp; with costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>The tragic incident happened in the evening of August 17, 1991, along a dark alley in Villa Reyes Compound, Bambang, Pasig, fifty (50) meters away from the victim’s house and twenty (20) meters away from the store of Amelia Dequiña (Ka Amy).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>That fateful night, Ka Amy was tending her store at the ground floor of her house.&nbsp; Her daughter, Alma, was upstairs, watching television.&nbsp; It was drizzling.&nbsp; At about 8:30 p.m., a customer of Ka Amy’s told her about a commotion somewhere along the alley. Used to the rowdiness in their area, Ka Amy was unperturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Accused Ben Priela was one of Ka Amy’s customers that night.&nbsp; He was buying kerosene.&nbsp; At about 9:00 p.m., a tricycle driver parked in front of the store and related to Ka Amy that someone was sprawled on the ground.&nbsp; Afraid that it could be her brother, Enrique, Ka Amy asked Alma and accused Priela to accompany her to the place of the incident.&nbsp; They brought with them an emergency light.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>When they reached the crime scene, they found the victim, Enrico Gaon, sprawled in an open canal in front of the house of one Aida Calugay.&nbsp; The victim seemed lifeless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Three (3) minutes later, Ka Amy left with Alma, leaving behind accused Priela alone at the crime scene to illuminate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the place with the emergency light.&nbsp; Alma returned to the store.&nbsp; Restless, Ka Amy rushed to the house of the victim to inform his family about the incident.&nbsp; While Ka Amy was on her way to the house of the victim, a crowd started to mill at the crime scene. Among those who gathered around the victim was accused Diego Esguerra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The victim’s common-law wife, Elisa Molina, and his younger brother, Romel Gaon, were home when Ka Amy arrived.&nbsp; Ka Amy related to Romel what she had just seen.&nbsp; Elisa immediately ran to the crime scene.&nbsp; Romel followed Elisa after five (5) minutes. When Elisa arrived at the crime scene, she tried to approach the victim.&nbsp; Allegedly, accused Esguerra sternly warned her not to get near the victim while accused Priela dissuaded her from touching the victim because the police would soon arrive.&nbsp; Nonetheless, Elisa was able to get close to the victim.&nbsp; The victim had several stab wounds on his face and on his neck, but he was still breathing.&nbsp; Instinctively, she held his hand to kiss it.&nbsp; It was still warm.&nbsp; However, she got scared when she saw a big gash on his hand.&nbsp; At that instance, Romel arrived at the scene. Elisa then immediately left and returned to their house to ask help from her parents-in-law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Romel lifted up the victim from the canal and asked him, “<i>Bakit ka pumunta rito? Sino ang may gawa nito?</i>”&nbsp; Allegedly, the victim clearly replied, “Ramil Marquina! Ramil Marquina!”&nbsp; The victim’s mouth was near Romel’s ears as their faces were only five (5) inches away from each other when the victim uttered the name of accused Marquina.&nbsp; Romel carried his brother to their house.&nbsp; Before they reached it, the victim died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Enrico Gaon was 28 years old at the time of his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He was survived by his common-law spouse, Elisa Molina, then 25 years old, and their child who turned one (1) year old on September 20, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>That tragic night, the police went to the victim’s house and conducted an investigation.&nbsp; Elisa suspected that accused Esguerra and Priela had something to do with the killing of the victim because they prevented her from getting near the victim.<br><br>A few days after the killing, Elisa allegedly received a “report” that Alma Dequiña saw the incident and knew that accused Ramil Marquina killed the victim.&nbsp; Alma allegedly heard the victim pleading for his life saying, “P<i>areng Ramil, wala naman akong atraso sa’yo, bigyan mo ako ng pagkakataong mabuhay, may pamilya at anak ako.&nbsp; Kung gusto mo, baldadohin mo na lang ako.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Despite the report, Elisa feigned ignorance of the identity of the assailants of the victim because one of her suspects, accused Ramil Marquina, is a son of a certain Capt. Francisco Marquina of the Pasig Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On August 23, 1991, the police conducted a reinvestigation of the case.&nbsp; Upon ocular inspection of the crime scene, the police found a fan knife with bloodstains in the open canal in front of the house of Aida Calugay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thereafter, Romel Gaon gave his sworn statement, implicating for the first time accused Ramil Marquina to the crime on account of the&nbsp; victim’s dying declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Dr. Emmanuel Aranas of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Service, NCRU, Central Police District Command, conducted an autopsy on the victim on August 18, 1991.&nbsp;

The trachea or the windpipe was lacerated and it contained blood and blood clots.&nbsp; With the said wound, the victim could only produce sounds like moans, but <b>the possibility of producing legible clear words is impossible.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The victim could still talk within a few seconds after the infliction of the wound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He concluded that it was possible that the wounds sustained by the victim could have been caused by more than one instrument, considering their dimensions, and there could have been more than one assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The victim died primarily due to “hemorrhage as a result of multiple stab wounds on the neck and the trunk.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Accused Priela and Esguerra denied any complicity in the killing. Accused Priela claimed that he was merely requested by Amelia Dequiña (Ka Amy) to accompany her and her daughter, Alma, to the crime scene.&nbsp; They were the first ones to arrive at the scene.&nbsp; A couple of minutes later, Ka Amy and Alma left and headed towards the victim’s house. He was left behind to provide light in the area.&nbsp; Soon after, people started to gather at the crime scene.&nbsp; He admitted that he discouraged Elisa from touching the victim because he thought that the police would arrive soon and the victim would be brought to the hospital. However, he denied that he blocked her way or prevented her from getting near the victim. Ka Amy and Alma Dequiña corroborated his story that they merely requested him to accompany them to the crime scene to check who the victim was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Ka Amy also stressed that she was willing to help accused Priela as she felt responsible that he was jailed because of her.<br><br>Accused Esguerra, on the other hand, claimed that when the incident happened, he was playing <i>mahjong</i> with his neighbors, namely, Norma Cruz, Erlinda Amarante and Rosita Santos.&nbsp; They only stopped playing when somebody shouted that a body was found along the alley in Villa Reyes Compound.&nbsp; He and his co-players went to the crime scene. Norma Cruz and Erlinda Amarante corroborated his alibi.&nbsp; According to Norma Cruz, Esguerra merely viewed the victim’s body at the crime scene and did nothing more.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>For his part, accused Marquina chose to remain silent and banked on the medical findings of Dr. Aranas that the victim’s lacerated windpipe would make it impossible for the latter to speak clearly.<br><br>After the trial, accused Ramil Marquina was convicted of the crime of murder while his co-accused, Diego Esguerra and Ben Priela, were acquitted on reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Hence, the appeal by accused Ramil Marquina.<br><br>In his Brief, the appellant raises the sole issue that the trial court erred in giving much weight and credence to the dying declaration of the deceased.<br><br>We acquit the appellant on the ground that his guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>One of the essential rights given to a person charged with a criminal offense is that he is presumed innocent unless the contrary is proved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and the proof required must be one that is beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the only evidence that supports the appellant’s conviction was the alleged dying declaration of the victim to prosecution witness Romel Gaon.&nbsp; According to Romel, before his brother died, the latter had declared to him that appellant Ramil Marquina was his assailant.&nbsp; Romel testified:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When you reached your brother what happened?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">When I saw my brother was dying, I carried him with my two hands, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

In criminal cases such as murder or rape where the accused stands to lose his liberty if found guilty, this Court has, on many occasions, relied principally upon physical evidence in ascertaining the truth.&nbsp; Where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimony of witnesses, the primacy of the physical evidence must be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Still, the Office of the Solicitor General argues that the medico-legal officer himself stated that the victim could still moan or groan, despite his injuries.&nbsp; Hence, it was possible that the victim was able to speak when Romel Gaon arrived at the crime scene.<br><br>Again, we are not persuaded.&nbsp; Being able to moan or groan is quite different from being able to speak clearly.&nbsp; A moan is a low prolonged sound indicative of pain or any similar low mournful or murmuring sound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> A groan is a deep, usually inarticulate and involuntary often strangled sound, typically abruptly begun and ended and usually indicative of pain or grief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> To speak, on the other hand, is to utter words.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The victim sustained at least four (4) stab wounds on his neck that include wound nos. 22 and 24.&nbsp; The first was eight (8) centimeters deep, lacerating the trachea, and the second, seven (7) centimeters deep, lacerating the left common carotid artery.&nbsp; On re-direct examination, the doctor clarified that in a matter of seconds or a few minutes upon infliction of the wounds on the windpipe, the victim may still speak but, thereafter, there would be an accumulation of the blood in the windpipe that would block it and render the victim incapable of talking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He further stated:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“COURT:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Excuse me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">The creation (<i>sic</i>) of the blood clot would normally depend on the time of the infliction?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.&nbsp;

The records show that when Ka Amy was informed of the commotion somewhere in the alley between 8:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., she did not immediately leave her store.&nbsp; She went to the crime scene only after a tricycle driver had told her that someone was on the ground.&nbsp; It was then 9:00 p.m.&nbsp; She stayed there for 3 minutes before she went to Romel’s house.&nbsp; Romel also did not immediately go to the crime scene.&nbsp; He went there five (5) minutes after Elisa left their house. Even assuming that the victim could still moan or groan when Romel lifted him up from the canal, following the doctor’s expert opinion on the nature of the victim’s neck injuries, by then, a lot of blood had already accumulated, if not coagulated, in the victim’s windpipe.&nbsp; Given these facts, we are doubtful if the victim was, indeed, able to name his assailant to his brother, Romel.<br><br>The prosecution’s evidence must rise and fall on its own weight. Although the testimony of the prosecution witness was straightforward, and he has no ill motive against the appellant, it cannot prevail vis-à-vis the physical evidence on hand.&nbsp; The prosecution has not adequately discharged the burden of proof required for the conviction of the appellant. He should be acquitted on reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 70, of Pasig City in Criminal Case No. 93843 is <b>REVERSED</b>.&nbsp; Appellant RAMIL MARQUINA is <b>ACQUITTED</b> of the crime of murder and he is ordered immediately released from custody unless he is lawfully held for another cause.<br><br>The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is directed to implement this Decision and to report to this Court the action taken hereon within five (5) days from receipt hereof.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Kapunan, Pardo</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Original Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 39, 53, 108.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rollo, pp. 84-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, Romel Gaon, March 10, 1993, p. 10;&nbsp; TSN, Amelia Dequiña, November&nbsp; 3, 1994, p. 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, Amelia Dequiña, February 3, 1993, pp. 15-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, Amelia Dequiña, November 3, 1994, pp. 8-10, 20; TSN, Alma Dequiña, February 3, 1993, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, Amelia Dequiña, February 3, 1993, p. 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Tinanglawan.</span><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, Amelia Dequiña, February 3, 1993, p. 17, November 3, 1994, pp. 10-13; TSN, Alma Dequiña, February 3, 1993, pp. 7-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, Elisa Molina, December 9, 1992, pp. 13-22; TSN, Romel Gaon, February 10, 1993, pp. 8-12, 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, Romel Gaon, February 10, 1993, pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Exh. “C”, Original Records, p. 182.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Exh.&nbsp; “A”, id., pp. 179-180.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN, Elisa Molina, December 9, 1992, pp. 28-32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 60, 80-81.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Exh. “G”, Original Records, p. 191.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Exh. “H”, id., pp. 193-194.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Exh. “D”,&nbsp; “D-1” to “D-4”, <i>id.</i>, pp. 183-186.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Exh. “1” for Accused Ramil Marquina, Original Records, p. 423.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> TSN, Dr. Emmanuel Aranas, December 16, 1992, pp. 13-14, 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 9-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Medico Legal Report No. M-1621-91, Exh. “D”, <i>supra</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> TSN, Amelia Dequiña, November 3, 1994, p. 9; TSN, Alma Dequiña, February 3, 1993, pp. 6-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> TSN, Norma Cruz, November 15, 1993, pp. 5-14;&nbsp; TSN, Erlinda Amarante, November 16, 1993, pp. 3-7;&nbsp; TSN, Diego Esguerra, February 15, 1994, pp. 2-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Section 14 (2), 1987 Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Sec. 1 (a) Rule 115, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> TSN, Romel Gaon, February 10, 1993, pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> TSN, Dr. Emmanuel Aranas, December 16, 1992, pp. 13-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Tan, Jr., vs. CA, 342 SCRA 643, 651 (2000); People vs. Roche, et al., 330 SCRA 91 (2000); Jose vs. Court of Appeals, 322 SCRA 25, 31 (2000).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, unabridged ed., (1993), p. 1449.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 1001.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, p. 2185.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> TSN, Dr. Emmanuel Aranas, December 16, 1992, p. 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, pp. 20-21. </div>
