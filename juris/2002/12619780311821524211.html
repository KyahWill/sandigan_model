I queried him why and answered me (sic) to go with him downstair[s] &amp; at the same time pulled my hand to follow him. Upon reaching downstair[s], he told me to have sex with him which I refused prompting him to slap my face &amp; head repeatedly. After he stopped slapping me, I went back to the upper floor to sleep again. About 5 minutes after, he came back to me &amp; told me again to have sex with him.

She also manifested her desire for the dismissal of the case she filed against her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Nevertheless, on May 26, 1998, Arturo Ocomen was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the accusation. Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented Dr. Noel Obedoza of the Don Amadeo J. Perez, Sr. Memorial General Hospital in Urdaneta, Pangasinan. He testified that on March 3, 1998, he conducted a medical and physical examination on a rape victim, identified as Kristine Ocomen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> His examination showed that Kristine’s hymen was ruptured at 2, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The lacerations were already healed and could be about two (2) weeks old at the time of the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The lacerations were caused by a hard foreign object, which could be an erect male organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, he found no laceration or injuries on the upper part of the victim’s body. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The prosecution likewise presented SPO3 Avelino Sandi, Jr. of the Philippine National Police (PNP) San Miguel, Pangasinan, who testified that on March 3, 1998, he received a complaint from Panchito Salioa, <i>Barangay Kagawad of Barangay</i> Cabacaraan that Kristine Ocomen was raped by her father Arturo Ocomen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He went to Cabacaraan, together with SPO3 Gregorio Antonio and Eduardo Banggi to investigate and arrest the accused. Arturo initially refused to go with the policemen but later on, he was prevailed upon to accompany them to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> At the police station, he took the statements of Kristine as well as of Salioa and Moderna Tolete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For a while, trial of the case could not be conducted because Kristine, who was summoned to testify, could not be located. On June 1, 1998, the trial court issued an order for her arrest for her failure to attend the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> However, SPO1 Rodolfo Abat Estacio reported that Kristine could not be located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The trial court ordered Police Senior Inspector Rodolfo Ramos Tadeo to explain why both Kristine and Panchito Salioa could not be located. In the same order, a representative of the local Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) of San Miguel, Pangasinan was directed to appear before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On even date, another order was issued directing the Head of the CIG/PNP Urdaneta Detachment to locate Kristine and to bring her to the DSWD, Lingayen, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>It would appear that on March 5, 1998, Salioa and Carlos M. Tolete, Sr., uncle of Kristine, entered into an agreement with the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officer of San Manuel where they manifested their willingness to take custody of Kristine. They also held themselves responsible for the safety and protection of Kristine, as well as her appearance during court hearings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Still, the police could not locate Kristine and during the hearing on June 15, 1998, the trial court gave the police and the DSWD three (3) days within which to produce Kristine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Finally, on June 22, 1998, Kristine Ocomen gave her testimony before the trial court. She recounted that sometime in February 1998, at around 11 o’clock in the evening, she was sleeping beside her 12-year old brother in their house when her father, Arturo Ocomen removed her t-shirt and shorts and “raped” her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> She likewise testified that before the act of rape, her father slapped her on the head several times because she refused to have sex with him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> However, while Kristine testified that she voluntarily reported the incident to the police and that she executed a sworn statement, she refused to affirm her answer to question no. 6 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the sworn statement on the particulars of the act of rape. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>During the hearing on June 23, 1998 and after the prosecution rested its case, the defense manifested his intention to file a demurrer to evidence for “insufficiency of evidence,” but the court intimated that it would not grant any motion and ordered the defense to present evidence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Only Arturo Ocomen testified for the defense. He admitted that Kristine is his daughter and that she was born in December 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He likewise admitted that sometime in February 1998, at around 11 o’clock in the evening, he woke up Kristine <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> but denied that he slapped her and forced her to have sex with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He recalled that he only wanted her to boil some water for his coffee because he just came from the ricefield. After waking her up, he went downstairs to their kitchen and waited for Kristine to follow him but she did not heed his order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> so he just went to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He surmised that Kristine filed a case against him because he scolded her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>After trial, judgment was rendered against the accused, as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered CONVICTING the accused beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE aggravated by relationship (between father and daughter below 18 years old) and the Court sentences ARTURO OCOMEN to suffer the penalty of DEATH to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law. The accused is hereby ordered to pay Kristine Ocomen the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>The Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to prepare the Mittimus and to transmit the complete records of this case to the Honorable Supreme Court.<br><br>The Warden, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology is hereby ordered to immediately deliver the person of Arturo Ocomen to the National Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City, with proper escort and security.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant now avers that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE DISCREPANCIES AND INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AND HER SWORN STATEMENT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THE MINORITY OF THE ALLEGED RAPE VICTIM AND HER FILIATION WITH THE ACCUSED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>Ordinarily, the conclusions of the trial courts command great weight and respect <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> unless the trial judge overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> in which case this Court is compelled to reassess the findings reached by the trial judge. After a careful evaluation of the records of this case, the Court finds that the acquittal of accused-appellant is in order.<br><br>It is well-settled that while an absolute guarantee of guilt is not demanded by law to convict a person of a crime, there must at least be moral certainty that each element essential to constitute the offense and the identity of the person who committed the same are established by the prosecution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> To sustain a conviction for the crime of rape as charged, it is necessary for the prosecution to allege and prove the following basic elements: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) by force and without consent, and in order to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, the additional elements that (4) the victim is under eighteen <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[18]</span> years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent [whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted] of the victim. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In the case before us, the fact of rape was not sufficiently proved by the prosecution.

No proof was adduced that there was even a slightest penetration of the female organ aside from a general statement that Kristine was “raped.” In <i>People vs. Caingat</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; this Court declared that the use of the terms “sexual assault,” “rape” and “carnal knowledge” in the testimony of the victim is not sufficient to establish the guilt of accused-appellant for the crime of rape. According to the Court, said statements fall short of the requirement of the law on the quantum of evidence required in the prosecution of criminal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Elaborating on what constitutes consummated rape, the Court continued:<br><blockquote>x x x We have said often enough that in concluding that carnal knowledge took place, full penetration of the vaginal orifice is not an essential ingredient, nor is the rupture of the hymen necessary; the <i>mere touching</i> of the external genitalia by the penis capable of consummating the sexual act is sufficient to constitute carnal knowledge. But the act of <i>touching</i> should be understood here as inherently part of the entry of the penis into the <i>labias</i> of the female organ and <i>not mere touching alone</i> of the <i>mons pubis</i> or the <i>pudendum</i>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>The <i>pudendum</i> or <i>vulva</i> is the collective term for the female genital organs that are visible in the perineal area, <i>e.g., mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora</i>, the hymen, the clitoris, the vaginal orifice, etc. The <i>mons pubis</i> is the rounded eminence that becomes hairy after puberty, and is instantly visible within the surface. The next layer is the <i>labia majora</i> or the outer lips of the female organ composed of the outer convex surface and the inner surface. The skin of the outer convex surface is covered with hair follicles and is pigmented, while the inner surface is a thin skin which does not have any hair but has many sebaceous glands. Directly beneath the <i>labia majora</i> is the <i>labia minora</i>. Jurisprudence dictates that the <i>labia majora</i> must be entered for rape to be consummated, and not merely for the penis to stroke the surface of the female organ. Thus, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the <i>mons pubis</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, <i>i.e.</i>, touching of either <i>labia</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>It may be true that the sworn statement of Kristine was more explicit, more particularly to the following portion:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">06.</td> <td width="5%">Q -</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Please state briefly on how did these happen?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>A -</td> <td><div align="justify">Sometime in February 1998, last month, at about 11:00 o’clock in the evening, while I &amp; my two younger brother, Arvin &amp; Rodolfo Ocomen, were sleeping inside our room, my father woke me up &amp; told me to go with him downstairs[s].

It is a settled rule that between the affidavit and the testimony given in open court, the latter prevails<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and sworn statements are generally considered inferior to the testimony in open court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>While the testimony of Dr. Obedoza may have proved the fact that Kristine had sexual relations, there was nothing in it that would prove that she was raped, or that accused-appellant was the perpetrator of the offense.
