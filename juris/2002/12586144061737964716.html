				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 15, dated May 28, 1997 in Criminal Cases Nos. 36,564-96, convicting accused-appellant Marianito Monteron of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the appealed decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the prosecution having proven the guilt of the&nbsp; accused beyond reasonable doubt, Marianito Monteron is hereby sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify Mary Ann Martenez the sum of&nbsp; Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>The factual&nbsp; antecedents&nbsp; are&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>On March 7, 1996, at 12:10 p.m., fifteen year-old Mary Ann Martenez was walking home from Wangan National Agricultural School, Davao City.&nbsp; While she was walking on a secluded portion of the road, Mary Ann was hit on the head by a slingshot.&nbsp; She turned to see where the stone came from, she was hit again on the mouth.&nbsp; She fell down unconscious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>When Mary Ann came to, she found herself lying on the grass naked. Accused-appellant was lying on top of her, also naked.&nbsp; She struggled but accused-appellant, who was stronger, restrained her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> He placed his penis on top of her vagina, which caused her to feel pain.&nbsp; She frantically grabbed his erect penis and pushed it away from her.&nbsp; This caused accused-appellant to stand up in pain.&nbsp; Mary Ann ran towards the road while putting on her clothes.<br><br>Mary Ann’s cousin, Arnel Arat, witnessed the whole incident as he was then walking to Wangan Agricultural School.&nbsp; He met Mary Ann while the latter was running away and brought her home.&nbsp; When they got home, Mary Ann told her uncle what happened.&nbsp; Her uncle, in turn, told her mother.<br><br>That afternoon, upon complaint of Mary Ann, the Calinan Police Precinct arrested accused-appellant.<br><br>The following morning, Mary Ann was brought to the City Health Office of Davao City where she was examined by Dr. Danilo P. Ledesma.&nbsp; The latter found that Mary Ann’s hymen was intact and had no laceration, but her <i>labia minora</i> was coaptated and her <i>labia majora</i> was gaping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On March 12, 1996, accused-appellant was formally charged with rape.&nbsp; At his arraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> After trial, the lower court convicted him of the crime of rape.<br><br>Accused-appellant is now before us on appeal on a lone assigned error:<br><blockquote>DUE TO REASONABLE DOUBT, THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT IN DAVAO CITY, BRANCH 15 HAS COMMITED AN ERROR IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant argues that his negative plea to the information filed against him; his filing of the notice of appeal; and his denial of the rape charge against him during trial indicate his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Constitutional due process demands that the accused in a criminal case should be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.&nbsp; The rationale behind this constitutional guarantee are: <i>First</i>, to furnish the accused with the description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defense; <i>second</i>, to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal, for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause; and <i>third</i>, to inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction, if one should be had.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In fulfillment of the aforesaid constitutional guarantee, Rule 116, Section 1 (a) of the Rules of Court mandates that an accused be arraigned in open court and asked to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty of the crime charged.&nbsp; The purpose of arraignment is, thus, to apprise the accused of the possible loss of freedom, even of his life, depending on the nature of the crime imputed to him, or at the very least to inform him of why the prosecuting arm of the State is mobilized against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Consequently, when accused-appellant entered a negative plea during his arraignment, the same was not binding on the court as an indication of his innocence.&nbsp; Rather, it is a general denial of the charges impugned against him and an exercise of his right to be heard of his plea.<br><br>Neither is accused-appellant’s filing of a notice of appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> indicative of his innocence.&nbsp; On the contrary, accused-appellant’s appeal was necessitated by the judgment of conviction rendered against him by the trial court.&nbsp; At the very least, the judgment below constituted a preliminary finding of accused-appellant’s guilt.<br><br>On the whole, accused-appellant denies having abused and raped Mary Ann.&nbsp; Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the negative averments of the accused, the former undisputedly deserves more credence and entitled to greater evidentiary weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Moreover, positive identification of the accused by prosecution witnesses as to his participation in the crime cannot be overcome by his denial of participation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Mary Ann Martenez positively identified accused-appellant as her molester in this wise:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td

Ledesma that Mary Ann’s hymen was intact and had no laceration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Campuhan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> we held that the <i>labia majora</i> of the victim must be entered for rape to be consummated, and not merely for the penis to stroke the surface of the female organ.&nbsp; Thus, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the <i>mons pubis</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape.&nbsp; Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, <i>i.e.</i>, touching of either <i>labia</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Consummated rape is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> For attempted rape, the penalty two degrees lower shall be imposed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>i.e., prision mayor</i>.<br><br>During his direct examination, accused-appellant testified that he was born on December 3, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Consequently, when the crime was committed on March 7, 1996, accused-appellant was only seventeen years old.&nbsp; We have held that the claim of minority by an accused will be upheld by the court even without any proof to corroborate his testimony, especially so when coupled by the fact that prosecution failed to present contradictory evidence thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Therefore, considering the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, the penalty to be imposed on accused-appellant should be lowered by one more degree,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <i>i.e., prision correccional</i>.&nbsp; There being no more aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the same shall be imposed in its medium period.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty to be imposed should be four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum.<br><br>The trial court correctly ordered accused-appellant to indemnify the victim, Mary Ann Martenez, in the amount of P50,000.00.&nbsp; Moral damages may also be awarded without necessity for pleading or proof thereof.&nbsp; In cases of attempted rape, the amount of&nbsp; moral damages is P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 15, in Criminal Case No. 36,564-96, is <b>MODIFIED</b>.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Marianito Monteron y Pantoras is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Attempted Rape and is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum.&nbsp; Further, accused-appellant is ordered to pay the victim, Mary Ann Martenez, the sums of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P25,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio.</i><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno</i>, and <i>Kapunan, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Record, pp. 53-54; penned by Judge Jesus V.
