				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellants Segundino Valencia y Blanca, Johnny Tadena y Torda and Domingo Deroy, Jr. y Sarocam were charged and convicted by the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City for violation of Section 15 of Republic Act (R.A.) 6425, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act, for unlawfully selling or offering to sell 634.0 grams of Psuedophedrine Hydrochloride which is a regulated drug. The trial court sentenced each of the accused to the supreme penalty of death and to pay a fine of P500,000.00. Hence, the case is now before us on automatic review. <p> It appears from the prosecution evidence that on September 22, 1998, a confidential informant of the PNP Narcotics Group confided to the group that he was able to negotiate the purchase of one kilo of drugs from a certain Junior and Johnny. The information was passed to the operatives’ team leader, Insp. Ramon Arsenal and then to their commanding officer, Supt. Arturo Castillo. Supt. Castillo immediately formed a buy-bust operation team composed of P/Insp. Arsenal, P/Insp. Beasa, SPO2 Estrada and SPO1 Facto. SPO1 Larry Facto was designated as the poseur buyer. He was to buy the one kilo of drugs for the agreed price of P800,000.00. SPO1 Facto was given ten P100.00 bills which he used in preparing the boodle money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>&nbsp; The team proceeded to the corner of Baler and Miller Streets in San Francisco Del Monte, Quezon City. SPO1 Facto and the informant waited at the corner of Baler and Miller Streets, while the other members of the team stayed about ten meters away. At about 10:50 in the evening, a white Mitsubishi Lancer with plate no. UET 384 arrived. The driver, Johnny Tadena, called the informant. The informant, together with SPO1 Facto, approached him. SPO1 Facto was introduced by the informant to Johnny Tadena as the buyer. SPO1 Facto asked Tadena where the stuff was. The latter replied, “It’s here.” He told him not to worry because their boss, a certain Dodong (Segundino Valencia), was present. SPO1 Facto saw three persons inside the car. Valencia was seated beside the driver while their other companion, Domingo Deroy, was at the backseat. Tadena then asked SPO1 Facto about the money and the latter showed him a plastic bag containing the money. When SPO1 Facto asked Tadena to show him the stuff, Valencia ordered Deroy to hand him the bag containing the drugs. Deroy did as instructed. Valencia then handed the stuff to SPO1 Facto in exchange for the money. SPO1 Facto examined the content of the bag and when he saw the white substance inside, he scratched his head to signal his companions that the transaction had been consummated. SPO1 Facto then introduced himself as a police officer and grabbed the car key from the ignition switch. SPO1 Facto arrested Johnny Tadena while his companions seized the other accused. The three accused were brought to Camp Crame for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The substance was submitted for examination at the PNP Crime Laboratory. It tested positive for psuedo-ephedrine, a regulated drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p> The defense, on the other hand, alleged that in the evening of September 22, 1998, Johnny Tadena went to see Segundino Valencia in Caloocan City to ask him if he knew anyone who would be interested in buying a 1995 Mitsubishi Lancer. Valencia was allegedly engaged in the business of buying and selling used cars. On the way home, Valencia rode with Tadena to go to Bago Bantay, Quezon City. As they were crossing an intersection along Iligan Street, an Isuzu van suddenly blocked their way. The passengers of the van who appeared to be police officers approached them. They took Valencia’s gun which he bought from a police asset. The police brought Valencia and Tadena to Camp Crame. Tadena was placed in a jail cell while Valencia was brought before Col. Castillo. Col. Castillo showed Valencia a plastic bag and said that he would use it as evidence against him. Valencia claimed that the police mauled him and extorted from him the amount of P20,000.00. They also took his necklace worth P5,000.00 and his wallet containing P1,200.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Meanwhile, Domingo Deroy claimed that in the evening of September 22, 1998, he was picked up by the police without any reason at the house of Valencia’s parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p> On September 24, 1998, Assistant City Prosecutor Danilo B. Vargas filed the following information against the accused:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “That on or about the 22nd day of September 1998 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring, confederating with and mutually helping one another, not having been authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any regulated drug, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully sell or offer for sale 634.0 grams of white crystalline substance containing Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride which is a regulated drug.&nbsp; </p><p> CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p></blockquote><p> Giving more weight to the testimony of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation, the trial court convicted the accused of the crime charged. It held that the denial and alibi of the accused were not sufficient to overturn the prosecution evidence which established the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision read:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “WHEREFORE, finding that the prosecution was able to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the Court hereby sentences each of them (1) to suffer the penalty of Death; (2) to pay a fine of P500,000.00; and (3) to pay the costs.&nbsp; </p><p> SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p></blockquote><p> In this appeal, accused-appellants raise the following errors:</p><blockquote><blockquote>“1. The court a quo gravely erred in finding that the guilt of the accused-appellants for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; <p> 2. The court a quo gravely erred in giving weight and credence to the improbable testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution.&nbsp; </p><p> 3. The court a quo gravely erred in finding that there was conspiracy in the case at bar.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote><p> The appeal is without merit.</p><p> Accused-appellants were caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em> in a buy-bust operation. A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment whereby ways and means are resorted to for the purpose of trapping and capturing the lawbreakers in the execution of their criminal plan. Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duty, their testimony on the operation deserves full faith and credit. When the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation have no motive to falsely testify against the accused, the courts shall uphold the presumption that they have performed their duties regularly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The trial court in this case correctly upheld the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation. It did not err in applying the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty by law enforcement agents. We laid down in the case of <strong>People vs. Doria</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the test in determining the credibility of the testimony of police officers regarding the conduct of buy-bust operations. The Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “It is thus imperative that the presumption, <em>juris tantum</em>, of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents raised by the Solicitor General be applied with studied restraint. The presumption should not by itself prevail over the presumption of innocence and the constitutionally-protected rights of the individual. It is the duty of courts to preserve the purity of their own temple from the prostitution of the criminal law through lawless enforcement. Courts should not allow themselves to be used as an instrument of abuse and injustice lest an innocent person be made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses.&nbsp; </p><p> We therefore stress that the ‘objective’ test in buy-bust operations demands that the details of the purported transaction must be clearly and adequately shown. This must start from the initial contact between the poseur-buyer and the pusher, the offer to purchase, the promise or payment of the consideration until the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the illegal drug subject of the sale. The manner by which the initial contact was made, whether or not through an informant, the offer to purchase the drug, the payment of the ‘buy-bust’ money, and the delivery of the illegal drug, whether to the informant alone or the police officer, must be the subject of strict scrutiny by courts to insure that law-abiding citizens are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense. Criminals must be caught but not at all cost. At the same time, however, examining the conduct of the police should not disable courts into ignoring the accused’s predisposition to commit the crime. If there is overwhelming evidence of habitual delinquency, recidivism or plain criminal proclivity, then this must also be considered. Courts should look at all factors to determine the predisposition of an accused to commit an offense in so far as they are relevant to determine the validity of the defense of inducement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p></blockquote><p> In the case at bar, SPO1 Facto, the poseur-buyer, gave the complete details of how the transaction was conducted from beginning to end -- the negotiation between the confidential agent and the drug dealers, the preparation made by the buy-bust team before conducting the operation, when the informant introduced him as the supposed buyer to the drug dealers, the exchange of the stuff and the payment between the pushers and the poseur buyer, and the arrest of said drug dealers. SPO1 Facto positively identified accused-appellants as the drug dealers. His testimony went as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="center"> “xxx xxx xxx</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">Q:</td><td width="93%"><div align="justify">Can you recall, Mr. Witness, if you reported for duty on September 22, 1998? </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">Yes, ma’am.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">Q:</td><td><div align="justify">What time did you report? </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify">Nine o’clock in the morning, ma’am.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">Q:</td><td><div align="justify">Now, while you were on duty was there any specific assignment given to you by your chief?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir. </div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">Q:</td><td><div align="justify">What was that assignment?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td><div align="justify"> To conduct surveillance against drug traffic in Quezon City.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="7%">Q:</td><td><div align="justify"> Was there any specific person whom you were supposed to conduct surveillance on December 22 ...

We are not impressed. It has been shown that the appellants have previously negotiated with the confidential agent. Prior to September 22, they have already closed the deal for the purchase of drugs for the price of P800,000.00. Hence, it is not as if the appellants were dealing with strangers. They knew the informant. When they met with the poseur-buyer, the latter was accompanied by the informant who introduced them to each other. Nonetheless, the Court has observed that drug pushers sell their prohibited articles to any customer, be he a stranger or not, in private as well as in public places, whether daytime or nighttime. Indeed, drug pushers have become increasingly daring, dangerous and openly defiant of the law. Hence, it is immaterial whether the vendor and the vendee are familiar with each other. It is only necessary to prove the fact of agreement and the acts constituting sale and delivery of the prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> These facts have been sufficiently proved in this case.</p><p> Accused-appellants also argue that the prosecution has not shown by clear and convincing evidence whether the sale was voluntary or whether this was a case of instigation. The argument deserves scant consideration. A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment which in recent years has been accepted as a valid means of arresting violators of the Dangerous Drugs Law. It is commonly employed by police officers as an effective way of apprehending law offenders in the act of committing a crime. In a buy-bust operation, the idea to commit a crime originates from the offender, without anybody inducing or prodding him to commit the offense. Its opposite is instigation or inducement, wherein the police or its agent lures the accused into committing the offense in order to prosecute him. Instigation is deemed contrary to public policy and considered an absolutory cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In this case, accused-appellants, apparently, have, for some time, been engaged in drug dealing. They were in fact the subject of a surveillance conducted by the operatives of the PNP Narcotics Group. The police engaged the services of a confidential informant to lead them to transact with them. The confidential agent facilitated the meeting of accused-appellants and the poseur buyer. Hence, it was not the police nor the confidential agent who induced accused-appellants to commit a violation of the Dangerous Drugs Law. They were already violating the law and the police only used the buy-bust operation to apprehend them in the act of unlawfully selling drugs. This is certainly a legitimate entrapment operation and not instigation.</p><p> Finally, accused-appellants alleged that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of a conspiracy among the three accused, as it did not show a common plan or design among them. Again, we find otherwise. There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The existence of a conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence because it may be inferred from the parties’ conduct indicating a common understanding among themselves with respect to the commission of the crime. Neither is it necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or object to be carried out. It may be deduced from the mode or manner in which the crime was perpetrated or from the acts of the accused showing a joint or common purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The existence of a conspiracy among the three accused is very much apparent from the narration of SPO1 Facto about how the transaction went. Upon the arrival of the Mitsubishi Lancer bearing plate no. UET 384 at the corner of Baler and Miller Streets, the driver, Tadena, called the informant and SPO1 Facto, the supposed buyer. Tadena asked SPO1 Facto about the money. When SPO1 Facto asked for the stuff, Valencia, who was occupying the front passenger seat, ordered Deroy, who was seated at the back of the car, to hand him the bag containing the drugs. Valencia gave the bag to SPO1 Facto as the latter handed him the money. This demonstrates the concerted effort of the three accused in drug dealing. Conspiracy among them is obviously present in this case.</p><p> As regards the penalty, the Court agrees with the conclusions of the trial court, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “Section 20, Article IV of R.A. 6425, as amended, provides that ‘The penalties for offense under x x x Sections 14, 14-A, 15, and 16 of Art. III of this Act shall be applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following quantities: 8. In the case of other dangerous drugs, the quantity which is far beyond therapeutic requirements, as determined and promulgated by the DDB, after consultations/hearings conducted for the purpose.’ In Section 15, the penalty is ‘<em>reclusion perpetua </em>to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos.’ The crime is aggravated when committed by any person or persons belonging to an organized or syndicated crime group (Section 30, R.A. 7659; and People vs. Esparas, G.R. No. 120034, July 10, 1998). In such a case, the death penalty shall be imposed. An organized or syndicated crime group has been defined as a group of two or more persons collaborating, confederating or mutually helping one another for purposes of gain in the commission of any crime.’ (Section 30, R.A. No. 7659; and People vs. Esparas, G.R. No. 120034, July 10, 1998)”</p></blockquote><p> <strong>IN VIEW WHEREOF</strong>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Criminal Case No. Q98-78878 is <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> In accordance with Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, upon finality of this decision, let the records of these cases be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of executive clemency.
