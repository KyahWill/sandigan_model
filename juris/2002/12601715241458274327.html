Cruz, Zambales.<br><br>“Mary Rose and her brother Mark Anthony studied at the Guinabon Elementary School.&nbsp; She was the brightest in her class, even though because of their poverty, she had to walk from their hut to the school everyday.<br><br>“In January of 1997, Felita Sobrevilla, noticed a sudden change in the behavior and performance of Mary Rose, who was twelve-year[s] old at th[at] time.&nbsp; The latter appeared sleepy, hungry and snobbish.&nbsp; She also urinated on her panty.&nbsp; When confronted by Generosa Mayo, the head teacher, Mary Rose admitted to her that she was abused repeatedly by appellee.&nbsp; Mayo informed Elpidia Balindo, the aunt of Mary Rose, about the abuses.&nbsp; They then decided to refer the matter to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), who took Mary Rose under its custody.<br><br>“It turned out that on September 30, 1996, Mary Rose was about to sleep when appellee told her, ‘anak puwede ba nating subukan?’ She did not understand what that meant and continued to sleep.&nbsp; Appellee then placed himself on top of Mary Rose.&nbsp; After removing her shorts as well as his shorts, he poked his penis into her organ.&nbsp; He also kissed and embraced Mary Rose, who just wept.&nbsp; The same incident was repeated in the evening of October 10, 1996.<br><br>“In the evening of October 18, 1996, appellee was able to insert his penis into the vagina of Mary Rose.&nbsp; After the act, her whole body ached.&nbsp; She started to fear appellee.&nbsp; He also had sexual intercourse with his minor daughter on three more occasions, that is, on November 1 and 12 and December 23, 1996.<br><br>“A medical examination conducted by Dr. Milagrina Mayor, Rural Health Physician of Sta. Cruz, Zambales, on Mary Rose revealed that her vagina admitted one finger with ease.&nbsp; She was no longer a virgin.&nbsp; Her hymen was broken with healed lacerations at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 nine o’clock positions.&nbsp; The girl also suffered from urinary tract infection.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Appellee’s Version </i></b></u> <br></div><br>On the other hand, appellee’s statement of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> as contained in his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote>“Appellee WILFREDO DELA TORRE had three (3) children with Melinda Torre, namely: Mary Rose, Mark Anthony and Mark Ronnil.&nbsp; Melinda left her family when Mary Rose was about seven (7) years old bringing with her Mark Ronnil.&nbsp; The victim lived with her father and brother Mark Anthony in Sta.

No. 7659.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Lone Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Propriety of Appeal by the Prosecution</i></b></u><br></div><br>The prosecution asks this Court to modify the RTC Decision by imposing the supreme penalty of death on the accused.&nbsp; It argues that it has proven that the victim is the daughter of the accused, and that she was below eighteen (18) years old when the rapes took place.&nbsp; As a consequence, the trial court should have imposed the penalty of death pursuant to Section 11 of RA 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Under Section 1, Rule 122 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure, any party may appeal from a judgment or final order, unless the accused will be placed in double jeopardy.&nbsp; This provision is substantially the same as that provided by the 1985 Rules.<br><br>The question now is whether an increase in the penalty imposed by the lower court will violate the right of the accused against double jeopardy.<br><br>In several cases, this Court has already definitively ruled on this issue.&nbsp; Recently, in <i>People v. Leones,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> it unmistakably declared that “[w]hile it is true that this Court is the Court of last resort, there are allegations of error committed by a lower court which we ought not to look into to uphold the right of the accused.&nbsp; Such is the case in an appeal by the prosecution seeking to increase the penalty imposed upon the accused for this runs afoul of the right of the accused against double jeopardy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It added:<br><blockquote>“This Court has not just once ruled that where the accused after conviction by the trial court did not appeal his conviction, an appeal by the government seeking to increase the penalty imposed by the trial court places the accused in double jeopardy and should therefore be dismissed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>This doctrine was applied as early as 1904 in <i>Kepner v. United States</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (hereinafter “<i>Kepner</i>”), as follows:<br><blockquote>“The Court of First Instance, having jurisdiction to try the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused, found Kepner not guilty; to try him again upon the merits, even in an appellate court, is to put him a second time in jeopardy for the same offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>The <i>Kepner</i> doctrine was clarified in a 1987 case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Speaking through Justice Isagani A. Cruz, the Court explained that an “appeal of the prosecution from a judgment of acquittal (or for the purpose of increasing the penalty imposed upon the convict) would place him in double jeopardy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Double jeopardy provides three related protections: (1) against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, (2) against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and (3) against multiple punishments for the same offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Although <i>Kepner</i> technically involved only a single proceeding, the Court regarded the practice as equivalent to two separate trials, and the evil that the Court saw in the procedure was plainly that of multiple prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The ban on double jeopardy is deeply rooted in jurisprudence.&nbsp; The doctrine has several avowed purposes.&nbsp; Primarily, it prevents the State from using its criminal processes as an instrument of harassment to wear out the accused by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It also serves the additional purpose of precluding the State, following an acquittal, from successively retrying the defendant in the hope of securing a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> And finally, it prevents the State, following conviction, from retrying the defendant again in the hope of securing a greater penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Being violative of the right against double jeopardy, the instant appeal filed by the prosecution cannot prosper.&nbsp; The rule is clear -- the prosecution cannot appeal on the ground that the accused should have been given a more severe penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Besides, even assuming that the penalties imposed by the RTC were erroneous, these cannot be corrected by this Court on an appeal by the prosecution.&nbsp; Said the Court:<br><blockquote>“Whatever error may have been committed by the lower court was merely an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction.&nbsp; It did not affect the intrinsic validity of the decision.&nbsp; This is the kind of error that can no longer be rectified on appeal by the prosecution no matter how obvious the error may be.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>The only way to nullify an acquittal or to increase the penalty is through a proper petition for certiorari to show grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; This was explained in <i>People v. CA and Maquiling</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>“While certiorari may be used to correct an abusive acquittal, the petitioner in such extraordinary proceeding must clearly demonstrate that the lower court blatantly abused its authority to a point so grave as to deprive it of its very power to dispense justice.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the petition, regardless of its nomenclature, merely calls for an ordinary review of the findings of the court a quo, the constitutional right against double jeopardy would be violated.&nbsp; Such recourse is tantamount to converting the petition for certiorari into an appeal, contrary to the express injunction of the Constitution, the Rules of Court and prevailing jurisprudence on double jeopardy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby <i>DENIED</i>.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 39-66; records, Vol. 1, pp. 167-194.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Records, Vol. 1, pp. 202-204.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Penned by Judge Rodolfo V.
