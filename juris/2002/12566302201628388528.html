				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case originated from an action for ejectment filed by petitioner Philippine Ports Authority against respondents, alleged squatter residents of the Batangas City Development Project Site, Barangay Sta. Clara, Port Area, Batangas City.&nbsp; However, it is only the Order dated April 19, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 84, which became the subject of further proceedings before the Court of Appeals and this Court.&nbsp; In said Order dated April 19, 1996, petitioner was held liable for damages for the demolition of the houses and other structures of respondents notwithstanding the pendency of its action for ejectment. Petitioner was ordered to indemnify respondents in an amount to be determined according to the following formula: <i>(amount of counterclaim less twenty-five percent [25%] discount) less amount partially paid by petitioner as summarized in the Commissioner’s Report filed on March 27, 1996, plus interest of six percent [6%] per annum from June 27, 1994 until paid in full</i>. The Court of Appeals affirmed said Order.&nbsp; Dissatisfied, petitioner elevated the matter to this Court.<br><br>It appears that even during the pendency of this case before this Court, the parties have not foreclosed the possibility of arriving at an amicable settlement.&nbsp; In a letter dated July 11, 2001, the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel informed petitioner of the results of its study of the decisions of the trial and appellate courts:<br><blockquote>We have scrutinized the decisions of both the Regional Trial Court of Batangas, Branch 84 and the Court of Appeals, with particular attention on the statement allowing compensation to the 406 families who are at present the claimants involved in the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>It appears from both decisions that the P65 Million award which was scaled down to P34.9 Million for compromise purposes, was awarded to the 406 claimants because both the RTC and CA specifically liquidated the said P65 Million for them.<br><br>Assuming that the decision would be executed and not compromised, it is the undersigned’s opinion that the effect would be the same, i.e., that the 406 families will be awarded the P65 Million or P34.9 Million after deducting from the claimants all the monetary assistance previously given by the PPA to them.<br><br>Thus, there is no legal hindrance in pursuing the Compromise Agreement except that the Board Resolution approving said compromise be modified to reflect the 406 claimant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Acting upon said letter, in a regular meeting held on July 19, 2001, the Board of Directors of petitioner authorized management to proceed with the execution of the Compromise Agreement with respondents herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> On August 31, 2001, in further pursuance of said authorization, the Board Committee of petitioner approved the revised draft of the Compromise Agreement with respondents, and directed its submission to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel for review and to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; The Board Committee likewise ordered that payments of the settlement be paid directly to the individual respondents, and that the General Manager of petitioner be authorized to execute the compromise agreement in its behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>For its part, on October 1, 2001, respondents executed Special Powers of Attorney with Quit Claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> appointing Thelma M. Maranan, one of the respondents herein, to do and perform the following acts:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx </div><ol> <li>To enter into a compromise agreement with the Philippine Ports Authority under Civil Case No. 3601, RTC Branch 84 of Batangas City (CA-GR SP/CV CR No. CY 53870 and G.R.
