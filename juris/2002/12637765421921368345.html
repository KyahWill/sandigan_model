  <p>This is a petition fore review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  of the Court of Appeals affirming the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 108, Pasay City. The trial court 
upheld the writ of attachment and the declaration of default on 
petitioner while ordering her to pay private respondent P109,376.95 plus
 18 percent interest per annum, 25 percent attorney’s fees and costs of 
suit.</p>
  <p> The Facts </p>
  <p>Petitioner Anita Mangila (“petitioner” for brevity) is an exporter 
of sea foods and doing business under the name and style of Seafoods 
Products. Private respondent Loreta Guina (“private respondent” for 
brevity) is the President and General Manager of Air Swift 
International, a single registered proprietorship engaged in the freight
 forwarding business. </p>
  <p>Sometime in January 1988, petitioner contracted the freight 
forwarding services of private respondent for shipment of petitioner’s 
products, such as crabs, prawns and assorted fishes, to Guam (USA) where
 petitioner maintains an outlet. Petitioner agreed to pay private 
respondent cash on delivery. Private respondent’s invoice stipulates a 
charge of 18 percent interest per annum on all overdue accounts. In case
 of suit, the same invoice stipulates attorney’s fees equivalent to 25 
percent of the amount due plus costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On the first shipment, petitioner requested for seven days within 
which to pay private respondent. However, for the next three shipments, 
March 17, 24 and 31, 1988, petitioner failed to pay private respondent 
shipping charges amounting to P109, 376.95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Despite several demands, petitioner never paid private respondent. 
Thus, on June 10, 1988, private respondent filed Civil Case No. 5875 
before the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City for collection of sum of 
money. </p>
  <p>On August 1, 1988, the sheriff filed his Sheriff’s Return showing 
that summons was not served on petitioner. A woman found at petitioner’s
 house informed the sheriff that petitioner transferred her residence to
 Sto. Niño, Guagua, Pampanga. The sheriff found out further that 
petitioner had left the Philippines for Guam.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Thus, on September 13, 1988, construing petitioner’s departure from
 the Philippines as done with intent to defraud her creditors, private 
respondent filed a Motion for Preliminary Attachment. On September 26, 
1988, the trial court issued an Order of Preliminary Attachment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> against petitioner. The following day, the trial court issued a Writ of Preliminary Attachment. </p>
  <p>The trial court granted the request of its sheriff for assistance 
from their counterparts in RTC, Pampanga. Thus, on October 28, 1988, 
Sheriff Alfredo San Miguel of RTC Pampanga served on petitioner’s 
household help in San Fernando, Pampanga, the Notice of Levy with the 
Order, Affidavit and Bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On November 7, 1988, petitioner filed an Urgent Motion to Discharge Attachment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 without submitting herself to the jurisdiction of the trial court. She 
pointed out that up to then, she had not been served a copy of the 
Complaint and the summons. Hence, petitioner claimed the court had not 
acquired jurisdiction over her person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>    </p>
  <p>In the hearing of the Urgent Motion to Discharge Attachment on 
November 11, 1988, private respondent sought and was granted a 
re-setting to December 9, 1988. On that date, private respondent’s 
counsel did not appear, so the Urgent Motion to Discharge Attachment was
 deemed submitted for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>    </p>
  <p>The trial court granted the Motion to Discharge Attachment on 
January 13, 1989 upon filing of petitioner’s counter-bond. The trial 
court, however, did not rule on the question of jurisdiction and on the 
validity of the writ of preliminary attachment. </p>
  <p>On December 26, 1988, private respondent applied for an alias summons, which the trial court issued on January 19, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It was only on January 26, 1989 that summons was finally served on petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On February 9, 1989, petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss the 
Complaint on the ground of improper venue. Private respondent’s invoice 
for the freight forwarding service stipulates that “if court litigation 
becomes necessary to enforce collection xxx the agreed venue for such 
action is Makati, Metro Manila.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 Private respondent filed an Opposition asserting that although “Makati”
 appears as the stipulated venue, the same was merely an inadvertence by
 the printing press whose general manager executed an affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 admitting such inadvertence. Moreover, private respondent claimed that 
petitioner knew that private respondent was holding office in Pasay City
 and not in Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The 
lower court, finding credence in private respondent’s assertion, denied 
the Motion to Dismiss and gave petitioner five days to file her Answer. 
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but this too was denied. </p>
  <p>Petitioner filed her Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on June 16, 1989, maintaining her contention that the venue was improperly laid. </p>
  <p>On June 26, 1989, the trial court issued an Order setting the 
pre-trial for July 18, 1989 at 8:30 a.m. and requiring the parties to 
submit their pre-trial briefs. Meanwhile, private respondent filed a 
Motion to Sell Attached Properties but the trial court denied the 
motion. </p>
  <p>On motion of petitioner, the trial court issued an Order resetting 
the pre-trial from July 18, 1989 to August 24, 1989 at 8:30 a.m.. </p>
  <p>On August 24, 1989, the day of the pre-trial, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 terminating the pre-trial and allowing the private respondent to 
present evidence ex-parte on September 12, 1989 at 8:30 a.m.. The Order 
stated that when the case was called for pre-trial at 8:31 a.m., only 
the counsel for private respondent appeared. Upon the trial court’s 
second call 20 minutes later, petitioner’s counsel was still nowhere to 
be found. Thus, upon motion of private respondent, the pre-trial was 
considered terminated. </p>
  <p>On September 12, 1989, petitioner filed her Motion for 
Reconsideration of the Order terminating the pre-trial. Petitioner 
explained that her counsel arrived 5 minutes after the second call, as 
shown by the transcript of stenographic notes, and was late because of 
heavy traffic. Petitioner claims that the lower court erred in allowing 
private respondent to present evidence ex-parte since there was no Order
 considering the petitioner as in default. Petitioner contends that the 
Order of August 24, 1989 did not state that petitioner was declared as 
in default but still the court allowed private respondent to present 
evidence ex-parte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On October 6, 1989, the trial court denied the Motion for 
Reconsideration and scheduled the presentation of private respondent’s 
evidence ex-parte on October 10, 1989. </p>
  <p>On October 10, 1989, petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion stating 
that the presentation of evidence ex-parte should be suspended because 
there was no declaration of petitioner as in default and petitioner’s 
counsel was not absent, but merely late. </p>
  <p>On October 18, 1989, the trial court denied the Omnibus Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On November 20, 1989, the petitioner received a copy of the 
Decision of November 10, 1989, ordering petitioner to pay respondent 
P109,376.95 plus 18 percent interest per annum, 25 percent attorney’s 
fees and costs of suit. Private respondent filed a Motion for Execution 
Pending Appeal but the trial court denied the same. </p>
  <p>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals </p>
  <p>On December 15, 1995, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision 
affirming the decision of the trial court. The Court of Appeals upheld 
the validity of the issuance of the writ of attachment and sustained the
 filing of the action in the RTC of Pasay. The Court of Appeals also 
affirmed the declaration of default on petitioner and concluded that the
 trial court did not commit any reversible error. </p>
  <p>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration on January 5, 1996 
but the Court of Appeals denied the same in a Resolution dated May 20, 
1996. <br>
  Hence, this petition. </p>
  <p>The Issues </p>
  <p>The issues raised by petitioner may be re-stated as follows: </p>
  <p align="center">I. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>WHETHER RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE WRIT OF ATTACHMENT WAS IMPROPERLY ISSUED AND SERVED; </p>
    <p align="center">II. </p>
    <p>WHETHER THERE WAS A VALID DECLARATION OF DEFAULT; </p>
    <p align="center">III. </p>
    <p>WHETHER THERE WAS IMPROPER VENUE. </p>
    <p align="center">IV. </p>
    <p>WHETHER RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN DECLARING THAT PETITIONER IS OBLIGED TO PAY P109, 376.95, PLUS ATTORNEY’S FEES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Ruling of the Court </p>
  <p><em>Improper Issuance and Service of Writ of Attachment </em></p>
  <p>Petitioner ascribes several errors to the issuance and 
implementation of the writ of attachment. Among petitioner’s arguments 
are: first, there was no ground for the issuance of the writ since the 
intent to defraud her creditors had not been established; second, the 
value of the properties levied exceeded the value of private 
respondent’s claim. However, the crux of petitioner’s arguments rests on
 the question of the validity of the writ of attachment. Because of 
failure to serve summons on her before or simultaneously with the writ’s
 implementation, petitioner claims that the trial court had not acquired
 jurisdiction over her person and thus the service of the writ is void. </p>
  <p>As a preliminary note, a distinction should be made between 
issuance and implementation of the writ of attachment. It is necessary 
to distinguish between the two to determine when jurisdiction over the 
person of the defendant should be acquired to validly implement the 
writ. This distinction is crucial in resolving whether there is merit in
 petitioner’s argument. </p>
  <p>This Court has long settled the issue of when jurisdiction over the
 person of the defendant should be acquired in cases where a party 
resorts to provisional remedies. A party to a suit may, at any time 
after filing the complaint, avail of the provisional remedies under the 
Rules of Court. Specifically, Rule 57 on preliminary attachment speaks 
of the grant of the remedy “<strong><em>at the commencement of the action or at any time thereafter</em></strong>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 This phrase refers to the date of filing of the complaint which is the 
moment that marks “the commencement of the action.” The reference 
plainly is to a time before summons is served on the defendant, or even 
before summons issues. </p>
  <p>In <span class="style1">Davao Light &amp; Power Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court clarified the actual time when jurisdiction should be had: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“It goes without saying that whatever be the acts done by the 
Court prior to the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of 
defendant - issuance of summons, order of attachment and writ of 
attachment - these do not and cannot bind and affect the defendant until
 and unless jurisdiction over his person is eventually obtained by the 
court, either by service on him of summons or other coercive process or 
his voluntary submission to the court’s authority. Hence, when the 
sheriff or other proper officer commences implementation of the writ of 
attachment, it is essential that he serve on the defendant not only a 
copy of the applicant’s affidavit and attachment bond, and of the order 
of attachment, as explicitly required by Section 5 of Rule 57, but also 
the summons addressed to said defendant as well as a copy of the 
complaint xxx.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Furthermore, we have held that the grant of the provisional remedy
 of attachment involves three stages: first, the court issues the order 
granting the application; second, the writ of attachment issues pursuant
 to the order granting the writ; and third, the writ is implemented. For
 the initial two stages, it is not necessary that jurisdiction over the 
person of the defendant be first obtained. However, once the 
implementation of the writ commences, the court must have acquired 
jurisdiction over the defendant for without such jurisdiction, the court
 has no power and authority to act in any manner against the defendant. 
Any order issuing from the Court will not bind the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  </p>
  <p>In the instant case, the Writ of Preliminary Attachment was issued 
on September 27, 1988 and implemented on October 28, 1988. However, the 
alias summons was served only on January 26, 1989 or almost three months
 after the implementation of the writ of attachment. </p>
  <p>The trial court had the authority to issue the Writ of Attachment 
on September 27 since a motion for its issuance can be filed “at the 
commencement of the action.” However, on the day the writ was 
implemented, the trial court should have, previously or simultaneously 
with the implementation of the writ, acquired jurisdiction over the 
petitioner. Yet, as was shown in the records of the case, the summons 
was actually served on petitioner several months after the writ had been
 implemented. </p>
  <p>Private respondent, nevertheless, claims that the prior or 
contemporaneous service of summons contemplated in Section 5 of Rule 57 
provides for exceptions. Among such exceptions are “where the summons 
could not be served personally or by substituted service despite 
diligent efforts or where the defendant is a resident temporarily absent
 therefrom x x x.” Private respondent asserts that when she commenced 
this action, she tried to serve summons on petitioner but the latter 
could not be located at her customary address in Kamuning, Quezon City 
or at her new address in Guagua, Pampanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 Furthermore, respondent claims that petitioner was not even in 
Pampanga; rather, she was in Guam purportedly on a business trip. </p>
  <p>Private respondent never showed that she effected substituted 
service on petitioner after her personal service failed. Likewise, if it
 were true that private respondent could not ascertain the whereabouts 
of petitioner after a diligent inquiry, still she had some other 
recourse under the Rules of Civil Procedure. </p>
  <p>The rules provide for certain remedies in cases where personal 
service could not be effected on a party. Section 14, Rule 14 of the 
Rules of Court provides that whenever the defendant’s “whereabouts are 
unknown and cannot be ascertained by diligent inquiry, service may, by 
leave of court, be effected upon him by publication in a newspaper of 
general circulation x x x.” Thus, if petitioner’s whereabouts could not 
be ascertained after the sheriff had served the summons at her given 
address, then respondent could have immediately asked the court for 
service of summons by publication on petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Moreover, as private respondent also claims that petitioner was 
abroad at the time of the service of summons, this made petitioner a 
resident who is temporarily out of the country. This is the exact 
situation contemplated in Section 16,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Rule 14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, providing for service of summons by publication. </p>
  <p>In conclusion, we hold that the alias summons belatedly served on 
petitioner cannot be deemed to have cured the fatal defect in the 
enforcement of the writ. The trial court cannot enforce such a coercive 
process on petitioner without first obtaining jurisdiction over her 
person. The preliminary writ of attachment must be served after or 
simultaneous with the service of summons on the defendant whether by 
personal service, substituted service or by publication as warranted by 
the circumstances of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 The subsequent service of summons does not confer a retroactive 
acquisition of jurisdiction over her person because the law does not 
allow for retroactivity of a belated service. </p>
  <p><em>Improper Venue </em></p>
  <p>Petitioner assails the filing of this case in the RTC of Pasay and 
points to a provision in private respondent’s invoice which contains the
 following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“3. If court litigation becomes necessary to enforce collection, 
an additional equivalent (sic) to 25% of the principal amount will be 
charged. The agreed venue for such action is Makati, Metro Manila, 
Philippines.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Based on this provision, petitioner contends that the action should
 have been instituted in the RTC of Makati and to do otherwise would be a
 ground for the dismissal of the case. </p>
  <p>We resolve to dismiss the case on the ground of improper venue but not for the reason stated by petitioner. </p>
  <p>The Rules of Court provide that parties to an action may agree in writing on the venue on which an action should be brought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, a mere stipulation on the venue of an action is not enough to preclude parties from bringing a case in other venues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 The parties must be able to show that such stipulation is exclusive. 
Thus, absent words that show the parties’ intention to restrict the 
filing of a suit in a particular place, courts will allow the filing of a
 case in any venue, as long as jurisdictional requirements are followed.
 Venue stipulations in a contract, while considered valid and 
enforceable, do not as a rule supersede the general rule set forth in 
Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 In the absence of qualifying or restrictive words, they should be 
considered merely as an agreement on additional forum, not as limiting 
venue to the specified place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  </p>
  <p>In the instant case, the stipulation does not limit the venue 
exclusively to Makati. There are no qualifying or restrictive words in 
the invoice that would evince the intention of the parties that Makati 
is the “only or exclusive” venue where the action could be instituted. 
We therefore agree with private respondent that Makati is not the only 
venue where this case could be filed. </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, we hold that Pasay is not the proper venue for this case. </p>
  <p>Under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the general rule is venue 
in personal actions is “where the defendant or any of the defendants 
resides or may be found, or where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs
 resides, at the election of the plaintiff.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 The exception to this rule is when the parties agree on an exclusive 
venue other than the places mentioned in the rules. But, as we have 
discussed, this exception is not applicable in this case. Hence, 
following the general rule, the instant case may be brought in the place
 of residence of the plaintiff or defendant, at the election of the 
plaintiff (private respondent herein). </p>
  <p>In the instant case, the residence of private respondent (plaintiff
 in the lower court) was not alleged in the complaint. Rather, what was 
alleged was the postal address of her sole proprietorship, Air Swift 
International. It was only when private respondent testified in court, 
after petitioner was declared in default, that she mentioned her 
residence to be in Better Living Subdivision, Parañaque City. </p>
  <p>In the earlier case of <em>Sy v. Tyson Enterprises, Inc.,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 the reverse happened. The plaintiff in that case was Tyson Enterprises,
 Inc., a corporation owned and managed by Dominador Ti. The complaint, 
however, did not allege the office or place of business of the 
corporation, which was in Binondo, Manila. What was alleged was the 
residence of Dominador Ti, who lived in San Juan, Rizal. The case was 
filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig. The Court there 
held that the evident purpose of alleging the address of the 
corporation’s president and manager was to justify the filing of the 
suit in Rizal, Pasig instead of in Manila. Thus, the Court ruled that 
there was no question that venue was improperly laid in that case and 
held that the place of business of Tyson Enterpises, Inc. is considered 
as its residence for purposes of venue. Furthermore, the Court held that
 the residence of its president is not the residence of the corporation 
because a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from that 
of its officers and stockholders. </p>
  <p>In the instant case, it was established in the lower court that petitioner resides in San Fernando, Pampanga<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> while private respondent resides in Parañaque City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 However, this case was brought in Pasay City, where the business of 
private respondent is found. This would have been permissible had 
private respondent’s business been a corporation, just like the case in 
Sy v. Tyson Enterprises, Inc. However, as admitted by private respondent
 in her Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> in the 
lower court, her business is a sole proprietorship, and as such, does 
not have a separate juridical personality that could enable it to file a
 suit in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In fact, there is no law authorizing sole proprietorships to file a suit in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  </p>
  <p>A sole proprietorship does not possess a juridical personality 
separate and distinct from the personality of the owner of the 
enterprise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The law merely
 recognizes the existence of a sole proprietorship as a form of business
 organization conducted for profit by a single individual and requires 
its proprietor or owner to secure licenses and permits, register its 
business name, and pay taxes to the national government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 The law does not vest a separate legal personality on the sole 
proprietorship or empower it to file or defend an action in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Thus, not being vested with legal personality to file this case, 
the sole proprietorship is not the plaintiff in this case but rather 
Loreta Guina in her personal capacity. In fact, the complaint in the 
lower court acknowledges in its caption that the plaintiff and defendant
 are Loreta Guina and Anita Mangila, respectively. The title of the 
petition before us does not state, and rightly so, Anita Mangila v. Air 
Swift International, but rather Anita Mangila v. Loreta Guina. Logically
 then, it is the residence of private respondent Guina, the proprietor 
with the juridical personality, which should be considered as one of the
 proper venues for this case. </p>
  <p>All these considered, private respondent should have filed this 
case either in San Fernando, Pampanga (petitioner’s residence) or 
Parañaque (private respondent’s residence). Since private respondent 
(complainant below) filed this case in Pasay, we hold that the case 
should be dismissed on the ground of improper venue. </p>
  <p>Although petitioner filed an Urgent Motion to Discharge Attachment 
in the lower court, petitioner expressly stated that she was filing the 
motion without submitting to the jurisdiction of the court. At that 
time, petitioner had not been served the summons and a copy of the 
complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thereafter, petitioner timely filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
 on the ground of improper venue. Rule 16, Section 1 of the Rules of 
Court provides that a motion to dismiss may be filed “[W]ithin the time 
for but before filing the answer to the complaint or pleading asserting a
 claim.” Petitioner even raised the issue of improper venue in his 
Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> as a special and affirmative defense. Petitioner also continued to raise the issue of improper venue in her Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> before this Court. We thus hold that the dismissal of this case on the ground of improper venue is warranted. </p>
  <p>The rules on venue, like other procedural rules, are designed to 
insure a just and orderly administration of justice or the impartial and
 evenhanded determination of every action and proceeding. Obviously, 
this objective will not be attained if the plaintiff is given 
unrestricted freedom to choose where to file the complaint or petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  </p>
  <p>We find no reason to rule on the other issues raised by petitioner. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the petition is GRANTED on the grounds 
of improper venue and invalidity of the service of the writ of 
attachment. The decision of the Court of Appeals and the order of 
respondent judge denying the motion to dismiss are REVERSED and SET 
ASIDE. Civil Case No. 5875 is hereby dismissed without prejudice to 
refiling it in the proper venue. The attached properties of petitioner 
are ordered returned to her immediately. </p>
