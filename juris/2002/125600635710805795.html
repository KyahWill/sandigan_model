Tañedo filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision, contending that while the case was pending before the Court of Appeals the Allied Bank and Cheng Ban Yek &amp; Co., Inc. agreed to extend the time of payment of the indebtedness, without the consent of petitioner, thereby relieving him of his obligation as guarantor or surety of such obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On November 27, 1998, the Court of Appeals denied the motion for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Issues</u><br></div><br>The basic issues raised are (a) whether the execution by the respondent Bank of the Fourth Amendatory Agreement extinguished petitioner’s obligations as surety, and (b) whether the “continuing guarantee” executed by the petitioner is a contract of (surety) adhesion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Court’s Ruling</u><br></div><br>We find the petition without merit.<br><br>Resolving the first issue, we note that the amendatory agreement between the respondent Allied Banking Corporation and Cheng Ban Yek &amp; Co., Inc. extended the maturity of the promissory notes without notice or consent of the petitioner as surety of the obligations. However, the “continuing guarantee” executed by the petitioner provided that he consents and agrees that the bank may, at any time or from time to time extend or change the time of payments and/or the manner, place or terms of payment of all such instruments, loans, advances, credits or other obligations guaranteed by the surety. Hence, the extensions of the loans did not release the surety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>As to the second issue, even if the “continuing guarantee” were considered as one of adhesion, we find the contract of “surety” valid because petitioner was “free to reject it entirely”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Petitioner was a stockholder and officer of Cheng Ban Yek&nbsp; and Co., Inc. and it was common business and banking practice to require “sureties” to guarantee corporate obligations.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Fallo</u><br></div><br>IN VIEW WHEREOF, the Court DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the decision of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>No costs in this instance.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Kapunan, J.</i>, no part.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In CA-G.
