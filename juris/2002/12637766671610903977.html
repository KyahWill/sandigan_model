  <p>Respondent EUTIQUIO PLANIA alleged in his <em>Complaint</em> for specific performance/rescission with damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  filed with the municipal trial court that on 19 September 1989 he entered into a <em></em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 with Teresita Pacaña Conejos whereby they agreed that each of them 
would pay half of the purchase price of the 134-square-meter residential
 lot situated in Tisa, Labangon, Cebu City, subject matter hereof, and 
that upon full payment they would equally divide the lot and register it
 in their individual names.  </p>
  <p> Plania averred that after paying P22,804.91 corresponding to the 
value of his one-half share, petitioner Teresita Pacaña Conejos, despite
 repeated demands, refused to divide the subject lot and register it in 
their individual names conformably with their agreement.</p>
  <p> Respondent Plania brought the matter to the Office of the Barangay
 Captain of Tisa, Labangon, Cebu City, and, as borne out by the <em>Minutes of Hearing of 4 May 1995</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Plania shelled out the amount of P22,804.91 to the Borromeo Bros. 
Estate, Inc., as payment for his one-half (1/2) portion of the lot. At 
the same time Plania admitted having authorized herein petitioner 
Teresita Pacaña Conejos to sell his share in the property to Nenita 
Gavan but petitioner Conejos failed to remit the proceeds of the sale to
 him. This admission was likewise evidenced by the <em>Minutes</em>. </p>
  <p>During their meeting, Teresita Pacaña Conejos promised to pay the 
amount of P22,804.91 to Plania in June 1995, but Conejos reneged on her 
promise so that Plania instituted this instant action before the 
Municipal Trial Court in Cities in Cebu City. </p>
  <p>In her <em>Answer</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Conejos alleged that the <em></em>
 dated 19 September 1989 was mutually abandoned by the parties and that 
Plania's alleged payment was frowned upon by the Statute of Frauds. 
According to Conejos, the stipulations contained in the <em>Minutes of the Hearing</em> were mere proposals by Plania for an amicable settlement which she rejected. </p>
  <p>On 9 March 1999 the MTCC-Br. 7, Cebu City, dismissed the complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> ruling that Plania had failed to present sufficient evidence to substantiate his allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 The municipal trial court noted that the official receipts offered in 
evidence by Plania were not issued in his name but in the name of 
Conejos. It lent more credence to the testimony of Conejos that the <em></em>
 had been mutually abandoned by the parties considering that Plania did 
not even attempt to inform the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc., about the 
aforesaid Agreement. It opined that had Plania done so, then the 
official receipts and the <em>Deed of Sale</em> would have been issued 
in both their names and not in the name of Conejos alone. It did not 
give any probative value to the Minutes of the Hearing before the Office
 of the Barangay Captain on the ground that it was only signed by the 
Pangkat Secretary and the Barangay Chairman but not by Plania and 
Conejos. </p>
  <p>The Regional Trial Court, Br. 9, of Cebu City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> reversed the MTCC. It ruled that except for the unilateral claim by Conejos that the <em></em>
 had been cancelled no other evidence was proffered to prove the same. 
It ratiocinated that a written agreement like the subject  could not be 
considered abandoned by the mere say-so of one of the parties thereto. 
The Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc., need not even be informed of the 
Agreement for its validity because the latter was not a party to it and 
as such the Agreement remained binding as between Plania and Conejos. </p>
  <p>The trial court validated the <em>Minutes of the Hearing</em> noting that it was an official document issued by the <em>Pangkat</em>
 Secretary and attested by the Pangkat Chairman and that its 
authenticity was never put in question. It ruled that the Minutes was 
admissible and should be given weight as it did not lose its evidentiary
 value as a record of what transpired during the meeting despite the 
lack of signatures of Plania and Conejos. It also observed that when 
Pangkat Secretary Samuel F. Valderama testified in open court and 
identified the document under oath he appeared to be objective and 
unbiased. </p>
  <p>In lending credence to the claim of Plania that he paid some 
amounts of money to the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc., the trial court 
stressed that it was understandable that the official receipts were 
issued in the name of Conejos and not in the name of Plania considering 
that Conejos was considered by the Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc., as the 
original buyer of the property. To require the Borromeo Bros. Estate, 
Inc., to issue official receipts in the names of both Plania and Conejos
 would have complicated the matter considering that Borromeo Bros. 
Estate, Inc., was not privy to the .</p>
  <p> Likewise, the trial court noted that since Plania had authorized 
Conejos to sell his portion of the property and that Conejos had in fact
 sold the property to Nenita Gavan, then Plania could not very well 
recover his portion of the property. Considering the foregoing, Conejos 
should reimburse the value of the property sold to Gavan or, if she was 
so minded, to turn over her portion of the property to Plania. </p>
  <p>Conejos moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> but the same was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> hence she filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 with the Court of Appeals. Finding no merit in her arguments, the 
appellate court affirmed the Regional Trial Court concluding that there 
was dearth of evidence that the  had been mutually abandoned by the 
parties. It likewise debunked the thesis of petitioner that the <em>Minutes of the Hearing</em> was unenforceable for lack of signatures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Petitioner's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> she filed the instant Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Petitioner basically argues that the Court of Appeals gravely 
abused its discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction (a) in not 
ruling that there was mutual cancellation by both parties of the  of 19 
September 1989; and, (b) in giving any probative value to the Minutes of
 Hearing of 5 May 1995 and the official receipts presented in evidence 
by Plania.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  </p>
  <p>In support of her arguments, petitioner insists that she never admitted the veracity of the contents of the <em>Minutes of the Hearing</em>.
 She alleges that what she admitted instead was the confrontation 
between her and Plania before the Lupon. She maintains that the contents
 of the Minutes of the Hearing were mere proposals of Plania for a 
possible amicable settlement that never materialized. </p>
  <p>Petitioner likewise asserts that the  was mutually cancelled 
considering the failure of Plania to prove payments to the Borromeo 
Bros. Estate, Inc., and the fact that the certificate of title to the 
lot was issued solely in the name of Conejos. </p>
  <p>At first glance, petitioner’s Petition for Certiorari should be 
summarily dismissed for adopting the wrong mode of appeal. The Court of 
Appeals promulgated its Decision dismissing petitioner's petition for 
review on 9 January 2001 and received by petitioner on 22 January 2001. 
Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on 29 January 2001 but the
 Court of Appeals denied the same in its Resolution of 31 May 2001, 
notice of which was received by petitioner on 13 June 2001. Petitioner's
 remedy would have been to file a petition for review on certiorari 
before this Court, and, counting fifteen (15) days from receipt of the 
resolution denying her motion for reconsideration petitioner had until 
28 June 2001 to file a petition for review on certiorari before this 
Court. However, instead of a petition for review on certiorari 
petitioner filed on 13 August 2001 a petition for certiorari or one (1) 
month and twenty-five (25) days after the lapse of the allotted period 
within which to file a petition for review on certiorari. </p>
  <p>Apparently, petitioner resorted to this special civil action after 
failing to appeal within the fifteen (15)-day reglementary period. This 
cannot be countenanced. The special civil action of certiorari cannot be
 used as a substitute for an appeal which petitioner already lost. 
Certiorari lies only where there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and
 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. There is no reason why 
the question being raised by petitioner, i.e., whether the appellate 
court committed a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitions, 
could not have been raised on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Concededly, there were occasions when this Court treated a petition
 for certiorari as one filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. 
However, the circumstances prevailing in the instant case do not justify
 a deviation from a general rule. Notably, the instant petition was 
filed way beyond the reglementary period allowed under Rule 45 without 
any justifiable reason therefor nor any reasonable explanation being 
proffered by petitioner. In addition, the arguments she cited are 
without merit and are in fact mere rehash of the issues raised before 
and judiciously resolved by the courts a quo. The issues require a 
review of the factual findings which, verily, could not be done because 
this Court is not a trier of facts. More importantly, a reading of the 
records of the case strengthens our disposition that both the trial and 
the appellate courts did not abuse their discretion in assessing their 
factual findings. We find their conclusions amply supported by the 
records of the case and grounded in law. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the instant Petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED as a wrong remedy and for utter lack of merit. Costs against petitioner. </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED. </p>
  <em>Mendoza, Quisumbing, </em>and <em>Corona, JJ., </em>concur.
