No. 1866, as amended, alleged:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 9th day of October, 1994, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused without any authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in his possession and under his custody and control one (1) .38 cal. revolver Smith &amp; Wesson “<i>paltik</i>” with Serial No. 453822 with three (3) live ammunitions and three (3) spent shells without first having secured the necessary license/permit issued by the proper authorities.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>During his arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, joint trial of the cases ensued.<br><br>The prosecution’s evidence consist of the (a) testimonies of (1) Perlita Baldoza, a cousin of victim Nelson Daras, and an eyewitness to the shooting incident; (2) SPO1 Wilfredo Red who apprehended the accused-appellant and confiscated the subject firearm from the latter; (3) SPO1 Gil J. Gregorio who investigated the case; (4) Ruben Aliaga, a “<i>peryante,</i>” also an eyewitness to the shooting incident; (5) Dr. Bienvenido O. Muñoz, Medico-Legal Officer III, Medico-Legal Division, National Bureau of Investigation, who conducted the autopsy on the body of the victim and (b) documents consisting of (1) the Certification, dated March 22, 1995 of the Firearms and Explosive Office, PNPHQ, Civil Security Force Command, Camp Crame, showing that accused-appellant does not possess any authority or license from the government to possess the subject firearm; and (2) the Autopsy Report No. N-94-2046.<br><br>The prosecution sought to prove that at around ten-thirty in the evening of October 9, 1994, witness Perlita Baldoza who was at her stall in the <i>peryahan</i> (mini carnival) behind the Camelot Hotel at Scout Tuazon, Barangay South Triangle, Quezon City saw accused-appellant alighting from a taxi as if he was looking for somebody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She knew the accused-appellant because he was “an overseer” in the <i>peryahan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The accused-appellant walked towards the victim and positioned himself behind him. Then, he immediately pulled out a gun and fired at the victim, hitting him in the lower portion of the breast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The victim fell. Not satisfied, the accused-appellant came closer to the victim, then, fired at him twice hitting him once on the right side of his chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Wasting no time, accused-appellant made his getaway and ran towards the direction of Scout Tuazon, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> With the help of one Dennis Guinto, witness Baldoza brought the victim to the Capitol Medical Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Ruben Aliaga, a coin overseer in the “coin-throwing” game in the <i>peryahan</i>, was on duty the night the unfortunate incident took place and corroborated the testimony of witness Baldoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He testified that he saw accused-appellant holding a gun (“a short gun”) when the latter arrived at the <i>peryahan</i> and he saw him shoot the victim three (3) times. The victim had his back turned on the accused-appellant when the latter shot him from behind. After the shooting incident, he also helped in bringing the victim to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, SPO1 Wilfredo Red and SPO1 Malang were on patrol duty in the area along Scout Tuazon Street, Quezon City when they heard three (3) successive shots fired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They went to the direction where the shots were fired and came upon the accused-appellant running away from the said direction. He was holding a gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> SPO1 Red fired a warning shot and introduced himself as a police officer and told the accused-appellant to surrender his gun<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> but the latter did not heed the warning and instead, he poked the gun at SPO1 Red, then, he ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> SPO1 Red chased accused-appellant. He was able to subdue him. He confiscated accused-appellant’s gun<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and noticed that the subject firearm was a homemade revolver, with three (3) live ammunition and three (3) spent shells.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When shown the subject gun with Serial No. 453822 in court, SPO1 Red identified the same as the one he confiscated from the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Dr. Bienvenido O. Muñoz, Medico-Legal Officer III of the Medico-Legal Division of the National Bureau of Investigation conducted an autopsy of the victim and made the following postmortem findings, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>Pallor, conjunctivae and integument.<br>Abrasions, reddish brown: nasal bridge, 0.5 x 1.0 cm.; chin, across midline, 3.0 x 7.0 cm.; thigh, left, lower third, anterior, 0.7 x 5.0 cm.<br>Lacerated wound, forehead, across midline, 3.0 cm.<br><br>Gunshot wounds:<br><ol><li><u>Entrance</u>, ovaloid, 0.8 x 1.0 cm., with a contusion collar widest at its upper border. Located at the anterior chest, level of second intercostal space, right, 11.0 cm. from anterior median line, 134.0 cm. above right heel. Directed backward, downward and from right to left, into the right thoracic cavity, perforating the lower lobe of right lung then fracturing the body of 7<sup>th</sup> thoracic vertebra, into the posterior thoracic wall, where a bullet was lodged and recovered, 2.5 cm. to the left of posterior median line, 120.0 cm. above the left heel;<br><br></li><li><u>Entrance</u>, ovaloid, 0.9 x 1.0 cm., with a contusion collar widest at its lower border. Located at the back, level&nbsp; 10<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, left, 16.0 cm. from posterior median line, 109.5 cm. above left heel. Directed forward, upward and medially, perforating the diaphragm and spleen and making an <u>exit</u>&nbsp; wound, irregular, 2.0 x 1.0 cm., chest, anterior, level of 7<sup>th</sup> intercostal space, left, 7.0 cm. from anterior median line, 112.0 cm. above left heel.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Hemothorax, right-950 c.c.; left-750 c.c.<br>Hemoperitoneum-600 c.c.<br>Brain and other visceral organs, pale.<br>Stomach-empty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></div></li></ol></blockquote>In his testimony, Dr. Muñoz declared that he found two (2) gunshot wounds in the victim’s body. One was located at the front portion of the chest and the other one was located at the back. He declared the two (2) fatal gunshot wounds were the cause of death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> When asked about the distance of the muzzle of the gun used by the accused-appellant to the body of the victim when he fired it, Dr. Muñoz said that the distance was probably more than 24 inches because of the absence of any of the characteristics of a close range fire like smudging or burning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> As to the position of the victim <i>vis-a-vis</i> the assailant when shot, particularly the first shot, which was gunshot wound No. 2, Dr. Muñoz said that the assailant was at the back of the victim and more to the left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> With respect to gunshot wound No. 1, he said that the assailant and the victim were probably both standing and that the assailant was in front and to the right of the victim and the victim was standing on a lower level than the assailant because the trajectory of the bullet was downward and from right to left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It was also proven that the gun which took the life of the victim was not properly registered as required by law. P/Senior Inspector Edwin Roque of the Records Branch of the Philippine National Police issued a certification stating that the 0.38 caliber revolver recovered from the accused-appellant was not a licensed firearm and that accused-appellant was not a licensed or registered holder of any kind of firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant was presented as the sole witness for the defense. He admitted the killing but claimed that he did so in self-defense. He testified that at about six o’clock in the evening of October 9, 1994, he reported for work as an overseer in the <i>peryahan</i> of one Tony Baguio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> At around ten-thirty in the evening of that day, he closed one of the stalls in the <i>peryahan</i> because the owner of that stall did not arrive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Immediately thereafter, the victim approached him and angrily asked why he closed the stall. Without waiting for him to answer, the victim boxed him on his left ear,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> then asked the accused-appellant if he was going to fight back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Suddenly, the victim drew his gun. Accused-appellant grappled with the victim for the possession of the gun. In the course of the struggle, the gun fired hitting the victim on the left side of his stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> After the first shot was fired, the struggle for the possession of the gun continued. Accused-appellant then tried to raise the gun but it fired again twice, hitting the victim at his right shoulder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> At this point, somebody struck his neck causing him to move backward. A commotion ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thereafter, a policeman (whom the accused-appellant later identified as SPO1 Wilfredo Red) poked a gun at him and ordered him to raise his hands, then frisked his body and was able to get P9,000.00 and $50.00 from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The policeman then boarded him on a jitney and brought him to Camp Karingal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In his brief, the accused-appellant ascribed the following errors to the court <i>a quo</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ESTABLISH THE SAME.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE VERSION OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT THAT HE WAS MERELY ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN NOT APPLYING THE PROVISION OF RA 8294 AND IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR TWO SEPARATE OFFENSES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>The accused-appellant assails his conviction in this automatic review and contends that the trial court has gravely erred in convicting him of murder aggravated by the use of an unlicensed firearm and sentencing him to death on the basis of the prosecution’s evidence.<br><br>The Court affirms the judgment of conviction but reduces the sentence of death to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Having admitted killing the victim, the accused-appellant has the burden of proving that he acted in self-defense by establishing (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed by him to prevent or repel the aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on his part in defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Accused-appellant has failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>The version of accused-appellant of what transpired that night is simply incredible. He asserted that at around ten-thirty in the evening of October 9, 1994, he closed one of the stalls in the <i>peryahan</i> when the victim approached him and angrily asked why he closed the stall. Then, without waiting for his answer, the victim boxed him on his left ear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Surprised and irritated, he asked the victim why he boxed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Instead of answering, the victim drew his gun and asked accused-appellant if he was going to fight back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Accused-appellant then grappled for the possession of the gun. In the course of the struggle for possession of the same, the gun fired hitting the victim on the left side of his stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> While the struggle for the possession of the gun continued, accused-appellant then tried to raise the gun but the same fired again twice, hitting the victim at his right shoulder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The presence of a number of gunshot wounds on the body of the victim negates self-defense and indicates a determined effort on the part of the accused-appellant to kill the victim. The autopsy made on the body of the victim as shown by the postmortem report indubitably shows that the nature and location of the gunshot wounds inflicted on the victim belie accused-appellant’s claim of self-defense. Dr. Muñoz found two (2) gunshot wounds and declared that the same caused the death of the victim. One of the wounds was located at the front portion of the chest while the other one was located at the back. As to the position of the victim vis-a-vis the assailant when shot, particularly the first shot, which was gunshot wound No. 2, Dr. Muñoz stated that in gunshot wound No. 2, which was located at the back, the assailant would have been at the back of the victim and more to his left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> With respect to gunshot wound No. 1, he said that if the victim and the assailant were both standing, the assailant would have been in front and to the right of the victim and the victim would have been standing on a lower level than the assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Quite clearly, these findings confirm the testimony of witness Baldoza that accused-appellant alighted from a taxicab, positioned himself behind the victim and shot him at the back. When the victim fell to the ground, the accused-appellant fired at him again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Dr. Muñoz further stated that the gun was not fired at close range because of the absence of smudging or burning around the victim’s wound, thereby, negating accused-appellant’s claim that the gun accidentally fired while he and the victim were grappling for the possession thereof. Likewise, it is highly improbable for the victim to have been shot at the back if the gun accidentally fired in the course of the struggle for its possession, as this would assume that the victim’s hand holding the gun was twisted abnormally to reach his back with the gun muzzle pointed at his back when the gun exploded. Accused-appellant did not testify that such an impossible scenario took place. What is clear is that the nature and location of the gunshot wounds are physical evidence that demonstrate a determined effort to kill the victim and not just defend oneself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>A plea of self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated where it is not only uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence, but also extremely doubtful by itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Here, accused-appellant was presented as the sole witness for the defense. No other witness was presented to testify how the fateful shooting happened. If it were true, as declared by the accused-appellant, that a lot of people were present during the scuffle and wanted to pacify them, why had not there been any attempt to present anyone of them to support his story.

Both testimonies are consistent in all material points and no ill motive or reason was shown to indicate that said witnesses falsely testified against accused-appellant.<br><br>Accused-appellant also contends that the court <i>a quo</i> erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery despite the prosecution’s failure to establish the same.<br><br>Article 14, paragraph 16 of the Revised Penal Code provides that treachery or <i>alevosia</i> exists when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons by employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on an unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself, thereby ensuring its commission without risk to the aggressor and without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly held that treachery had qualified the killing to murder. The suddenness of the attack, apparently without any provocation on the part of the victim, should suffice to demonstrate the treacherous nature of the aggression. The accused-appellant surreptitiously positioned himself at the back of the victim, aimed his gun, and without warning, shot the latter. When the victim fell to the ground, he again shot him twice. Clearly, the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself.<br><br>However, there is merit to accused-appellant’s contention that the trial court should have appreciated illegal possession of firearms merely as an aggravating circumstance in the murder case, instead of treating it as a separate crime. Although R.A. No. 8294 took effect on July 6, 1997, or after the crimes involved in the case at bar were committed on October 9, 1994, it is advantageous to the accused, hence, it should be given retrospective application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> insofar as it spares the accused-appellant from a separate conviction for the crime of illegal possession of firearm.<br><br>Section 1 of R.A. No. 8294 further amended Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866, which in part, provides:<br><blockquote>If homicide or murder is committed with the use of unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.</blockquote>Under the aforequoted section, where murder or homicide is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, the separate penalty for illegal possession of firearm shall no longer be meted out since it becomes merely a special aggravating circumstance. The penalty for illegal possession of firearms shall be imposed in all other cases where none of the crimes enumerated under R.A. No. 8294 is committed. The intent of Congress is to treat the offense of illegal possession of firearm and the commission of homicide or murder with the use of unlicensed firearm as a single offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In view of this provision, the Court has held in a number of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> that there can be no separate conviction of the crime of illegal possession of firearm in a case where another crime, as indicated in RA. No. 8294 (murder or homicide under Section 1, and rebellion, insurrection, sedition or attempted <i>coup d’etat</i> under Section 3), is committed.<br><br>In the case at bar, although the prosecution was able to establish that the crime of illegal possession of firearm under P.D. No. 1866 had been committed by the accused-appellant, R.A. No. 8294 merely considers the use of an unlicensed firearm as a special aggravating circumstance in murder or homicide, and not as a separate offense. Fortunately for the accused-appellant, the use of an unlicensed firearm in the killing of the victim was not alleged in the information for murder. Such being the case, the same could not be used as an aggravating circumstance to warrant the imposition of the death penalty against the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the trial court dated June 22, 1998 is hereby <b>MODIFIED.</b> Accused-appellant Constancio Candido y Collarga is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of the murder and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Bellosillo, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez</i> and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Puno</i>, and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Erroneously denominated as Criminal Case No. Q-94-58985 in the Decision dated June 22, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 220, Quezon City.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Entitled</i> “Codifying the Laws on Illegal/Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Dealing in, Acquisition or Disposition of Firearms or Explosives or Instruments Used in the Manufacture of Firearms, Ammunition or Explosives, and Imposing Stiffer Penalties for Certain Violations Thereof, and for Relevant Purposes.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Entitled</i> “An Act Amending the Provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as Amended, entitled ‘Codifying the Laws on Illegal/Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Dealing in, Acquisition or Disposition of Firearms, Ammunition or Explosives or Instruments Used in the Manufacture of Firearms, Ammunition or Explosives, and Imposing Stiffer Penalties for Certain Violations Thereof, and for Relevant Purposes.’“<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Records, p. 172.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 28 and 30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> TSN, March 20, 1995, pp. 2-8<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 8-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 11, 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN, May 29, 1995, pp. 3-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i>, at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> TSN, March 20, 1995, pp. 12-13; TSN, May 3, 1995, pp. 3-4, 25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> TSN, March 20, 1995, p. 114.
