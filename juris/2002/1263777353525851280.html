				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A qualifying circumstance like treachery changes the character of the crime and increases the penalties that may be imposed. Hence, like the crime itself, it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. <p align="center"><strong> <u>Statement of the Case</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> For review by this Court is the March 5, 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City (Branch 36) in Criminal Case No. 38744, finding Eleno Paracale y Pardilla guilty of murder. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “<strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court <strong>FINDS</strong> the accused, <strong>ELENO PARACALE Y PARDILLA, GUILTY</strong> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <strong>MURDER qualified by treachery</strong> and hereby <strong>SENTENCES</strong>&nbsp; him to suffer the penalty of <strong>[r]eclusion [p]erpetua</strong> and all the accessory penalties provided for by law, to further pay the [h]eirs of the late Manolo Pasquin the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity and P4,000.00 as attorney’s fees.&nbsp; </p><p> “Consequently, the standing bail bond for the provisional liberty of the accused is ordered cancelled pursuant to Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 2-92 dated January 20, 1992. Let the corresponding mittimus or commitment order issue immediately after the promulgation of judgment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p></blockquote><p> Appellant was charged in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated September 9, 1992, worded thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “That on or about the 12th day of January, 1992 in the Municipality of Pototan, Province of Iloilo, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating with three (3) others whose identities are presently unknown, with deliberate intent and without any justifiable motive, armed with firearms of unknown caliber, with treachery, evident premeditation and superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot and hit MANOLO PASQUIN with said firearms they were then provided, inflicting upon said Manolo Pasquin gunshot wounds on different parts of his body which caused his death thereafter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote><p> Duly assisted by his counsel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge during his arraignment on March 2, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trial on the merits proceeded in due course. Thereafter, the RTC rendered the assailed Decision.</p><p align="center"><strong><u> The Facts</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><strong><em><u> Version of the Prosecution</u></em></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> In its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution’s version of the facts as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “Around eight o’clock in the evening of January 12, 1992, Ninfa Pasquin was at her house situated in Sitio Inadlayan, Barangay Macatol, Pototan, Iloilo. She was busy preparing her lesson plan when she was alarmed by the barking of dogs. She looked outside the window and aided by the moonlight and her heavy-duty flashlight, she saw appellant with three (3) companions walking outside her fence. She noticed that appellant was carrying a shotgun while his companions were carrying firearms tucked at their waist. She thought that they were merely conducting their nightly rounds since appellant was then a barangay tanod.&nbsp; </p><p> “After observing the appellant and his companions, she returned to her table to continue her work. She, however, started feeling uneasy because her husband had not yet come home.&nbsp; </p><p> “About eleven o’clock of the same evening, Ninfa again looked outside the window and saw several persons hiding behind some tall grasses near their fence. She thought that one of them was her husband. She then went to the kitchen to wash her face.&nbsp; </p><p> “While washing her face, she heard an explosion near their house. She heard another explosion which prompted her to take her flashlight and look out the window. When she turned on the flashlight towards the place where the explosion came from, she saw appellant still carrying a shotgun and running away with his three companions. The four of them passed by the side of their fence. She also saw a person half-hanging at the entrance of the fence. While appellant was running, she heard him shout to his companions: ‘You run fast’. However, Ninfa could not identify the person at the entrance of their fence because he was lying prone on the ground.&nbsp; </p><p> “In great fear, she closed the window. After a while, she heard her name being called by Rex Dosado, her husband’s nephew. Rex shouted that his ‘Tiyo Manolo’ was at the entrance of their fence and that he was already dead. Forthwith, she ran downstairs, still carrying her flashlight. She and her nephew examined her husband’s body and they discovered two (2) gunshot wounds. Ninfa then ran to her brother-in-law, Felicisimo Pasquin, who lived nearby, and told him that her husband was already dead. Rex, on the other hand, reported the incident to the Barangay Kagawad who passed on the information to the Poto[t]an Police Station.&nbsp; </p><p> “The patrol team on duty immediately responded and found at the scene of the crime an empty shell of a shotgun. Ninfa also told them that right after she heard the shots, she saw appellant running away, holding a shotgun. She recognized the appellant not only because he was a barangay tanod in their area, but also he used to go to their house to buy eggs.&nbsp; </p><p> “The next day, a team from the Pototan Police Station, composed of SPO2 Romeo Benamarca, SPO3 Primo S. Cabrera, and SPO1 Enrico Parreño returned and invited appellant to go with them to Camp Delgado in order to conduct a paraffin examination. The results of the paraffin examination showed that appellant’s hands were positive for gunpowder nitrates.&nbsp; </p><p> “Dr. Isabel Cenal, Rural Health Physician of Pototan Rural Health Unit, examined the body of the victim. She found two (2) gunshot wounds on the body of the victim, both of which were fatal and caused his instantaneous death.&nbsp; </p><p> “After appellant learned of the positive result for gun powder nitrates, he immediately fled from Pototan. He was arrested several months later, on November 15, 1992, in Mandur[r]iao, Iloilo by the members of the Mandur[r]iao Police.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p align="center"><em style="font-weight: bold;"> <u>Version of the Defense</u></em>&nbsp; </p><p> In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> appellant narrates his version of the facts as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “Evidence for the defense shows that accused-appellant is 54 years of age, married, a vendor and a resident of Barangay Airport, Mandurriao, Iloilo City. He knew the deceased, the latter being a Barangay Tanod like himself. In the evening of January 12, 1992, he was in his house at Barangay Makatol taking care of his grandson, when a certain Freddie Prinsipe arrived thereat. Prinsipe asked for his help to bring Manolo Pasquin to the hospital, because the latter was shot. Accused-appellant told him that he was taking care of his grandson but nevertheless, he was willing to leave him to the care of his neighbors. However, Prinsipe told him: ‘Never mind, we will just do it’, and left. Thereupon, accused-appellant and his grandson went to sleep. The following day at about 7:00 o’clock in the morning, he went to the house of the deceased and talked to the latter’s widow regarding the alleged incident. Thereafter, he helped in the construction of a temporary bamboo shelter for the wake of the deceased. On the same day, he was fetched from his house and was requested to come along, together with four (4) persons, to the Pototan Police Station. From there, they were brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Iloilo City for paraffin examination, after which, they were allowed to go home.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p align="center"><strong> <u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> The RTC gave full faith and credence to the testimony of Ninfa Pasquin, who had positively identified appellant as her husband’s assailant. It also believed the other prosecution witnesses, because they had no ill motive to testify falsely against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> The trial court likewise rejected the alibi of appellant and his allegation that he had been denied due process owing to the lack of preliminary investigation of the case. It said that he waived his right to a preliminary investigation, because he had not raised this question prior to entering his plea during the arraignment. It further held that treachery had qualified the killing as murder.</p><p> Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong> <u>Issues</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> Appellant assigns three supposed errors for our consideration:</p><p align="center"> “I&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="justify">“The court <u>a-quo</u> gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime charged based on circumstantial evidence.</p></blockquote><p align="center"> “II&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="justify"> “The court <u>a quo</u> gravely erred in giving weight and credence to the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution.</p></blockquote><p align="center"> “III&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p align="justify"> “On the assumption that the accused-appellant committed the acts complained of, the court a-quo gravely erred in convicting him of the crime of murder instead of homicide only, the qualifying circumstance of treachery not having been duly proven to have attended the commission of the crime charged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br></p></blockquote><p> In sum, the issues boil down to two: (1) the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and (2) the presence of treachery.</p><p align="center"><strong> <u>The Court’s Ruling</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p> The appeal is partly meritorious. Appellant is guilty of homicide only, not murder.</p><p align="center"><strong><u> First Issue:</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><em><strong> <u>Sufficiency of Circumstantial Evidence</u></strong></em>&nbsp; </p><p> Appellant argues that the RTC’s reliance on circumstantial evidence is misplaced. He avers that since only one circumstance was proven by the prosecution, there can be no basis for his conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> We are not convinced.</p><p> The trial court convicted appellant of murder based on these eight (8) pieces of circumstantial evidence:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “1. that minutes before the shooting incident, the accused Eleno Paracale was seen by Mrs. Ninfa Pasquin passing by the side of their fence together with three unknown companions;&nbsp; </p><p> “2. that moments after, when Mrs. Pasquin looked outside of their window waiting for her husband to come home, she saw several persons outside of their fence and being hidden by some tall grasses, in fact she even thought that one of them was her husband Manolo Pasquin who was on his way home;&nbsp; </p><p> “3. that after the shots had occurred, Mrs. Pasquin immediately looked outside of their window and with the use of a flashlight, she saw and positively recognized the accused Eleno Paracale running away together with three other unknown companions; she even heard the accused instructing his companions to run fast;&nbsp; </p><p> “4. that immediately after the shots, Mrs. Pasquin also saw a person half-hanging at the entrance of their fence who was later on identified to be her husband Manilo;&nbsp; </p><p> “5. that immediately after the incident, prosecution’s witness Wilfredo Prinsipe proceeded to the house of the accused to ask for help and he noticed that the accused was nervous, walking back and forth and somewhat uneasy as if afraid of something; that even before they reached the house of the accused he heard him talking to some persons inside the house which was still lighted at the time;&nbsp; </p><p> “6. that the accused was one of those subjected by the police authorities to paraffin examination and found to be positive of gunpowder nitrates;&nbsp; </p><p> “7. that the accused after the incident transferred residence from Brgy. Macatol, Pototan, Iloilo to Mandurriao, Iloilo City;&nbsp; </p><p> “8. that even before the incident, the accused and the victim were no longer in good terms because barely two (2) weeks before the incident, the two had a heated argument wherein the victim was heard warning the accused that he would kill him if the accused would not kill him first.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br></p></blockquote><p> Circumstantial evidence is “that which indirectly proves a fact in issue through an inference that the factfinder draws from the evidence established. Resort thereto is essential when the lack of direct testimony would result in setting a felon free.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> It is akin to a tapestry made up of strands that create a pattern when interwoven, and that cannot be plucked out and considered one at a time independently of the others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As a basis for conviction for a crime, it should be acted on and weighed with great caution, considering that it is preferable for the guilty to remain unpunished than for the innocent to suffer a long prison term unjustly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> Conviction based on circumstantial evidence requires the concurrence of the following elements: (a) there is more than one circumstance, (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven, and (c) the combination of all the circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> To withstand judicial scrutiny, the circumstances must be inconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is innocent or with any other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>Further, the law requires the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime, not simply an eyewitness account of the act of committing the crime. By direct evidence, witnesses may identify the appellant as the culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; There are instances, however, when they may not have actually seen the very acts constituting the crime. They may, however, still be able to identify the perpetrator, as when their testimonies position the accused at the<em> locus criminis </em>immediately before and after the occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> In the case at bar, the positive identification of appellant by Prosecution Witness Ninfa Pasquin forms part of the threads of circumstantial evidence. Taken as a whole, they inexorably lead to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to him, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; She testified thus:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">“ATTY.

The trial court had the advantage of these aids, which cannot be incorporated into the records. Appellate court, on the other hand, can only read the cold words of the witnesses as contained in transcripts of their testimonies, with the risk that some of what they have communicated by word and behavior may have been lost in the process of transcription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong> <u>Second Issue:</u></strong>&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><em><strong> <u>Treachery Not Proven</u></strong></em>&nbsp; </p><p> Appellant argues that, assuming <em>arguendo</em> he was responsible for the death of the victim, he can be held guilty of homicide only, because treachery has not been proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> We agree.</p><p> Well-settled is the rule that treachery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> must be proved by clear and convincing evidence as conclusively as the killing itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The essence of treachery is the swiftness and the unexpectedness of the attack upon the unsuspecting and unarmed victim, who has not been given the slightest provocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> For treachery to be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance, it must be shown to have been present at the inception of the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Two essential elements must concur: (1) the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation and (2) the deliberate or conscious adoption of the said means of execution.

The crime was already a <em>fait accompli </em>when she looked out of the window of her house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Since she did not see how it was begun and carried out, the qualifying circumstance of treachery cannot be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> <em>Second,</em> the circumstantial evidence on record does not prove that there was any conscious or deliberate effort on the part of appellant to adopt any particular means, method or form of attack to ensure the commission of the crime without affording the victim any means to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The fact that the gun was drawn and fired does not mean that the mode of attack was consciously and deliberately employed. The use of a shotgun, by itself, does not necessarily imply treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> The RTC appreciated treachery, because the victim had been shot twice from behind as confirmed by the testimony of the medicolegal expert<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and by the physical evidence showing the extent and the location of the wounds sustained by the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> However, the mere fact that the wounds were found at the back of the victim does not by itself prove that there was treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p><p> Also, the possibility that the assailant was positioned behind the victim does not necessarily show treachery, unless there is evidence that such manner of attack was purposely adopted by him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> to accomplish the act without any risk to himself from the defense that the victim might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> Verily, the gap in the prosecution’s evidence cannot be substituted by mere suppositions, as the trial court apparently did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; Treachery cannot be appreciated absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act unfolded and resulted in the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; Treachery cannot be presumed, but must be proven positively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Any doubt as to its existence must be resolved in favor of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p><p> Thus, appellant can be convicted of homicide only,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> for which the penalty under the Revised Penal Code is <em>reclusion temporal.</em> Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and considering that there are no aggravating or mitigating circumstances present in this case, the penalty that should be imposed on him is <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period as minimum to <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> WHEREFORE, the appeal is partly <em><strong>GRANTED</strong></em>&nbsp; and the appealed Decision <em><strong>MODIFIED</strong></em>.
