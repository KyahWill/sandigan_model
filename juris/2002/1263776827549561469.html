				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO,
J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the 
decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 11, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which upheld the decision of the 
Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB, for brevity) dated May 
27, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> as well as the resolution 
dated May 16, 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying 
petitioners’ motion for reconsideration. <div align="justify">
<p>The facts as culled from the records are as follows: </p>
<p>Juana Luciano was the registered owner of an agricultural land planted to 
rice and corn measuring 16,555 square meters, situated in Barangay Bolakan, 
Bocaue, Bulacan, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1338. On 
January 12, 1962, she mortgaged the parcel of land to the Philippine Banking 
Corporation. </p>
<p>After Luciano defaulted in the payment of her loan, the bank foreclosed the 
mortgage. Thereafter, the bank became absolute owner of the land in due course, 
upon registration of its Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership. Accordingly, 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-123404 was consequently issued in the name 
of the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>On January 11, 1985, the bank sold the property to petitioner Guillermo 
Batongbacal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The bank subsequently 
executed an Affidavit of Non-Tenancy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
in order to enable petitioner to register the land in his name. However, when 
petitioner tried to register the deed of absolute sale, he discovered that 
Certificate of Land Transfer No.0-025760, issued in the name of private 
respondent Catalino Santos, also covers the same property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p>Hence, petitioner filed a letter-complaint with the Department of Agrarian 
Reform Team Office in Sta. Maria, Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The complaint was endorsed to the DAR 
Provincial Adjudicator at Dolores, San Fernando, Pampanga. Petitioner alleged 
that private respondent Catalino Santos excavated a substantial portion of the 
property despite knowledge that petitioner already purchased the same. 
<br>Catalino Santos countered that he was awarded Certificate of Land Transfer 
No. 0-025760 dated January 22, 1981 affecting the property by the Department of 
Agrarian Reform, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He declared the land for taxation 
purposes, for which Tax Declaration No.12564 was issued in his name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He presented Tax Receipt No. 9928095 to 
show that he has been paying taxes on the property since May 11, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
<p>On May 21, 1987, private respondent went blind. Thus, he waived all his 
rights and interests over the property as an amortizing agrarian reform 
beneficiary in favor of his younger son, Severino Santos, with the conformity of 
his elder son, Teofilo Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<p>Severino Santos continued cultivating the property and delivering a portion 
of the harvest by way of rentals to former owner Juana Luciano and her 
representatives till the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, when the latter refused to 
receive them. Thereafter, Severino Santos entrusted the rentals to the Barangay 
Captain who, in turn, deposited the same with the rice mill of a certain Crispin 
Santiago, at Tuvo, Bocaue, Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
Private respondent further alleged that the transactions between Juana Luciano 
and the bank, and between the latter and the petitioner Guillermo Batongbacal, 
were all executed in Manila without notice to him as the actual tenant. 
Therefore, he is not bound by the said transactions for lack of knowledge or 
information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>
<p>After due proceedings, the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board 
rendered a decision in favor of Catalino and Severino Santos, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered: </p>
<p>1. Dismissing the complaint against Catalino/Severino Santos; </p>
<p>2. Declaring Catalino/Severino Santos as tenant-lessee and now owner; </p>
<p>3. Declaring the substitution valid; </p>
<p>4. No damages against the defendant for making improvement only on his farm 
holding. </p>
<p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner’s subsequent Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion 
for Reconsideration were both denied by the RARAD in an order dated August 17, 
1989. On appeal, the DARAB affirmed the decision, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the appealed decision is hereby 
AFFIRMED, and, as an addition to the dispositive portion thereof, it is hereby 
ordered that the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer for Bocaue, Bulacan and the 
Bulacan Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer at Baliuag, Bulacan shall forthwith 
continue the processing of the land transfer action documents involving the farm 
holding in this case, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27 and Department of 
Agrarian Reform and Land Bank of the Philippines procedures and regulations 
implementing the said decree. </p>
<p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, petitioner passed away, and was substituted by his heirs Rosario 
Batongbacal et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thereafter, the 
said heirs filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, alleging, 
<em>inter alia</em>, that the DARAB erred when it refused to recognize 
petitioner Guillermo Batongbacal as the true and lawful owner of the subject 
landholding; in declaring the sale of said land null and void pursuant to P.D. 
No. 27; in ruling against their claim for damages despite the preponderance of 
evidence in their favor; and in recognizing the validity of a Certificate of 
Land Transfer despite the fact that the alleged transferor/landowner no longer 
owned the parcel of land covered thereby at the time of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
<p>On August 11, 1995, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment denying the 
petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioners’ filed a Motion 
for Reconsideration, which was denied on May 16, 1996. <br>Hence this petition, 
raising the following issues: </p>
<p align="center">I. </p>
<p align="center">THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION 
TANTAMOUNT TO EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE PETITIONER 
GUILLERMO BATONGBACAL AS THE TRUE AND LAWFUL OWNER OF THE LANDHOLDING AND 
ENTITLED TO CLAIM DAMAGES. </p>
<p align="center">II. </p>
<p align="center">THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT 
DECLARED AS NULL AND VOID THE SALE OF THE SUBJECT LAND BETWEEN PHILBANKING AND 
PETITIONER, AFTER STATING THAT THE LATTER VALIDLY ACQUIRED WHATEVER TITLE THE 
FORMER HAD OVER THE LAND. </p>
<p align="center">III. </p>
<p align="center">THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT 
UPHELD THE DARAB’S POSITION THAT THE PETITIONER IS NOT ENTITLED TO CLAIM 
DAMAGES. </p>
<p align="center">IV. </p>
<p align="center">THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT 
DECLARED THE CERTIFICATE OF LAND TRANSFER VALID DESPITE THE FACT THAT AT THE 
TIME OF ITS GENERATION, THE PURPORTED TRANSFEROR NO LONGER OWNED THE LAND BEING 
TRANSFERRED. </p>
<p>The petition lacks merit. </p>
<p>In determining, once and for all, the rights of the parties with respect to 
the subject property, it is necessary to trace the transfer of ownership from 
the original owner, Juana Luciano, to Philippine Banking Corporation and, 
eventually, to petitioner, vis-à-vis private respondent’s rights of tenancy. 
</p>
<p>The records show that the subject land was initially denominated as Lot 1129, 
and was among the parcels of land comprising what was then known as the Lolomboy 
Estate originally registered in the name of the Insular Government of the 
Philippines. It was subsequently transferred in favor of Juana Luciano sometime 
in the 1930s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Tenancy relations 
between Juana Luciano and private respondent Catalino Santos commenced at about 
the same time, so that when said property was mortgaged by the former to 
Philbanking in 1962, said relations already subsisted, and were governed by the 
provisions of R.A. 1199<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and R.A. 
3844.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p>
<p>Thus, when Philbanking became the absolute owner of the subject land on 
February 5, 1970, it was subrogated to the rights of Juana Luciano as 
agricultural lessor with respect to private respondent. Section 7 of R.A. 1199 
states that once the tenancy relationship is established, the tenant is entitled 
to security of tenure. Section 9 thereof, on the other hand, provides in part 
that the sale or alienation of the tenanted land does not extinguish the tenancy 
relationship. The purchaser or transferee shall assume the rights and 
obligations of the former landholder in relation to the tenant. </p>
<p>Section 7 of R.A. 3844, on the other hand, states that once the agricultural 
leasehold relation is established, the same shall confer upon the lessee the 
right to continue working on the landholding until such relation is 
extinguished, and the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to security of 
tenure on his landholding and cannot be ejected therefrom unless authorized by 
the Court and for causes provided by law. It is worthy to note that the sale or 
alienation of tenanted land is not among the causes of extinguishment of the 
agricultural leasehold relation provided under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p>
<p>In <em>Endaya v. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> we held that, “Transactions involving 
agricultural land over which an agricultural leasehold subsists resulting in 
change of ownership will not terminate the rights of the agricultural lessee.” 
In <em>Tanpingco v. Intermediate Appellate Court</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we stated that, “Security of tenure is a 
legal concession to agricultural lessees which they value as life itself and 
deprivation of their landholdings is tantamount to deprivation of their means of 
livelihood.”</p>
<p>When P.D. 27 took effect on October 21, 1972, the land was already owned by 
Philbanking, but the tenancy relations remained in force. By virtue of this law, 
“tenant-farmers are <em>deemed </em>owners of the land they till, subject to the 
rules and regulations to be hereafter promulgated.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Pursuant to the mandate of P.D. 27, a 
Certificate of Land Transfer was issued to private respondent Catalino Santos on 
January 22, 1981, and was registered on February 1, 1981 with the Register of 
Deeds of Bulacan. </p>
<p>During all this time, private respondent continued tilling the land and 
paying rentals to Juana Luciano, and after her death, to her representatives. 
The sale between Philbanking and petitioner took place on January 11, 1985. At 
about this time, Juana Luciano’s representatives began to refuse accepting the 
rentals from private respondent. Thus, private respondent deposited the rentals 
with a certain Crispin Santiago, a rice mill owner in nearby Tuvo, Bocaue, 
through the mediation of the Barangay Captain. Under the circumstances, we find 
that private respondent complied in good faith with the obligations incumbent 
upon him as an agricultural lessee.&nbsp;</p><p>Philbanking, on the other hand, was 
remiss in its duties as an agricultural lessor when it sold the subject land to 
a third person, without giving notice to private respondent and giving him the 
opportunity to exercise his right of preemption as an agricultural lessee. </p>
<p>Section 11 of R.A. 3844 provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 11. <em>Lessee’s Right of Preemption</em>. – In case the agricultural 
lessor decides to sell the landholding, the agricultural lessee shall have the 
<strong>preferential right to buy</strong> the same under reasonable terms and 
conditions: Provided, That the entire landholding offered for sale must be 
preempted by the Department of Agrarian Reform upon petition of the lessee or of 
any of them: Provided, further, That where there are two or more agricultural 
lessees, each shall be entitled to said preferential right only to the extent of 
the area actually cultivated by him. The right of preemption under this section 
may be exercised within one hundred eighty days <strong>from notice in writing, 
which shall be served by the owner on all lessees affected and the Department of 
Agrarian Reform.</strong> (Emphasis provided) </p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, therefore, Philbanking committed breach of obligation as an 
agricultural lessor. As the records show, private respondent was not informed 
about the sale between Philbanking and petitioner, and neither was he privy to 
the transfer of ownership from Juana Luciano to Philbanking. As an agricultural 
lessee, the law gives him the right to be informed about matters affecting the 
land he tills, without need for him to inquire about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Department 
Memorandum Circular No. 8, series of 1974, implementing P.D. 27, provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. No act shall be done to undermine or subvert the intent and provisions of 
Presidential Decrees, Letters of Instructions, Memoranda and Directives, such as 
the following and/or similar acts: </p></blockquote>
<p>x x x <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x 
x<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x </p>
<p>f.) Transferring ownership of tenanted rice and/or corn lands after October 
21, 1972, except to the actual tenant-farmers or tillers but in strict 
conformity with the provisions of Presidential Decree No.27 and the requirements 
of the Department of Agrarian Reform. x x x. </p>
<p>In other words, transfer of ownership over tenanted rice and/or corn lands 
after October 21, 1972 is allowed only in favor of the actual tenant-tillers 
thereon. Hence, the sale executed by Philbanking on January 11, 1985 in favor of 
petitioner was in violation of the aforequoted provision of P.D. 27 and its 
implementing guidelines, and must thus be declared null and void. </p>
<p>Finally, petitioner’s claim for damages arising out of private respondent’s 
act of excavating the property is untenable, considering the fact that the 
tenant is “deemed owner” of the property and as such he is given a certain 
discretion relative to the manner of tilling the land. In fact, according to the 
DARAB, the removal of the topsoil was done to level the land for purposes of 
irrigation. The excavation was in line with the cultivation of the land and 
calculated to increase production.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 
Well settled is the rule that factual findings of administrative agencies are 
binding upon the courts, unless such findings are not supported by substantial 
evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the instant petition for 
review is DENIED. The decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 11, 1995, 
which upheld the decision of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication 
Board dated May 27, 1993, is AFFIRMED. </p>
<p>SO ORDERED. </p>
