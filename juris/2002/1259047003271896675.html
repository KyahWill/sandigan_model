				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For automatic review is the decision of the Regional Trial Court of the City of Tagbilaran, Branch 2, in Criminal Case No. 10283, dated August 30, 1999, finding accused-appellant Elpidio Pastor guilty of incestuous rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death with its accessory penalties, to indemnify the complainant Maria Niña R. Pastor the sum of P75,000.00, and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 12, 1999, accused-appellant was charged with the crime of Incestuous Rape, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 7th day of May, 1998, in the Municipality of Loon, Province of Bohol, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused with lewd designs, entered the room of his own daughter, Maria Niña R. Pastor (accused being the biological father of the victim), a 13-year-old girl, and once inside did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation, lie on top of her, insert his penis in the vagina of the said offended victim, Maria Niña R. Pastor, and succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her against her will and without her consent resulting in the pregnancy of the victim, to the damage and prejudice of the latter.<br><br>Acts committed in violation of Sec. 2, Art. 266-B, par. 1, of RA 8353, amending [Article] 335 of the Revised Penal Code.”</blockquote>On April 8, 1999, accused-appellant was arraigned and, with the assistance of PAO lawyer Atty. Perpetuo Magallano, entered a plea of not guilty.<br><br>During the hearing on June 23, 1999, Atty. Adriano Damalerio of PAO manifested that after a conference with accused-appellant, the latter had decided to change his plea from Not Guilty to Guilty.&nbsp; The trial court ordered that the previous plea of not guilty be set aside and that accused-appellant be arraigned anew.&nbsp; Upon re-arraignment, accused-appellant entered a plea of guilty to the Information which was read and translated to him in the Visayan dialect.&nbsp; Thereafter, the trial court propounded clarificatory questions to accused-appellant to ascertain whether he understood the consequences of his plea.<br><br>Accused-appellant then testified on the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty, voluntary surrender and drunkenness which is not habitual.&nbsp; The prosecution admitted the plea of guilty and voluntary surrender.&nbsp; Accused-appellant offered evidence to prove drunkenness.&nbsp; He testified that on May 7, 1998, he drank tuba and in his drunkenness, he was led to think bad about his daughter, herein complainant, because his wife left him.&nbsp; He claims that it was never his intention to rape his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the prosecution was ordered to prove the culpability of accused-appellant.&nbsp; Complainant Maria Niña testified that on May 7, 1998, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, she was raped by her father, herein accused-appellant, in their house at Catagbacan Sur, Loon, Bohol.&nbsp; Her parents were already separated at that time and her mother was living in Manila.&nbsp; Complainant was impregnated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and gave birth on December 12, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On cross examination, complainant testified that she was 13 years old at the time of the incident;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> that she had a premature delivery and her baby died five days after birth; that nobody forced her to file the complaint against accused-appellant; and that she pursued the prosecution of the case against accused-appellant knowing that he may be sentenced to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On August 30, 1999, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of incestuous rape.&nbsp; It nevertheless recommended the commutation of the sentence from death to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by reason of the remorseful attitude exhibited by accused-appellant.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 10283, the Court finds accused <b>ELPIDIO PASTOR</b>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Incestuous Rape, defined under Par 1 (a) of Article 266-A and penalized under Par 5, No. (1) of Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, and hereby sentences said accused <b>ELPIDIO PASTOR</b> to suffer the supreme and indivisible penalty of <b>DEATH</b>, in the manner provided for by law, with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the offended party, Maria Niña R. Pastor the sum of P75,000.00, and to pay the costs.<br><br>The Court herein was saved of its precious time in conducting (a) full-dress trial because the accused pleaded guilty.&nbsp; The prosecution even conformed to accused' (sic) claim of the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and spontaneous plea of guilt.<br><br>When the accused took the witness stand to prove the circumstance of drunkenness, which is not habitual, which was not conceded by the prosecution, we found him to be meditative and remorseful, a behaviour which is quite different from other death-row convicts, who despite the onus of the evidence against them, with insistence, persist in needlessly taxing the court on their claim of innocence, all throughout the trial and even after the affirmance of their conviction by our Highest Court.&nbsp; We believe that accused herein should not be equated to the likes of these calloused and non-repentant offenders.<br><br>It is therefore on the basis of the foregoing circumstances, and in the highest interest of humane and compassionate justice, that we are minded of the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, and hereby, without suspending the execution of the sentence herein, recommends unto the President of the Republic of the Philippines, thru the Secretary of Justice, the commutation of accused' (sic) sentence from death to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>Accordingly, let copy of this decision be furnished the Secretary of Justice, Padre Faura, Manila, for whatever recommendation he may deem proper to His Excellency, the President of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b>”</blockquote>In his appellant's brief, accused-appellant avers that the trial court gravely erred in not applying the guidelines for a plea of guilty to a capital offense provided in Section 3, Rule 116 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.&nbsp; Specifically, it is contended that the trial court failed to conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of the accused-appellant's plea, pursuant to the ruling laid down in the cases of <b>People vs. Bello</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and <b>People vs. Dayot.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Allegedly, the questions propounded to the accused-appellant were limited to his family background and personal circumstances.&nbsp; Accused-appellant thus prays that the case be remanded to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> for a full-blown trial.<br><br>Section 3, Rule 116 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>“SEC. 3.&nbsp; <i>Plea of guilty to capital offense; reception of evidence.</i> - When the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his plea and shall require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of his culpability.&nbsp; The accused may present evidence in his behalf.”</blockquote>When a plea of guilty to a capital offense is entered, the trial court is duty bound to: (1) conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea and the accused's full comprehension of the consequences thereof; (2) require the prosecution to present evidence to prove the guilt of the accused and the precise degree of his culpability; and (3) inquire from the accused if he desires to present evidence on his behalf and allow him to do so if he desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The rationale behind the rule is that the courts must proceed with more care where the possible punishment is in its severest form, namely death, for the reason that the execution of such a sentence is irrevocable and experience has shown that innocent persons have at times pleaded guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Moreover, the requirement of taking further evidence would aid this Court on appellate review in determining the propriety or impropriety of the plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">I.<br></div><br>Anent the first requirement, the searching inquiry must determine whether the plea of guilt was based on a free and informed judgment. Hence, it must focus on (1) the voluntariness of the plea, and (2) the full comprehension of the consequences of the plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Although there is no definite and concrete rule as to how a trial judge must conduct a “searching inquiry,” we have held that the following guidelines should be observed: <ol> <li>Ascertain from the accused himself (a) how he was brought into the custody of the law; (b) whether he had the assistance of a competent counsel during the custodial and preliminary investigations; and (c) under what conditions he was detained and interrogated during the investigations.&nbsp; This is intended to rule out the possibility that the accused has been coerced or placed under a state of duress either by actual threats of physical harm coming from malevolent quarters or simply because of the judge's intimidating robes.<br><br></li><li>Ask the defense counsel a series of questions as to whether he had conferred with, and completely explained to, the accused the meaning and consequences of a plea of guilty.<br><br></li><li>Elicit information about the personality profile of the accused, such as his age, socio-economic status, and educational background, which may serve as a trustworthy index of his capacity to give a free and informed plea of guilty.<br><br></li><li>Inform the accused the exact length of imprisonment or nature of the penalty under the law and the certainty that he will serve such sentence.&nbsp; For not infrequently,&nbsp; an accused pleads guilty in the hope of a lenient treatment or upon bad advice or because of promises of the authorities or parties of a lighter penalty should he admit guilt or express remorse.&nbsp; It is the duty of the judge to ensure that the accused does not labor under these mistaken impressions because a plea of guilty carries with it not only the admission of authorship of the crime proper but also of the aggravating circumstances attending it, that increase punishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br></li><li>Inquire if the accused knows the crime with which he is charged and fully explain to him the elements of the crime which is the basis of his indictment.&nbsp; Failure of the court to do so would constitute a violation of his fundamental right to be informed of the precise nature of the accusation against him and a denial of his right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br></li><li>All questions posed to the accused should be in a language known and understood by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br></li><li>The trial judge must satisfy himself that the accused, in pleading guilty, is truly guilty. The accused must be required to narrate the tragedy or reenact the crime or furnish its missing details.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </li></ol> In the case at bar, the records will show that the trial court miserably failed to discharge its duty to conduct a "searching inquiry," to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY.

In the case at bar, the qualifying circumstance of relationship was not established beyond moral certainty.&nbsp; The rule is that relationship, as a qualifying circumstance of rape, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, just as the crime itself.&nbsp; It has been held that the bare testimony of the complainant and the admission of accused-appellant as to their relationship is not sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The birth certificate of herein complainant which was not duly certified cannot be given probative value insofar as the relationship of complainant with accused-appellant is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Since the relationship of complainant to accused-appellant has not been sufficiently established, it was error for the trial court to impose the penalty of death.<br><br>In addition, the trial court, in convicting accused-appellant, considered pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution that are inadmissible for being hearsay.&nbsp; The prosecution merely asked complainant to identify the two medical certificates relating to her pregnancy without presenting the doctors who issued the certifications to testify thereon. The defense counsel failed to object to the documentary evidence of the prosecution and worse, even expressed his conformity to its admission.&nbsp; Such lapses should not have been allowed by the trial court considering that it was trying a case where a life was at stake.&nbsp; Life cannot be lost due to the ignorance of counsel.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III.</b><br></div><br>Under the third requirement, the court must ask the accused if he desires to present evidence on his behalf and allow him to do so if he desires.&nbsp; In the present case, there is nothing in the records to show that accused-appellant was informed, either by his counsel or by the court, of his right to present evidence, if he so desires.<br><br>Very glaring is the manifest lack of enthusiasm of the defense counsel, Atty. Damalerio, for his client's cause when he refused to cross examine the complainant, on the pretext that accused-appellant has pleaded guilty.&nbsp; We reiterate that it is the bounden duty of lawyers to protect the constitutional right of an accused even when he has pleaded guilty to the crime charged, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.</span>:<br><blockquote>“It may be so that defense counsel personally found Oleby's testimony to be believable.&nbsp; Nonetheless, he had the bounden duty to scrutinize private complainant's testimony to ensure that the accused's constitutional right to confront and examine the witnesses against him was not rendered for naught.<br><br>It bears pointing out that in rape cases, it is often the word of the complainant against that of the accused, the two being the only persons present during the commission of the offense.&nbsp; While the lone testimony of the victim is sufficient to convict the accused, such testimony must be clear, positive, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.&nbsp; Complainant's testimony cannot be accepted with precipitate credulity without denying the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent.&nbsp; This is where cross examination becomes essential to test the credibility of the witnesses, expose falsehoods or half-truths, uncover the truth which rehearsed direct examination testimonies may successfully suppress, and demonstrate inconsistencies in substantial matters which create reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused and thus to give substance to the constitutional right of the accused to confront the witnesses against him.&nbsp; For unless proven otherwise to be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, the accused is presumed to be innocent.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Atty. Brotonel, as counsel de oficio, had the duty to defend his client and protect his rights, no matter how guilty or evil he perceives accused-appellant to be.&nbsp; The performance of this duty was all the more imperative because the life of accused-appellant hangs in the balance.&nbsp; His duty was no less because he was counsel de oficio.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>This utter lack of concern is further aggravated by Atty. Damalerio's lackadaisical and perfunctory discharge of his obligation to present evidence in behalf of accused-appellant. After the prosecution rested its case, Atty. Damalerio manifested that since the accused-appellant had already pleaded guilty, he is not presenting any defense, and merely prayed that his client be credited with the mitigating circumstances earlier claimed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> To say the least, Atty. Damalerio’s attitude falls short of the noble duty of a lawyer to defend an accused however guilty he may appear to be if only to assure that his prosecution is in accord with the procedure laid down by our law.&nbsp; In cannot be over emphasized that even the guilty cannot be prosecuted by means revolting to the civilized demands of due process.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the judgment appealed from is <b>SET ASIDE.</b>&nbsp; The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the trial court for further proceedings in accord with the guidelines set forth in this Decision.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Buena, Ynares-Santiago, De Leon, Jr., Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Baudilio K.
