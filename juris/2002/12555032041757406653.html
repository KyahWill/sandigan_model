				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant, Melchor Estomaca y Garque, was charged by his daughter, Melita Estomaca, of five counts of rape, committed on different occasions, before the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo, Branch 38, and docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 43567, 43568, 43569, 43570 and 43571.<br><br>During the arraignment on June 15, 1994, accused-appellant entered a plea of guilty to Criminal Cases Nos. 43568 and 43571, and a plea of not guilty to Criminal Cases Nos. 43567, 43569 and 43570.<br><br>Trial ensued with respect to Criminal Cases Nos. 43568 and 43571. The criminal complaint subject of Criminal Case No. 43568 reads:<br><blockquote>“That sometime in the month of December, 1993, in the Municipality of San Joaquin, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, taking advantage of his superior strength, abuse of confidence and trust, he, being the father of the undersigned, with deliberate intent and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with (sic) the undersigned who, at that time, is 15 years of age.<br><br>“CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </blockquote>while Criminal Case No, 43571 reads:<br><blockquote>“That on or about March 6, 1994, in the Municipality of San Joaquin, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the father of the undersigned complainant, with deliberate intent and by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse of the undersigned, who, at that time, is 15 years of age.<br><br>“CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>On July 15, 1994, the trial court rendered judgment finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in Criminal Case No. 43568 and death in Criminal Case No. 43571. He was also ordered to indemnify the private complainant the sum of P50,000.00 in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The cases were brought to this Court for automatic review and docketed as G.R. No. 117485-86. On April 22, 1996, judgment was rendered setting aside accused-appellant’s conviction, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the judgment of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> in Criminal Cases Nos. 43568 and 43571 convicting accused-appellant Melchor Estomaca y Garque of two crimes of rape is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp;Said cases are <b>REMANDED</b> to the trial court for further and appropriate proceedings, with instructions that the same be given appropriate priority and the proceedings therein be conducted with deliberate dispatch and circumspection.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote>On August 30, 1996, the records of the case were returned to the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; However, with the inhibition of Judge David A. Alfeche, Jr., Presiding Judge of the trial court, Criminal Cases Nos. 43568 and 43571 were referred to Branch 67 of the Regional Trial Court of Guimbal, lloilo and re- docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 024(97) and 025(97), respectively.<br><br>Accused-appellant, assisted by counsel, was arraigned anew on November 26, 1997, where he entered a plea of not guilty to both criminal complaints. Thereafter, the two cases were tried jointly.<br><br>The prosecution’s evidence revealed that Melita Estomaca, was born on July 21, 1972<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; to accused-appellant and Nenita Ruelo, Sometime in December of 1993, at about 11:00 in the evening, Melita was in their house at Barangay Tiolas, San Joaquin, Iloilo, sleeping on the floor with her brother Nicolas and accused-appellant. Suddenly, she felt somebody touching her breast and forehead. When she woke up, she saw accused-appellant who told her to go back to sleep. Thereafter, accused-appellant removed her shorts and panty, laid on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina. Melita struggled but accused-appellant boxed her on the stomach which rendered her unconscious. She did not report the incident to her mother because accused- appellant threatened to kill her mother and brother.<br><br>The incident was repeated on March 6, 1994. Melita was about to sleep when accused-appellant started fondling her breast. She pleaded with her father to stop but the latter continued. She kicked him but accused-appellant punched her on the stomach which rendered her unconscious. Thereafter, accused-appellant succeeded in satisfying his lust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Unable to take the abuses of her father, Melita finally narrated the incidents to her mother, Nenita who confronted accused-appellant but the latter maltreated her. Melita left their house and stayed at her grandmother’s house in Nueva Valencia , Guimaras. Accused-appellant followed her and asked her to go home, but Melita refused. It was at this instance when Melita narrated to her grandmother her ordeal. Criminal complaints were filed against accused- appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Melita was brought to Dr. Shiela D. Gumabong, Rural Health Physician of Nueva Valencia , Guimaras, for medical examination which revealed the following findings:<br><blockquote>“EXTERNAL EXAMINATIONS:<br><br>“Breast, fully developed, hemispherical in shape, slightly soft in consistency, areola brownish in color with nipples prominent and protruding.<br><br>“No evidence of contusion, hematoma or abrasion in external body surfaces.<br><br>“INTERNAL EXAMINATIONS:<br><br>“Pubic hair grown and slightly abundant; labia majora and minor are coaptated.<br><br>“Hymenal opening shows an old laceration with scar formation at 3:00 o’clock and 9:00 o’clock position on the face of the watch. Hymenal orifice admits 2 fingers with moderate resistance. Vaginal ruguesities are present and prominent. Vaginal canal is moderately tight.<br><br>“Speculum examination: Cervix closed, well formed, pinkish in color. Uterus not enlarged.<br><br>“CONCLUSION:&nbsp;1. No extra-genital injuries noted<br><div style="margin-left: 120px;">2. Physical Virginity Lost.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div> </blockquote>For his defense, accused-appellant denied the charges levelled against him, testifying thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY. TIONGCO:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You are accused by Melita Estomaca on raping her five (5) times on five (5) separate occasions, are those accusations true?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">No, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“Q&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Melita Estomaca while in the witness stand testified before this Honorable Court that you boxed her in the stomach in order to rape her, is that true?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>“A&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">No, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY.

He did not bother to advance any serious, credible or well-founded motive or reason why his own daughter charged him of the heinous crime of RAPE. Yes, the records of the proceedings are bereft of any evil motive why Melita Estomaca should charge his father of rape. There was no effort on the part of the accused to impute ill or evil motive on the complainant. The record is bare of any evidence to show any improper motive on the part of the victim to charge her own father of such a very serious crime that is punishable by death. The legal conclusion therefore, is that the testimonies of the victim, Melita Estomaca is worthy of full faith and credit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote>Accused-appellant now comes to this court assailing the above decision, arguing that the trial court erred in convicting him and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and death. He contends that the testimonies of Nenita and Nicolas negate the claim of Melita that force or intimidation was used for him to have carnal access to her.<br><br>Such contention deserves no merit.<br><br>Melita’s failure to shout or offer tenacious resistance did not make voluntary her submission to the criminal acts of the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; We have, time and again, ruled that in rape committed by the father against the daughter, violence or intimidation need not be proven because of the former’s moral ascendancy and influence over the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Being the father, accused-appellant exercises moral and physical ascendancy over Melita which could be sufficient to cow her into submission to his bestial desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, evidence shows that Melita resisted the efforts of accused-appellant. In fact, in the March 1994 incident, Melita kicked accused-appellant. Her resistance, however, proved futile. On the other hand, Nicolas’ failure to hear any commotion during the sexual assaults may be attributed to the fact that at the time of the rapes, it is possible that Nicolas was in deep slumber and not awakened by the resistance offered by the latter against her father.<br><br>Accused-appellant likewise asserts that the testimony of Melita is incredible, full of improbabilities and inconsistent with human experience.&nbsp;He specifically points to the following: (a) it was impossible for accused-appellant to rape Melita in the presence of his son who was sleeping between them; (b) Melita continued to sleep with accused-appellant and her brother despite the alleged assault on her honor; (c) Melita did not report the incident to her mother and brother; and (d) Melita did not make any attempt to escape.<br><br>Again, we find the above contentions unmeritorious.<br><br>In a prosecution for rape, the complainant’s credibility becomes the single most important issue and when the testimony meets the test of credibility, an accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the testimony of the offended woman standing alone can be the basis of conviction if such testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>We have carefully read the testimony of Melita and finds the same to be truthful and credible.

In addition, no ill motive can be imputed against her to concoct a story of defloration were she not motivated by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished. Certainly, no barrio lass, still in her teens, innocent and naive to the ways of the world, would fabricate a story of bestiality against her own father that could sully her reputation and expose herself, as well as her family to all sorts of public aspersions were she not motivated to seek justice for a wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Similarly, we cannot sustain accused-appellant’s argument that it was impossible for him to commit the rape in the presence of his son who was sleeping beside him. There is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion. We have time and again held that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks along the roadside, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping and even in places which to many would appear unlikely and high risk venues for its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Lust is no respecter of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Also, Melita’s failure to immediately report the incident to her mother or to the police authorities do not negate the crime of rape.<br><br>We have ruled, in a plethora of cases, that failure of the victim to immediately report the rape is not necessarily an indication of fabricated charge. It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for some time the assault on their virtues because of the rapist’s threat on their lives, more so when the rapist is living with her. Melita’s delay in reporting the sexual violations is thus understandable and does not affect her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant’s sheer denial cannot overthrow the unequivocal and positive testimony of Melita. Mere denial, just like alibi, constitute a self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Without being substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, his defense deserves no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value than the testimony of complainant, whom the court finds to be a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, in an attempt to evade the death penalty, assails Melita’s age claiming that her birth date was altered from 1972 to 1978 to make it appear that at the time of the alleged rape, Melita was a minor. He also insinuates that Melita is not his daughter claiming that at the time he married Melita’s mother, the latter was already two months pregnant. He denies having carnal knowledge of Melita’s mother before the marriage.<br><br>The contention has no leg to stand on.<br><br>The Certificate of Live Birth shows that Melita was born on July 21, 1978 and that she is the daughter of accused-appellant and Nenita Ruelo. At the time of rape, Melita was 14 years old. The defense failed to present contrary evidence to dispute Melita’s age. It presented Melita’s mother, Nenita, but the latter did not refute the former's age much less her paternity. It requires more than a party's bare allegation to defeat the face value of the Birth Certificate which enjoys a legal presumption of regularity of issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In sum, this court finds no reversible error in the trial court’s decision finding the accused- appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape and sustains the imposition of the penalties with a modification that the civil indemnity awarded in Criminal Case No. 025(97) be increased from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00, in view of the attendant qualifying circumstances for which the death penalty is authorized under RA No. 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In addition, we deem it proper to award moral damages for the shame, as well as mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, moral shock and social humiliation Melita has suffered, which, conformably with current jurisprudence, should be placed in the amount of P50,000.00 for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; An award of exemplary damages is also proper to deter other fathers with similar perverse tendencies or aberrant sexual behavior from sexually abusing their own daughters, in the amount of P25,000.00 for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Four Justices of the Court maintain their position that R. A. No. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty.
