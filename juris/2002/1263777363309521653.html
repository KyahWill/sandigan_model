Or does it enfeeble him to render it difficult or impossible to commit coital assault? <p> Before us for automatic review is the March 28, 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 76, of San Mateo, Rizal in Criminal Case No. 4163 convicting accused-appellant Aurelio Cruz y Ramos of raping his then sixteen (16) year old daughter Marivic Cruz and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death.</p><p> The Information dated May 20, 1999 charged accused-appellant with rape allegedly committed as follows:</p><blockquote><p> That on or about the 15th day of May, 1999, in the Municipality of San Mateo, Province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, having moral ascendancy over complainant MARIVIC CRUZ Y ORE, the latter being his daughter, by means of force, coercion and intimidation and with lewd design or intent to cause or gratify his sexual desire or abuse, humiliate and degrade complainant, while armed with a knife, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said complainant, a minor, sixteen (16) years old, without her consent and against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup></p></blockquote><p> When arraigned on June 17, 1999, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup></p><p> Culled from the testimony of five witnesses for the prosecution, namely: Marivic, her mother Juliet, her aunt Susana Quigaman – sister of accused-appellant, a medico legal officer, and a policeman, are the following facts:</p><p> Marivic, the eldest of six children of accused-appellant and his common-law-wife Juliet Ore, and her young twin siblings resided with their parents at Doña Pepeng Subdivision, Banaba, San Mateo Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">4</sup></p><p> On May 15, 1999, at about 2:00 p. m., after accused-appellant, his wife Juliet, Marivic and the twins had returned home following their attendance of a fiesta in neighboring barangay Nangka in Marikina City, Juliet left for her usual weekly visit to her ailing mother in Bulacan.</p><p>Right after her mother Juliet departed for Bulacan, the then 16 year old Marivic sat teary eyed in front of the house of her aunt-neighbor Susana<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5</sup> who, noting her expanding buttocks,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">6</sup> asked her what her problem was. Marivic reluctantly revealed to Susana that she had been molested by her father-accused-appellant since she was 12<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">7</sup> but that she was afraid to disclose it because he threatened to kill her and her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">8</sup></p><p> Marivic’s tale upset Susana who echoed it to her (Susana’s) other siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">9</sup></p><p> At around 7:00 p. m., also of May 15, 1999, while inside their house, accused-appellant ordered Marivic to lie down and sleep beside him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">10</sup> He then took off his clothes and asked her to undress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">11</sup> As accused-appellant poked a “Rambo” knife<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">12</sup> at her neck and threatened to kill all of them,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">13</sup> Marivic complied.</p><p> Although Marivic tried to shout for help, accused-appellant covered her face with a pillow,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">14</sup> after which he inserted his penis into her vagina and made a push and pull movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">15</sup> Marivic could not do anything but cry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">16</sup></p><p> After satisfying his lust, accused-appellant warned Marivic not to tell anyone about the incident under pain of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">17</sup></p><p> On May 17, 1999, Susana and her relatives, after reflecting on what to do about Marivic’s plight, had accused-appellant arrested and detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">18</sup></p><p> On Juliet’s return from Bulacan, Susana informed her of Marivic’s tale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">19</sup> Juliet lost no time in confronting the already detained accused- appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">20</sup>&nbsp; whom she slapped.</p><p> On May 18, 1999, Marivic, accompanied by Juliet and Susana,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">21</sup> was examined by Dr. James Margallo Belgira, Medical Legal Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory Services in Camp Crame, Quezon City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">22</sup> whose findings were incorporated in Medico Legal Report No. M-1032-99.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">23</sup></p><p>The doctor found that there was a deep healed laceration in Marivic’s hymen at 5 o’clock position, which laceration he opined to be caused by the insertion of a hard blunt object in the vagina, possibly an erect male penis; that the insertion could have been done on May 15, 1999; and that from the pregnancy test he conducted on her <em>viz a viz </em>her last menstrual period, Marivic was 12 - 13 weeks pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">24</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> Accused-appellant, confronted with Marivic’s claim that he poked a knife at her and “forcibly abused” (the phrase used by defense counsel) her, replied that he did not know because he was drunk:</p><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%">You heard her testify that you forcibly abused her with the use of a bladed weapon?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>No, sir.</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td> Why are you saying so?</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td><strong> I really did not do it, sir? </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td> Which act you did not commit?

(a), Sec. 5 of RA 8369) and sentencing him to suffer the Penalty of Death, and to indemnify the private complainant Marivic Cruz y Ore in the amount of P75,000.00 and P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">27</sup></p></blockquote><p> In his Brief, accused-appellant proffers this lone assignment of error:</p><blockquote><p> THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">28</sup></p></blockquote><p> he assailing the credibility of Marivic.</p><p> Accused-appellant argues that Marivic’s failure to report to her mother Juliet that she was being molested by him, and her going back home in the afternoon of May 15, 1999 even after she had confided to her aunt Susan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">29</sup> what she claimed to have gone through, infirm her credibility. And he reiterates his claim that he was drunk on May 15, 1999 and concludes that it was hard for him to rape Marivic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">30</sup></p><p> It is doctrinally settled that a rape victim who, like Marivic, testifies in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank manner, and remains consistent, is a credible witness and her testimony must be given full weight and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">31</sup></p><p> And the victim’s credibility is enhanced when she accuses her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">32</sup> For it is unthinkable, if not completely preposterous, that a daughter would audaciously concoct a story of rape against her father in wanton disregard of the unspeakable trauma and social stigma it may generate on her and the entire family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">33</sup></p><p>Marivic’s failure to report the previous incidents of rape to her mother does not dent her credibility, there being no standard form of behavior expected of rape victims who react differently to emotional stress. Accused-appellant’s moral ascendancy could have led Marivic to suffer in silence and restrain her from reporting the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">34</sup> Besides, in rape cases, young girls usually conceal for some time their ordeals due to threats made by their assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">35</sup> that Marivic was overcome by accused-appellant’s threats,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">36</sup> she so clearly impressed while she was at the witness stand.</p><p> Marivic’s credibility should not thus be tainted with any modicum of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">37</sup></p><p>As for Marivic’s returning home after she had revealed her ordeals to her aunt Susana: The rape subject of the case at bar occurred nighttime of May 15, 1999, after Marivic had disclosed earlier in the afternoon to her aunt the previous coital assaults on her by accused-appellant. That Marivic still returned home that afternoon of May 15, 1999 is not, under the factual circumstances, thus unusual. After all, she had already been suffering in silence, not to mention fear.</p><p> Accused-appellant’s answer, however, on whether he raped Marivic – that he does not know as he was then drunk – is a virtual <em>mea culpa</em>. </p><p> As for accused-appellant’s argument that it was hard for him to rape Marivic because he was then drunk: His state of intoxication on May 15, 1999, following his attendance of a fiesta which started at 11:30 a. m. and lasted until 1:00 p. m., by itself does not preclude him from raping Marivic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">38</sup> For by Marivic’s account, she was raped around 7:00 p. m. of May 15, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">39</sup> 6 hours after accused-appellant winded up his drinking, long enough for him to sober up.</p><p> At all events, by accused-appellant’s claim, he was drunk not on the day of the rape incident on May 15, 1999 but in February 1999 when he admitted “abusing” Marivic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">40</sup></p><p> Article 266-B, paragraph 6 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended provides:</p><blockquote><p> The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:</p><p> 1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age <strong>and</strong>&nbsp; the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim.</p><p align="center"> x x x</p></blockquote><p> Under this provision, the <strong>concurrence</strong> of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender is a special qualifying circumstance which must be alleged and proved with certainty, otherwise the death penalty cannot be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">41</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> That Marivic was a daughter of accused-appellant was alleged in the information. Accused-appellant admitted during pre-trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">42</sup> and at the witness stand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">43</sup> that indeed Marivic is his daughter. This does not, suffice, however, to show that accused-appellant is the father of Marivic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">44</sup></p><p> In any event, since the minority of Marivic was not sufficiently proven, there would be no special qualifying circumstance to bring the penalty to death. For even if Marivic’s testimony that she was 16 when she was raped on May 15, 1999, she having, by her claim, been born on March 4, 1983,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">45</sup> was corroborated by her mother and accused-appellant himself, the same falls short of the quantum of proof of minority.</p><blockquote><p> [T]he testimony of the victim as to her age, even if corroborated by that of her father, is not sufficient proof of her minority. In this case at bar, the concurrent testimonies of the victim and the accused-appellant as to the victim’s age fall short of the required proof of the qualifying circumstance.</p><p> Neither can a stipulation of the parties with respect to the victim’s age be considered sufficient proof of minority. Circumstances that qualify a crime and increases its penalty to death cannot be the subject of stipulation. An accused cannot be condemned to suffer the extreme penalty of death on the basis of stipulations or his own admissions. This strict rule is warranted by the seriousness of the penalty of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">46</sup></p></blockquote><p> Parenthetically, while a photocopy of what was represented to be the Certificate of Live Birth of Marivic was marked during pre-trial as Exhibit “F”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">47</sup> and was referred to during trial particularly when she and her mother were called to testify, the same shows that the name of the father is<strong> Rogelio</strong>&nbsp; R. Cruz and that Marivic’s date of birth is March 2, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">48</sup> Additionally, the certificate shows that Marivic’s parents, accused-appellant and Juliet Ore, contracted marriage on May 10, 1982 in San Mateo, Rizal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">49</sup> which is contrary to Juliet’s claim that she and accused-appellant are just “live-in” partners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">50</sup> These discrepancies probably account why the document was withdrawn by the prosecution during the formal offer of exhibits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">51</sup>&nbsp; </p><p>Accused-appellant can thus only be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. As such, in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity due Marivic should be reduced to P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">52</sup> She is, however, also entitled to an award of P25,000.00 exemplary damages due to her relationship<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">53</sup> with accused-appellant. </p><p> WHEREFORE, the decision dated March 28, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court Brach 76, of San Mateo, Rizal, in Criminal Case No. 4163 is <strong>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</strong>. As modified, accused-appellant<strong> AURELIO CRUZ y RAMOS</strong> is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Simple Rape and is sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to pay private complainant Marivic Cruz civil indemnity of P50,000.00, moral damages of P50,000.00, and exemplary damages of P25,000.00. </p><p>Costs against accused-appellant. </p><p> SO ORDERED.</p><p> <i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Callejo, Sr</i>., and <i>Azcuna, JJ</i>., concur. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>Penned by Judge Jose C.
