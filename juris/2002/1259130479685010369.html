				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Before us&nbsp; for automatic review is the joint decision, dated 14 April 1999, of the Regional Trial Court of Calabanga, Camarines Sur, Branch 63 in Criminal Cases No. RTC ‘97-168 and RTC ‘97-169, finding accused-appellant Marcelo Esuela guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape committed against his stepdaughter Maricel A. Hilboy and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death for each count.<br><br>These criminal cases&nbsp; stemmed from two separate informations filed against accused-appellant Marcelo Esuela for the acts of rape committed sometime in 1995 and 1996 when Maricel A. Hilboy was 13 years old.&nbsp; The informations for both cases are as follows:<br><blockquote><u>Crim.

Hilboy, then 14 years old, declared that she was born on January 5, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Accused-appellant Marcelo Esuela was her stepfather<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> being the common-law husband of her mother, Concepcion Abadesa.<br><br>Maricel recalled that on December 14, 1996 at around 12:00 o’clock midnight, she was sleeping inside their house&nbsp; when she was awakened and found out that she was already naked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Accused-appellant Esuela was already on top of her, inserting his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; She felt pain but she could not shout because Esuela’s hand was covering her mouth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Before dismounting, accused-appellant warned her not to tell her mother about what happened; otherwise, he would inflict physical injuries upon her.&nbsp; Thereafter, accused-appellant Esuela left her, and she just kept on crying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She also testified that her stepbrothers and stepsisters were sleeping near her but they were not awakened while the rape was taking place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Her mother was sleeping on the other part of the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She did not report the incident to her mother because of accused-appellant’s warning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Maricel also testified that the incident in 1996 was the second time that she was raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; The first incident happened in 1995.&nbsp; She could not remember all the details of the first rape incident that transpired in 1995 but she could remember that accused-appellant kept on kissing her and that he inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> She reported the incident to her mother but she&nbsp; could not remember what the response of her mother was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Eventually, she told her teacher, Gemma Olarve, of what transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Dr. Goito Froyalde, the Municipal Health Officer of Tinambac, Camarines Sur, testified that he conducted an internal and physical examination on Maricel A. Hilboy on December 17, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> His examination revealed lacerations in Maricel’s vagina at 12:00 o’clock and 6:00 o’clock positions, which could be caused by penetration of a&nbsp; penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He concluded that the patient was no longer a virgin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Gemalil Buenaobra, a Social Worker from DSWD Center for Girls in Pangpang, Sorsogon, Sorsogon, testified that Maricel was her client at DSWD.&nbsp; Maricel's problem was the alleged rape incident, as well as the maltreatment that she suffered from the hands of her stepfather.&nbsp; Maricel told her that the perpetrator of the crime was accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the course of the individual counseling sessions with Maricel, she also found out that it was very difficult for the latter to relate her feelings.&nbsp; She asked Maricel to write a letter and draw in order to elicit some information from the latter and she discovered that Maricel was frustrated because of her family and her hatred for her stepfather.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The rape incident was a traumatic experience for Maricel and it affected her behavior, making it difficult for her to get along with others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Concepcion Abadesa, mother of Maricel, testified that her daughter was born on January 5, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Maricel's father was Vicente Hilboy but they separated.&nbsp; She and accused-appellant lived together in 1986 and they had four (4) children, three of whom are alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It was Maricel's teacher, Gemma Olarve, who told her that Maricel was abused by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> She confronted her daughter and the latter admitted that she was raped by accused-appellant.&nbsp; She quarreled with accused-appellant, after which she went to report the incident to their barangay captain, Socorro Cabral. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the presence of Cabral, accused-appellant at first denied but eventually admitted that he raped Maricel.&nbsp; Accused-appellant promised that the incident would not be repeated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Concepcion further testified that she consulted her mother about the matter and at first, they thought of having the incident recorded in the police blotter.&nbsp; However, they changed their minds because nobody would take care of&nbsp; the three (3) children since she was jobless and accused-appellant was the only breadwinner of the family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For the defense, Natividad Esuela, mother of accused-appellant, testified that her son and Concepcion lived together as husband and wife but separated in 1994 because they quarreled.&nbsp; Accused-appellant started living with her in their house at Zone 6, Tamban, Tinambac, Camarines Sur which was quite far from the house of Concepcion. .Her son was working as a porter and he would usually go out early in the morning and return home at three o'clock in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Marcelo Esuela denied the accusations against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He testified that at midnight of December 14, 1996, he was sleeping in the house of his parents at Zone 6, Tamban, Tinambac, Camarines Sur.&nbsp; With him were his mother, two (2) small sisters and brother Cris.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He further testified that he and Concepcion were live-in partners but they parted ways in 1994 because of misunderstanding about money and the meddling of&nbsp; his&nbsp; in-laws in their lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He declared that Maricel was not living with them during his cohabitation with Concepcion but with his in-laws whose house was about 200 meters from their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 14 April 1999, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the prosecution having proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in both cases, accused Marcelo Esuela, is found guilty of the offense of rape.&nbsp; Applying the above-quoted law, the rape cases having been committed in the year 1995 and December 14, 1996, accused Marcelo Esuela is hereby sentenced to suffer the following penalties: <ol> <li>In Crim. Case No. RTC '97-168, he is hereby sentenced the penalty of&nbsp; death and to indemnify the private complainant Maricel Hilboy the amount of P75,000.00;<br><br></li><li>In Crim. Case No. RTC '97-169, he is hereby sentenced the penalty of death and to indemnify the private complainant Maricel Hilboy the amount of P75,000.00.&nbsp; The indemnification of P50,000.00 has been increased by the Supreme Court in People vs. Victor, G.R. No. 127903; July 9, 1998 to P75,000.00;<br><br></li><li>He is further ordered to pay the cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The decision is now before this court for its automatic review.<br><br>Accused-appellant raised this lone assignment of error before the Court:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY UPON ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO ALLEGE IN THE TWO (2) INFORMATIONS THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS THE COMMON-LAW SPOUSE OF THE VICTIM'S MOTHER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>Clearly, accused-appellant does not question the decision of the trial court insofar as his guilt is concerned.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this Court still painstakingly reviewed the records of the cases to determine whether the guilt of accused-appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Unfortunately for accused-appellant, the Court could not find any reason to reverse his conviction.<br><br>It is apparent that the trial court arrived at its finding after a careful assessment of the evidence presented, foremost of which was the testimony of the victim in open court.&nbsp; As a rule, we do not disturb the findings by the trial court on the credibility of witnesses since the trial court is in a better position to pass upon the credibility of witnesses. The trial judge was able to personally evaluate the witness's manner of testifying, and from there reach a studied opinion as to her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Maricel categorically testified:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="90%">x x x</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">You said that something happened to you.&nbsp; Now, I call your attention whether you recall where were you?
