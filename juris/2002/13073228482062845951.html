The appellant, however, persisted on his plea of guilty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> thus, a new Certificate of Arraignment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated January 11, 2000, was issued. On the same day, the evidence for the prosecution was received. </p><p> The prosecution evidence shows that the private complainant, Dory Ebio, is the daughter of spouses Cristina Daquio and appellant Gerry Ebio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The private complainant is the third in a brood of six (6) children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She was born on March 24, 1989, as shown in her Certificate of Live Birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> The Ebios are residents of Tughan, Juban, Sorsogon. Their house has one bedroom where Cristina and Gerry sleep, together with private complainant’s youngest sister. The private complainant, her other sisters and their grandmother sleep in the<em> sala</em>. </p><p> The private complainant testified that in the evening of April 21, 2000, she was preparing to sleep in the <em>sala</em>. Her three (3) younger sisters and their grandmother were also in the<em> sala</em>, sleeping. Her elder sister, Donna, their aunt and their cousin, went to church earlier that night, while her mother, Cristina, was in Manila together with her sister, Dina. The appellant was not yet home at that time. </p><p> The appellant arrived in their house at about 10:00 p.m. He proceeded to the room and fixed the bed. Thereafter, he approached the private complainant and told her to transfer to the bedroom because they were already crowded in the<em> sala</em>. She obeyed him because she was afraid he would scold her. The appellant was drunk. </p><p> Armed with a six-inch long bladed instrument, the appellant ordered her to undress and threatened to kill her if she would not comply. Afraid of the threat, she took off her shorts and panty. Appellant also took off his shorts, mounted her and had carnal knowledge of her. She felt pain and cried. The private complainant was silent during the sexual assault because he threatened to kill her if she would talk or shout. After the assault, she put on her shorts and panty and again lay down. She remained inside the room, crying.</p><p>The following day, April 22, the private complainant reported the incident to her grandmother. Her grandmother accompanied her to the police authorities. She executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and a written complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> both dated April 27, 2000, charging the appellant with rape.</p><p> The private complainant revealed that the April 21, 2000 incident was the third occasion that she was raped by the appellant. The first two (2) defilements happened when she was ten (10) years old. She was then a Grade II elementary pupil. She related the incidents to her mother who told her that they would file a complaint against the appellant. However, they were not able to report the matter to the police.</p><p> The private complainant was brought to Dr. Erlinda B. Olondriz-Orense, Municipal Health Officer of Sorsogon, for medical examination. The lady doctor’s findings are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br></p><blockquote><p> “To Whom It May Concern:&nbsp; </p><p> This is to certify that I have examined Dory Ebio, 11 years old, resident of Tughan, Juban, Sorsogon.&nbsp; </p><p> Findings:&nbsp; </p><p> -<em> labia majora </em>and<em> minora</em> in close contact&nbsp; </p><p>- Internal exam. - vaginal wall admits one finger with resistance&nbsp; </p><p>- With healed hymenal lacerations at 4 o’clock and 6 o’clock (positions)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="45%">&nbsp;</td><td width="55%"><div align="center">ERLINDA B.

She testified that in the evening of April 21, 2000, after going to church, she returned to the house of the Ebios to sleep. She was about to sleep when she heard someone crying inside the room of her <em>Tiyo</em> Gerry, the appellant, and <em>Tiya</em> Cristy. Curious, she slowly entered the room. She saw the appellant on top of the private complainant. Both were naked and the appellant was raping the private complainant. Afraid that the appellant might kill her, she retreated and went back to sleep. She did not relate the incident to anyone out of fear.&nbsp; </p><p> <strong>Cristina Ebio</strong> testified that she is legally married to the appellant. The victim is their daughter. Dory was born on March 24, 1989. On April 27, 2000, she (Cristina) was in Manila for a medical check-up. She received a phone call from a relative, informing her that the appellant had raped their daughter. She cried and immediately headed back to Sorsogon. </p><p> Upon reaching their town, she proceeded to the municipal building where she found the private complainant. They both cried when they met. The private complainant told her about the April 21, 2000 rape incident.</p><p> Cristina claimed that she confronted the appellant about the rape committed on April 21, 2000. He admitted the dastardly act and explained that he was drunk at the time.</p><p> After the prosecution had rested its case, the defense opted not to present any evidence. Hence, the case was deemed submitted for decision.</p><p> On February 19, 2001, the trial court rendered its judgment, finding the appellant guilty of qualified rape. The appellant was sentenced to suffer the penalty of death and ordered to pay the private complainant the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages. The dispositive portion of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “In view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused Gerry Ebio y Hermida <strong>GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of RAPE </strong>under R.A. 7610 as amended by R.A. 7659 and further amended by R.A. 8353, otherwise known as the ANTI-RAPE LAW of 1997, and accordingly sentences him with the penalty of <strong>DEATH under Art. 266-8 of R.A. 8353</strong>; and to pay the victim civil indemnity of P75,000,00 and moral damages of P50,000,00.&nbsp; </p><p> Considering however the open repentance of the accused in Court in accepting the crime he has done, this Court is recommending to Her Excellency, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, thru the Department of Justice, an EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY as the penalty imposed to (sic) the accused is to the Court excessive if we are to administer justice in a manner that is fair and just but compassionate and merciful as well.</p><p> SO ORDERED.&nbsp; </p><p> Given this 19th day of February 2001 at Sorsogon, Sorsogon, Philippines.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="46%">&nbsp;</td><td width="54%"><div align="center">(SGD.) JOSE L. MADRID </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center">Judge”</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><p align="justify">Hence, the automatic review of the case.&nbsp; </p><p> The Appellant’s Brief assigns a single error:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> “THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED ON (<em>sic</em>) CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE HIS IMPROVIDENT PLEA OF GUILTY.”</p></blockquote><p> We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p><p> Appellant contends that his plea of guilty was improvident because the trial court did not strictly observe Section 3, Rule 116 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The rule provides that when an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the courts should perform the following tasks: (1) it shall conduct a <strong>searching inquiry into</strong> the <strong>voluntariness</strong>&nbsp; and<strong> full comprehension</strong> of the consequences of his plea, and (2) it shall require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability. Thereafter, the trial court will allow the accused to present evidence, if he so desires. </p><p> It is alleged that the appellant did not fully understand the consequences of his plea because when the appellant was re-arraigned on January 11, 2001, the trial court told the appellant that he would be sentenced to “<em><strong>reclusion perpetua</strong></em><strong> to death</strong>” if he pled guilty. Allegedly, the penalty could not have been understood by the appellant. </p><p> Appellant is clutching on straws. He was convicted on the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution and not on his guilty plea.

No contrary evidence was submitted by the appellant.
