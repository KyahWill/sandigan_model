				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Accused-appellant Rolly Verino was convicted by the trial court of murder for the killing of Reynal S. Bravo and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; He was also ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P8,500.00 for actual damages, P50,000.00 as death indemnity and another P50,000.00 for moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> He now appeals from his conviction as he contends that the lower court erred in convicting him on the basis of circumstantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Rolly Verino, together with Carlito Bulan and one&nbsp; "Alias"&nbsp; Ibabao who are still at large, was charged before the court <i>a quo</i> with murder for having conspired and confederated in killing one Reynal S. Bravo with use of firearms, with intent to kill, treachery, evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The version of the prosecution is that on 18 March 1997, at around 9:00 o'clock p.m., the victim Reynal Bravo, together with his two (2) children and two (2) other men, namely, Medes Madredejo and David Afable, was at the house of Danilo Sause, a neighbor, watching television.&nbsp; Sause's house was still undergoing construction, so a portion had neither door nor walls.&nbsp; A little later, Danilo Sause left the house of Juan Bravo, a neighbor and an uncle of Reynal Bravo, to discuss some problems about land.<br><br>While at Juan Bravo's house, they heard a gunshot coming from the direction of his (Danilo) house.&nbsp; Danilo ran towards his house.&nbsp; On his way, he heard two (2) more gunshots.&nbsp; When he reached his house, he saw Reynal Bravo lying prostrate on the ground with blood oozing from his neck.&nbsp; He also saw two (2) men, with their backs toward him, running away from the scene.&nbsp; Before Danilo could enter his house, he saw accused-appellant Rolly Verino standing beneath a 100-watt bulb at the back of his house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Verino was wearing a gray jacket with standing collar and a hat.&nbsp; He had a gun which he kept holding when he ran away towards the river.<br><br>The victim's wife, Virginia Bravo, also heard the gunshots while she was doing household chores in their&nbsp; house.&nbsp; She went out of her house and met two (2) of her children&nbsp; who&nbsp; told&nbsp; her&nbsp; that their father had been shot, so she immediately ran towards Danilo's house.&nbsp; There she saw her husband with blood coming out of his neck although he was still alive.&nbsp; With the help of her neighbors, she brought her husband to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way, the victim told her that he was shot by Rolly Verino, Carlito Bulan and Jerry Ibabao.&nbsp; They were the same men, according to Virginia, who a few days earlier, had threatened her husband not to testify against them in another murder case.&nbsp; The first hospital they went to was unable to treat the victim for lack of medical facilities so they brought him to the provincial hospital.&nbsp; On the way there, however, Reynal Bravo died.&nbsp;&nbsp; Post mortem examination on the victim revealed that he had succumbed to his three (3) gunshot wounds in the head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The defense proferred the testimonies of Charlene Bulan, Jaypee de Guzman, Martin Ibabao and of accused-appellant Rolly Verino himself.&nbsp; Charlene Bulan is the daughter of the accused Carlito Bulan, while Jaypee de Guzman and Martin Ibabao were his neighbors.<br><br>Charlene Bulan testified that on 18 March 1997, at 9:00 o'clock p.m., she and her three (3) siblings were in the house of Danilo Sause watching television.&nbsp; Later, Danilo left for Juan Bravo's house.&nbsp; As she and her siblings were watching a show in the house of Danilo, she heard a peculiar sound from the back.&nbsp; She turned her head and saw three (3) men approaching Reynal Bravo who then fired their guns at him.&nbsp; She could not recognize&nbsp; the men since they were wearing masks.&nbsp; She asserted however that accused-appellant Rolly Verino could not be one of the three (3) men nor could her father be also one of them since the three (3) assailants were small and thin while accused-appellant and her father were not.<br><br>Defense witnesses Jaypee de Guzman and Martin Ibabao testified that on 18 March 1997, at 9:00 o'clock in the evening, they were at the pastoral house of the Iglesia ni Kristo watching television.&nbsp; With them were the accused Jerry Ibabao and Carlito Bulan, and five (5) other people.&nbsp; According to De Guzman, while watching television he heard three (3) successive gunshots.&nbsp; A minute later, accused-appellant Rolly Verino arrived and asked about the gunshots.&nbsp; But De Guzman replied, "Ewan," and continued watching television.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolly Verino then left to water the plants in the yard of the INK chapel.<br><br>According to Martin Ibabao, he also heard gun reports but he was not sure how many there were.&nbsp; A minute after hearing the gunshots, accused-appellant Verino arrived from his house and Martin Ibabao told him about the gunshots he heard, but Verino merely ignored what he said, and went to water the plants in the yard.&nbsp; Later, the police came and talked to Rolly Verino as he was watering the plants.&nbsp; The police left without arresting anyone.<br><br>On the part of accused-appellant Rolly Verino, he testified that on the same date and at about the same time, he was in his house watching television when he heard gunfire. So he went out and proceeded to the house of the minister beside the Iglesia ni Kristo Chapel and asked the people there if they heard any&nbsp; gunfire.&nbsp; They told him they did, but they just continued watching television.&nbsp; Since they were not paying him any attention, accused-appellant proceeded to water the plants in front of the chapel.&nbsp; An hour later, the policemen arrived.&nbsp; Gaudencio Ibabao who was also in the house of the minister, went out and talked to the policemen who inquired about the whereabouts of Carlito Bulan.&nbsp; But the police made no arrests, not until eight (8) days later, or on 26 March 1997 when accused-appellant Rolly Verino was finally arrested by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The trial court found accused-appellant Rolly Verino guilty of murder and sentenced him accordingly.&nbsp; In this appeal, accused-appellant alleges that the trial court erred in appreciating the following circumstantial evidence which became the basis for his conviction:&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Rolly Verino was seen by Danilo Sause holding a gun at the back of his house after he heard three (3) shots and saw Reynal Bravo lying supine and bloody. Then Verino went down the stream rushing towards the forest.&nbsp; Danilo saw two (2) others also running away; (b) Reynal Bravo was a witness to the murder of Vitaliano Maso who was said to have been killed by the same three (3) accused; (c) On the way to the Bagac Medicare Hospital, the victim told his wife that he was shot by Carlito Bulan, Rolly Verino and Jerry Ibabao.&nbsp; This could be considered an ante-mortem statement because of the gravity of the wound suffered by the victim who was dead on arrival at the Bataan Provincial Hospital.&nbsp; At the very least, it is part of the <i>res gestae</i>; (d) Before he was shot, Reynal Bravo told his wife that he had been receiving threats from Carlito Bulan, Rolly Verino and Jerry Ibabao; and, (e) Carlito Bulan and Jerry Ibabao disappeared without any explanation after they learned that they were suspected as the other two (2) of the three (3) men who shot Reynal Bravo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant insists that Danilo Sause is a perjured witness since his testimony is replete with inconsistencies and contradictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He argues that Danilo's declarations in the direct examination contradict his statements given on cross- examination.&nbsp; Thus, on direct examination Danilo claimed having seen the accused Verino only after he saw Reynal Bravo lying supine and bloody.&nbsp; That was after he already heard the first shot while he was still in the house of his <i>kumpadre</i> about fifty (50) meters away to his house, and likewise, after hearing the other two (2) successive shots while on his way home.&nbsp;&nbsp; This declaration contradicts his statement on cross-examination that upon reaching his house he saw two (2) persons running with their backs turned toward him.&nbsp; In his written statement, it is very different. According to Danilo, he saw Verino holding a gun and fired three (3) successive shots after which he saw Reynal Bravo lying prostrate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.&nbsp; The prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the culpability of accused-appellant who failed to destroy the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>To warrant a conviction, direct evidence is not always required.&nbsp; Conviction can be had on the basis of circumstantial evidence if the established circumstances constitute an unbroken chain leading to a fair and reasonable conclusion proving&nbsp; that the appellant is the author of the crime to the exclusion of all others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Section 4, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if the following requisites are complied with:&nbsp; (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proved; and, (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The circumstances relied upon by the trial court to convict accused-appellant clearly satisfied the foregoing requirements.<br><br>The records of the case, particularly the transcripts of stenographic notes of the examination of the prosecution witness Danilo Sause, reveal no such inconsistency alleged by accused-appellant.&nbsp; The testimony of Danilo establishes with moral certainty the presence of accused-appellant at the scene of the crime.&nbsp; On direct examination, he testified:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Prosecutor Mendoza:&nbsp;

Sause's categorical statement at his direct examination that he saw Rolly Verino at the back of his house holding a gun was not contradicted by his statement during cross-examination that he saw two (2) men whom he did not recognize run away from his house.&nbsp; In fact, his testimony is consistent with the theory that three (3) armed men shot and killed Reynal S. Bravo.<br><br>The question of inconsistency arose from the sworn statement executed by Danilo Sause before the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Inconsistencies between the testimony and the sworn statement were explained to be due to the fact that affidavits are generally not prepared by the affiants themselves but by others and affiants are only made to sign them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Certain discrepancies between declarations made in an affidavit and those made at the witness stand seldom discredit the declarant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Sworn statements, taken ex parte, are almost always incomplete and often inaccurate for various reasons, sometimes from partial suggestion or for want of suggestion and inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They are generally inferior to the testimony of the witness given in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In other words, whenever there is inconsistency between an affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also alleges that in Danilo Sause's testimony, there is a five (5)- minute lapse from the first gunshot which he heard, until he ran to his house.&nbsp; The five (5)-minute lapse is alleged to be such a considerable amount of time that he could not have possibly found anyone of the culprits upon reaching his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It seems, however, that such allegation is only a misinterpretation or misreading of the testimony of witness Danilo Sause.&nbsp; Nowhere in the transcripts of stenographic notes is it stated that Danilo waited for five (5) minutes after hearing the first gunshot before he ran to his house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, what the records show is that Danilo stayed at Juan Bravo's house for around five (5) minutes before he heard the first gunshot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The other pieces of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the trial court have also been duly proved, and were not controverted by the defense.&nbsp; The testimony of Virginia Bravo established that her husband executed a statement in connection with the murder case of one Vitaliano Maso where he was a witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the ante-mortem statement of her husband&nbsp; naming&nbsp; the three (3) accused as the ones who shot him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and the statement that a week before the incident, her husband had confided to her that he had received threats against his life from the same three (3) accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> That Carlito Bulan and Jerry Ibabao disappeared without any explanation is a fact, since they have eluded arrest and the case against them has been archived.<br><br>Circumstantial evidence is considered sufficient when the facts from which the inferences are derived are themselves duly proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the case at bar, the prosecution has established accused-appellant's culpability through the aforementioned circumstances.&nbsp; Those circumstances taken together lead to no other conclusion than that he is guilty.<br><br>On the other hand, accused-appellant's defense is basically alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Alibi is a weak defense and cannot overturn the positive identification by the prosecution witness of the assailant.&nbsp; For alibi to prosper, it must be shown that the accused was at another place for such a period of time that it was impossible for him to have been at the place where the crime was committed at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the case at bar, it has been determined from the testimonies of the defense witnesses Jaypee de Guzman and Martin Ibabao that the distance from accused-appellant's house to the scene of the crime is more or less one hundred (100) meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Accused-appellant’s alibi does not satisfactorily show that it was physically impossible for him to have participated in the shooting.<br><br>However, we disagree with the trial court that treachery attended the commission of the crime.&nbsp; The trial court based this finding on the testimony of defense witness Charlene Bulan.&nbsp; While finding that her testimony was negative and self-serving, at the same time the trial court stated that the same testimony "established the cold- blooded manner in which Reynal Bravo was slain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The rule in criminal cases is that the burden is on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements of the offense with which the accused is charged.&nbsp; It must do so on the strength of its own evidence and not merely rely on the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to present any proof as to the manner the attack commenced or how the act which resulted in the victim's death unfolded.&nbsp; The evidence presented by the prosecution only proved the events after the attack had happened.&nbsp; Hence, treachery cannot be appreciated.&nbsp; Nor was evidence presented to establish the alleged circumstances of evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength.&nbsp; In the absence of specific evidence proving these qualifying circumstances, the crime committed is simple homicide, not murder.<br><br>Under Art. 249 of <i>The Revised Penal Code, homicide is punished by reclusion temporal</i>. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum penalty to be imposed is <i>prision mayor</i>, in any of its periods, being the penalty next lower in degree.&nbsp; There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the imposable penalty ranges from six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, medium, as maximum.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is MODIFIED.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Rolly Verino is found guilty instead of homicide and is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of eight (8) years two (2) months and ten (10) days of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years eight (8) months and twenty (20) days of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, as maximum, and ordered to pay the heirs of Reynal S. Bravo P8,500.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as death indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages. No costs.<br><br>Meanwhile, let an alias warrant issue against the accused Carlito Bulan and Jerry Ibabao a.k.a. "Alias" Ibabao for their immediate arrest so that this case against them may finally be terminated.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Mendoza, Quisumbing, Buena</i>, and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Decision penned by Judge Lorenzo R.
