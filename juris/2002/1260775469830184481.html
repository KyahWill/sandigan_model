MARCELITO ABAS, a physician at the Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital, testified that he medically examined the victim who, he said, was ten years old, on February 3, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He found “superficial hymenal laceration in her genitalia at 7:00 and 10:00 o’clock; small opening of the vaginal orifice measuring about 0.5 cm., diameter more or less; negative for any physical injuries.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In his opinion, there was penetration of the victim’s vagina by a penis, and the laceration of the hymen was due to sexual intercourse or defloration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>BELEN SENES, nicknamed Ate Belen, testified that she was the president of Purok 6, Barangay Mantigbi, Calangcawan Sur, Vinzons, Camarines Norte.&nbsp; She knew both the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>and appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She recounted that on January 31, 1997, sometime between 9:00 and 11:00 A.M., Jovelyn Listana told her that she had been raped by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Belen reported the matter to Barangay Captain Dominico<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Mago, Jr., who advised her to go to the DSWD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Since it was a Friday afternoon, Belen took custody of Jovelyn who had asked Belen not to bring her back to appellant because it was he who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Belen narrated that appellant later on went to her house looking for Jovelyn.&nbsp; He said he wanted to talk to her and added that Jovelyn would lie on many things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Appellant talked to Jovelyn, who refused to go with him because she was afraid of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> At first, he forced her to come with him but Jovelyn cried and held on to the fence, then reached for Belen, and begged not to be given to appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> According to Belen, appellant left after she refused to give Jovelyn to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The next morning, Belen recalled seeing appellant in a tricycle with a pig and, suspecting he would escape, she hurriedly went to the PNP.&nbsp; However, she was instead asked to bring Jovelyn to the PNP office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The police interrogated Jovelyn, then went to Daet to look for appellant; they found him selling a pig and then brought him to Vinzons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Belen said she turned over Jovelyn to the PNP and later, to the DSWD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> According to her, Jovelyn was then nine (9) years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The defense presented as witnesses: (1) Tito Ochoa, appellant’s landlord; (2) Gerwin Cana, appellant’s son; (3) Gracita Vasquez, appellant’s sister; and (4) appellant himself.<br><br>TITO OCHOA testified that he knew Jovelyn, having seen her with her grandmother at appellant’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He observed that Jovelyn was fond of climbing coconut trees and that every time she did, appellant would beat her up with a twig.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> So, she fled the house and at times would not return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Twelve-year old GERWIN CANA stated that he knew Jovelyn, who lived in their house for a year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He narrated that appellant often scolded and whipped Jovelyn for her various mistakes such as stealing appellant’s money<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and climbing coconut trees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Twice, he saw her embrace a dog, play with its organ, and insert it in her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He confirmed that Jovelyn would fight back whenever appellant beat her up.<br><br>On cross-examination, Gerwin testified that he told appellant about Jovelyn’s habit of toying with the dog’s penis.&nbsp; Appellant whipped Jovelyn and warned her not to repeat it, and killed the dog.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>GRACITA VAZQUEZ testified that she knew Jovelyn as her sister-in-law’s daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> During a family reunion at appellant’s house on November 2, 1994, she noticed Jovelyn fondling the dog’s penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> She told appellant about this, but he answered that Jovelyn got mad at him whenever he scolded her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Appellant ESMERALDO CANA testified that on the night of January 27, 1997, just before the alleged offense, he was at the seashore catching shrimps and that he went home at midnight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> He saw Jovelyn sleeping at home with legs apart, and wearing a torn panty that revealed her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He touched her vagina twice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This awakened the complainant who, he claimed, was eleven years old.&nbsp; She then ran to the sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> His two sons were also awakened and he did not pursue her anymore but went to sleep instead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>During cross-examination, he denied inserting his penis inside the complainant’s genitalia.&nbsp; He said that he only wanted to tease complainant by touching her vagina,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> but admitted that doing so got him aroused to the extent that he inserted his middle finger in it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> He admitted that during his arrest, he did not tell the police or execute an affidavit stating that he merely touched her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>On December 28, 1998, the trial court handed down its decision as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused Esmeraldo Cana GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of DEATH.<br><br>Further, he is ordered to indemnify the offended party the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal assigning the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED FOR THE CRIME CHARGED WAS PROVEN BY THE PROSECUTION BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>GRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE TO QUALIFY THE CRIME OF SIMPLE RAPE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote>In essence, the pertinent issues raised by appellant concern (1) the propriety of leading questions addressed to the complainant; (2) the sufficiency of the prosecution’s evidence to prove appellant’s guilt for the crime of rape; and (3) the correctness of the penalty imposed on him.<br><br>First, on the procedural issue.&nbsp; Appellant imputes partiality to the trial court for allowing the prosecution to ask Jovelyn leading questions on direct examination.&nbsp; He claims that were it not for these improper questions, the prosecution could not have established the crime charged.<br><br>As a general rule, leading questions are not allowed.&nbsp; However, we have held that when the witness is a child of tender years, it is proper for the court to allow leading questions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> as it is usually difficult for a child of such age to state facts without prompting or suggestion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Leading questions are necessary to coax the truth out of their reluctant lips.&nbsp; Here, the decision of the trial court to allow leading questions to Jovelyn was justified, as she was evidently young and unlettered, making the recall of events difficult, if not uncertain.&nbsp; Her cross-examination is quite instructive on this matter, to wit:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

(1) (d)].<br><br>According to appellant, the trial court failed to appreciate the testimony of his son, Gerwin Cana.&nbsp; But his testimony took a bizarre turn by suggesting that Jovelyn’s defloration was caused by the insertion of a dog’s penis into her vagina and by climbing coconut trees.&nbsp; This suggestion, however, was contradicted by Dr. Abas, who testified that Jovelyn’s defloration could have only been caused by the insertion of a person’s penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s main defense of alibi and denial, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, that he was then at the seashore catching shrimps<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> in the evening just before the alleged rape, is equally unavailing.&nbsp; For alibi to prosper, the requirements of time and place must be strictly met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It is not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere else when the offense was committed.&nbsp; It must likewise be shown that he was so far away that it was impossible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> No such showing was made here by appellant.<br><br>In another bizarre twist, appellant insisted he merely “touched her private parts with the use of the middle finger”.&nbsp; This admission was touted as a badge of truthfulness. Juxtaposed against the testimony of the 10-year-old victim that he ravished her on several occasions, his claim to honesty is woefully pathetic.&nbsp; His lewd design on her surfaced clearly during cross-examination.&nbsp; According to his testimony, when he saw the complainant with legs apart, wearing a torn panty that revealed her vagina,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> he caressed complainant’s vagina not once but twice.&nbsp; He got excited as he did, so he inserted his middle finger inside her private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The presence of appellant’s son in the crime scene, even if true, would not negate the possibility of rape.&nbsp; It would not logically follow that because he could have heard or seen the assault, rape could not take place.&nbsp; As previously held, rape happens even in the same room where other family members also slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> There is no rule providing that rape can only be committed in seclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>To sum up, appellant’s protestation of innocence is hollow.&nbsp; The prosecution’s evidence of his guilt is simply overwhelming.<br><br>However, while the Court agrees with the finding concerning appellant’s guilt, we cannot sustain the death sentence imposed by the trial court.&nbsp; Appellant was convicted under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, which reads in part:<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol><li>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age <i>and</i> the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim. xxx</li></ol></blockquote>The trial court imposed the death penalty because the victim, Jovelyn Listana, was only ten (10) years old at the time of the commission of the offense <i>and the offender is her stepparent.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> But we must stress that if this was the case, both circumstances of the victim’s minority and her relationship with the accused should have been alleged in the information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> pursuant to the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> as qualifying circumstances.&nbsp; Here, the information failed to mention the step-relationship between appellant and the victim, i.e. that of stepfather and stepdaughter.&nbsp; Following <i>People vs. Balacano,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> failure to allege the relationship of step-parentage necessarily excludes the offense from the coverage of R.A.
