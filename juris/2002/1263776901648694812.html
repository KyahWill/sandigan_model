				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> <p>In an action based on quasi delict, the registered owner of a motor vehicle is solidarily liable for the injuries and damages caused by the negligence of the driver, in spite of the fact that the vehicle may have already been the subject of an unregistered Deed of Sale in favor of another person. Unless registered with the Land Transportation Office, the sale -- while valid and binding between the parties -- does not affect third parties, especially the victims of accidents involving the said transport equipment. Thus, in the present case, petitioner, which is the registered owner, is liable for the acts of the driver employed by its former lessee who has become the owner of that vehicle by virtue of an unregistered Deed of Sale. </p> <p><u>Statement of the Case </u></p> <p>Before us is a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the May 12, 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 55474. The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <strong>DISMISSED</strong> for lack of merit. The assailed decision, dated May 5, 1997, of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 14, in Civil Case No. 95-73522, is hereby <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with <strong>MODIFICATION</strong> that the award of attorney’s fees is <strong>DELETED</strong>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>On the other hand, in Civil Case No. 95-73522, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila (Branch 14) had earlier disposed in this wise:</p> <blockquote> <p>“WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant Equitable Leasing Corporation ordering said defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the following: </p> <p>A. <u>TO MYRNA TAMAYO </u></p> <p>1. the sum of P50,000.00 for the death of Reniel Tamayo; </p> <p>2. P50,000.00 as moral damages; and </p> <p>3. P56,000.00 for the damage to the store and its contents, and funeral expenses. </p> <p>B. <u>TO FELIX OLEDAN </u></p> <p>1. the sum of P50,000.00 for the death of Felmarie Oledan; </p> <p>2.

P7,000.00 as actual damages </p> <p>D. <u>TO LUCITA SUYOM </u></p> <p>1. The sum of P5,000.00 for the medical treatment of her two sons. </p> <p>The sum of P120,000.00 as and for attorney’s fees.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote> <p><u>The Facts </u></p> <p>On July 17, 1994, a Fuso Road Tractor driven by Raul Tutor rammed into the house cum store of Myrna Tamayo located at Pier 18, Vitas, Tondo, Manila. A portion of the house was destroyed. Pinned to death under the engine of the tractor were Respondent Myrna Tamayo’s son, Reniel Tamayo, and Respondent Felix Oledan’s daughter, Felmarie Oledan. Injured were Respondent Oledan himself, Respondent Marissa Enano, and two sons of Respondent Lucita Suyom. </p> <p>Tutor was charged with and later convicted of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and multiple physical injuries in Criminal Case No. 296094-SA, Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 12.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p> <p>Upon verification with the Land Transportation Office, respondents were furnished a copy of Official Receipt No. 62204139<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and Certificate of Registration No. 08262797,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> showing that the registered owner of the tractor was “Equitable Leasing Corporation/leased to Edwin Lim.” On April 15, 1995, respondents filed against Raul Tutor, Ecatine Corporation (“Ecatine”) and Equitable Leasing Corporation (“Equitable”) a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for damages docketed as Civil Case No. 95-73522 in the RTC of Manila, Branch 14. </p> <p>The trial court, upon motion of plaintiffs’ counsel, issued an Order dropping Raul Tutor, Ecatine and Edwin Lim from the Complaint, because they could not be located and served with summonses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On the other hand, in its Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> petitioner alleged that the vehicle had already been sold to Ecatine and that the former was no longer in possession and control thereof at the time of the incident. It also claimed that Tutor was an employee, not of Equitable, but of Ecatine. </p> <p>After trial on the merits, the RTC rendered its Decision ordering petitioner to pay actual and moral damages and attorney’s fees to respondents. It held that since the Deed of Sale between petitioner and Ecatine had not been registered with the Land Transportation Office (LTO), the legal owner was still Equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, petitioner was liable to respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p> <p><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals </u></p> <p>Sustaining the RTC, the CA held that petitioner was still to be legally deemed the owner/operator of the tractor, even if that vehicle had been the subject of a Deed of Sale in favor of Ecatine on December 9, 1992. The reason cited by the CA was that the Certificate of Registration on file with the LTO still remained in petitioner’s name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In order that a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle can bind third persons, it must be duly recorded in the LTO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p> <p>The CA likewise upheld respondents’ claim for moral damages against petitioner because the appellate court considered Tutor, the driver of the tractor, to be an agent of the registered owner/operator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p> <p>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p> <p><u>Issues </u></p> <p>In its Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues for the Court’s consideration:</p> <p align="center">I</p> <p align="center">“Whether or not the Court of Appeals and the trial court gravely erred when they decided and held that petitioner [was] liable for damages suffered by private respondents in an action based on quasi delict for the negligent acts of a driver who [was] not the employee of the petitioner. </p> <p align="center">II</p> <p align="center">“Whether or not the Court of Appeals and the trial court gravely erred when they awarded moral damages to private respondents despite their failure to prove that the injuries they suffered were brought by petitioner’s wrongful act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> <p><u>This Court’s Ruling </u></p> <p>The Petition has no merit. </p> <p><u>First Issue: </u></p> <p><em><u>Liability for Wrongful Acts </u></em></p> <p>Petitioner contends that it should not be held liable for the damages sustained by respondents and that arose from the negligence of the driver of the Fuso Road Tractor, which it had already sold to Ecatine at the time of the accident. Not having employed Raul Tutor, the driver of the vehicle, it could not have controlled or supervised him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> <p>We are not persuaded. In negligence cases, the aggrieved party may sue the negligent party under (1) Article 100<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, for civil liability<em> ex delicto</em>; or (2) under Article 2176<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Civil Code, for civil liability ex quasi delicto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p> <p>Furthermore, under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code, employers may be held <em>subsidiarily liable</em> for felonies committed by their employees in the discharge of the latter’s duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This liability attaches when the employees who are convicted of crimes committed in the performance of their work are found to be insolvent and are thus unable to satisfy the civil liability adjudged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p> <p>On the other hand, under Article 2176 in relation to Article 2180<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the Civil Code, an action predicated on quasi delict may be instituted against the employer for an employee’s act or omission. The liability for the negligent conduct of the subordinate is <em>direct </em>and <em>primary</em>, but is subject to the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The enforcement of the judgment against the employer for an action based on Article 2176 does not require the employee to be insolvent, since the liability of the former is solidary -- the latter being statutorily considered a joint tortfeasor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> To sustain a claim based on quasi delict, the following requisites must be proven: (a) damage suffered by the plaintiff, (b) fault or negligence of the defendant, and (c) connection of cause and effect between the fault or negligence of the defendant and the damage incurred by the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> <p>These two causes of action (<em>ex delicto or ex quasi delicto</em>) may be availed of, subject to the caveat<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that the offended party cannot “recover damages twice for the same act or omission” or under both causes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Since these two civil liabilities are distinct and independent of each other, the failure to recover in one will not necessarily preclude recovery in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p> <p>In the instant case, respondents -- having failed to recover anything in the criminal case -- elected to file a separate civil action for damages, based on quasi delict under Article 2176 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The evidence is clear that the deaths and the injuries suffered by respondents and their kins were due to the fault of the driver of the Fuso tractor. </p> <p>Dated June 4, 1991, the Lease Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> between petitioner and Edwin Lim stipulated that “it is the intention of the parties to enter into a FINANCE LEASE AGREEMENT.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Under such scheme, ownership of the subject tractor was to be registered in the name of petitioner, until the value of the vehicle has been fully paid by Edwin Lim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Further, in the “Lease Schedule,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the monthly rental for the tractor was stipulated, and the term of the Lease was scheduled to expire on December 4, 1992. After a few months, Lim completed the payments to cover the full price of the tractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, on December 9, 1992, a Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> over the tractor was executed by petitioner in favor of Ecatine represented by Edwin Lim. However, the Deed was not registered with the LTO. </p> <p>We hold petitioner liable for the deaths and the injuries complained of, because it was the registered owner of the tractor at the time of the accident on July 17, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The Court has consistently ruled that, regardless of sales made of a motor vehicle, the registered owner is the lawful operator insofar as the public and third persons are concerned; consequently, it is directly and primarily responsible for the consequences of its operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In contemplation of law, the owner/operator of record is the employer of the driver, the actual operator and employer being considered as merely its agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The same principle applies even if the registered owner of any vehicle does not use it for public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p> <p>Since Equitable remained the registered owner of the tractor, it could not escape primary liability for the deaths and the injuries arising from the negligence of the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> <p>The finance-lease agreement between Equitable on the one hand and Lim or Ecatine on the other has already been superseded by the sale. In any event, it does not bind third persons. The rationale for this rule has been aptly explained in Erezo v. Jepte,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which we quote hereunder:</p> <blockquote> <p>“x x x. The main aim of motor vehicle registration is to identify the owner so that if any accident happens, or that any damage or injury is caused by the vehicle on the public highways, responsibility therefor can be fixed on a definite individual, the registered owner. Instances are numerous where vehicles running on public highways caused accidents or injuries to pedestrians or other vehicles without positive identification of the owner or drivers, or with very scant means of identification. It is to forestall these circumstances, so inconvenient or prejudicial to the public, that the motor vehicle registration is primarily ordained, in the interest of the determination of persons responsible for damages or injuries caused on public highways.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>Further, petitioner’s insistence on <em>FGU Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals</em> is misplaced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> First, in <em>FGU </em>Insurance, the registered vehicle owner, which was engaged in a rent-a-car business, rented out the car. In this case, the registered owner of the truck, which is engaged in the business of financing motor vehicle acquisitions, has actually sold the truck to Ecatine, which in turn employed Tutor. Second, in <em>FGU </em>Insurance, the registered owner of the vehicle was not held responsible for the negligent acts of the person who rented one of its cars, because Article 2180 of the Civil Code was not applicable. We held that no <em>vinculum juris</em> as employer and employee existed between the owner and the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In this case, the registered owner of the tractor is considered under the law to be the employer of the driver, while the actual operator is deemed to be its agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Thus, Equitable, the registered owner of the tractor, is -- for purposes of the law on quasi delict -- the employer of Raul Tutor, the driver of the tractor. Ecatine, Tutor’s actual employer, is deemed as merely an agent of Equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p> <p>True, the LTO Certificate of Registration, dated “5/31/91,” qualifies the name of the registered owner as “EQUITABLE LEASING CORPORATION/Leased to Edwin Lim.” But the lease agreement between Equitable and Lim has been overtaken by the Deed of Sale on December 9, 1992, between petitioner and Ecatine. While this Deed does not affect respondents in this quasi delict suit, it definitely binds petitioner because, unlike them, it is a party to it. </p> <p>We must stress that the failure of Equitable and/or Ecatine to register the sale with the LTO should not prejudice respondents, who have the legal right to rely on the legal principle that the registered vehicle owner is liable for the damages caused by the negligence of the driver. Petitioner cannot hide behind its allegation that Tutor was the employee of Ecatine. This will effectively prevent respondents from recovering their losses on the basis of the inaction or fault of petitioner in failing to register the sale. The non-registration is the fault of petitioner, which should thus face the legal consequences thereof. </p> <p><u>Second Issue: </u></p> <p><em><u>Moral Damages </u></em></p> <p>Petitioner further claims that it is not liable for moral damages, because respondents failed to establish or show the causal connection or relation between the factual basis of their claim and their wrongful act or omission, if any. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p> <p>Moral damages are not punitive in nature, but are designed to compensate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and alleviate in some way the physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury unjustly caused a person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Although incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages must nevertheless be somehow proportional to and in approximation of the suffering inflicted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This is so because moral damages are in the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered, not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p> <p>Viewed as an action for quasi delict, the present case falls squarely within the purview of Article 2219 (2),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which provides for the payment of moral damages in cases of quasi delict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Having established the liability of petitioner as the registered owner of the vehicle,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respondents have satisfactorily shown the existence of the factual basis for the award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and its causal connection to the acts of Raul Tutor, who is deemed as petitioner’s employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Indeed, the damages and injuries suffered by respondents were the proximate result of petitioner’s tortious act or omission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> <p>Further, no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages may be awarded, the amount of indemnity being left to the discretion of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The evidence gives no ground for doubt that such discretion was properly and judiciously exercised by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The award is in fact consistent with the rule that moral damages are not intended to enrich the injured party, but to alleviate the moral suffering undergone by that party by reason of the defendant’s culpable action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition is <em>DENIED</em> and the assailed Decision <em>AFFIRMED</em>.
