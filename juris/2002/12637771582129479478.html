  <p>May pretrial stipulations duly signed by the accused and 
their 
counsel be unilaterally withdrawn before the commencement of the trial? 
To this main issue, the answer is “No.” Stipulations freely and 
voluntarily made are valid and binding and will not be set aside unless 
for good cause. The Rules of Court mandate parties in a criminal case to
 stipulate facts. Once they have validly and voluntarily signed the 
stipulations, the accused and their counsel may not set these aside on 
the mere pretext that they may be placed at a disadvantage during the 
trial.  </p>
  <p> Statement of the Case </p>
  <p>Before us is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the 
Rules of Court, praying for the setting aside of the April 28, 
2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the 
May 26, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
Orders of the Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 (SBN) in Criminal Case Nos. 25280-82. The first Order denied 
petitioners’ Motion to Withdraw the Joint Stipulation of Facts and 
Documents,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
while the second denied reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>    </p>
  <p>The Facts </p>
  <p>On May 6, 1999, three Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 were filed before the SBN, charging Petitioners Ernesto T. Matuday and 
Sixto M. Bayas with violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019, as 
amended; and two counts of malversation through falsification penalized 
under Article 217, in relation to Article 171, of the Revised Penal 
Code. They were charged in their capacities as municipal mayor and 
municipal treasurer, respectively, of the Municipality of Kabayan, 
Province of Benguet. </p>
  <p>During their arraignment on September 21, 1999, petitioners 
pled 
“not guilty.” The pretrial conference scheduled on October 15, 1999 was 
cancelled and reset to November 5, 1999, because the counsel for the 
accused, Atty. Jose M. Molintas, was not prepared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 On November 5, 1999, the pretrial was again cancelled because of the 
absence of Atty. Molintas, who was allegedly “suffering from the flu.” 
Nonetheless, the Sandiganbayan urged the accused to discuss with their 
counsel the stipulation of facts drafted by Ombudsman Prosecutor II 
Evelyn T. Lucero. They were asked to do so, so that at the resumption of
 the pretrial on December 10, 1999, they could expeditiously pass upon 
all other matters that still remained to be resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On December 10, 1999, the parties submitted a “Joint 
Stipulation of
 Facts and Documents,” which had been duly signed by the two accused 
(herein petitioners), Atty. Molintas and Prosecutor Lucero. It is 
reproduced hereunder: </p>

  <p>On January 14, 2000, the pretrial conference was again 
scuttled due
 to the absence of Atty. Molintas. The hearing was rescheduled for 
February 14, 2000. However, on February 7, 2000, he moved to withdraw as
 counsel for the accused. His motion was granted by the anti-graft court
 in an Order dated February 14, 2000. In the same Order, the pretrial 
was rescheduled for March 31, 2000, to give the accused ample time to 
employ a new counsel. </p>
  <p>On April 26, 2000, the accused, represented by their new 
counsel, 
Atty. Cecilia M. Cinco, moved to withdraw the Joint Stipulation of Facts
 and Documents. Specifically, they sought to withdraw, first, 
Stipulation 1(b) which states that “Both the accused admit the 
disbursement of the amount of P510,000.00 and P55,000.00”; and second, 
Exhibits “1” to “8-a”. They invoked their constitutional right to be 
presumed innocent until proven guilty. </p>
  <p>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan </p>
  <p>The Sandiganbayan justified its denial of petitioners’ Motion
 to 
Withdraw Joint Stipulation of Facts and Documents in this wise: 
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“x x x. [For] the fact that there [was] express statement 
from 
Atty. Rogelio A. Cortes this morning that neither fraud nor any other 
mistake of a serious character vitiated the consent of the parties when 
they affixed their conformity to the stipulations of facts, the reason 
put forth by the accused or movant’s counsel at this time, is that if 
these stipulations were to remain, then the accused might as well not 
present any evidence on the entire accusation against him as this will 
already be supported by the evidence on record. While the court, indeed,
 sees this as a possibility, that, by itself, is not a ground for 
withdrawing any stipulation freely and knowingly made and given.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the second assailed Order, the anti-graft court denied 
reconsideration and reiterated its previous stand, as follows: 
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“x x x. The fact that the stipulation of facts leaves less 
or no 
room for the accused to defend himself is not a ground for setting aside
 a pre-trial order; in fact, an accused can plead guilty if he so 
desires or make admissions as he deems appropriate and truthful, even if
 in the mind of the new counsel, it gave very few opportunities to 
present contesting evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It then added that “the pre-trial order shall remain. The 
admissions therein contained can be used in this case and for whatever 
purpose the Rules on Evidence will allow.”  </p>
  <p>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  </p>
  <p>The Issues </p>
  <p>In their Memorandum, petitioners raise the following issues 
for the Court’s consideration: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">“I </p>
    <p>Whether or not respondent Sandiganbayan committed grave 
abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying 
petitioners’ Motion to Withdraw the Joint Stipulation of Facts and 
Documents, considering the relevant facts and applicable laws and rules.
 </p>
    <p align="center">“II </p>
    <p>Whether or not the denial by respondent Sandiganbayan of 
the 
withdrawal of the Joint Stipulation of Facts and Documents would result 
in manifest injustice and impairment of the constitutional rights of the
 petitioners. </p>
    <p align="center">“III </p>
    <p>Whether or not there is a law or rule which would bar 
petitioners
 from withdrawing their Joint Stipulation of Facts and Documents from 
the respondent Sandiganbayan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Plainly put, the issue raised by petitioners is whether they 
may be
 allowed to withdraw unilaterally from the Joint Stipulation of Facts 
and Documents. </p>
  <p>The Court’s Ruling </p>
  <p>The Petition has no merit. </p>
  <p>Main Issue: <br>
    <em>Withdrawal from the Joint Stipulation 
</em></p>
  <p> Petitioners contend that pretrial stipulations may be 
unilaterally
 withdrawn by the accused because allegedly, they are not binding until 
after the trial court has issued a pretrial order approving them. We are
 not persuaded. </p>
  <p>Petitioners fail to appreciate the indispensable role of 
stipulations in the speedy disposition of cases. The new Rules on 
Criminal Procedure mandate parties to agree on matters of facts, issues 
and evidence. Such stipulations are greatly favored because they 
simplify, shorten or settle litigations in a faster and more convenient 
manner. They save costs, time and resources of the parties and, at the 
same time, help unclog court dockets. </p>
  <p>Once validly entered into, stipulations will not be set aside
 unless for good cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> They should be enforced especially when they 
are not false, unreasonable or against good morals and sound public 
policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 When made before the court, they are conclusive. And the party who 
validly made them can be relieved therefrom only upon a showing of 
collusion, duress, fraud, misrepresentation as to facts, and undue 
influence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> or 
upon a showing of sufficient cause on such terms as will serve justice 
in a particular case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 Moreover, the power to relieve a party from a stipulation validly made 
lies in the court’s sound discretion which, unless exercised with grave 
abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Validity of the Joint Stipulations </p>
  <p>While petitioners wish to be relieved from the stipulations, 
they, 
however, do not allege that these were false or misleading or were 
obtained through force or fraud. On the contrary, they do not dispute 
the finding of the anti-graft court that no fraud or serious mistake 
vitiated their and their counsel’s consent to the signing of these 
stipulations. They even admitted, in answer to its query, that they had 
freely given their consent. </p>
  <p>Nonetheless, in a desperate bid to strengthen their position,
 
petitioners lay the blame on the alleged incompetence of their former 
counsel. They claim that, in agreeing to the Joint Stipulation, he 
failed to consider their legal interests. </p>
  <p>To be a ground for relief against a stipulation, a mistake 
must be 
one of fact -- not, as in this case, a mere lack of full knowledge of 
fact because of failure to exercise due diligence in ascertaining 
it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  
</p>
  <p>Moreover, it is hornbook doctrine that parties are bound by 
the 
action or the inaction of their counsel. To all intents and purposes, 
the acts of a lawyer in the defense or the prosecution of a case are the
 acts of the client. The rule extends even to the mistakes and the 
simple negligence committed by the counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Presumption of Innocence </p>
  <p>In their effort to withdraw from the Joint Stipulation, 
petitioners
 argue that the two questioned items impair their constitutional right 
to be presumed innocent, violate their right against self-incrimination,
 and deny them due process in the sense that the trial would be a 
“useless formality, an idle ceremony.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Other than by generalized argumentation, petitioners have not
 
convinced us that the aforementioned constitutional rights would be 
violated. True, the old Rules of Court frowned upon stipulations of 
facts in criminal cases because of a perceived danger -- that by the 
mere expedient of stipulating with the defense counsel the elements of 
the crime charged, the prosecution would relieve itself of its duty to 
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 However, the Rules were amended in 1985, precisely to enable parties to
 stipulate facts. The amendment was carried over to the 2000 Revised 
Rules on Criminal Procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  </p>
  <p>The acceptability of stipulating facts has long been 
established in
 our jurisprudence. In a case involving illegal possession of 
firearms,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 the prosecution and the defense stipulated the fact that the accused 
had been found in possession of a gun without the required permit or 
license. In People v. Bocar,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 the Court considered as valid the admission by the accused of the 
existence of certain affidavits and exhibits, which the prosecution had 
presented to dispense with oral testimonies on the matter contained 
therein. In <em>People v. Hernandez</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 which involved illegal recruitment, the Court upheld the joint 
stipulation that the accused had not been licensed or authorized by the 
Philippine Overseas Employment Agency to recruit workers for overseas 
jobs. </p>
  <p>There is nothing irregular or unlawful in stipulating facts 
in 
criminal cases. The policy encouraging it is consistent with the 
doctrine of waiver, which recognizes that “x x x everyone has a right to
 waive and agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for
 the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity, 
if it can be dispensed with and relinquished without infringing on any 
public right and without detriment to the community at large.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  </p>
  <p>In the present case, the Joint Stipulation made by the 
prosecution 
and petitioners was a waiver of the right to present evidence on the 
facts and the documents freely admitted by them. There could have been 
no impairment of petitioners’ right to be presumed innocent, right to 
due process or right against self-incrimination because the waiver was 
voluntary, made with the assistance of counsel and is sanctioned by the 
Rules on Criminal Procedure. </p>
  <p>Necessity of a Pretrial Order </p>
  <p>Petitioners further contend that the law on pretrial requires
 the 
issuance of a pretrial order to make pretrial stipulations binding. We 
do not agree. </p>
  <p>Section 2 of Rule 118 of the Rules of Court states: 
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Sec. 2. <em>Pre-trial agreement</em>. — All 
agreements or 
admissions made or entered [into] during the pre-trial conference shall 
be reduced in writing and signed by the accused and counsel, otherwise, 
they cannot be used against the accused. The agreements covering the 
matters referred to in section 1 of this Rule shall be approved by the 
court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  
</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Based on the foregoing provision, for a pretrial agreement to
 be 
binding on the accused, it must satisfy the following conditions: (1) 
the agreement or admission must be in writing, and (2) it must be signed
 by both the accused and their counsel. The court’s approval, mentioned 
in the last sentence of the above-quoted Section, is not needed to make 
the stipulations binding on the parties. Such approval is necessary 
merely to emphasize the supervision by the court over the case and to 
enable it to control the flow of the proceedings. </p>
  <p>Once the stipulations are reduced into writing and signed by 
the 
parties and their counsels, they become binding on the parties who made 
them. They become judicial admissions of the fact or facts 
stipulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 Even if placed at a disadvantageous position, a party may not be 
allowed to rescind them unilaterally; it must assume the consequences of
 the disadvantage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> If the 
accused are allowed to plead guilty under appropriate circumstances, by 
parity of reasoning, they should likewise be allowed to enter into a 
fair and true pretrial agreement under appropriate circumstances. 
</p>
  <p>There is another cogent reason why the Joint Stipulation 
should be 
binding. It must be noted that the SBN could not fully act on the 
matter, not through its fault, but because of the continued absence of 
petitioners’ counsel. Verily, the records reveal that at the intended 
completion of the pretrial on January 14, 2000, it could not pass upon 
the Joint Stipulation because he was absent. Also, the pretrial 
conference had to be re-scheduled six times, just to ensure the 
attendance of the parties and their counsels and to prepare them for the
 conference. </p>
  <p>Therefore, under these circumstances, the SBN cannot be 
faulted for
 its failure to approve expressly the stipulations. It had the 
opportunity to rule on the matter only when the accused, through their 
new counsel, Atty. Cecilia L. Cinco, moved to withdraw their 
stipulations. In its first assailed Order, the SBN upheld their 
validity, thereby effectively approving the submitted Joint Stipulation 
of Facts and Documents. The assent of the court to agreements of the 
parties, assisted by their counsel, is assumed until they indicate a 
dissent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus,
 the 
stipulations freely made by the latter are to be respected as their true
 will and intention with regard to the facts and evidence of the case, 
especially if the anti-graft court has not struck them down for being 
violative of the law. </p>
  <p>Role of Lawyers in Pretrials </p>
  <p>Pretrial is meant to simplify, if not fully dispose of, the 
case at
 its early stage. It is therefore important that the parties take active
 roles in the proceedings. The Rules on Criminal Procedure provide that 
if the counsel for the accused and/or the prosecutor do not appear at 
the pretrial and do not offer an acceptable excuse for their lack of 
cooperation, the court may impose proper sanctions or penalties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Verily, during pretrial, attorneys must make a full 
disclosure of 
their positions as to what the real issues of the trial would be. They 
should not be allowed to embarrass or inconvenience the court or injure 
the opposing litigant by their careless preparation for a case; or by 
their failure to raise relevant issues at the outset of a trial; or, as 
in this case, by their unilateral withdrawal of valid stipulations that 
they signed and that their clients fully assented to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  </p>
  <p>The records reveal that the parties were the ones who 
volunteered 
to make the Joint Stipulation of the facts of the case. Thus, the 
anti-graft court can rightfully expect that both parties arrived upon it
 with fairness and honesty. Therefore, petitioners may not assail it on 
the mere ground that it would allegedly put the accused at a 
disadvantage. Furthermore, a new counsel cannot justify such withdrawal 
by the simple expedient of passing the blame on the previous counsel, 
who had supposedly not sufficiently discharged his duty to the client. 
</p>
  <p>If we allow parties to renege on stipulations they validly 
entered 
into during the course of pretrial proceedings, there would be no end to
 litigations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> 
Lawyers can 
wiggle in and out of agreements the moment they are disadvantaged. 
Lawyers should remember, however, that they are not merely 
representatives of the parties but, first and foremost, officers of the 
court. As such, one of their duties -- assisting in the speedy and 
efficient administration of justice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> -- is more significant than that of acquitting 
their client,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> 
rightly or wrongly. </p>
  <p>We stress that candor in all dealings is the very essence of 
membership in the legal profession. Lawyers are obliged to observe rules
 of procedure in good faith, not to misuse them to defeat the ends of 
justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> They 
should 
realize that the earlier they dispose of their cases, especially at the 
pretrial stage, the better for them. In doing so, they can now 
concentrate and work more efficiently on their other cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Grave Abuse of Discretion </p>
  <p>As already discussed, the power to relieve a party from a 
stipulation validly made lies at the sound discretion of the court. 
Unless exercised with grave abuse, this discretion will not be disturbed
 on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> 
There is 
“grave abuse of discretion” where “a power is exercised in an arbitrary,
 capricious, whimsical or despotic manner by reason of passion or 
personal hostility, so patent and so gross as to amount to evasion of 
positive duty or virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by, or in 
contemplation of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  </p>
  <p>Petitioners in this case failed to prove that the 
Sandiganbayan 
committed grave abuse of discretion in disallowing them to withdraw the 
stipulations that they had freely and voluntarily entered into. Also, no
 bad faith or malice was or can be imputed to the anti-graft court for 
failing to immediately act upon the Joint Stipulation. The delay was 
due, not to its deliberate evasion of its duty, but to the continued 
absence of petitioners’ counsel. </p>

DENIED, and the assailed Orders AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners.
