				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Once again, we hark back to the principle that as long as constitutional safeguards are adequately complied with, a confession constitutes evidence of the highest order for it is supported by the strong presumption that no person of normal mind will deliberately and knowingly confess to a crime unless prompted by truth and his conscience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 10, 1990 filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 72, Olangapo City, accused Deorito Porio y Rapsing was charged with the complex crime of rape with homicide, committed in the following manner:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the twenty-fifth (25<sup>th</sup>) day of June, 1990, in the City of Olongapo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Riza Cleodoro,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> an 11 year old girl, and by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the accused, with intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault and strangle the said Riza Cleodoro, which caused her death shortly thereafter.<br><br>“CONTRARY TO LAW.”</blockquote>Accused entered a plea of "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> During the hearing, the prosecution presented Dr. Richard Patilano, Atty. Juanito Atienza, Pfc. Roosevelt Menor, Cpl. Felipe Francia, and Pat. Marlon Agno as its witnesses.&nbsp; The defense, on the other hand, offered the sole testimony of accused Deorito Porio.<br><br>The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses reveal that:<br><br>Shortly before midnight of June 25, 1990, the residents of New Cabalan found the lifeless body of Riza Cleodoro Flores near a creek at Purok I, Libas, New Cabalan, Olongapo City.&nbsp; She was 11 years old, and was survived by her mother Trinidad Cleodoro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The Autopsy Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> shows that the cause of Riza's death is strangulation.&nbsp; The genital examination discloses "sexual intercourse with a man."&nbsp; The pertinent portions of the said report issued by Dr. Richard Patilano, Medico-Legal Officer of Olongapo City, read:<br><blockquote><b>"Contusions:&nbsp; 4x1 cm over the left side of the neck; 2x1 cm over the anterior aspect of the neck; 2x1.5 cm over the left side of the inguinal area.</b><br>Breast:&nbsp; not yet developed.<br><b>Genital Examination:</b><br>No pubic hair, Labia majora-gaping, Labia Minora –gaping.

Felipe Francia of the Olangapo Police Department that the accused attempted to rape Riza on three previous occasions.&nbsp; Montes got this information, as a Purok Leader, from Trinidad, the victim's mother, who confirmed its veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 1990, Montes accompanied the accused to the&nbsp; Olongapo Police Department.&nbsp; Immediately, Pat. Marlon Agno and Cpl. Francia conducted a cursory examination of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The latter readily admitted to them that he raped and killed Riza and that he was bothered by his conscience.&nbsp; However, Pat. Agno and Cpl. Francia did not reduce the accused's admission in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On January 27, 1990, the accused, together with Montes, returned to the Olongapo Police Station.&nbsp;&nbsp; Montes then informed Pfc. Roosevelt Menor that the accused admitted having committed the crime.&nbsp; Thereupon, Pfc. Menor verified from the accused the truth of such statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter answered positively.&nbsp; Communicating in the Tagalog language, Pfc. Menor informed the accused of his constitutional rights, among which are his rights to remain silent and to have a counsel of his own choice.&nbsp; Pfc. Menor also cautioned the accused that whatever statement he will give can be used against him in court.&nbsp; Pfc. Menor repeatedly explained these rights to the accused.&nbsp; He said he understood them.&nbsp; Since the accused could not mention any lawyer of his own choice, Pfc. Menor requested Atty. Juanito Atienza to assist him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Atty. Atienza conferred with the accused, informing him of all his constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Atty. Atienza also reminded him of the gravity of his crime and advised him of its consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Notwithstanding these warnings, accused, assisted by Atty. Atienza signed the <i>Pagpapatunay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that he was informed of his constitutional rights which he understands; and that he is expressly waiving them.&nbsp; Immediately, he made the following confession in his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">“T:</td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="justify">Ano ang masasabi mo sa nangyaring ito?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>S:</td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="justify">Nagawa ko po iyon dahil gusto ko po at ako ay nakainom.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>T: </td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify">Isalaysay mo nga sa akin ang mga pangyayari?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>S: </td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify">Pagkatapos ko pong ayusin ang aking trabaho ay umalis na ako, bandang alas otso na po iyon at dumaan ako&nbsp; sa isang tindahan at bumili ng isang lapad na ESQ, tapos tuloy na ako sa bahay namin ni Trining at Teresa.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>T: </td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify">Sino naman itong Trining?<br> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>S:</td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="justify">Ina po ni Teresa, na kinakasama ko.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>T:</td> <td colspan="3"> <div align="justify">Ipagpatuloy mo ang iyong salaysay?

Atienza was present during the investigation, he did not know the said lawyer, nor did he request him to act as his counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to him, the police&nbsp; "let" him sign the document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On July 20, 1994, the trial court, rendered a Decision finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape with homicide, thus:<br><blockquote>“<b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing considerations, this Court finds accused Deorito Porio y Rapsing guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of rape with homicide and sentences him to RECLUSION PERPETUA; to indemnify the complainant Trinidad Cleodoro the amount of P50,000.00 as actual damages; P100,000.00 as moral damages; P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay the costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Feeling aggrieved, the accused, now appellant, comes to us ascribing to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>“I</b><br></div><b><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN ADMITTING THE EXTRAJUDICIAL CONFESSION OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE COMPETENT AND INDEPENDENT COUNSEL PREFERABLY OF HIS OWN CHOICE.<br><br></b><div style="text-align: center;"><b>“II</b><br></div><b><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT CONSIDERING THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION.<br><br></b><div style="text-align: center;"><b>“III</b><br></div><b><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING MUCH WEIGHT AND CREDIT TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES AND IN REJECTING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.<br><br></b><div style="text-align: center;"><b>“IV</b><br></div><b><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE COMPLEX CRIME OF RAPE WITH HOMICIDE."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Appellant mainly contends that the taking of his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> was in violation of his constitutional rights and is, therefore, inadmissible.&nbsp;&nbsp; He claims that he was not assisted by an independent counsel and that he was "intimidated or practically forced to execute or sign" the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; He likewise maintains that the evidence against him is insufficient since all the prosecution witnesses are mere "witnesses after the fact."<br><br>The Solicitor General maintains that the constitutional mandates on custodial investigation were complied with, hence, appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> is admissible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, appellant's guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt as his Sinumpaang Salaysay was corroborated by the corpus <i>delicti</i>.<br><br>The primordial issue in this case is whether appellant's extra-judicial confession (<i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>) was taken in violation of his constitutional rights.<br><br>Appellant's extra-judicial confession is not constitutionally infirmed.<br><br>This Court, with its constant tryst with retracting confessants, has drawn the cardinal requirements for an extra-judicial confession to be admissible, to wit: <b>1)</b> the confession must be voluntary;&nbsp; <b>2)</b> the confession must be made with the assistance of a competent and independent counsel, preferably of the confessant's choice; <b>3)</b> the confession must be express; and <b>4)</b>&nbsp; the confession must be in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Measured against this yardstick, we are convinced that appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> is admissible.<br><br><b>I. The confession was made voluntarily.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>A confession is presumed to be voluntary until the contrary is proved and the declarant bears the burden of proving that his confession is involuntary and untrue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Appellant was unable to discharge this burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; He failed to present evidence that he was "intimidated or practically forced to execute or sign"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>.<br><br>Initially, it must be stressed that appellant was not arrested by the police authorities.&nbsp; He voluntarily went to the Olongapo Police Station, accompanied by Montes, a Purok Leader, to whom he previously mentioned having committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> There, before Cpl. Francia and Pat. Agno, he admitted that he raped and killed Riza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> With such prior deliberate conduct, we are inclined to believe that the subsequent execution of his <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> before Pfc. Menor was likewise voluntary on his part.<br><br>Significantly, this Court has held that where the appellant did not present evidence of compulsion or duress or violence on his person; where he did not institute any criminal or administrative action against his alleged intimidators for maltreatment; where there appeared to be no marks of violence on his body; and where he did not have himself examined by a reputable physician to buttress his claim,&nbsp; all these should be considered as factors indicating voluntariness of a confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, no evidence whatsoever was offered by appellant to show that he filed a complaint against the persons who allegedly intimidated or forced him even if he had the opportunity to do so.&nbsp; Neither did he submit to the trial court a medical report proving that his body was subjected to violence or torture.&nbsp; He even willfully signed a Pagpapatunay that he gave the statements freely, without coercion, intimidation, inducement, or false promises, thus:<br><blockquote>"PAGPAPATUNAY<br><br>Pagpapatunay po ito na naunawaan ko ang lahat ng nasasaad sa gawing itaas, pinawalang halaga o bisa ko ang mga ito sa harapan ni Atty. JUANITO C. ATIENZA. <b>Kusa po akong nagbigay ng kusang salaysay at hindi ako pinilit o tinakot o pinangakuan ng ano pa man, lahat ng aking sasabihin ay buong katotohanan lamang.</b><br><br><div style="margin-left: 440px; text-align: center;">(Sgd.)<br>DEORITO PORIO<br>May salaysay “<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></div></blockquote>On its face, the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> has no sign of suspicious circumstances tending to cast doubt on its integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like in other cases where this Court upheld the admissibility of extra-judicial confessions, appellant's narration reflects spontaneity and coherence which, psychologically, cannot be associated with a mind to which force and intimidation have been applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant's response to each question contains details beyond what was&nbsp; being asked,&nbsp; thus indicating&nbsp; a mind free from exraneous restraints.&nbsp; As can be gleaned from the confession, the investigator did not propound questions answerable only by yes or no.&nbsp; He gave appellant sufficient latitude to elaborate by simply saying to him, "<i>Ipagapatuloy mo ang iyong salaysay.</i>"<br><br>All the above facts indicate that appellant executed his Sinumpaang Salaysay freely and voluntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; To hold otherwise is to facilitate the retraction by appellant of his solemnly made statements at the mere allegations of force, intimidation, violence or torture, without any proof whatsoever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Bare assertions will certainly not suffice to overturn the presumption of voluntariness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>II.&nbsp; The confession was made with the <br>assistance of a competent and<br>independent counsel.</b><br><br>Enshrined in Article III, Section 12 (1) of the 1987 Constitution are the rights of the accused during custodial investigation, thus:<br><blockquote>"<b>Sec.&nbsp; 12. (1)</b> Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.&nbsp; These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel."</blockquote>The rights to remain silent and to have a competent and independent counsel may be waived by the accused provided that the constitutional requirements are complied with.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must appear clearly that the accused was beforehand accorded his right to be informed of such rights.&nbsp; In addition, the waiver must be in writing and in the presence of counsel.<br><br>Appellant signed the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> which consists of two parts.&nbsp; The first part shows that he was informed he has a right to remain silent and not to give any statement; that he has a right to retain a counsel of his choice; and that any statement he gives can be used against him in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; After being thus informed, he said he was willing to give a statement and tell the truth.&nbsp; He even signed a <i>Pagpapatunay</i> that contains an express waiver of his constitutional rights in the presence of Atty. Atienza.<br><br>Notwithstanding such express waiver of his rights, Pfc. Menor still requested Atty. Atienza to act as counsel for appellant during the investigation.&nbsp; <b>He interposed no objection to Atty. Atienza's assistance, thus:</b><br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">COURT:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify"><b>But you have no objection for Atty.

Atienza and that the latter was only "picked up" by Pfc. Menor outside the police station.&nbsp; It must be emphasized that appellant did not object when Atty. Atienza, suggested by the police, acted as his own counsel.&nbsp; We have consistently ruled that while the initial choice of the lawyer, in cases where a person under custodial investigation cannot afford the services of the lawyer, is naturally lodged in the police investigator, the accused really has the final choice as he may reject the counsel chosen for him and ask for another one.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lawyer provided by the investigator is deemed engaged by the accused where the latter never raised any objection against the former's appointment during the course of the investigation, and the accused thereafter subscribes to the veracity of his statement before the swearing officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> We reiterate that appellant did not interpose any opposition when Atty. Atienza assisted him.<br><br>We find that Atty. Atienza is a competent and independent counsel. To be considered competent and independent for the purpose of assisting an accused during a custodial investigation, it is only required for a lawyer to be:<br><blockquote>“….willing to fully safeguard the constitutional rights of the accused, as distinguished from&nbsp; one who would merely be giving a routine, peremptory and meaningless recital of the individual’s constitutional rights. In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Basay</span>&nbsp; (219 SCRA 404, 418) this Court stressed that an accused’ right to be informed of the right to remain silent and to counsel contemplates the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>Atty. Atienza testified that he was present and assisted appellant during the time that the latter waived his constitutional rights and gave his statement admitting that he committed the crime charged.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he asked the investigator to give him an opportunity to talk to appellant alone.&nbsp; We quote Atty. Atienza's testimony, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“PROSECUTOR MACABANGUN:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">I have here a document, it appears in that statement executed by the accused Deorito Porio that your signature appears at the bottom of the statement, and it is stated that you assisted the accused.

The confession is explicit and categorical.</b><br><br>A confession is an acknowledgement in express words, by the accused in a criminal case, of the truth of the main fact charged, or some essential parts thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Owing to its very definition, there is no such thing as an implied confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It is always a direct and positive acknowledgement of guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that appellant is charged with the complex crime of rape with homicide, his statements that he inserted his penis in the victim's vagina and that he strangled her to death are express confessions or acknowledgement of guilt.<br><br><b>IV. The confession is in writing.</b><br><br>Appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salayasay</i> is not only in writing, it also written in the language which appellant speaks and understands.<br><br>In fine, we hold that appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> adequately satisfies the constitutional requirements on pre-interrogation advisories.&nbsp; Appellant can no longer extricate himself from its necessary consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the passage of time could easily bring a change of mind to a retracting confessant, courts, on the strength of settled principles, cannot undo for the confessant what he had deliberately done in the name of truth. We can not overlook the fact that appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> is replete with details which only a perpetrator of the crime could have supplied and which could not have been concocted by someone who did not take part in its commission.&nbsp; Appellant's&nbsp; statement that he raped the victim and&nbsp; then strangled her to death cannot be taken lightly as it concurs with the findings of Dr. Patilano that the cause of death is strangulation and that the victim's genitalia shows "sexual intercourse with a man…with violence." This clearly signifies that appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> is corroborated by the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<br><br>In a criminal prosecution, in order to warrant a conviction, the State is required to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. <b>An extra-judicial confession made by an accused is a sufficient ground for conviction if corroborated by the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The existence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> and the legality of appellant's extra-judicial confession having been duly proven by the State, appellant's conviction is, therefore, in order.&nbsp; To reiterate, a confession constitutes evidence of the highest order as long as constitutional safeguards are adequately complied with, as in this case.<br><br>The trial court correctly imposed upon appellant the penalty of&nbsp; <i>reclusion perpetua</i> inasmuch as the crime was committed in 1990 when the imposition of the death sentence was suspended.&nbsp; However, the trial court erred in awarding P50,000.00 as actual damages since there is no evidence to&nbsp; sustain the same. Instead, the civil indemnity of&nbsp; P100,000.00 must be awarded, this amount being properly commensurate with the seriousness of the complex crime of rape with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The amount of P100,000.00 for moral damages awarded by the trial court must be reduced to P50,000.00 in keeping with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> And, the award of exemplary damages must be deleted. In criminal offenses, exemplary damages may be imposed only if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Here, the prosecution failed to establish any aggravating circumstance.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the challenged Decision of the trial court finding appellant guilty of the crime of rape with homicide is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, subject to the modification that the heirs of the victim, Riza Cleodoro Flores, shall be entitled to the amount of&nbsp; P100,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Melo, J., (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban</i>, and <i>Carpio, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> People <i>v.</i> Aquino, 310 SCRA 437 (1999).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Her real name is Riza Cleodoro Flores, her mother's surname being "Cleodoro."
