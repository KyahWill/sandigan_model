				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an automatic review of the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Capas, Tarlac, Branch 66, in Criminal Case No. 1139 finding accused-appellant Rogelio Caiñgat guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his daughter, Rowena Caiñgat, a minor, and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death.&nbsp; The trial court further ordered accused-appellant to pay the victim the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) “by way of indemnification for moral damages.”<br><br>In the criminal complaint, dated October 28, 1996, Rowena charges her father, accused-appellant, as follows:<br><blockquote>The undersigned private complainant Rowena Payumo Caiñgat, 14 years, assisted by her guardian-aunt, Dometila Nolasco, after the necessary preliminary investigation conducted by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Aladin C. Bermudez, Jr., accuses her father, Rogelio Caiñgat of Cub-Cub, Capas, Tarlac, of the crime of Rape, committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 28<sup>th</sup> day of July, 1996, in the Municipality of Capas, Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with lewd design, have sexual intercourse with her undersigned daughter, Rowena Payumo Caiñgat against the latter’s will and with the said accused taking advantage of his moral ascendancy equivalent to force and intimidation.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>At his arraignment on April 21, 1997, accused-appellant, who was assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The prosecution then presented two witnesses:&nbsp; Rowena and Dr. Glothelda Rivera.&nbsp; They testified to the following:<br><br>Fifteen-year-old Rowena was six years old when her mother, Lucila Payumo, died.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father, accused-appellant, did not re-marry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, the two of them lived together in a house in Cub-Cub, Capas, Tarlac.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Late in the evening of July 28, 1996, while Rowena was sleeping in their house, accused-appellant arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was intoxicated and immediately came near Rowena, who was then only half-asleep.&nbsp; He was wearing only his briefs. He awakened Rowena and began to undress her.&nbsp; He told her he was going to kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp; As accused-appellant “grabbed” her, Rowena was forced to lie down (<i>napahiga ako</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; He kissed her, removed his briefs, and, according to her, he “raped” her. After the incident, Rowena left their house and told her aunt, Dometila Nolasco, accused-appellant’s sister, what happened. Dometila brought Rowena to the chapel and forthwith reported the incident to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In her sworn statement given to the police, Rowena stated that she was filing a complaint against her father as he had been raping her since she was eight years old until she was fourteen (<i>panggagahasa sa akin mula noong ako ay walong taong gulang pa lamang hanggang ngayong labing-apat na taon na po ako</i>). <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rowena confirmed this statement on the witness stand when she testified that accused-appellant had raped her two (2) times prior to July 28, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Rowena testified that only she and her father slept in their one-room house that had no divider.&nbsp; She did not shout when her father raped her because she was afraid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Carlos Caiñgat, accused-appellant’s first cousin, accompanied Rowena<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to Dr. Glothelda Rivera who, after examining her, issued a medical certificate, the&nbsp; pertinent portion of which states:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">GENITALIA:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="center">= </div></td> <td width="90%">slightly prominent mons pubis with scanty, black, curly pubic hairs</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">= </div></td> <td>hymen;

She opined that the laceration might have been inflicted “more than a week” before the examination or possibly on July 28, 1996 because of its rounded edges and scars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Dr. Rivera added that Rowena, who was then under treatment for psychosis, was “not very cooperative.” When Dr. Rivera verified from Rowena if she was indeed abused by her father, she replied that her father “was trying to molest her.” However, Dr. Rivera did not find Rowena to be psychotic as she answered her questions “intelligently,” although according to Dr. Rivera, she had to repeat the questions several times before Rowena could give her answers.&nbsp; Rowena appeared then to be “very afraid.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Only accused-appellant testified in his own defense.&nbsp; A laborer, shoemaker and widower, accused-appellant admitted that Rowena is his only child with his deceased common-law wife although he had children with another woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On July 28, 1996, Rowena was staying with his sister, Dometila Nolasco.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dometila’s house was beside his own.&nbsp; On the evening of that date, he fetched his sister who was selling <i>balut</i> at the market.&nbsp; It was 1:00 a.m. when they returned home.&nbsp; Rowena was in his house, sleeping on her bed.&nbsp; He told her to eat the <i>balut</i> given by her aunt, as she had been awakened by the noise of his cart.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister had transferred Rowena to his house at 1:30 a.m. and she slept on the folding bed three (3) paces away from his own folding bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowena was eating <i>balut</i> when he slept.&nbsp; He woke up at 7:00 the next morning while Rowena slept until 10:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant vehemently denied that he raped Rowena.&nbsp; According to accused-appellant, Rowena filed the rape case against him because she “was not in her right mind.”&nbsp;&nbsp; She would laugh and be in a state of shock (<i>tulala</i>) sometimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning,&nbsp; Rowena told him, “<i>Tata, o, bili tanas.&nbsp;&nbsp; He-he-he,</i>” which meant that she wanted him to buy her an apple.&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening of July 28, 1996, when he gave her <i>balut</i>, Rowena said, “<i>He</i>!”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>He discovered that Rowena was mentally disturbed on June 24, 1996 when his sister brought her to his house.&nbsp; He was mad at his sister.&nbsp; Rowena was going to school and he would give her allowance.&nbsp; One time, he asked her why she became mentally disturbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowena told him:&nbsp; “<i>Tata, pinainom po ako ng Pepsi Cola sa tapat po ng eskuwela namin</i>” (Father, somebody asked me to drink Pepsi Cola in front of our school).&nbsp; He asked her to identify the person who gave her the drink but she could not tell him who that person was.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowena also told him that there was an old man on board a car but when he asked her about the plate number of the car, Rowena answered:&nbsp; “I don’t remember.&nbsp; <i>He-he-he.</i>” After that, accused-appellant could no longer talk to Rowena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant made inquiries in Rowena’s school about the person who gave her a drink but nobody knew that person.&nbsp;&nbsp; After June 28, 1996, he “took full responsibility” of his daughter.&nbsp; He was mad at “them” (his sister) because when his sister took his daughter, Rowena was still in her right mind; when her sister returned Rowena to him, she was already “suffering from mental disorder.” Hence, on July 15, 1996, before taking Rowena to the hospital, accused-appellant asked “them” if they maltreated his daughter while she was in “their” custody.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sister got angry.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at that time, Rowena was in his sister’s house because he had asked her to look after Rowena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant was detained on September 17, 1996 but he did not know the reason for his detention.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither did he know why Dometila and his daughter would file the rape case against him. Feeling embarrassed by the accusation against him, accused-appellant went to the office of the barangay captain for advice.&nbsp; The barangay captain told him to go to the police station.&nbsp; He did as told but he could not confront Rowena because Dometila had hidden her from him since the first Saturday of September 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>He was at the police station at 2:00 p.m. on September 17, 1996, when a person angrily told him to affix his signature on an affidavit.&nbsp; When shown the counter-affidavit, dated October 7, 1996, that bore his signature, accused-appellant initially denied that it was his.&nbsp; Later, he claimed that he was forced to sign the document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, accused-appellant again admitted that Rowena is his daughter, that she was already sixteen (16) years of age at that time, and that on July 28, 1996, she was only fourteen (14) years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; His first wife was Josefina Castro but she was not Rowena’s mother.&nbsp; He and Rowena’s mother, Lucila, did not get married.&nbsp; Rowena was born on the eighth year that they (accused-appellant and Lucila) were living together.&nbsp; In 1988, Lucila died; Rowena was then six years old.&nbsp; He and Lucila’s mother, Fidela Tiamzon Canono, took care of Rowena.&nbsp; They stayed with his sister.&nbsp; Later, accused-appellant built a small hut near Dometila’s house but Rowena did not stay with him yet.&nbsp; She would just pass by his hut to ask if he had eaten.&nbsp; On June 24, 1996, after five years that Dometila had been taking care of Rowena, she brought Rowena to accused-appellant.&nbsp; She said, “Rolly, Rowena, your daughter will stay with you because right now she is not in her right mind.&nbsp; My daughter-in-law was afraid of her, she might kill her two kids.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the evening of June 28, 1996, he was waiting for his sister because she would pay him P10.00 every time he delivered <i>balut</i>.&nbsp; Rowena was at home then because he took care of him whenever he was home.&nbsp; They slept in their respective folding beds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After the prosecution and the defense presented their respective evidence, the trial court rendered judgment convicting accused-appellant for the crime of rape and sentencing him to death.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused, ROGELIO CAIÑGAT, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended.<br><br>Accordingly, by virtue of the amendment therefor under Republic Act No. 7659 and as further amended in Republic Act No. 8353, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>Likewise, the accused is hereby ordered to pay the victim, Rowena Caiñgat, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of indemnification for moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>In this automatic appeal, accused-appellant raises the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT ROGELIO CAIÑGAT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DEFINED AND PENALIZED UNDER ARTICLE 335 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AS AMENDED, IN RELATION TO REPUBLIC ACT NOS. 7659 AND 8353.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN IMPOSING THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OF DEATH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>In determining the guilt of the accused in rape cases, the Court is guided by the following considerations: (a) that an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) that in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime which usually involves two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In all criminal prosecutions, without regard to the nature of the defense which the accused may raise, the burden of proof remains at all times upon the prosecution to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Further, it is the prosecution’s duty to prove each and every element of the crime charged in the information to warrant a finding of guilt for the said crime or for any other crime necessarily included therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As defined by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the law then in effect at the time of the commission of the crime, rape is committed as follows:<br><blockquote>Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed. </i>– Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: <ol> <li>By using force or intimidation.<br></li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br></li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or demented.<br><br>The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i> </li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"> x x x<br></div><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances: <ol> <li>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; </li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"> x x x</div></blockquote>To sustain a conviction under the above provision of law, the prosecution must allege and prove the basic elements of: 1) sexual congress; 2) with a woman; 3) by force and without consent, and in order to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, the additional elements that 4) the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the rape; and 5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The Court is mindful of the general rule that factual findings by the trial court deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any clear showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>A judicious review of the records of this case shows that the trial court did overlook some material facts and circumstances warranting the modification of its decision. The prosecution has failed to discharge its onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt of accused-appellant for the crime of rape.&nbsp; Specifically, the evidence presented by the prosecution does not conclusively establish the first element of carnal knowledge.&nbsp; Despite her lengthy testimony, Rowena failed to mention how the alleged sexual intercourse was consummated.&nbsp; There was a total absence of proof that there was the slightest penetration of the female organ, not even the barest subliminal touch.&nbsp; When her testimony reached the critical point to demonstrate carnal knowledge, all that she said was that she was “raped” without even a modicum of details how the act was done.<br><br>In convicting accused-appellant, the trial court relied heavily on the testimony of Rowena that accused-appellant “raped” her.&nbsp; She testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td>

Jurisprudence dictates that the <i>labia majora</i>&nbsp; must be <i>entered</i> for rape to be consummated, and not merely for the penis to stroke the surface of the female organ.&nbsp; Thus, a grazing of the surface of the female organ or touching the <i>mons pubis</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> is not sufficient to constitute consummated rape.&nbsp; Absent any showing of the slightest penetration of the female organ, <i>i.e.</i>, touching of either <i>labia</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> by the penis, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>The medical certificate and the testimony of Dr. Rivera likewise do not establish to a degree of moral certainty the guilt of accused-appellant for the crime of rape.&nbsp; Dr. Rivera could not categorically say that the laceration on the hymen of Rowena was caused by the penetration of accused-appellant’s penis. When asked whether the laceration on Rowena’s hymen was caused by sexual abuse, Dr. Rivera could only answer: “It is possible, sir, but I could not really say that the penis penetrated because I have not seen it; but it is possible.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Court cannot make this statement the basis for holding accused-appellant liable for rape because in criminal cases, speculation and probabilities cannot take the place of proof required to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Suspicion, no matter how strong, must not sway judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>While we find that the crime of rape has not been established, the evidence advanced by the prosecution fully supports the conclusion that accused-appellant committed the crime of acts of lasciviousness.<br><br>Accused-appellant insists that Rowena was suffering from mental imbalance at the time she testified before the trial court.&nbsp; As such, she did not testify “voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently” and “on her own free will and without being exploited by any other persons such as her aunt with whom the accused had a grudge prior to the filing of this case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>It is well settled that when it comes to the issue of credibility of witnesses, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to properly evaluate testimonial evidence having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses’ deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The trial court observed that Rowena did not show a trace of mental affliction because she testified coherently and intelligently:<br><blockquote>While the record of the case will disclose that the private complainant may be said to be mentally imbalanced at the time she gave her testimony, it is nonetheless observed by this Court that such mental condition of the complainant did not deter her from giving a rational and coherent testimony nor in any way affected her intelligence.&nbsp; In fact, no one could even tell that she is mentally disturbed with the way she laid down her testimony even during her cross-examination.&nbsp; Her answers to the questions propounded to her were answers expected from witnesses of normal disposition, showing that she possesses the same perception as any other ordinary person of sufficient intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding her mental condition, she was able to make known and transmit her perception to others, not only from the questions thrown by the Court but also those from the public prosecutor and the defense counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, the trial court would not have convicted accused-appellant had it believed that the sole prosecution eyewitness was suffering from mental impairment that seriously affected her competence as a witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither is it true that Dr. Rivera corroborated the trial court’s finding on Rowena’s mental state simply because she used the word “coerce” in referring to the manner by which she was able to elicit information from Rowena.
