Branch 53, in Criminal Case Nos. 97-130 and 97-131, convicting appellant
 Laurito Arriola of the crime of rape on two counts committed against 
Judylou Verso and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death 
for each count.
  <p>

The two separate informations charging Laurito Arriola of the crime of 
rape read as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
  
    Criminal Case No. 97-130</p>
  <p> "That on or about the month of May 1995, at Barangay Marao, in the
 Municipality of Padre Burgos, Province of Quezon, Philippines and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, who is the step-father of the offended party, with lewd design,
 by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one 
Judylou C. Verso, a minor, 9 years of age, against her will.</p>

 within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named

  <p> Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>

When arraigned, the accused-appellant, assisted by Atty. Enrico Joaquin 
Villanueva, counsel <em>de oficio</em>, pleaded not guilty to the 
offenses charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>

Trial on the merits thereafter ensued with the two cases (Criminal Case 
Nos. 97-130 and 97-131) jointly tried by the trial court. On September 
8, 1999, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion 
of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, the Court finds Laurito 
Arriola y Santander guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of 
rape.</p>
  <p>
    
    In Criminal Case No. 97-130 he is sentenced to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death and he is ordered to indemnify Judylou Verso in the sum
 of P75,000.00 and to pay the costs.</p>
  <p>
    
    In Criminal Case No. 97-131 he is sentenced to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death and he is ordered to indemnify Judylou Verso in the sum
 of P75,000.00 and to pay the costs.</p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>

The antecedent facts, as culled from the testimonies of the witnesses, 
follow.</p><p>

On January 23, 1997, at 3:40 p.m., Olivia Paulo (hereafter, Olivia), a 
teacher at the Padre Burgos Elementary School in Quezon Province, was 
practicing some pupils for a dance number at the school's hall. 
Suddenly, she heard a noise as if a desk was being dragged. She and 
Teresita Bejerano, the other teacher inside the hall, went to the 
adjacent classroom where the noise came from. They saw Judylou Verso 
(hereafter, Judylou) crying. The accused, Laurito Arriola, was also 
inside the classroom. Olivia asked the classmates of Judylou why she was
 crying. They told her that Laurito Arriola, Judylou's stepfather, 
wanted to fetch Judylou but she refused to go with him. Olivia told her 
co-teacher, Teresita Bejerano, to take Laurito Arriola out of the 
classroom. Arriola, who appeared drunk, obliged but when he reached the 
door of the hall, he boxed the wall. Sensing something wrong, Olivia 
told Judylou to go with her to the non-formal room which was then 
vacant. There she asked Judylou why she refused to go with her 
stepfather. At first, Judylou who looked frightened refused to talk. 
Eventually, because of Olivia's motivation, Judylou told Olivia that 
Arriola had sexually molested her ("<em>ako ay ginalaw niya</em>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Olivia then told Teresita 
Bejerano (hereafter, Teresita), Judylou's teacher-in-charge, to also 
talk with Judylou. Teresita got the same information. With this 
disturbing information, Olivia sent the janitor of the school to the 
Padre Burgos police station to fetch some policemen. The chief of 
police, who headed the responding policemen, ordered his men to look for
 Arriola and advised Olivia to bring Judylou to a physician for physical
 examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>

Judylou Verso was immediately brought to Dr. Grace Santiago, municipal 
health officer of Padre Burgos, Quezon for physical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The findings of Dr. Santiago, 
based on the medico-legal certificate she issued dated January 23, 1997,
 read:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> " watery vaginal discharge; erythematous vaginal wall; (+) hymenal
 tear; (+) healed lacerations on posterior vaginal fourchette; cervix is
 closed, long; uterus is small upon palpation.</p>
  <p>
    
    Recommendation:</p>
  <p> Advised psychological follow-up with psychiatrist for emotional 
preparation &amp; stabilization."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Judylou, who gave her age as eleven<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 when she took the witness stand on September 29, 1997, testified that, 
one night in May of 1995 inside their house in Barangay Marao, Padre 
Burgos, Quezon Province, she woke up to find the appellant Laurito 
Arriola whom she had came to consider as her father ("<em>kinagisnang 
ama</em>")<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on top of her. 
Laurito stood up to remove her t-shirt, shorts and panty and then he 
undressed himself. He again went on top of Judylou and inserted his 
penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The
 accused moved his buttocks up and down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> While on top of her, accused told Judylou not to tell 
anybody of what he was doing to her or else he would kill her and all 
members of her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
Judylou could not do anything but cry. She felt pain because of what 
Laurito was doing to her but she did not say anything; she just 
continued crying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15] </sup>Not long
 after, something came out of Laurito's penis. Laurito put on his brief 
and shorts, and repeated his threat to Judylou not to tell anybody or 
else he would kill all of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p>

Fearful of the threat made by Laurito whom she called Papa,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Judylou kept to herself what 
Laurito did to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
</p><p> In the evening of January 5, 1997, Laurito again lay beside 
Judylou. He repeated what he did to Judylou before — he removed her 
t-shirt, shorts and panty; he undressed himself; he went on top of her; 
he inserted his penis into her vagina; and he moved his buttocks up and 
down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While on top of her,
 he again repeated his warning to Judylou not to tell anybody what he 
was doing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup>He kissed 
Judylou on the lips but Judylou just kept on crying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Just like before, Laurito stopped when 
something came out of his penis. He then stood up, put on his shorts and
 brief and again repeated his warning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><p>

Sometime thereafter, Judylou's mother, Lorena Calalo, returned to the 
Philippines from Hongkong where she was working as a domestic helper. 
Judylou told her mother what her stepfather did to her. Lorena cried and
 uttered bad things at Laurito ("<em>nagmura po siya</em>") in Judylou's
 presence. Before going back to Hongkong, Lorena left Judylou and her 
younger stepbrother and stepsister, aged 3 and 6 respectively, with 
their maternal grandmother, Anastacia Calalo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p>

On January 23, 1997, Laurito tried to fetch Judylou from her school but 
Judylou created a commotion because she refused to go with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Judylou was afraid that he 
might rape her again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p>

When it was the turn of the appellant to present his evidence, his 
counsel, Atty. Enrico Joaquin Villanueva, filed his withdrawal as 
counsel <em>de oficio</em> on the ground that he had irreconciliable 
differences with the accused in the conduct of his defense. After 
talking to the appellant, the court found the ground for withdrawing 
cited by Atty. Villanueva as unmeritorious and denied the same. The 
appellant agreed that Atty. Villanueva would continue to defend him. 
However, in a subsequent hearing, the appellant informed the court that 
his family had decided to secure the services of another lawyer. The 
court relieved Atty. Villanueva as counsel <em>de oficio</em>. But when,
 after several settings, no counsel <em>de parte </em>of the appellant 
appeared, the court, upon the request of the appellant himself, 
appointed Atty. Rodel Ambas as counsel <em>de oficio</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
</p><p>

To the charge of raping his stepdaughter, Judylou Verso, the appellant 
set up the defense of denial. He testified that he did not know anything
 of the charges filed against him nor the reasons why Judylou charged 
him with rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p>

The trial court, taking into account the straightforward testimony of 
Judylou Verso and her demeanor while she testified, found the appellant 
guilty of the two counts of rape filed against him. The trial court did 
not believe the lame denial of the accused that he did not know anything
 of the charges filed against him. The trial court also rejected the 
insinuation of the defense that it was the anger and ill-feeling that 
Judylou felt towards her stepfather (the appellant) for treating her and
 her siblings badly that drove her to file the rape charges against the 
appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p>

The trial court said that, Judylou, in her young and innocent mind, 
could not have concocted the story. She told her teachers of the sexual 
abuse, and only after some prodding, because it was true. Also, the 
trial court noted, it was not difficult to deduce that Judylou refused 
to go with the appellant when he went to fetch her from school in the 
afternoon of January 23, 1997, because the memory of the sexual assault 
by the appellant on January 5, 1997 (only about three weeks before) was 
still fresh in her mind and she was afraid that the appellant was going 
to do the same thing to her again. Lastly, the testimony of Dr. Grace 
Santiago gave credence to the allegation of Judylou that she had been 
raped. Dr. Santiago testified that the genitalia of Judylou had a healed
 laceration and admitted two fingers with ease during the physical 
examination. This indicates that she was no longer a virgin and that 
there was frequent penetration by the male organ. The trial court 
accordingly convicted the appellant of two counts of rape and sentenced 
him to suffer the supreme penalty of death for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p>

Hence, the instant automatic review by us of the decision of the trial 
court. The appellant raises the following errors for our consideration:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    
I</p>
  <p>
    
    That the Honorable Trial Court gravely erred in believing the claim 
of the complainant of her being raped by the accused;</p>
  <p align="center">
    
II    </p>
  <p>That the Honorable Trial Court gravely erred in totally discarding 
the admission of the complainant's examining physician that the victim 
(complainant) had self induced her laceration;</p>
  <p align="center">
    
III</p>
  <p> That the Honorable Trial Court likewise gravely erred in 
disregarding the admission by the complainant of vindictiveness as her 
motive in falsely accusing the accused; and</p>
  <p align="center">
    
IV    </p>
  <p>That the Honorable Trial Court gravely erred in convicting the 
accused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

The main argument of the appellant is that the trial court gravely erred
 in convicting him of the crime of rape in the light of (1) the 
admission of Dr. Santiago, the examining physician, that the victim 
self-inflicted the laceration found in her genitalia and (2) the 
admission of the victim herself that her motive in accusing the 
appellant of the crime of rape is to vindicate the bad treatment 
accorded her and her younger stepbrother and stepsister by the 
appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
</p><p>The argument of the appellant does not hold water.
</p><p>

Appellant wants to make it appear that Dr. Santiago categorically stated
 that the cause of the laceration in Judylou's vaginal fourchette is 
self-inflicted. However, this is not true. The testimony of Dr. 
Santiago, taken as a whole, shows that she merely stated the possible 
causes of the laceration. She did not categorically state that the 
laceration was self-inflicted by the victim. Pertinent portions of her 
testimony are as follows:

<p>Clearly, the testimony of Dr. Santiago merely provided the possible 
causes of the laceration. In her direct testimony, Dr. Santiago stated 
that the cause might be the frequent penetration by the male organ and, 
in her cross-examination, she stated other causes like accident, 
self-infliction or penetration of the vagina by an object 6 to 7 cm in 
size. She never said, in her entire testimony, that the laceration in 
Judylou's vaginal fourchette was caused by self-infliction, as what the 
appellant now avers.</p>
<p>

What is important in the testimony of Dr. Santiago is that she 
identified and affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> 
the medical certificate she executed on January 23, 1997 and, in that 
medical certificate, she stated her findings that Judylou's hymen was 
torn and there was a healed laceration in her posterior vaginal 
fourchette.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p>

We observe that the appellant gives much emphasis to the alleged 
admission of Dr. Santiago when the best evidence is the medical 
certificate she executed. In any case, it must be stated that, in a rape
 case, what is most important is the credible testimony of the victim. 
The medical certificate is merely corroborative in nature. The testimony
 of the victim alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict the accused 
of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>

The appellant next attacks the credibility of the victim by arguing that
 Judylou just made up the charges against him because she wanted to 
avenge the bad treatment he had been according her and her younger 
stepbrother and stepsister. He pointed out the admission of such fact 
made by Judylou in her cross-examination.</p><p>

We, however, find that the alleged admission of Judylou was taken out of
 context. The appellant cannot isolate portions of Judylou's testimony 
to suit his purpose.</p><p>

First, we find it highly inconceivable that Judylou, a child 11 years of
 age,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> with all her naivete
 and innocence, will fabricate a story of defloration, allow an 
examination of her private parts and thereafter submit herself to public
 trial, gossip or ridicule, if she was not, in fact, a victim of rape 
and deeply motivated by a sincere desire to have the culprit apprehended
 and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> No woman or
 girl will subject herself to such humiliation just because her 
stepfather treated her and her younger stepbrother and stepsister badly.</p><p>

What the appellant fails to realize is that Judylou was naturally angry 
with him, not because of the alleged ill-treatment which the defense 
failed to elaborate on in the first place,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> but because of the fact that the appellant actually 
raped the victim not just once but twice. Not only that. The appellant 
repeatedly<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> threatened the 
victim, a child of tender years, not to tell anybody or else he would 
kill her and all the people to whom she divulged the sexual assault. 
Naturally such child lived in fear and anger. She could be raped by her 
stepfather anytime in their house and she could not even tell anybody 
about it.</p><p>

This is precisely the reason why, on January 23, 1997, Judylou created a
 commotion – crying and dragging her table and/or chair, when the 
accused tried to fetch her from school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Judylou was fed up with the heavy feeling of fear she 
had been carrying in her heart for two years. She finally told her 
teachers about it, and only after some prodding, that fateful afternoon 
of January 23, 1997.</p><p>

Thus, when Judylou admitted, in all honesty, in her cross-examination 
that she had ill-feelings toward the appellant, that she looked at the 
appellant as a bad person and she entertained thoughts of vindictiveness
 against him, we consider that in her favor. She answered all the 
questions propounded to her honestly and candidly. And so, when asked 
during her cross-examination if she wanted the appellant to pay for the 
bad things he had done to them, she naturally said “yes” because she was
 angry at him for raping her.</p><p>

Taken therefore in the proper context, Judylou's ill-feelings are 
expected, believable and within the realm of human experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In fact, her spontaneous 
emotional breakdown towards the end of her narration of the sexual 
assault completely bolstered her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>

From the credible testimony of the victim, the fact of carnal knowledge 
has been sufficiently established. Carnal knowledge is the single most 
essential element of statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>

</p><p>In sum, we find no serious flaw in the testimony of the victim 
and in the conclusions of the trial court. The mass of physical and 
testimonial evidence in this case clearly establishes the appellant's 
guilt.
</p><p>

We now come to the proper penalty to be imposed.
</p><p> Under RA 7659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43] </sup>which
 amended Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the relationship of 
stepfather and stepdaughter makes the imposition of the death penalty 
mandatory. RA 7659 provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is 
committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:</p>
  <ol><li>  When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the 
common-law spouse of the parent of the victim."</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>                                                                     
                                                                        
  

Since the prosecution was able to sufficiently establish the guilt of 
the appellant in raping his stepdaughter twice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the penalty of death for each count of rape 
would have been correctly imposed by the trial court.</p><p>  

However, the prosecution failed to present any independent evidence like
 the victim's birth certificate or school records to prove that she was a
 minor (below 18 years of age) when raped by the appellant. The 
allegation in the informations that the victim was only 9 and 10 years 
old, respectively, when raped by the appellant in two separate occasions
 is not sufficient evidence. Nor is the testimony of the victim herself 
to that effect sufficient evidence of minority. Thus, this Court is 
constrained to lower the penalty of death imposed by the trial court 
upon the appellant to<em> reclusion perpetua</em>, in line with recent 
jurisprudence requiring independent proof of minority of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
</p><p>  

We are not unaware of our ruling in <em>People v. Tipay</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> where we ruled that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "This does not mean however, that the presentation of the 
certificate of live birth is at all times necessary to prove minority. 
The minority of a victim of tender age who may be below 10 is quite 
manifest and the court can take judicial notice thereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  

We hold, however, that the circumstances in that case do not exactly 
jibe with those in the case at bar.</p><p>  

As to the award of damages, the imposition by the trial court of P75,000
 as civil indemnity for each count of rape should be reduced to P50,000 
for each count (or a total of P100,000) because the death penalty was 
not imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We also add 
the award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000 for each count (or a
 total of P100,000) because the trial court failed to grant one. This is
 in line with current rulings which automatically grant moral damages in
 rape cases without need of proof. The reason for this is that the 
mental, physical and psychological trauma suffered by the victim is too 
obvious to still require proof at the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p>  

<strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of 
Lucena City, Branch 53, finding the appellant Laurito S. Arriola guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape for two counts and 
sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death for each count and
 ordering him to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000 for each 
count is hereby <strong>MODIFIED</strong>.
</p><p>  

The penalty is reduced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for each count of 
rape and the civil indemnity is reduced to P50,000 for each count (or a 
total of P100,000). The amount of P50,000 for moral damages is also 
awarded for each count of rape (or a total of P100,000) in line with 
current jurisprudence.</p><p>
