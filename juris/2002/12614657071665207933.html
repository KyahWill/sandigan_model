Ir-4716 and Ir-4717, in which he was adjudged guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Pedro Daramay, Jr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Criminal Case No. Ir-4716 as principal thereof, and hereby sentences accused to suffer the penalty of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reclusion perpetua</span> and to indemnify Diana Estadilla P60,000.00 as moral damages.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Appellant was charged with two (2) counts of rape allegedly committed on January 14, 1998 and January 31, 1998.&nbsp; The Information on the first charge, docketed as Criminal Case No. Ir-4716, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 14<sup>th</sup> day of January, 1998, in Barangay San Vicente, Bato, Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, violence, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge [of] one Diana J.

Estadilla, married and a resident of San Vicente, Bato, Camarines Sur left her house at San Vicente, Bato, Camarines Sur to buy ice at a nearby store.&nbsp; On her way to the store, appellant Pedro Daramay, Jr., Diana’s neighbor, who was standing at the doorway of his house called Diana.&nbsp; Thinking that appellant was being neighborly, Diana approached appellant without any hesitation.&nbsp; However, when Diana reached appellant’s doorway, the latter suddenly grabbed Diana’s hand and dragged her inside his house.&nbsp; Diana shouted for help but appellant instantly covered her mouth with his hand.&nbsp; To immobilize Diana, appellant pushed her against the wall, facing it, and pressed the full weight of his body against hers.&nbsp; Appellant covered her mouth with his left hand.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant removed his shorts and brief by using his right hand.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, appellant pulled down Diana’s short pants and panty likewise using his right hand.&nbsp; Aroused, appellant attempted to penetrate Diana but did not succeed as she had vehemently resisted.&nbsp; Appellant persisted.&nbsp; He forcibly pried open Diana’s legs by kicking them hard and when they were apart, he forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; Diana felt weak as appellant made push and pull movements.&nbsp; After satisfying his lust, appellant threatened Diana that harm would befall her and her family if she were to tell anyone of the incident.&nbsp; Trembling and petrified, Diana immediately went home.&nbsp; Having be[e]n intimidated, Diana did not go out of her house nor did she reveal to her husband what appellant did to her.<br><br>“On March 11, 1998, Diana executed a sworn statement relative to the incident before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Nabua, Bato, Camarines Sur.<br><br>“A warrant of arrest of appellant was issued by Hon. Orlando L. Espinas, then Pairing Judge, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 37, Iriga City.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></u><br></div><br>In his Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>, appellant did not present a statement of facts.&nbsp; He simply denied that any incident of rape occurred on January 14, 1998.&nbsp; However, he admitted having had consensual intercourse with complainant on another occasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In an attempt to cast doubt on the probability of the occurrence of the alleged rape on January 14, 1998, he stated that she continued to go to his house even after that date.&nbsp; He cited two specific instances to support his claim: (1) on January 31, 1998, she allegedly went to his house on the pretext that she wanted his wife to teach her how to make cassava cake; and (2) on January 21, 1998, complainant supposedly requested him to go to her house to repair the water pump, which he refused to do to avoid any scandal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>The RTC ruled that the self-serving assertions of appellant that he had been seduced by complainant cannot prevail over her positive and candid statements.&nbsp; It gave credence to her testimony, because it was positive, clear and straightforward.&nbsp; Noting her appearance to be that of a simple, reticent and unsophisticated woman, the trial court opined that she could not have seduced him, whom her family considered to be a good neighbor.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Issue</b></u><br></div><br>In his eight-page Brief, appellant assigns this single error for our consideration:<br><br>“The trial court erred in not appreciating vital testimonies of Aida Estadilla and in convicting the appellant in Crim. Case No. Ir-4716.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Sole Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Sufficiency of&nbsp; Evidence</i></b></u><br></div><br>Appellant assails the lower court’s Decision for giving credence to the “weak evidence” presented by the prosecution.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; <i>First,</i> the records clearly show that complainant testified positively, clearly and credibly on how she had been raped by appellant on January 14, 1998.&nbsp; The relevant portions of her testimony are reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td

In the light of her harrowing experience, she cannot be expected to recall where she was facing when he raped her.&nbsp; What is important is her vivid recollection that he sexually attacked her against her will.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Trial Court’s Factual Findings<br>Binding and Conclusive</i></b></u><br><br>Appellant alleges that the RTC erred in not appreciating the testimony of complainant’s daughter, Aiza Estadilla.&nbsp; However, nowhere in his Brief does he explain why he considers this an error.<br><br>Time and time again, this Court has said that the assessment of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by a trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand; and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under examination.&nbsp; Its findings on such matters are binding and conclusive on appellate courts unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Since appellate courts have access only to inanimate transcripts of stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses during the trial and to the various documentary evidence adduced by both parties, they must rely on the assessment of the trial court regarding the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the present case, appellant has not shown why the RTC erred in giving more credence and weight to the testimony of complainant.&nbsp; Verily, the trial court had the opportunity to see the witnesses on the stand and to determine by their conduct and demeanor whether they were testifying truthfully or simply lying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The RTC correctly awarded moral damages to the rape victim, who is presumed to have suffered moral damages entitling her to such award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, the grant should be reduced to P25,000.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; the trial court erred in not awarding the victim indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>.&nbsp; It has been the practice of the Court to award outrightly the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity to victims of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is <i><b>DENIED</b></i> and the assailed Decision <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>, with the <b><i>MODIFICATION</i></b> that an award of P50,000 as indemnity <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> be granted to the victim in addition to moral damages which is hereby fixed at P25,000.&nbsp;
