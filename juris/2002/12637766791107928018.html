				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
  <p>For resolution is the administrative complaint filed against 
respondent Reynaldo B. Sta. Ana, Human Resource Management Officer I, 
Leave Division, Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), Supreme Court 
for Dishonesty and Falsification of Public Documents relative to his 
promotion as Human Resource Management Officer III.  </p>
  <p> Respondent gained employment in the Office of the Court 
Administrator, Supreme Court in 1976. He started as a Laborer and was 
later promoted to the position of Human Resource Management Officer I. 
Sometime in 1996, respondent applied for promotion as Human Resource 
Management Officer III. In support of his application for promotion to 
the said position, he submitted the following documents: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> (1)     a Certificate of Eligibility purportedly issued by
 the 
Civil Service Commission certifying that respondent Sta. Ana passed the 
Career Service Professional examination on February 18, 1996 with a 
rating of 83.8%;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and </p>
    <p>(2)     a Personal Data Sheet (PDS) dated August 5, 1996 
stating,
 under Item 18, that he passed the Career Service Professional 
examination on February 18, 1996 with a rating of 83.8%.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Upon verification by Atty. Dante Huerta, Field Officer of the
 Civil
 Service Commission in the Supreme Court, it was found that respondent 
Sta. Ana was not in the CSC-NCR Master List of those who passed the MOWE
 Career Service Professional Examination given by the Civil Service 
Commission on February 18, 1996 at Ramon Magsaysay High School.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Atty. Huerta 
recommended the filing of a formal charge against respondent. </p>
  <p>Thus, the Civil Service Commission Office for Legal Affairs 
(CSC-OLA) issued a formal charge against respondent for Dishonesty and 
Falsification of Public Document committed as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That in support of promotional appointment to the position 
of 
Human Resource Management Officer III, you submitted a Certificate of 
Eligibility certifying you to have passed the Career Service 
Professional Examination on February 18, 1996 with a rating of 83.8%. 
Upon verification with this Office’s Registry of Eligibles, it was found
 out that your name does not appear among those who have passed the said
 examination. Such act is contrary to Civil Service Law and 
rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>    
</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A copy of the formal charge was furnished respondent on 
October 11,
 1996 requiring him to file his Answer within five days from notice. 
Respondent asked for an extension of time to file his Answer which was 
granted by the CSC-OLA on December 11, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 However, respondent still did not submit his Answer within the extended
 period. He also failed to attend the scheduled hearings despite notices
 for him to appear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On February 19, 1998, an <em>ex-parte hearing 
</em>was conducted by
 the Hearing Officer of the CSC-OLA. A representative from the CSC Field
 Office in the Supreme Court, Ms. Rose Perlas, testified to confirm the 
documents submitted by respondent in support of his promotional 
appointment, namely: (1) a Certificate of Eligibility indicating that 
respondent passed the Career Service Professional Examination held at 
Ramon Magsaysay High School on February 18, 1996;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (2) a Personal Data Sheet dated 
August 5, 1996 stating that he passed said examination;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 and (3) an official Appointment dated July 9, 1996 issued by then Chief
 Justice Andres Narvasa promoting respondent to the position of Human 
Resource Management Officer III.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>    </p>
  <p>In the same hearing, a certification issued by Ms. Bella A. 
Mitra, 
Officer-in-Charge, Examination and Placement Services Division (EPSD), 
CSC-NCR, was presented attesting that respondent’s name was not included
 in the Registry of Eligibles in the Career Service Professional 
Examination held on February 18, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 On the basis of this certification, it was deduced that respondent 
submitted a spurious certificate of eligibility and made a false entry 
in his Personal Data Sheet. </p>
  <p>Hence, on June 22, 1998, the Hearing Officer of the CSC-OLA 
recommended that respondent be dismissed from government service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This was affirmed by
 Atty. Nelson Acebedo, Director IV, CSC-OLA, on June 24, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>    </p>
  <p>On August 12, 1998, respondent filed a Petition to transfer 
jurisdiction of the case from the Civil Service Commission to the 
Supreme Court and/or to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> pursuant to CSC 
Memorandum No. 53, Series of 1998, to wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Article VIII, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution 
exclusively 
vests in the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts 
and court personnel, from the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals 
down to the lowest municipal trial court clerk. By virtue of this power,
 it is only the Supreme Court that can oversee the judge’s and court 
personnel’s compliance with all laws, and take the proper administrative
 action against them if they commit any violation thereof. No other 
branch of government may intrude into this power, without running afoul 
of the doctrine of separation of powers. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The CSC-OLA thus referred the case to the Office of the Court
 Administrator (OCA) on August 18, 1998. </p>
  <p>On May 17, 1999, the Office of the Court Administrator 
directed 
respondent to explain in writing why no disciplinary action should be 
taken against him for dishonesty and falsification of public 
documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>In a letter to the Court Administrator dated May 21, 
1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 respondent admitted the charge and asked that the penalty meted him be 
reduced and that he be given another chance to serve the court in order 
to correct his mistake. </p>
  <p>On February 28, 2001, the Court resolved to docket the case 
as a 
regular administrative matter and required the parties to manifest 
whether they were willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis
 of the available records on file.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 On April 10, 2001, the CSC-OLA manifested no objection to docketing of 
the case as a regular administrative matter and submitting the same for 
resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>   
 </p>
  <p>In his Manifestation dated April 11, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 respondent reiterated that he admits the charge against him and pleaded
 for forgiveness. Respondent asked that he be given another chance 
considering that he has served the court for more than twenty (20) years
 and has consistently received performance ratings of “Very 
Satisfactory” and “Outstanding.” Pertinent portions of respondent’s 
Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.  That he admits with so much regret that he indeed 
committed the act complained of; </p>
    <p>2.  That he humbly pleads for forgiveness before this 
Honorable 
Court and he be given another chance to prove his sincerity to correct 
his misdeed and promises that this wrongdoing, although not done in the 
performance of his duties, this will never happen in the future; 
</p>
    <p>3.  That he respectfully informs this Honorable Court that 
he 
served the Court for more than twenty (20) years to the best of his 
ability. In fact, he was given a performance rating of “Very 
Satisfactory” (VS) and “Outstanding,” an indication that he has been 
faithfully performing his job well. (Please see attached supporting 
papers); </p>
    <p>4.  That this is the first Administrative Case filed 
against him; and </p>
    <p>5.  That he respectfully prays for compassionate justice 
before 
this Honorable Court in inflicting a harsh penalty considering the 
future of his children and family depend on his role (sic) financial 
support. </p>
    <p>xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On January 25, 2001, the Office of the Court Administrator 
affirmed
 the findings of the CSC-OLA but recommended suspension for one (1) year
 without pay. In reducing the penalty, the Court Administrator took into
 account - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>xxx    the fact that respondent has already spent more than
 
twenty (20) years of his life in the service of this Court and this is 
his first administrative complaint. It could be that he committed the 
acts complained of out of his desire to be promoted for the benefit of 
his family. Respondent’s admission and prayer for forgiveness is a good 
sign that he is indeed remorseful for what he did. xxx </p>
    <p>True, respondent deserves to be penalized but the same may 
(sic) 
tempered in the name of compassionate justice. Unlike the respondent in 
A.M. No. 95-1-01-MTCC respondent Sta. Ana did not defraud and prejudice 
the government by his acts. He neither assumed the position he desired 
nor received the compensation and benefits pertaining thereto. 
</p>
    <p>Moreover, it appears that Reynaldo B. Sta. Ana proved to be
 an 
asset of the Leave Division, OAS-OCA. His efficiency is shown by his 
performance ratings xxx. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public 
Officials and
 Employees, Republic Act 6713, enunciates the State’s policy of 
promoting a high standard of ethics and utmost responsibility in the 
public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> And no 
other office in the government service exacts a greater demand for moral
 righteousness and uprightness from an employee than in the 
judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>    
</p>
  <p>Every employee of the judiciary should be an example of 
integrity, uprightness and honesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the conduct of court 
personnel, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, must always 
be beyond reproach and must be circumscribed with the heavy burden of 
responsibility as to let them be free from any suspicion that may taint 
the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 The Court 
condemns and would never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the
 part of all those involved in the administration of justice which would
 violate the norm of public accountability and diminish or even just 
tend to diminish the faith of the people in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, respondent failed to live up to this standard 
of conduct. </p>
  <p>One of the supporting documents respondent appended to his 
application for promotion to HRMO III was a certificate of eligibility 
purportedly issued by the Civil Service Commission certifying that he 
passed the career service professional examination on February 18, 1996 
with a rating of 83.8%. In his personal data sheet, respondent also 
stated that he passed the said examination on the same date and with the
 same rating. However, upon examination of the records of the 
Examination and Placement Services Division (EPSD) of the Civil Service 
Commission, it was disclosed that petitioner’s name was not in the list 
of those who passed the said examination held at Ramon Magsaysay High 
School on February 18, 1996. This belied respondent’s statement in his 
personal data sheet and led to the inevitable conclusion that respondent
 submitted a false certificate of eligibility. </p>
  <p>Under Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code, the elements of 
the 
crime of “use of falsified documents” are (1) that the offender knew 
that document was falsified by another person; (2) that the false 
document is embraced in Art. 171 or in any subdivisions 1 or 2 of Art. 
172; (3) that he used such document (not in judicial proceedings); and 
(4) that the use of the false document caused damage to another or at 
least it was used with intent to cause such damage. </p>
  <p>It cannot be gainsaid that respondent was well aware that the
 
certificate of eligibility he submitted was false because he knew for a 
fact that he did not pass the career service examination. It is, 
likewise, undeniable that his use of such false document in support of 
his promotion to HRMO III prejudiced the other applicants who were 
genuinely qualified for the position. Then Chief Justice Andres Narvasa 
had already issued his official appointment, even though he neither 
assumed the position nor received the compensation and benefits 
pertaining thereto. </p>
  <p>Respondent’s act of indicating in his personal data sheet 
that he 
passed that career service professional examination when in fact he did 
not, also makes him liable for falsification of a document by making an 
untruthful statement in a narration of facts, as defined under Art. 171,
 par. 4, of the Revised Penal Code. In falsification by false narration 
of facts, (1) the offender makes untruthful statements in a narration of
 facts; (2) he has a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts
 narrated by him; (3) the facts narrated are absolutely false; and (4) 
it was made with a wrongful intent to injure a third person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>    </p>
  <p>Respondent stated in his personal data sheet that he passed 
the 
career service professional examination knowing fully well that it was 
not true because he did not pass the said exam. Being an aspirant for 
promotion to a higher position, he had a legal obligation to disclose 
the truth because the personal data sheet is required in connection with
 the promotion to a higher position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In the case of <em>Inting vs. 
Tanodbayan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 the Court ruled that “the accomplishment of the Personal Data Sheet 
being a requirement under the Civil Service Rules and Regulations in 
connection with employment in the government, the making of an 
untruthful statement therein was therefore intimately connected with 
such employment xxx.” In <em>Belosillo vs. 
Rivera</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 we said that since “truthful completion of Personal Data Sheet is a 
requirement for employment in the Judiciary, the importance of answering
 the same with candor need not be gainsaid.”    </p>
  <p>By making a false statement in his personal data sheet to 
enhance 
his qualification and increase his chances of being considered for 
promotion, which in fact happened because he was issued an appointment 
as HRMO III by then Chief Justice Andres Narvasa, respondent prejudiced 
the other qualified aspirants to the same position. It does not matter 
that respondent did not actually assume the position and receive 
salaries and benefits pertaining thereto. The law does not require that 
actual injury to a third person be present. What is necessary is that 
there be intent to injure. Moreover, in People vs. Po Giok To,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 it is held that when official documents are falsified, “the intent to 
injure a third person need not be present because the principal thing 
punished is the violation of the public faith and the destruction of the
 truth as therein proclaimed.”    </p>
  <p>The facts and evidence, coupled with respondent’s admission, 
sufficiently established his culpability. Respondent’s use of a false 
certificate of eligibility constitutes an act of dishonesty under civil 
service rules and his act of making a false statement in his personal 
data sheet renders him administratively liable for falsification. Under 
Section 23, Rule XIV of the Administrative Code of 1987, dishonesty 
(par. a) and falsification (par. f) are considered grave offenses 
warranting the penalty of dismissal from service upon commission of the 
first offense. </p>
  <p>On numerous occasions, the Court did not hesitate to impose 
such extreme punishment on employees found guilty of these 
offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 There is no reason why respondent should be treated differently. The 
Court takes note of the fact that initially, respondent did not 
controvert this evidence against him. Neither did he admit the charge. 
In fact, deliberately or otherwise, respondent did not participate in 
the proceedings before the CSC. He did not file any answer and failed to
 appear in the scheduled hearings despite due notice. When he was found 
guilty of the charge by the CSC-OLA and was recommended for dismissal, 
he filed a petition to transfer jurisdiction to the Office of the Court 
Administrator and/or motion to dismiss the case. It was only when his 
case was transferred to the OCA did he confess his guilt, more than 
three years after he was first charged in the CSC. </p>
  <p>While we recognize that respondent committed the acts 
complained of
 out of an extreme desire to be promoted for the benefit of his family, 
the Court cannot turn a blind eye to what is clearly a transgression of 
the law. Dishonesty and falsification are malevolent acts that have no 
place in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> 
Because of his conduct, the Court seriously doubts respondent’s ability 
to perform his duties with the integrity, uprightness and honesty 
demanded of an employee in the judiciary. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, respondent Reynaldo 
B. Sta. Ana is 
hereby DISMISSED from the service with prejudice to re-employment in any
 government agency and government-owned or controlled corporation, and 
with forfeiture of unused leaves, if any, and retirement benefits. This 
decision shall take effect immediately. </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED. </p>
