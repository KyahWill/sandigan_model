<p class="BODY">In an Information filed by Public Prosecutor Reynaldo R. Guayco
it was alleged that in the evening of 26 April 1995 at Sitio Balikbitin, San
Nicolas, Coron, Palawan, the accused Ronilo Ferrera "who is the victim's
father and who exercises parental authority over her, with lewd design, and
with force, threat and intimidation through the use of a fan knife x x x
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own
daughter, one MELANIE C. FERRERA, 13 years old, against her will and
consent."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 August 2000 the Regional Trial Court of Puerto Princesa
City found accused-appellant Ronilo Ferrera guilty of qualified rape and
sentenced him to death.  He was also
ordered to pay his victim, his own daughter, <s>P</s>75,000.00 as civil
indemnity and <s>P</s>50,000.00 as moral damages, and to pay the costs.  </p>

<p class="BODY">Melanie was born on 1 January 1982, the eldest of three (3)
children of Ronilo Ferrera and Lita Cabagay.  Ronilo and Lita separated when Melanie was still an infant so little
Melanie lived with her paternal grandmother, Esmeralda Ferrera, in Barangay
Alilay, Bungabong, Oriental Mindoro.  In
May 1992 when Melanie was about ten and a-half years old accused-appellant
brought her to Sitio Balikbitin, San Nicolas, Coron, Palawan, to live with him
and his common-law wife Analy Alfonso, together with their three (3) children. </p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 April 1995 at about 6 o’clock in the evening Ronilo
together with his now thirteen (13)-year old Melanie was at the house of his
cousin Pablo Rey, Jr., who at the time was having a drinking spree with two (2)
companions.  They were joined in by
Ronilo.  While waiting for her father,
Melanie went to the house of Pancho Viongan, a neighbor of Pablo, to watch a <i style="">betamax </i>movie.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around 9:30 in the evening, Ronilo and Melanie left for
home.  On their way, he told her that
they would rest first in the small hut along the way instead of proceeding
straight to their house.  Melanie
objected so she continued walking only to be berated by Ronilo who then
forcibly dragged her on the side of the road until they reached the
bridge.  Ronilo undressed her and forced
her to lie on the ground.  He also took
off his clothes and poking a knife at the waist of Melanie copulated with her,
after which they proceeded home to Sitio Balikbitin. </p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning Melanie reported the incident to her
stepmother but the latter took no heed, so she sought the help of her uncle
Pablo Rey, Jr., and together they brought the matter to the police.  She underwent medical examination and the
result indicated that she suffered new hymenal lacerations at 3 o’clock, 7 o’clock
and 11 o’clock positions.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Denying that he raped his daughter, accused-appellant claimed
that on the night of the 26 April 1995, at about the time of the incident for
which he was charged, he was a chainsaw operator in Barangay Torda which was
some three (3) hours away by boat.  He
maintained that the charges against him were filed upon the instigation of his
cousin Pablo Rey, Jr. who had quarreled with him earlier.  Ronilo admitted though that Melanie was his
daughter and that when the crime was supposed to have been committed she was
thirteen (13)- years old.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant, in his Brief, no longer questions his
conviction for rape but prays that his sentence be reduced to <i style="">reclusion perpetua</i> in view of the
failure of the prosecution to prove the minority of his daughter with
sufficient evidence within the purview of current jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the contention meritorious.  Although the Information alleged both the relationship of the
offender to the victim and her minority when she was raped, the prosecution did
not offer any other evidence, documentary or otherwise, to prove her actual
age.  The fact that accused-appellant
admitted that the victim was his daughter and that she was only thirteen (13)-
years old at the time of the rape is not sufficient for purposes of convicting
him of qualified rape.  The qualifying
circumstances of relationship and minority must not only be concurrently and
specifically alleged in the Information but must likewise be proved beyond
reasonable doubt.  Even if the defense
did not contest the minority of the victim, it is still incumbent upon the
prosecution to prove her age with absolute certainty.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, no independent evidence was presented by the prosecution to
establish the minority of the victim, e.g., a duly authenticated Certificate of
Live Birth, Baptismal Certificate, school records, or any other authentic
document proving her age.  Hence, we
have no alternative but to hold accused-appellant liable for simple rape and
not qualified rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court observes that even the trial court failed to make a
categorical finding on the age of Melanie.  It imposed the death penalty only on the basis of the admission of
accused-appellant that Melanie was thirteen (13)- years old at the time of the
commission of the crime.  Thus -</p>

<blockquote>Although the Live Birth Certificate of the victim was not presented
in Court, the age and paternity of the victim was admitted by the accused in
open Court when clarificatory question was propounded by the Court where
accused declared (TSN-EAP, page 6 and 9, 2000) - </blockquote>

<blockquote>Q – What is your relationship with the victim?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A – My daughter, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q – How old is your daughter when she filed a case against you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A – Thirteen (13) Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having been proven that the victim Melanie Ferrera is (sic) 13
years old at the time of the commission of the crime and that the accused
Ronilo Ferrera is the natural father of the victim, this Court has no
alternative but to impose what is provided from what the law commands x x x x<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The life of the accused cannot be made to depend on mere
conjectures or surmises.  Considering
the severity of the penalty involved, courts must take an extremely careful
stance in assessing the evidence presented.  All the elements of the crime as well as every qualifying circumstance must
be established beyond reasonable doubt.  By soliciting an admission from the accused as regards the minority of
his victim and thereafter imposing the death penalty based solely on his
admission is tantamount to pretending to guide him along a dark tunnel only to
lead him directly into the lion’s den.  This cannot be tolerated in our criminal jurisdiction.  After all, in criminal cases, all doubts are
still resolved in favor of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt
the minority of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime bars the
conviction of accused-appellant for qualified rape.  Thus, the proper penalty to be imposed upon him is only <i style="">reclusion perpetua, </i>not death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, the aggravating circumstance of relationship was
duly established.  The Information
expressly alleged that accused-appellant was the father of the victim and that
he himself admitted this in open court.  The aggravating circumstance of relationship having been satisfactorily
alleged and proved, exemplary damages in the amount of <s>P</s>20,000.00, in
addition to the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded by trial court, may
also be properly granted to the victim in line with prevailing jurisprudence.<i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED
with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant RONILO FERRERA is found guilty of
Simple Rape, not Qualified Rape, and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i style="">Reclusion Perpetua</i>, instead of Death. <i style="">  </i>The
award of <s>P</s>75,000.00 as civil indemnity and <s>P</s>50,000.00 as moral
damages imposed by trial court is AFFIRMED. In addition, accused-appellant is
further directed to pay Melanie Ferrera <s>P</s>20,000.00 for exemplary
damages.  </p>
