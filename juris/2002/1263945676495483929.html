<p>When the prosecution’s evidence, consisting mainly of the 
complainant’s 
testimony, fails the test of moral certainty demanded by the law and the

the accused must be acquitted. It then becomes this Court’s duty to 
uphold the

<p align="center"><strong>The 
Facts<br><em>Version of the 
Prosecution</em></strong></p>
<p>In its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG) summarized the facts in the following 
manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Private complainant Yolanda Fernandez is the illegitimate 
daughter of 
appellant Ernesto Fernandez and Percilita Garcia. Percilita Garcia, on 
the other 
hand, is appellant’s step-daughter, being the daughter of his common-law
 wife 
Espirita Costales with her first husband, who was then living with 
appellant in 
Namonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union, when she was raped and impregnated by 
appellant. On October 10, 1982, Percilita Garcia, who was then 18 years 
old, 
gave birth out of wedlock to appellant’s child, complainant Yolanda 
Fernandez, 
in appellant’s house in Namonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union. After giving 
birth to 
Yolanda, Percilita went to live in her brother Ernesto Garcia’s house, 
also in 
Namonitan, until she went to Manila in 1984 and stayed there for good, 
leaving 
Yolanda to the care and custody of appellant and her mother 
Esperita.</p>
<p>“Since birth, Yolanda lived with her father, appellant Ernesto 
Fernandez, and 
her grandmother Espirita Costales, appellant’s common-law wife, in 
appellant’s 
house in Namonitan, Sto. Tomas, La Union. She went to school at Cupang 
Elementary School in Namonitan, which was a walking distance from their 
house. 
She was in Grade V when she was serially raped by [her] father, 
appellant 
Ernesto Fernandez, inside their house starting October 2, 1995, which 
forced her 
to quit schooling. At the time, Yolanda was twelve (12) going [on] 
thirteen (13) 
years old, and was living in the house of appellant together with 
appellant, her 
grandmother Espirita Costales and her 5-year old sister Catherine 
Fernan[d]ez 
who is also appellant and Percilita’s daughter. Previous to these rape 
incidents, appellant had started abusing Yolanda as early as when she 
was five 
(5) years old by touching her breasts and other parts of the body. 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">“THE FIRST RAPE (Criminal Case No. 
A-3177)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On October 2, 1995 at about 6:00 o’clock in the evening, 
Yolanda was sitting 
in the sala of their house when appellant came near her. Just the two 
[of] them 
were in the house at the time, because her grandmother and Catherine 
were out 
selling fish. Appellant pulled her by the arm to her room which was 
located 
south of the sala of the house. As he pulled her towards her room, he 
warned her 
not to tell anyone. When they got inside the room, appellant undressed 
her, by 
removing first her T-shirt, then her short pants, then her panty and 
bra. She 
tried to fight back, boxed his back, and tried to run away but appellant
 caught 
her and laid her down on her bed. After laying her down on the bed, he 
kissed 
her cheeks, her lips and on her breasts; touched her body and her 
private parts 
with his hand; then he held his penis, opened her legs wide and inserted
 his 
penis into her vagina, and made pumping motions for a while. She felt 
pain in 
her anybody [sic] because he would kill her, and then he left. She then 
put her 
clothes on. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">“THE SECOND RAPE (Criminal Case No. 
A-3274)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On October 3, 1995, at about 7:00 o’clock in the morning, 
while Yolanda was 
alone at the kitchen of their house washing the dishes, appellant 
arrived and 
pulled her inside his own room. There, he removed her dress (bestida), 
her bra 
and her panty, and laid her to his bed. She tried to run away but he 
caught her. 
He then laid her down on his bed and thereupon, inserted his penis and 
had 
sexual intercourse with her. She felt pain inside her vagina. While 
doing the 
act, appellant kissed her breasts, cheeks and lips. After the 
intercourse, 
appellant warned her that he would kill her should she report what 
happened, 
then he left.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">“THE THIRD RAPE (Criminal Case No. 
A-3275)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On October 4, 1995, at about 6:00 o’clock in the morning, 
Yolanda was 
sweeping in the house when appellant kissed her all over her body and 
then 
pulled her to her room. Only she and the appellant were in the house at 
the 
time. Once inside her room, appellant removed first her skirt, then her 
blouse 
and then her bra and panty. When she was totally naked, he [lay] her 
down on the 
bed. Despite her resistance by pushing him away, appellant again 
succeeded in 
inserting his penis inside her vagina. He also kissed her. She felt pain
 in her 
vagina and in her breasts as he did the pumping motion. After the 
intercourse, 
appellant warned her, that he would kill her; then, he 
left.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">“THE FOURTH RAPE (Criminal Case No. 
A-3276)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On October 15, 1995, at about 7:00 o’clock in the morning, 
Yolanda was 
sitting alone in the kitchen of their house, as her grandmother and 
sister 
Catherine had already left to sell fish, when appellant approached and 
pulled 
her towards her room. She tried to resist but he was very strong in 
pulling her. 
Once they got inside her room, appellant embraced her, kissed her cheeks
 and 
mashed her breasts. Then he undressed her and laid her on the bed. He 
again 
warned her not to reveal it to anybody, or he would kill her. Then he 
placed 
himself on top of her, inserted his penis inside her vagina and made a 
pumping 
motion. She felt pain in her vagina. It took appellant a few minutes to 
stay on 
top of her. After consummating the sexual act, appellant left. Yolanda 
remained 
inside their house.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">“THE FIFTH RAPE (Criminal Case No. 
A-3277)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After October 15, 1995, Yolanda was raped again and again, the
 dates and the 
number of times she could no longer remember nor recall. Even after she 
was 
already pregnant with appellant’s child, appellant still kept on raping 
her. On 
July 3, 1996, she gave birth in their house to appellant’s child, a baby
 girl 
whom they named Marimar Fernandez.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
(Citations omitted)</p></blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong>Version of the 
Defense</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, appellant’s version of the facts is as 
follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The defense presented the oral testimonies of Winifreda Butay 
and Ernesto 
Fernandez.</p>
<p>“The first witness, Winifreda Butay, is a Chief of Police of 
Burgos, La 
Union. Before she became Chief of Police of Burgos, La Union, she was 
assigned 
at the Women’s Desk of San Fernando, La Union. On July 1997, she 
accompanied an 
insane victim of a vehicular accident to the DSWD Substitute Home Care 
for Women 
in Urayong, Bauang, La Union. While she was there, Yolanda Fernandez 
approached 
her and introduced herself that she was from San Fernando, La Union. She
 asked 
Yolanda why she was there and the latter informed her that she was taken
 by the 
DSWD and NBI because she filed a rape case against her father. When she 
asked 
why she filed a rape case Yolanda answered that it was her mother who 
instructed 
her to reveal that it was her father who raped her. She asked why, and 
Yolanda 
said that her parents were quarreling. She further inquired as to who 
raped 
Yolanda. The latter answered that it was her boyfriend, Jonathan Camiro.
 She 
said that when Yolanda was confiding to her, two (2) personnel of the 
DSWD were 
listening to their conversation. The said personnel were Remelie 
Guillermo and 
Edwina Masi. While she was talking with Yolanda, the two (2) approached 
them and 
said that Yolanda gave them the same story. She again asked Yolanda who 
raped 
her and why she filed a case against her own father. She gave the same 
answer 
that her mother taught her what to say and that it was her boyfriend who
 
impregnated her. During that time, the two (2) DSWD personnel were still
 
listening. She told the DSWD about the case and she was informed that 
the DSWD 
already sen[t] a written communication to the NBI, but the NBI, however,
 didn’t 
respond. She said that she received a letter from the mother of Yolanda 
prohibiting her from talking to or visiting Yolanda.</p>
<p>“The last witness, Ernesto Fernandez, is the accused[.] He 
admitted that he 
is the father of the alleged victim but said that Catherine is not [his]
 
daughter because Percy gave birth in Manila. He denied vehemently the 
rape 
charges filed against him but admitted that he tied Yolanda to a mango 
tree to 
force her to admit as to who impregnated her. However, he denied kicking
 her 
abdomen to abort the baby. The uncle of Yolanda talked to her and the 
latter 
admitted to her uncle that it was Jonathan Camiro who got her pregnant. 
Upon 
knowing this, he asked a Barangay councilman to talk to the father of 
Jonathan, 
but the latter denied that he impregnated Yolanda. During the dates of 
the 
alleged rapes, he was working at San Fernando, Pampanga. On June 26, 
1996, the 
DSWD personnel and the assigned NBI Agent went to their house to get 
Yolanda, 
whom he voluntarily allowed to go with them. He didn’t know where they 
brought 
Yolanda. He only came to know that a complaint was filed against him 
when he 
received a subpoena requiring him to file a counter-affidavit which he 
identified in open court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Citations 
omitted)</p></blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong>Ruling of the Trial 
Court</strong></p>
<p>The RTC gave full credence to the testimony of complainant, 
noting that “she 
narrated the circumstances before, during and after the alleged rape in a
 
positive and straightforward manner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
On her part, no ill motive for accusing her own father of the crime of 
rape was 
found by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p>
<p>Having accepted complainant’s testimony, the RTC ruled that 
appellant had 
indeed succeeded in having carnal knowledge of his daughter who, at the 
time of 
the rape, was under eighteen years of age. It sentenced him to death, 
one each 
for the five (5) counts of rape he had been charged with.</p>
<p>Hence, this automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Issues</strong></p>
<p>In his Brief, appellant faults the RTC with this lone 
assignment of 
error:</p>
<p>“The lower court gravely erred in imposing the death penalty 
upon 
accused-appellant despite the failure of the prosecution to prove the 
real age 
of the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Court’s 
Ruling</strong></p>
<p>The appeal is meritorious; the prosecution’s evidence does not 
pass the test 
of moral certainty. Hence, appellant must be acquitted.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Main 
Issue:<br><em>Sufficiency of Prosecution 
Evidence</em></strong></p>
<p>Appellant did not raise the sufficiency of the prosecution’s 
evidence as an 
issue. This Court, however, looked into it motu proprio, consistent with
 the 
principle that an appeal in a criminal action opens the whole case for 
review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p>
<p>Any review of a rape case begins with the settled reality that 
accusing a 
person of this crime can be done with facility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, the testimony of the 
complainant 
must always be scrutinized with great caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It may not be easy for her to prove
 the 
commission of rape; yet, it is even more difficult for the accused, 
though 
innocent, to disprove his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This 
principle must be viewed in relation to that which holds that the 
evidence for 
the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits; it cannot draw 
strength 
from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p>
<p>To be sure, it is the primordial duty of the prosecution to 
present its side 
with clarity and persuasion, so that conviction becomes the only logical
 and 
inevitable conclusion. What is required of it is to justify the 
conviction of 
the accused with moral certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 
Upon the prosecution’s failure to meet this test, acquittal becomes the 
constitutional duty of the Court, lest its mind be tortured with the 
thought 
that it has imprisoned an innocent man for the rest of his life<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or, worse -- as in 
this case -- put him 
to death.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Complainant’s Dubious 
Testimony</strong></p>
<p>The court <em>a quo</em> describes the testimony of
 the victim as “positive, 
straightforward, explicit and spontaneous”;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> hence, sufficient to convict 
appellant of 
rape. This Court believes otherwise.</p>
<p>We are not unmindful of the general rule that the findings of 
the trial court 
regarding the credibility of witnesses are generally accorded great 
respect and 
even finality on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> However, 
this principle does not preclude a reevaluation of the evidence to 
determine 
whether material facts or circumstances have been overlooked or 
misinterpreted 
by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In the past, we 
have not hesitated to reverse judgments of conviction, where there were 
strong 
indications pointing to the possibility that the rape charge was 
false.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></sup></p>
<p>After a judicious examination of complainant’s testimony, which
 is the main 
evidence for the allegation of rape, we cannot subscribe to the RTC’s 
assessment 
of it as straightforward and unwavering. Quite the contrary, we believe 
that no 
conviction can arise from it on the following grounds.</p>
<p>
</p><ol><li><strong>Unreliability 
<p></p></strong>
<p>Complainant testified that the first incident of rape happened 
on October 2, 
1995, at 6:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>But on 
cross-examination, she testified that on the afternoon of that day, she 
went out 
to fetch her <em>Inang</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It would 
have been a simple matter to reconcile these two events, if complainant 
simply 
clarified that one happened after the other. Surprisingly, during her 
direct 
examination, she did not even remember that she had gone out to pick up 
her 
<em>Inang</em> that afternoon.</p>
<p>What baffles this Court is the fact that complainant was sure 
of the time of 
the alleged rape; she was likewise sure of the time her 
<em>Inang</em> 
arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> But 
the girl could not 
remember what time she had gone out to fetch her grandmother. 
Complainant could 
have easily estimated the time she had done so, if indeed the events 
transpired 
as she recounted them, because one event logically followed the 
other.</p>
<p>The same recall selectiveness is repeated in her testimony as 
to the alleged 
second and third incidents of rape. On direct examination, she claimed 
that on 
October 3, 1995, she was raped for the second time at 7:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></sup> 
But on cross-examination, she said that she had just left her 
<em>Inang</em> at 
that same time in the place where the latter was to get a ride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As to the third 
incident of rape 
allegedly committed on October 4, 1995, complainant testified that she 
was raped 
at 6:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> 
Again, on 
cross-examination, she declared that at that very same time, she and her
 sister 
Catherine had brought their <em>Inang</em> to the place 
where the old lady would 
get a ride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p>
<p>As before, following the narration of events given by 
complainant, one can 
logically infer that after the rape, she accompanied her grandmother up 
to the 
place where the latter would get a ride; or the other way around -- 
after 
fetching her <em>Inang</em>, she returned home and was 
raped. However, 
complainant could make no such connection between the two events. The 
only way 
to reconcile these events is to suppose that they happened in 
succession, but 
her failure to recall a closely connected sequence of events immediately
 
preceding or succeeding the supposed rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> casts doubt on the veracity of her 
statements and erodes her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p>
<p>The pattern that emerged was that when defense counsel made no 
reference to 
the supposed rape incident, she became unsure whether her testimony 
during 
direct examination on the alleged rape coincided with the times of the 
activities she mentioned at the latter portion of the 
cross-examination.</p>
<p>These discrepancies were material. Yet, they were not explained
 in the direct 
or redirect examinations even when the trial was continued on succeeding
 dates. 
Neither were they discussed in the Decision of the trial 
court.</p>
<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Inconsistency 
<p></p></strong>
<p>A careful analysis of the testimony of complainant will reveal 
that she kept 
on giving statements that were inconsistent or contradictory.</p>
<p><em>First, </em>she testified that she stopped 
schooling in October 1995, 
because her stomach was already bulging due to her pregnancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>She categorically 
declared that she became 
pregnant because appellant had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> But later, still on direct examination, 
she averred that she was raped for the first time on October 2, 1995. 
She 
testified:</p>
<p>“Q When for the first time did this Ernesto Fernandez [rape] 
you?<br>A 
October 2, sir.</p>
<p>Q What year?<br>A In 1995, sir.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p>
<p align="center">x x x x x x x x x</p>
<p>“Q But you claimed that he only raped you for the first time on
 October 2, 
1995?<br>A Yes, sir.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p>
<p>It bewilders this Court how she could have stopped schooling in
 October 1995 
due to her pregnancy, which allegedly resulted from the first instance 
of rape 
committed by appellant, also in October of that same year. She said, in 
fact, 
that her stomach was already “bulging”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> at this time. If such were the case, then 
not only did her pregnancy occur simultaneously with the first rape but,
 more 
incredibly, her pregnancy <em>preceded </em>the 
rape.</p>
<p><em>Second,</em> in her testimony she alleged that 
at the time of the second 
rape, she was on her way to school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> 
This allegation contradicted her earlier statements, during both the 
direct and 
the redirect examinations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> that she 
had already stopped schooling on October 2, 1995.</p>
<p><em>Third,</em> when asked by the public prosecutor
 what she did after that 
rape, she said that “she left their house to go to her Uncle 
Boyet.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> But 
when asked the same question by the 
trial court, again she responded, “I went to school.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p>
<p><em>Fourth,</em> she also said in her testimony 
that on October 4, 1995, she 
was with her sister Catherine when they brought their grandmother to the
 place 
where the woman would get her ride. Almost in the same breath, though, 
complainant said that she and her sister went home. Later, the former 
clarified 
that on that date, she went home while her sister Catherine accompanied 
their 
grandmother in selling fish.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p>
<p></p>
</li><li><strong>Inadequacy 
<p></p></strong>
<p>Showing lack of substance in her testimony, complainant could 
not even relate 
details of the final rape allegedly committed sometime in April 1996. 
Besides 
giving no details, she gave the impression that the occurrence itself 
was 
doubtful. When questioned by the trial court, she testified 
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“COURT QUESTION:</p>
<p>Q. How about in the year 1996, do you remember if you were 
raped by him?<br>A 
No more.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
</li><li>Complainant’s Perfunctory Manner of Testifying
<p></p></li></ol>
<p>Although it is settled that the accused may be convicted of 
rape simply on 
the basis of the complainant’s testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this principle holds true only if such 
testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This requires that the testimony be 
straightforward, clear, positive and convincing.</p>
<p>What particularly caught the Court’s attention was the manner 
in which 
complainant gave her testimony. We note that all the major circumstances
 before, 
during and immediately after the alleged rape were indirectly provided 
by the 
prosecutor through his questions. In fact, when one sifts through the 
testimony 
of complainant, it becomes evident that she simply affirmed, denied or 
supplied 
the missing facts in response to the questions propounded by him. Such 
testimony 
cannot be considered positive or categorical.</p>
<p>Although the trend in procedural law is to give wide latitude 
to the 
questioning of a child witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we 
must not lose track of the basic tenet that the truth must be 
ascertained.</p>
<p>When one scrutinizes the testimony of complainant, one will 
easily notice 
that her manner of testifying seems to be so mechanical that, in the 
alleged 
four instances of rape, both her actuation and that of appellant were 
almost 
always identical. To the Court, her narration seemed to come from 
memorization 
by rote, rather than genuine recollection, and thus sounded perfunctory 
or 
routinary. Moreover, when asked questions on events contemporaneous or 
immediately before or after the alleged rape, she seemed to falter in 
giving 
immediate, positive and categorical responses.</p>
<p>Owing to the character of the crime of rape, the testimony of 
the victim is 
the focal point around which the charges naturally revolve. Therefore, 
the 
degree of reliability, consistency and adequacy of her testimony on 
material 
points -- as well as the very manner in which she gives such testimony 
-- can 
either sustain or negate conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p>
<p><strong><em>Tainted Testimony 
of<br>Complainant’s Mother</em></strong></p>
<p>It is clear that conviction may arise from any categorical and 
consistent 
positive identification, absent any showing of ill motive on the part of
 the 
eyewitness testifying on the matter. In a litany of cases, this Court 
has ruled 
that when there is no showing of any improper motive on the part of the 
victim 
to testify falsely against the accused or to falsely implicate the 
latter in the 
commission of the crime, the logical conclusion is that no such improper
 motive 
exists, and that the testimony is worthy of full faith and 
credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>Further, this Court has reiterated time 
and time again that it is most unlikely for a young girl like 
complainant, or 
even her family, to impute the crime of rape to no less than a relative 
and to 
face social humiliation, if not to vindicate her honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p>
<p>However settled these principles, they do not apply to the case
 at bar. We 
note from Defense Witness Winifreda Butay’s testimony that complainant 
admitted 
to having been instructed by her mother to testify to having been raped 
by the 
father. We also had the occasion to examine the testimony of 
complainant’s 
mother, who openly testified how she herself had allegedly been raped by
 
appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> 
Without passing judgment 
on that incident, we note the animosity she felt towards him. The 
mother’s ill 
motive clearly supported Butay’s testimony that complainant had accused 
her 
father of raping her after being coached by her own mother to do so. 
This point 
will be discussed shortly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Unrebutted Testimony 
of<br>Credible Defense 
Witness</strong></em></p>
<p>Most damaging to the cause of the prosecution was the testimony
 referred to 
above -- that of Defense Witness Winifreda Butay, a police officer 
assigned to 
the Women’s Desk of Burgos, La Union. In July 1997, she accompanied 
complainant 
to the DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development) Substitute 
Home Care 
for Women in Urayong, Bauang, La Union. Having had the opportunity to 
interview 
complainant, Butay testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Q And what happened with this Yolanda Fernandez when she saw 
you?<br>A When 
this victim saw me, I ask her from where she is and she told me that 
[she is] 
from Sto. Tomas, La Union.</p>
<p>Q What happened next?<br>A I asked her name and she 
uttered Yolanda 
Fernandez.</p>
<p>Q After she told you her name, what happened next?<br>A I
 inquired from 
her.</p>
<p>Q What did you inquire from her?<br>A I inquired from 
her, what happened to 
her.</p>
<p>Q And what was the answer of Yolanda Fernandez?<br>A She 
was taken by the 
DSWD and NBI for them to [take] care of her or custody of her and she 
told me 
also that she filed a case [of rape] against her father, Ernesto 
Fernandez.</p>
<p>Q And when she told you tha[t], what happened or what did you 
do?<br>A I 
asked her, why she filed a case against her father and she told me that 
her 
mother taught her that she will tell that her father was the one who 
raped 
her.</p>
<p>Q And did you ask her why did her mother [teach] her to file a 
case against 
her father?</p>
<p>PROS. CATBAGAN: </p>

hearsay.</p></blockquote>
<p>COURT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Objection over[r]uled, that is a 
conversation.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was the answer?<br>A She told me that her mother and
 father are 
quar[r]eling.</p>
<p>Q Could you quote the exact Ilocano dialect before this Court 
[what] she told 
you?<br>A Yes sir.</p>
<p>Q What was it?<br>A I ask[ed] her ‘Apay nga indarum mo ni
 tatang mo ti rape’ 
(Why did you charge your father with rape) and she answered ‘Isumet 
ngamin ti 
inbaga ni Nanang ko’, nga idarum ko ni tatang ko ti rape’, and after 
that I 
ask[ed] her did your father rape you and she said no and then I asked 
her again 
who is then the person who raped you, she answered ‘didiay nobyok’ (my 
boyfriend). </p>
<p>Q Did you [ask] her the name of her suitor?<br>A Yes 
sir.</p>
<p>Q And what was the answer that was revealed?<br>A My 
boyfriend Jonathan 
Camiro.</p>
<p>Q And what else did she [reveal] to you regarding Jonathan 
Camiro?<br>A I 
asked he[r], is it not true that he was the one who raped you.</p>
<p>Q And what was the answer of Yolanda Fernandez?<br>A He 
was the one.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="center">x x x x x x x x x</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Q And what did she say to them<br>A And what she said to
 them she also told 
me.</p>
<p>Q And what is that?<br>A She said: (‘Isu met ti imbaga ni
 Nanangco’) That is 
what my mother said.</p>
<p>Q What [was] Yolanda Fernandez referring to?<br>A Yolanda
 Fernandez told me 
‘that it was not my father who impregnated me’ she said.</p>
<p>Q Did you ask Yolanda Fernandez who impregnated her?<br>A
 Yes, your honor, 
and said: ‘my boyfriend Jonathan Camiro.’</p>
<p>Q Where [were] these two DSWD [personnel] when Yolanda 
Fernandez told you 
that?<br>A They were in front of me, your honor.</p>
<p>Q How far Madam witness?<br>A This far, sir. (Witness is 
pointing to one-half 
meter).</p>
<p>Q Did you ask Yolanda Fernandez if she was actually raped by 
[her] 
father?<br>A Yes, and she told me again: ’Saan nga ni tatangco ti 
nangsicog 
caniac.’ (It was not my father who made me pregnant).</p>
<p>Q Did you ever ask her why she filed the case against her 
father?<br>A Yes, 
your honor. </p>
<p>Q And what was the answer?<br>A I asked her: ‘why then 
did you file a case 
against your father or why is it [that it is] your father whom you 
charged?’ 
(Apay ngarud nga ni tatangmo ti indarum mo?).</p>
<p>Q And what was the answer?<br>A Yes, because that is what
 my mother told me 
(Wen ta isu met ngarud ti imbaga ni nanangco cania).</p>
<p>Q Did you ask her why her mother want[s] her to charge Ernesto 
Fernandez?<br>A Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Q And what was the answer?<br>A She told me in Ilocano 
again. (Wen ta 
agap-apada). Yes because they are quarreling.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>We find no logical reason for Witness Butay to testify falsely.
 The public 
prosecutor tried to discredit her by implying that there was a friendly 
relationship between her and appellant. However, no concrete proof 
showing that 
her testimony was biased was ever presented.</p>
<p>Granting for the sake of argument that there was a friendly 
relationship 
between Butay and appellant, it did not impair or in any way affect the 
weight 
of her testimony. We have often held that the relationship of a witness 
with the 
accused does not automatically affect the veracity of the former’s 
testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> 
Friendship alone, even if 
true, is not reason enough to discredit and label Butay’s testimony as 
biased 
and unworthy of credence.</p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Epilogue</strong></em></p>
<p>Given
 the foregoing findings, we are not concluding that complainant has not 
been a victim of rape, or that appellant’s defense of alibi and denial 
can be 
given full faith and credence. We only stress that her testimony was 
unable to 
pass the exacting test of moral certainty that the law demands and the 
rules 
require to satisfy the prosecution’s burden of overcoming appellant’s 
presumption of innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p>
<p>A conviction in a criminal case must be supported by proof 
beyond reasonable 
doubt -- moral certainty that the accused is guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The defense may be 
weak, but the 
prosecution is even weaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> As a 
result of this finding, it will be unnecessary to discuss the other 
issues 
raised.</p>
<p>The Court has aptly said: “It is better to liberate a guilty 
man than to 
unjustly keep in prison one whose guilt has not been proved by the 
required 
quantum of evidence. Hence, despite the Court’s support of ardent 
crusaders 
waging all-out war against felons on the loose, when the People’s 
evidence fails 
to prove indubitably the accused’s authorship of the crime of which they
 stand 
accused, it is the Court’s duty -- and the accused’s right -- to 
proclaim their 
innocence. Acquittal, therefore, is in order.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p>
