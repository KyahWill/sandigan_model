In turn, her aunt told their other relatives what happened. They accompanied Rea to report the rape incidents to the police authorities at Barangay Mayamot. On January 21, 1995, Rea executed her sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> narrating how she was raped. </p> <p>Afterwards, Rea submitted herself for medical examination to Dr. Jesusa N. Vergara, the medico-legal officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Service (PNPCLS). The Medico-Legal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated January 23, 1995 prepared by Dr. Vergara states that Rea’s “vagina had a deep healed laceration at 6 o’clock, and shallow healed lacerations at the 3 and 9 o’clock positions;”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and that she was “in a non-virgin state physically.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p> <p>On the other hand, the accused-appellant denied raping Rea. Through his evidence, he sought to prove that he was imprisoned between 1982 and 1992 for killing a person in Divisoria. After his release from prison, he returned home and supported his family. While he was imprisoned, however, his wife’s sisters took care of Rea and the latter’s sisters. For such reason, his wife’s sisters harbored ill-feeling towards him and orchestrated the filing of the rape charges against him. </p> <p>On July 7, 1997, the trial court rendered the Joint Decision mentioned at the outset hereof, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p> <blockquote> <p>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Baltazar Cesista y Hagunoy GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE in Criminal Case No. 95-11972 and Criminal Case No. 95-11973, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH in each case, to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P50,000.00 also in each case, and to pay the costs. </p> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>The accused-appellant now comes before us with the following assignment of errors: </p> <blockquote> <p align="center">I. </p> <p>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED RAPE VICTIM, REA CESISTA, NOTWITHSTANDING HER LACK OF CREDIBILITY. </p> <p align="center">II. </p> <p>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED APPELLANT OF TWO (2) COUNTS OF RAPE AND SENTENCING HIM TO DEATH DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>The accused-appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he raped Rea on two occasions. </p> <p>The contention is devoid of merit. </p> <p>To begin with, based on the prosecution’s evidence and as correctly found by the trial court, the crimes charged in the two informations have been sufficiently established beyond reasonable doubt. </p> <p>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the applicable law at the time the acts of rape were committed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> provides: </p> <blockquote> <p>Art. 335. <em>When and how rape is committed.</em>—Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: </p> <p>1.

Her account of how he raped her was straightforward, detailed, consistent on all material points and convincing, both in her Sworn Statement and testimony in the trial court. <br> In her Sworn Statement, Rea unequivocally declared the following: </p> <blockquote> <p>05. T: Bakit mo naman gustong ireklamo ang tatay mong si Baltazar Cesista? </p> <blockquote> <p>S: Dahil po sa ako ay kanyang pinag-samantalahan. </p> </blockquote> <p>06.

It is well-settled that findings of fact of the trial judge who tried the case and heard the witnesses should not be disturbed on appeal and should be given considerable weight and respect especially on the credibility of witnesses, since he was in a better position to decide the question having heard and observed the demeanor attitude, conduct and deportment of witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p> <p>Also, it is quite clear that the accused-appellant used intimidation, threat and force on Rea when he raped her twice in September, 1994. </p> <blockquote> <p>. . . Intimidation, which includes coercion is a relative term, depending on the difference in age, size and strength of the parties, and their relationship. It can be addressed to the mind as ell. For rape to exist, it is not necessary that the force or intimidation employed be so great or be of such character that it can not be resisted. It is only necessary that the force or intimidation be sufficient to consummate the purpose of the accused. Intimidation must be viewed in the light of the victim’s perception and judgment at the time of the rape and not by any hard-and-fast rule. It is, therefore, enough that it produces fear - fear that if the victim does not yield to the bestial demands of the accused, something horrible would happen to her at the moment or thereafter, as when she is threatened with death if she should report the incident. Intimidation would explain the absence of any sign of struggle, which would otherwise indicate that the victim fought or tried to fight off her attacker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Here, as Rea’s father, the accused-appellant was able to effectively intimidate and threaten her to submit to his will because he has the moral ascendancy over her. In<em> People v. Dusohan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court held that “because of a father's moral ascendancy over his daughter, the degree of intimidation upon her need not be the same as that required in rape cases committed by an accused who has no filial relations with the victim.” "Physical resistance need not be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim and the latter submits herself against her will to the rapist's embrace because of fear for life and personal safety."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Rea's complete obedience to the accused-appellant's commands, her lack of struggle against him, and her silence despite her sufferings were all caused by her fear of him. In her mind, she was convinced of the danger he presented to her life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p> <p>Likewise, it is settled that "the force necessary in rape is relative, depending on the age, the size and strength of the parties. When applied, such force need not be overpowering or irresistible. What is essential is that the force used is sufficient to consummate the purpose which the offender had in mind, or to bring about the result.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In the instant cases, as unequivocally testified by Rea, whose youth and immaturity are badges of truth and sincerity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> during the time the accused-appellant raped her, she was only fourteen (14) years old. Without doubt, he was able to rape her with impunity because of his physical superiority which physically and mentally overpowered her. </p> <p>Be that as it may, the prosecution need not prove the elements of force and intimidation in the instant cases. Settled is the rule that in rape committed by a father or a person recognized by the victim as her father, the former’s moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p> <p>Moreover, the accused-appellant's assertion that he did not rape Rea is belied by her conduct after the incident. Granting arguendo that it is true that she had freely given herself to him, it would have been quite ridiculous for her (a) to invent a story of multiple incest rape; (b) to subject herself to medical examination; and (c) to narrate said rape incidents to her aunts when she divulged the matter to them, to the police authorities who took her sworn statement, and to the trial court when she gave her testimony therein. Verily, "[n]o young girl would concoct a story of sexual assault, undergo gynecologic examination, subject herself to the trauma and embarrassment of criminal prosecution unless she speaks the truth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p> <p>At any rate, “what is decisive in a rape charge is the complainant’s positive identification of the accused as the malefactor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In the instant cases, we find that Rea's candid and straightforward testimony of how the accused-appellant forced and inserted his penis inside her vagina during the time he raped her, sufficiently established that such acts were done with force, intimidation and against her will. Her testimony is entitled to great weight because she is charging of a heinous crime her own father, and the record is barren of any showing that her motive in testifying against him was other than to protect her honor and bring him to justice for having twice sexually defiled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p> <p>In any case, Dr. Jesusa Vergarra’s testimony, who conducted the medical examination, corroborated Rea's claim that she was raped. The presence of healed laceration in Rea’s hymen indicated that she was no longer a virgin and it is possible that the cause of said laceration is the insertion of a penis in her vagina. Stated differently, the medical evidence, notably the finding of healed lacerations on Rea’s vagina, supports the theory that she had been a victim of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p> <p>It bears stressing that the accused-appellant failed to sufficiently show any improper motive on Rea's part to falsely testify against him. Hence, her testimony is worthy of full faith and credence; and that her only motive can well be to bring him to justice for twice raping her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It taxes our credulity to believe his claim that his wife’s sisters orchestrated the filing of the false charges against him because when he was imprisoned, said sisters had to support his family. Indeed, the alleged grudge that said sisters allegedly held against him appears much too trivial compared to the magnitude of Rea’s accusation against him. It would take a great deal of psychological depravity on Rea’s part to weave, unless true, a tale of rape and drag herself to a possible lifetime of shame. Verily, no woman would concoct a story of defloration and subject herself to public humiliation if she has not really been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p> <p>Equally unpersuasive is the accused-appellant’s submission that it would have been impossible for him to rape Rea in their tiny and crowded room. Suffice it to state that “lust is no respecter of time and place; it can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadsides, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping, and even in places which to many would appear unlikely or high risk venues for its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p> <p>The accused-appellant heavily relied on denial as his defense, which is inherently a weak and unreliable defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> His denial is feeble, flimsy, self-serving and uncorroborated. Hence, it cannot prevail over Rea's unwavering and positive identification of him as her defiler and tormentor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As between Rea's categorical testimony that rings of truth on one hand, and his bare denial on the other, the former is to prevail. In short, his denial constitutes self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than Rea's credible declarations on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p> <p>Furthermore, Rea's testimony is not rendered doubtful by her belated reporting of the incidents that happened sometime in January, 1995 and executed her sworn statement on January 21, 1995. It bears stressing that Rea testified that the accused-appellant threatened to kill her should she tell someone that he raped her; and that she knew that he was imprisoned for having killed a person. Her failure to immediately report the incidents was due to said threat. Thus, her delay or vacillation in making her criminal accusation against him does not impair her credibility as the same was not without reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It must be noted that it is not easy for a rape victim to decide whether to conceal her humiliation in secrecy or to bravely have the rapist punished, at the same time bearing the inevitable and consequent public ridicule and embarrassment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p> <p>Nor are we impressed with the accused-appellant’s submission that Rea’s testimony should not be believed because she testified that when he raped her, he did not remove his pants. Her testimony when read in its entirety clearly shows that what she intended to convey to the trial court was that he had already succeeded in taking out his penis either by lowering his pants or unbuttoning it. Evidently, Rea’s testimony on this point was construed out of context. Settled is the rule that the testimony of a witness must be considered and calibrated in its entirety and not by truncated portions thereof or isolated passages therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p> <p>Neither do we find anything strange with Rea’s difficulty in recalling with accuracy the date the second rape incident took place. In the first place, we have repeatedly ruled that the date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In the second place, a rape victim cannot be expected to immediately remember every ugly detail of the appalling outrage especially so since she might in fact have been trying not to remember the traumatic experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> “Time-honored is the doctrine that discrepancies referring to minor details and collateral matters do not affect the veracity of the witnesses’ declarations. In fact, they strengthen rather than impair, the witnesses’ credibility for they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Besides, an errorless testimony cannot be expected when the complainant is recounting details of a harrowing experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> What matters most is Rea’s vivid recollection that the accused-appellant twice raped her. Her inability to give full details of her horrible experience is totally understandable. </p> <p>Undisputedly, the qualifying circumstances of the victim’s age and her relationship to the accused must specifically be alleged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In these cases, the records show that although Rea’s minority was alleged in the informations in these cases, the same was not sufficiently established during the trial of these cases. While she did testify that she was fourteen (14) years old when she was raped by the accused-appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the prosecution did not present her birth certificate or any other documentary evidence proving her age. Consequently, the accused-appellant can only be sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in both these cases, instead of death. </p> <p>We likewise award moral damages of P50,000.00 to Rea in each count of rape pursuant to the Court’s current policy that “moral damages are automatically awarded to rape victims without need of proof for it is assumed that they have suffered moral injuries entitling them to such award.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Moreover, we award exemplary damages of P25,000.00 in each count of rape, to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior, like the accused-appellant, from sexually abusing their daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Pursuant to existing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> we also award to her civil indemnity ex delicto in the amount of P50,000 for each count of rape. </p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the Joint Decision dated July 7, 1997 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 71, of Antipolo, Rizal, in Criminal Cases Nos. 95-11972 and 95-11973 finding the accused-appellant BALTAZAR CESISTA in both cases guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. As modified, the accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count of rape, instead of death, and he is ordered to pay in each count of rape, the victim, Rea Cesista, the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity ex delicto, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages. Costs against the accused-appellant. </p> <p>SO ORDERED. </p> <em>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez,</em> and <em>Corona, JJ.,</em> concur. <br> <br> <br> <hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659. <br> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Judge Felix S.
