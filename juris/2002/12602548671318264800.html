				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case involves a petition for certiorari and prohibition as well as a petition-in-intervention, praying that respondents be restrained from proceeding with the so-called “Balikatan 02-1” and that after due notice and hearing, that judgment be rendered issuing a permanent writ of injunction and/or prohibition against the deployment of U.S. troops in Basilan and Mindanao for being illegal and in violation of the Constitution.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>Beginning January of this year 2002, personnel from the armed forces of the United States of America started arriving in Mindanao to take part, in conjunction with the Philippine military, in “Balikatan 02-1.” These so-called “Balikatan” exercises are the largest combined training operations involving Filipino and American troops.&nbsp; In theory, they are a simulation of joint military maneuvers pursuant to the Mutual Defense Treaty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> a bilateral defense agreement entered into by the Philippines and the United States in 1951.<br><br>Prior to the year 2002, the last “Balikatan” was held in 1995.&nbsp; This was due to the paucity of any formal agreement relative to the treatment of United States personnel visiting the Philippines.&nbsp; In the meantime, the respective governments of the two countries agreed to hold joint exercises on a reduced scale.&nbsp; The lack of consensus was eventually cured when the two nations concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) in 1999.<br><br>The entry of American troops into Philippine soil is proximately rooted in the international anti-terrorism campaign declared by President George W. Bush in reaction to the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001.&nbsp; On that day, three (3) commercial aircrafts were hijacked, flown and smashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon building in Washington, D.C. by terrorists with alleged links to the al-Qaeda (“the Base”), a Muslim extremist organization headed by the infamous Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; Of no comparable historical parallels, these acts caused billions of dollars worth of destruction of property and incalculable loss of hundreds of lives.<br><br>On February 1, 2002, petitioners Arthur D. Lim and Paulino P. Ersando filed this petition for certiorari and prohibition, attacking the constitutionality of the joint exercise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> They were joined subsequently by SANLAKAS and PARTIDO NG MANGGAGAWA, both party-list organizations, who filed a petition-in-intervention on February 11, 2002.<br><br>Lim and Ersando filed suit in their capacities as citizens, lawyers and taxpayers. SANLAKAS and PARTIDO, on the other hand, aver that certain members of their organization are residents of Zamboanga and Sulu, and hence will be directly affected by the operations being conducted in Mindanao.&nbsp; They likewise pray for a relaxation on the rules relative to <i>locus standi</i> citing the unprecedented importance of the issue involved.<br><br>On February 7, 2002 the Senate conducted a hearing on the “Balikatan” exercise wherein Vice-President Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr., who is concurrently Secretary of Foreign Affairs, presented the Draft Terms of Reference (TOR).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Five days later, he approved the TOR, which we quote hereunder: <blockquote><ol type="I"> <li><u>POLICY LEVEL<br><br></u> <ol> <li>The Exercise shall be Consistent with the Philippine Constitution and all its activities shall be in consonance with the laws of the land and the provisions of the RP-US Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).<br><br></li><li>The conduct of this training Exercise is in accordance with pertinent United Nations resolutions against global terrorism as understood by the respective parties.<br><br></li><li>No permanent US basing and support facilities shall be established.

Falcon and United States <i>Charge d’ Affaires</i> Robert Fitts signed the Agreed Minutes of the discussion between the Vice-President and Assistant Secretary Kelly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioners Lim and Ersando present the following arguments:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE PHILIPPINES AND THE UNITED STATES SIGNED THE MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY (MDT) in 1951 TO PROVIDE MUTUAL MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ‘CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES’ OF EACH COUNTRY ONLY IN THE CASE OF AN ARMED ATTACK BY AN EXTERNAL AGGRESSOR, MEANING A THIRD COUNTRY AGAINST ONE OF THEM.<br><br>BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION CAN IT BE SAID THAT THE ABU SAYYAF BANDITS IN BASILAN CONSTITUTE AN EXTERNAL ARMED FORCE THAT HAS SUBJECT THE PHILIPPINES TO AN ARMED EXTERNAL ATTACK TO WARRANT U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MDT OF 1951.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>NEITHER DOES THE VFA OF 1999 AUTHORIZE AMERICAN SOLDIERS TO ENGAGE IN COMBAT OPERATIONS IN PHILIPPINE TERRITORY, NOT EVEN TO FIRE BACK “IF FIRED UPON”.</blockquote>Substantially the same points are advanced by petitioners SANLAKAS and PARTIDO.<br><br>In his Comment, the Solicitor General points to infirmities in the petitions regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, Lim and Ersando’s standing to file suit, the prematurity of the action, as well as the impropriety of availing of <i>certiorari</i> to ascertain a question of fact.&nbsp; Anent their <i>locus standi</i>, the Solicitor General argues that <i>first</i>, they may not file suit in their capacities as taxpayers inasmuch as it has not been shown that “Balikatan 02-1” involves the exercise of Congress’ taxing or spending powers.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, their being lawyers does not invest them with sufficient personality to initiate the case, citing our ruling in <b><i>Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Third, Lim and Ersando have failed to demonstrate the requisite showing of direct personal injury.&nbsp; We agree.<br><br>It is also contended that the petitioners are indulging in speculation.&nbsp; The Solicitor General is of the view that since the Terms of Reference are clear as to the extent and duration of “Balikatan 02-1,” the issues raised by petitioners are premature, as they are based only on a fear of <i>future</i> violation of the Terms of Reference.&nbsp; Even petitioners’ resort to a special civil action for certiorari is assailed on the ground that the writ may only issue on the basis of established facts.<br><br>Apart from these threshold issues, the Solicitor General claims that there is actually no question of constitutionality involved.&nbsp; The true object of the instant suit, it is said, is to obtain an interpretation of the VFA.&nbsp; The Solicitor General asks that we accord due deference to the executive determination that “Balikatan 02-1” is covered by the VFA, considering the President’s monopoly in the field of foreign relations and her role as commander-in-chief of the Philippine armed forces.<br><br>Given the primordial importance of the issue involved, it will suffice to reiterate our view on this point in a related case:<br><blockquote>Notwithstanding, in view of the paramount importance and the constitutional significance of the issues raised in the petitions, this Court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, brushes aside the procedural barrier and takes cognizance of the petitions, as we have done in the early <i><b>Emergency Powers Cases</b></i>, where we had occasion to rule:<br><blockquote>‘x x x ordinary citizens and taxpayers were allowed to question the constitutionality of several executive orders issued by President Quirino although they were involving only an indirect and general interest shared in common with the public.&nbsp; The Court dismissed the objection that they were not proper parties and ruled that <b>‘transcendental importance to the public of these cases demands that they be settled promptly and definitely, brushing aside, if we must, technicalities of procedure.’</b> We have since then applied the exception in many other cases.&nbsp; [citation omitted]</blockquote>This principle was reiterated in the subsequent cases of <b>Gonzales vs. COMELEC, Daza vs. Singson, and Basco vs. Phil. Amusement and Gaming Corporation,</b> where we emphatically held:<br><blockquote>‘Considering however the importance to the public of the case at bar, and in keeping with the Court’s duty, under the 1987 Constitution, to determine whether or not the other branches of the government have kept themselves within the limits of the Constitution and the laws that they have not abused the discretion given to them, the Court has brushed aside technicalities of procedure and has taken cognizance of this petition. xxx’</blockquote>Again, in the more recent case of <b>Kilosbayan vs. Guingona, Jr.</b>, this Court ruled that in cases of transcendental importance, <b>the court may relax the standing requirements and allow a suit to prosper even where there is no direct injury to the party claiming the right of judicial review.</b><br><br>Although courts generally avoid having to decide a constitutional question based on the doctrine of separation of powers, which enjoins upon the departments of the government a becoming respect for each others’ acts, this Court nevertheless resolves to take cognizance of the instant petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Hence, we treat with similar dispatch the general objection to the supposed prematurity of the action.&nbsp; At any rate, petitioners' concerns on the lack of any specific regulation on the latitude of activity US personnel may undertake and the duration of their stay has been addressed in the Terms of Reference.<br><br>The holding of “Balikatan 02-1” must be studied in the framework of the treaty antecedents to which the Philippines bound itself.&nbsp; The first of these is the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT, for brevity).&nbsp; The MDT has been described as the “core” of the defense relationship between the Philippines and its traditional ally, the United States.&nbsp; Its aim is to enhance the strategic and technological capabilities of our armed forces through joint training with its American counterparts; the “Balikatan” is the largest such training exercise directly supporting the MDT’s objectives.&nbsp; It is this treaty to which the VFA adverts and the obligations thereunder which it seeks to reaffirm.<br><br>The lapse of the US-Philippine Bases Agreement in 1992 and the decision not to renew it created a vacuum in US-Philippine defense relations, that is, until it was replaced by the Visiting Forces Agreement.&nbsp; It should be recalled that on October 10, 2000, by a vote of eleven to three, this court upheld the validity of the VFA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The VFA provides the “regulatory mechanism” by which “United States military and civilian personnel [may visit] temporarily in the Philippines in connection with activities approved by the Philippine Government.” It contains provisions relative to entry and departure of American personnel, driving and vehicle registration, criminal jurisdiction, claims, importation and exportation, movement of vessels and aircraft, as well as the duration of the agreement and its termination.&nbsp; It is the VFA which gives continued relevance to the MDT despite the passage of years.&nbsp; Its primary goal is to facilitate the promotion of optimal cooperation between American and Philippine military forces in the event of an attack by a common foe.<br><br>The first question that should be addressed is whether “Balikatan 02-1” is covered by the Visiting Forces Agreement. To resolve this, it is necessary to refer to the VFA itself. Not much help can be had therefrom, unfortunately, since the terminology employed is itself the source of the problem. The VFA permits United States personnel to engage, on an impermanent basis, in “activities,” the exact meaning of which was left undefined. The expression is ambiguous, permitting a wide scope of undertakings subject only to the approval of the Philippine government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The sole encumbrance placed on its definition is couched in the negative, in that United States personnel must “abstain from any activity <i>inconsistent with the spirit of this agreement, and in particular, from any political activity.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> All other activities, in other words, are fair game.<br><br>We are not left completely unaided, however. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which contains provisos governing interpretations of international agreements, state:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">SECTION 3. INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES<br><br><i>Article 31</i><br><br><i>General rule of interpretation</i></div> <ol> <li>A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.<br><br></li><li>The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the party.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></li><li>&nbsp;There shall be taken into account, together with the context:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td> <div align="justify">any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></li><li>A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. </li></ol> <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Article 32</i><br><br><i>Supplementary means of interpretation</i><br></div><br>Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">(a)</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b) </td> <td><div align="justify">leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>It is clear from the foregoing that the cardinal rule of interpretation must involve an examination of the text, which is presumed to verbalize the parties’ intentions.&nbsp; The Convention likewise dictates what may be used as aids to deduce the meaning of terms, which it refers to as the context of the treaty, as well as other elements may be taken into account alongside the aforesaid context.&nbsp; As explained by a writer on the Convention,<br><blockquote>[t]he Commission’s proposals (which were adopted virtually without change by the conference and are now reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the Convention) were clearly based on the view that the text of a treaty must be presumed to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties; the Commission accordingly came down firmly in favour of the view that ‘the starting point of interpretation is the elucidation of the meaning of the text, not an investigation <i>ab initio</i> into the intentions of the parties’.&nbsp; This is not to say that the <i>travaux préparatoires</i> of a treaty, or the circumstances of its conclusion, are relegated to a subordinate, and wholly ineffective, role.&nbsp; As Professor Briggs points out, no rigid temporal prohibition on resort to <i>travaux préparatoires</i> of a treaty was intended by the use of the phrase ‘supplementary means of interpretation’ in what is now Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.&nbsp; The distinction between the general rule of interpretation and the supplementary means of interpretation is intended rather to ensure that the supplementary means do not constitute an alternative, autonomous method of interpretation divorced from the general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>The Terms of Reference rightly fall within the context of the VFA.<br><br>After studied reflection, it appeared farfetched that the ambiguity surrounding the meaning of the word “activities” arose from accident.&nbsp; In our view, it was deliberately made that way to give both parties a certain leeway in negotiation.&nbsp; In this manner, visiting US forces may sojourn in Philippine territory for purposes other than military.&nbsp; As conceived, the joint exercises may include training on new techniques of patrol and surveillance to protect the nation’s marine resources, sea search-and-rescue operations to assist vessels in distress, disaster relief operations, civic action projects such as the building of school houses, medical and humanitarian missions, and the like.<br><br>Under these auspices, the VFA gives legitimacy to the current Balikatan exercises.&nbsp; It is only logical to assume that “Balikatan 02-1,” a “mutual anti-terrorism advising, assisting and training exercise,” falls under the umbrella of sanctioned or allowable activities in the context of the agreement.&nbsp; Both the history and intent of the Mutual Defense Treaty and the VFA support the conclusion that <i>combat-related</i> activities — as opposed to <i>combat </i>itself — such as the one subject of the instant petition, are indeed authorized.<br><br>That is not the end of the matter, though.&nbsp; Granted that “Balikatan 02-1” is permitted under the terms of the VFA, what may US forces legitimately do in furtherance of their aim to provide advice, assistance and training in the global effort against terrorism? Differently phrased, may American troops actually engage in combat in Philippine territory? The Terms of Reference are explicit enough.&nbsp; Paragraph 8 of section I stipulates that US exercise participants may not engage in combat “<i><b>except in self-defense.</b></i>” We wryly note that this sentiment is admirable in the abstract but difficult in implementation. The target of “Balikatan 02-1,” the Abu Sayyaf, cannot reasonably be expected to sit idly while the battle is brought to their very doorstep.&nbsp; They cannot be expected to pick and choose their targets for they will not have the luxury of doing so.&nbsp; We state this point if only to signify our awareness that the parties straddle a fine line, observing the honored legal maxim “<i>Nemo potest facere per alium quod non potest facere per directum.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The indirect violation is actually petitioners’ worry, that in reality, “Balikatan 02-1” is actually a war principally conducted by the United States government, and that the provision on self-defense serves only as camouflage to conceal the true nature of the exercise.&nbsp; A clear pronouncement on this matter thereby becomes crucial.<br><br>In our considered opinion, neither the MDT nor the VFA allow foreign troops to engage in an offensive war on Philippine territory.&nbsp; We bear in mind the salutary proscription stated in the Charter of the United Nations, to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">Article 2<br></div><br>The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Principles.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></blockquote>In the same manner, both the Mutual Defense Treaty and the Visiting Forces Agreement, as in all other treaties and international agreements to which the Philippines is a party, must be read in the context of the 1987 Constitution.&nbsp; In particular, the Mutual Defense Treaty was concluded way before the present Charter, though it nevertheless remains in effect as a valid source of international obligation.&nbsp; The present Constitution contains key provisions useful in determining the extent to which foreign military troops are allowed in Philippine territory.&nbsp; Thus, in the Declaration of Principles and State Policies, it is provided that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>SEC. 2. The Philippines renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation, and amity with all nations.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>SEC. 7. The State shall pursue an independent foreign policy.&nbsp; In its relations with other states the paramount consideration shall be national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination.<br><br>SEC. 8.

Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>After the expiration in 1991 of the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America concerning Military Bases, foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and, when the Congress so requires, ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people in a national referendum held for that purpose, and recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State.</blockquote>There is no treaty allowing foreign military troops to engage in combat with internal elements.<br><br>The Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America does not authorize US military troops to engage the ASG in combat.&nbsp; The MDT contemplates only an “<b>external</b> armed attack.” Article III of the treaty cannot be more explicit:<br><blockquote>The Parties, through their Foreign Ministers or their deputies, will consult together from time to time regarding the implementation of this treaty and whenever in the opinion of either of them the territorial integrity, political independence or security of either of the Parties is threatened by <b>external</b> armed attack in the Pacific.&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>Supporting this conclusion is the third paragraph of the MDT preamble where the parties express their desire<br><blockquote>to declare publicly and formally their sense of unity and their common determination to defend themselves against <b>external</b> armed attack, so that no potential aggressor could be under the illusion that either of them stands alone in the Pacific area. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><b><u>There is no evidence that <br>the ASG is connected with <br>“global terrorism</u>.”</b><br><br>There is no empirical basis for the allegation that the “terrorism” which the ASG is accused of constitutes an “external armed attack.” The ASG has committed mostly crimes of kidnapping for ransom and murder — common crimes that are punishable under the penal code but which, by themselves, hardly constitute “terrorism.”<br><br>Parenthetically, there is lack of agreement as to the precise definition of terrorism. Indeed, one man’s terrorist may be another man’s freedom fighter.&nbsp; The divergent interests of States have caused contradicting definitions and conflicting perceptions of what constitutes “terrorist acts” that make it difficult for the United Nations to reach a decision on the definition of terrorism.&nbsp; Because of this “definitional predicament,” the <b>power of definition</b> is easily exercised by a superpower which, by reason of its unchallenged hegemony, could draw lists of what it considers terrorist organizations or states sponsoring terrorism based on criteria determined by the hegemon’s own strategic interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In any case, ties between the ASG and so-called international “terrorist” organizations have not been established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Even assuming that such ties do exist, it does not necessarily make the “attacks” by the ASG “external” as to fall within the ambit of the MDT.<br><br><u><b>Balikatan exercises are <br>not covered by VFA as <br>US troops are not <br>allowed to engage in <br>combat</b></u><b>.</b><br><br>Neither is the present situation covered by the so-called Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).&nbsp; The VFA was concluded after the removal of the US military bases, troops and facilities in the aftermath of the termination of the treaty allowing the presence of American military bases in the Philippines.&nbsp; The VFA is nothing more than what its formal name suggests: an “Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America regarding the <b>Treatment</b> of United States Armed Forces Visiting the Philippines.” The last paragraph of the VFA preamble also “recogniz[es] the desirability of defining <b>the treatment</b> of United States personnel visiting the Republic of the Philippines.”<br><br>The VFA was entered into to enable American troops to enter the country again after the removal of the American military bases so they can participate in military exercises under the auspices of the Mutual Defense Treaty.&nbsp; It provided the legal framework under which American soldiers will be treated while they remain in the country.<br><br>The military exercises contemplated in the VFA are those in accordance with the National Defense Plan (NDP) of the Philippines.&nbsp; The NDP was previously approved and adopted by the Mutual Defense Board, jointly chaired by the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Commander in the Pacific of the United States Armed Forces.<br><br>The NDP is directed against potential foreign aggressors, not designed to deal with internal disorders.&nbsp; This was what the Senate understood when it ratified the VFA in Senate Resolution No. 18, which reads:<br><blockquote>The VFA shall serve as the legal mechanism to promote defense cooperation between the two countries, enhancing the preparedness of the Armed Forces of the Philippines against external threats; and enabling the Philippines to bolster the stability of the Pacific Area in a shared effort with its neighbor states.</blockquote>The VFA’s ambiguous reference to “activities”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> is not a loophole that legitimizes the presence of US troops in Basilan.&nbsp; In the treaty’s preamble, the parties “reaffirm their obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty of August 30, 1951.” As the preamble comprises part of a treaty’s context for the purpose of interpretation, the VFA must be read in light of the provisions of the MDT.&nbsp; As stated earlier, the MDT contemplates only an external armed attack; consequently, the “activities” referred to in the VFA cannot thus be interpreted to include armed confrontation with or suppression of the ASG members who appear to be mere local bandits, mainly engaged in kidnapping for ransom and murder — even arson, extortion and illegal possession of firearms, all of which are common offenses under our criminal laws.&nbsp; These activities involve purely police matters and domestic law and order problems; they are hardly “external” attacks within the contemplation of the MDT and the VFA.&nbsp; To construe the vagueness of the term “activities” in the VFA as authorizing American troops to confront the ASG in armed conflict would, therefore, contravene both spirit and letter of the MDT.<br><br>Respondents maintain that the American troops are not here to fight the ASG but merely to engage in “training exercises.” To allay fears that the American troops are here to engage the ASG in combat, the TOR professes that the present exercise “is a mutual counter-terrorism advising, assisting and training Exercise relative to Philippine efforts against the ASG, and will be conducted on the Island of Basilan.” The TOR further provides that the “exercise” shall involve the conduct of “mutual military <b>assisting, advising</b> and <b>training</b> of RP and US Forces with the primary objective of enhancing the operational capabilities of both forces to combat terrorism.”<br><br>These avowals of assistance, advice, and training, however, fly in the face of the presence of US troops in the heart of the ASG’s stronghold.&nbsp; Such presence is an act of provocation that makes an armed confrontation between US soldiers and ASG members inevitable.<br><br>The US troops in Basilan have been described as being <b>“on a slippery slope between training and fighting.”</b> Their very presence makes them a target for terrorist and for the local Moslem populace, which has been bitterly anti-American since colonial times. Though they are called advisers, the Americans will be going on risky missions deep into the jungle.&nbsp; A former Green Beret who is an analyst of Washington’s Center for Strategies and Budgetary Assessments notes that “when troops go out on patrol, they come as close as they can to direct combat.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>“Advising” or “training” Filipino soldiers hardly describes the involvement of US troops (unaccompanied by Filipino counterparts) on board combat helicopters which land on the battlegrounds to evacuate Filipino soldiers wounded while fighting the ASG.&nbsp; For example, on April 5, 2002, US troops on board a Pave Hawk helicopter flew to the scene of a night battle on Basilan Island to evacuate a wounded Filipino soldier.&nbsp; This was reportedly the third time in recent weeks that chopper-borne US forces had evacuated Filipino soldiers fighting the ASG.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><b>Whatever euphemisms may be conjured to characterize American involvement, the RP-US Balikatan 02-1 Exercises are aimed at seeking out the ASG and exterminating it.</b><br><br>The prohibition contained in the TOR against US exercise participants from engaging in combat but <b>“without prejudice to their right to self-defense”</b> provides little consolation. Combat muddles the distinction between aggression and self-defense.&nbsp; US troops can always say they did not fire first and no one would dare say otherwise.&nbsp; The ASG has been so demonized that no one cares how it is exorcised.&nbsp; Significantly, the TOR does not define the parameters of “self-defense.” Militarily, a pre-emptive strike could be interpreted as an act of self-defense.<br><br>What I fear most is that the country would be dragged into a more devastating and protracted conflict as a result of the continued presence of US military troops in Basilan. A single ASG sniper’s bullet felling an American soldier could be used as an excuse for massive retaliation by US ground and air forces to attack and bomb out every suspected ASG lair, all in the name of “self-defense.”<br><br>Apprehensions over possible catastrophic consequence of US military involvement in our country are not without historical basis.<br><br>The US experience in Vietnam, for example, began as an expression of support for the establishment of South Vietnam under Bao Dai’s leadership in 1949 to counteract the support given by communist China and the Soviet Union to North Vietnam.&nbsp; In 1950, the US began providing military assistance in fighting North Vietnam by sending military advisors as well as US tanks, planes, artillery and other supplies.&nbsp; The US became more involved in the Vietnam conflict when in 1961, it sent the first 400 Green Beret “Special Advisors” to South Vietnam to train the latter’s soldiers in methods of counter-insurgency against the Viet Cong guerillas.&nbsp; <b>It clarified that the American soldiers were not in Vietnam to engage in combat.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>However, due to the increased success of the Viet Cong guerillas, assisted by the Northern Vietnamese Army, the US eventually began to run covert operations using South Vietnamese commandos in speed boats to harass radar sites along the coastline of North Vietnam.&nbsp; In 1964, after an alleged torpedo attack by North Vietnam of the American destroyers USS.

Lists of States “sponsoring terrorism” and of terrorist organizations are set up and constantly being updated according to criteria that are not always known to the public, but are clearly determined by strategic interests.<br><br>The basic problem underlying all these military actions — or threats of the use of force as the most recent by the United States against Iraq — consists in the <i>absence of an agreed definition of terrorism.</i><br><br>Remarkable confusion persists in regard to the legal categorization of acts of violence either by states, by armed groups such as liberation movements, or by individuals.<br><br>The dilemma can be summarized in the saying “<i>One country's terrorist is another country’s freedom fighter.</i>” The apparent contradiction or lack of consistency in the use of the term “terrorism” may further be demonstrated by the historical fact that leaders of national liberation movements such as Nelson Mandela in South Africa, Habib Bourgouiba in Tunisia, or Ahmed Ben Bella in Algeria, to mention only a few, were originally labeled as terrorists by those who controlled the territory at the time, but later became internationally respected statesmen.<br><br>What, then, is the defining creterion for terrorist acts — the <i>differentia specific</i>a distinguishing those acts from eventually legitimate acts of national resistance or self-defense?<br><br>Since the times of the Cold War the United Nations Organization has been trying in vain to reach a consensus on the basic issue of definition.&nbsp; The organization has intensified its efforts recently, but has been unable to bridge the gap between those who associate “terrorism” with any violent act by non-state groups against civilians, state functionaries or infrastructure or military installations, and those who believe in the concept of the legitimate use of force when resistance against foreign occupation or against systematic oppression of ethnic and/or religious groups within a state is concerned.<br><br>The dilemma facing the international community can best be illustrated by reference to the contradicting categorization of organizations and movements such as Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) — which is a terrorist group for Israel and a liberation movement for Arabs and Muslims — the Kashmiri resistance groups — who are terrorists in the perception of India, liberation fighters in that of Pakistan — the earlier <u>Contras</u> in Nicaragua — freedom fighters for the United States, terrorists for the Socialist camp — or, most drastically, the Afhani <u>Mujahedeen</u> (later to become the <u>Taliban</u> movement): during the Cold War period they were a group of freedom fighters for the West, nurtured by the United States, and a terrorist gang for the Soviet Union.&nbsp; One could go on and on in enumerating examples of conflicting categorizations that cannot be reconciled in any way — because of opposing political interests that are at the roots of those perceptions.<br><br>How, then, can those contradicting definitions and conflicting perceptions and evaluations of one and the same group and its actions be explained?&nbsp; In our analysis, the basic reason for these striking inconsistencies lies in the <i>divergent interests of states</i>.&nbsp; Depending on whether a state is in the position of an occupying power or in that of a rival, or adversary, of an occupying power in a given territory, the definition of terrorism will “fluctuate” accordingly. A state may eventually see itself as protector of the rights of a certain ethnic group outside its territory and will therefore speak of a “liberation struggle,” not of “terrorism” when acts of violence by this group are concerned, and vice-versa.<br><br>The United Nations Organization has been unable to reach a decision on the definition of terrorism exactly because of these conflicting interests of sovereign states that determine in each and every instance how a particular armed movement (i.e. a non-state actor) is labeled in regard to the terrorist-freedom fighter dichotomy.&nbsp; A “policy of double standards” on this vital issue of international affairs has been the unavoidable consequence.<br><br>This “definitional predicament” of an organization consisting of sovereign states — and not of peoples, in spite of the emphasis in the Preamble to the United Nations Charter! — has become even more serious in the present global power constellation: <u>one</u> superpower exercises the decisive role in the Security Council, former great powers of the Cold War era as well as medium powers are increasingly being marginalized; and the problem has become even more acute since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States.</blockquote>Koechler adds, however, that this failure to distinguish between terrorist acts and acts of national liberation did not prevent the international community from arriving at an implicit or “operative” definition.&nbsp; For example, in Article of the International Convention for Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, terrorist acts are referred to as “criminal acts ..., in particular where they are intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons” that are under no circumstances justifiable considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The following excerpts from “Under the Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao” by Marites Dañguilan Vitug and Glenda M.

[Basilan Bishop Romeo] [de] la Cruz said he didn’t think the Abu Sayyaf was truly espousing fundamentalism. “Initially I thought this was a religious conflict because of the so-called resurgence of Islam.&nbsp; For a while the Church even attributed the spate of kidnappings in Basilan to Islamic fundamentalism.

It’s just that he’s not pure Muslim.”<br><br>Thus, how and why exactly the Abu Sayyaf was founded is a question for which neither the military nor Janjalani had a solid answer.&nbsp; The group remains as nebulous as its beginning, and as shadowy as its charismatic founder.&nbsp; There is absolutely no doubt that it has been infiltrated by the military.&nbsp; What is uncertain is whether or not Janjalani, who was admired by many in the Muslim community, formed the Abu Sayyaf precisely to work for the military or if he had simply lost control over his own men.&nbsp; (At pp. 210-211.)</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Article III (1) on Entry and Departure, for example, imposes upon the Philippine Government the duty to “facilitate the admission of United States personnel and their departure from the Philippines in connection with activities covered by this agreement.” Article VI (1) also mentions “claims... from activities to which this agreement applies.” The same reference to “activities to which this agreement applies” is found in Article VII on Importation and Exportation.

The pertinent portions of the study state:<br><blockquote><ol start="13"><li>Man is one of the few species that frequently uses violence against its own kind. He has done so since the dawn of history.&nbsp; In the past, periods in which violence has been especially conspicuous have been those of rapid social change.&nbsp; During the years of the existence of the United Nations, when in most parts of the world, and in both the developed and the developing countries, the patters of society are changing with almost unprecedented speed, violence has been frequent.<br><br></li><li>The interlinked growth of technology and growth of population have tended to create new hopes, expectations and needs in many social groups. These new attitudes mark a departure from the resignation and passivity with which most men in the past accepted the ills of life.&nbsp; The United Nations Charter is the voice of the aspirations of mankind when it contemplates the establishment of a world in which aggression and the threat or use of force in international relations would be effectively outlawed, friendly relations would exist among nations on the basis of respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, international disputes would be settled justly be peaceful, and international co-operation would solve international economic and social problems and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.<br><br></li><li>The period of the existence of the United Nations, however, has shown very incomplete and uneven progress towards these goals.&nbsp; While major wars involving the great Power have not occurred, force has often been resorted to, and has inflicted suffering and exile upon peoples.&nbsp; While progress has been made against colonialism and racism, those evils have not yet been completely eliminated.&nbsp; Even where political independence has been established, in many cases much remains to be done in assisting the populations to attain the minimum level necessary for decent conditions of life.&nbsp; Few advances have been made towards the peaceful settlement of some major international disputes, which are too often left to fester and poison international relations.&nbsp; Among groups where economic and social progress has been relatively slow, conditions have been unfavourable to the exercise of and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedom.<br><br></li><li>The lack of slowness of advance towards these goals has contributed toward the “misery, frustration, grievance and despair” which, while not themselves causes of terrorism, are psychological conditions or states of being which sometimes lead, directly or indirectly, to the commission of acts of violence.&nbsp; While in the United Nations context it is perhaps appropriate to give special attention to the international factor that contribute to violence, there are also many situations in individual nations which may give rise to the grievance of a particular group or person, leading to acts having international repercussions.&nbsp; Purely personal circumstances can also often have the same result.&nbsp; There are also cases in which there is no genuine grievance at all, and a violent crime affecting more than one country seems to have been committed from mere cupidity, or a desire to escape criminal prosecution.&nbsp; The General Assembly, however, in stressing “misery, frustration, grievance and despair, seems to have singled out for special attention those situations which have the common characteristic of calling for redress.<br><br></li><li>Why is it that violence resulting from these circumstances takes with increasing frequency the form of international terrorism, threatening, endangering or killing innocent victims? As the peoples of the world grow more interdependent the solution of many problems no longer hangs on any local ruler or government, but on actions and decisions taken thousands of miles away.&nbsp; Men think their ills have been produced by some vast impersonal force, which is deaf to their pleas for justice or impotent to find solutions, rather than by other men, striving for similar although opposed ends and bound to them by the claims of a common humanity. Modern communications and the growth of the public information media have transformed local incidents into world events, especially when the incidents have an international character.&nbsp; A terrorist act focuses world attention upon the terrorist and upon any cause he may claim to represent.&nbsp; In these circumstances, some such acts —which, as has already been said, cannot possibly by themselves effect radical social changes — are really acts of communication. They are intended to show the world that the determination and devotion of the terrorists are sufficient to compensate in the long run for their apparent inferiority in strength; that their cause is more holy to them than life itself, must be taken seriously, and is worthy of support; and that neither their foe nor the world at-large is able to prevent their success in their purpose, or ensure punishment of their deeds and those of their associates.<br><br></li><li>Other such acts, however, seem to be more the result of blind fanaticism, or of the adoption of an extremist ideology which subordinates morality and all other human values to a single aim.&nbsp; In either case, the result is the same; modern life and modern weapons bring more and more strangers and foreigners within the reach of the terrorist, and he uses them as instruments for his purpose.&nbsp; As violence breeds violence, so terrorism begets counter-terrorism, which in turn leads to more terrorism in an ever-increasing spiral.</li></ol><div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">xxx<br></div><ol start="20"><li>It thus appears that the “misery, frustration, grievance and despair” which lead to terrorism have many roots in international and national political, economic and social situations affecting the terrorist, as well as in his personal circumstances.&nbsp; The precise chain of causation of particular acts cannot be traced with scientific exactitude.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the General Assembly may wish to identify types of situations which, if a remedy could be found to bring them more into accord with justice, will cease to contribute to the spreading terrorism which has shocked the world.</li></ol></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Dañguilan Vitug and Gloria (<span style="font-style: italic;">Under the crescent Moon:&nbsp; Rebellion in Mindanao, supra.</span>) write:<br><blockquote>Indeed, a man is inspired by his belief but is constrained by his environment.&nbsp; And Basilan, where Janjalani grew up, is a place where the laws set by men are flouted daily.&nbsp; It is a place where people of weak resolve could give in to the challenges posed by power, either the lack or possession of it.&nbsp; It certainly is not a place conducive for reflection or reinforcing pure religious thoughts.&nbsp; Mindanao’s best war laboratory, Basilan is one of the country’s poorest provinces where all sorts of armed groups dominate a populace long neglected by government.&nbsp; Local rulers compete for legitimacy with armed rebel groups, bandits, Muslim preachers, Catholic volunteers, loggers legal and illegal, the Marines, the Army.&nbsp; In this sense, the Abu Sayyaf was ripe for growth.&nbsp; Modern history has proven that whenever the legitimacy of the state suffers and the economy goes down, other forces come to force as alternative.&nbsp; Janjalani had offered solace to those who bothered to listen to him.&nbsp; The reality of Basilan, after all, is its deadly environment: grinding poverty, the absence of the rule of law, and the proliferation of arms and of men who thrive on them.&nbsp; It is no coincidence that a group with such amorphous beginnings as the Abu Sayyaf was established in a province that remains poor despite its fertile, lushly forested land and its proximity to Zamboanga City.&nbsp; It didn’t matter that Janjalani went to the Catholic-run Clarest school.&nbsp; Janjalani, or any local leader for that matter, would have found it difficult to detach himself from this environment.<br><br>Former MNLF members in Basilan who have known little more than how to fire a gun have resorted to easy ways of earning a living.&nbsp; One of these means was kidnapping, and it gave Abu Sayyaf away.&nbsp; No group espousing a true Islamic state would have resorted to kidnapping in such a random, blatant style as the Abu Sayyaf did in its heyday.<br><br>It also didn’t help that the government and the media unfairly lumped Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism together because the Abu Sayyaf, which espouses the former, has been suing the latter as a means to fight for its cause.&nbsp; (At 206-207.)</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> DAÑGUILAN VITUG AND GLORIA, AT 244-245.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Bayan vs. Zamora</i>, 342 SCRA 449 (2002).<br></div><br><br><div align="JUSTIFY"> <hr size="1" width="60%" align="CENTER" noshade="NOSHADE"><u><br><br></u><div style="text-align: center;"><u>SEPARATE OPINION</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup><br></div><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PANGANIBAN, J.:</span><br><br>Through their “Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition,” Arthur D. Lim and Paulino R. Ersanda -- joined by Intervenors Sanlakas and Partido ng Manggagawa -- plead for the issuance of an order “restraining the respondents from proceeding or continuing and completing the so-called ‘Balikatan 02-1’” on the ground that the exercise is not sanctioned by any treaty and is, therefore, allegedly unconstitutional.<br><br>Agreeing with the Comment of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the <i>ponencia</i> of Mr. Justice Sabino R. de Leon Jr. dismisses the Petition essentially on these procedural grounds: <ol> <li>As taxpayers, petitioners do not have legal standing or <i>locus standi</i>, because Balikatan 02-1 “does not involve the exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power.”<br><br></li><li>Certiorari and prohibition are improper remedies, because petitioners have not alleged sufficient facts upon which grave abuse of discretion or excess/lack of jurisdiction could be argued from.<br><br></li><li>The Petition is premature because the alleged violation of the Constitution is merely speculative, not actual or imminent.<br><br></li><li>Though entitled “Certiorari and Prohibition,” the Petition is really one for declaratory relief which merely seeks an advice or opinion, not a decision.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to issue opinions or advices. </li></ol> Ordinarily, the above reasons would indeed be sufficient to cause the dismissal of a petition.&nbsp; However, because of the “transcendental importance” of the main question raised — the constitutionality of the Balikatan exercise — the Court, I believe, could have exempted this case from these procedural requirements and tackled the case on the merits, if only to put to rest the legality of this major event of public interest in our country and even in the world.&nbsp; I, for one, would have voted to set aside these legalistic obstacles, <i>had the Petition presented enough factual moorings upon which to base an intelligent discussion and disposition of the legal issues.</i><br><br>For instance, this Court cannot be called upon to decide the factual issues of whether the US forces are actually engaging the Abu Sayyaf Group in combat and whether they will stay in our country permanently.&nbsp; This Court has no authority to conduct a trial, which can establish these factual antecedents.&nbsp; Knowing what these antecedents are is necessary to determine whether the Balikatan violates the Constitution or the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) of 1951 or the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) of 1999.&nbsp; Verily, the Petition has not even alleged that the American troops have indeed been unconstitutionally engaged in actual offensive combat.&nbsp; The contention that they would necessarily and surely violate the Constitution by participating in the joint exercise in Basilan is merely speculative. Petitioners aver:<br><blockquote>“American soldiers with high-tech weaponry, disguised as trainers or advisers to Filipino troops, will go to the war zones of Basilan.&nbsp; Hence, while dubbed as a military exercise, it is in reality a continuing combat operation by the AFP against the Abu Sayyaf to be participated in this time by U.S. troops.&nbsp; It has been admitted that U.S. ‘advisers’ will accompany Filipino soldiers on patrol in the combat zones.</blockquote>Also, a base of operation will be in the Sampinit complex which is in the heartland of the Abu Sayyaf’s ‘territorial domain’ in Basilan island.&nbsp; A shooting war, not just an exercise, is unavoidable.”<br><br>That a “shooting war is unavoidable” is conjectural; at best, a conclusion that is not borne by solid factual moorings.&nbsp; Cases cannot be decided on mere speculation or prophecy.&nbsp; The Petition claims that while the US troops are “disguised” as “advisers” or “trainors” or “chaperons,” they are actually combatants engaged in an offensive war against local insurgents.&nbsp; Again, there is no solid factual basis for this statement.&nbsp; It may or may not be true.&nbsp; The Petition also alleges, again without firm factual support, that the American forces will stay here indefinitely — “for a year or even more depending on the need of the AFP for them.”<br><br>On the other hand, the OSG assures that petitioners’ “apprehensions are belied” by the Terms of Reference (TOR) approved by both the Philippines and the United States, which “expressly limit the conduct and completion of the exercise within a period not exceeding six (6) months and prohibits the American participants from engaging in combat, without prejudice to their right to self-defense.”<br><br>I stress that cases cannot be decided by this Court on the basis of speculative or hypothetical assumptions like “If the facts were these, then our decision would be this; on the other hand, if the facts change, then our ruling would be modified as follows.”&nbsp; Decisions of this Court especially in certiorari and prohibition cases are issued only if the facts are clear and definite.&nbsp; As a rule, courts may not consider or judge facts or matters unless they are alleged in the pleadings and proven by the parties.&nbsp; Our duty is to apply the law to facts that are not in dispute.<br><br>In the absence of firm factual findings that the Americans “will stay indefinitely” in our country or “are engaged in actual offensive combat with local insurgents” as alleged by petitioners, respondent Philippine officials who are hosting the Balikatan exercise cannot possibly be imputed with grave abuse of discretion — an indispensible element of certiorari.<br><br>True, there are some questions that may genuinely be raised in regard to the Balikatan 02-1 vis-à-vis our Constitution, the MDT and the VFA, like the following:<br><br><table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">(1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Is the Abu Sayyaf Group composed of “international terrorists” whose acts and practices violate the United Nations Charter to such an extent as to pose a threat to international peace and security?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(2) </td> <td><div align="justify">Is there an “external armed attack” against the Philippines sufficient in force and magnitude as to justify an invocation of the MDT?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(3) </td> <td><div align="justify">Are the size, the kind, and the location of the Balikatan deployment justified by the nature, the scope, the duration and the kind of “activities” allowed under the VFA?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(4)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Is it true that the real American objective is the rescue of ASG hostages Martin and Gracia Burnham, who are both American citizens?
