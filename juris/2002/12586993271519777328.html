Naval Street, Tangos near a videoke joint.&nbsp; He was at that time urinating and in fact his zipper was still open when apparently somebody tapped his shoulder.&nbsp; It turned out, however, that it was a stab thrust.&nbsp; When Crispin backslided, he was again stabbed on the stomach while his hands were being held as the battering continued.&nbsp; Crispin identified accused Conrado de Leon, along with the other accused, as among the persons who stabbed and ganged up [on] him.&nbsp; From the time Crispin was brought to her and on board the tricycle, he was repeatedly mentioning the names of the persons who assaulted him without any apparent reason.&nbsp; Crispin told her that he did not quarrel with anyone of the three (3) accused who ganged up on him.&nbsp; While traversing Bacog Street, Crispin was already having difficulty in saying a word because he was speaking very softly and in fact ha[d] to move his mouth near her ears in order to communicate.&nbsp; His eyes were drooping close unlike earlier [when] the same were wide open when he was brought home.<br><br>“Sometime in the month of May prior to the incident, Crispin went home crying because he was slapped by accused Rudy R. Manlapaz alias Talakitok who was asking fish out of their catch entrusted to Crispin by their manager.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the victim told accused Manlapaz that he [would] give them fish some other time.&nbsp; Accused Manlapaz got mad and slapped Crispin before threatening to kill him.<br><br>“Rudy dela Peña related that he was drinking inside MC Kitchenette/Snack House at Naval Street, Tangos, Navotas when his brother Crispin and Apollo Natividad arrived.&nbsp; The latter ordered and consumed two bottles of beer, [after which], he gave them another bottle, which they did not drink anymore.&nbsp; Crispin and Apollo told him that they could no longer drink more because they ha[d] each consumed one bottle of beer so he told them to go home.&nbsp; When Crispin and Apollo proceeded outside the MC Kitchenette, a commotion ensued which he did not bother to see because a melee [was] a natural occurrence in the place.&nbsp; However, the trouble reached the kitchenette.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; there&nbsp; when&nbsp; he saw a man x x x being held in both hands while accused Andring de Leon grabbed him by the chin and delivered a stab thrust on his neck.&nbsp; At that juncture, the man turned his head to the right.&nbsp; He readily recognized him to be his brother Crispin whose shirt was already tainted with blood because of the several stab wounds he had sustained.&nbsp; On his recognition of his brother, he immediately rushed towards him as Crispin was saying to his assailants ‘Bakit, talu-talo na ba tayo?’ He then carried his brother with his left hand and us[ed] his right hand to parry x x x several stab thrusts thrown by the assailants.&nbsp; He was able to destroy the wall of the comfort room despite the presence of all the accused blocking their escape.&nbsp; The door led them outside the MC Kitchenette.&nbsp; Seeing a pedicab, he immediately boarded his wounded brother therein.&nbsp; However, the driver was hesitant to drive them away because of the trouble that took place so he decided to look for another pedicab and brought Crispin home.&nbsp; His brother was still stable inside the pedicab because he managed to divulge to him the names of his assailants.&nbsp; He immediately noticed the blood oozing from the left side of the neck of Crispin as he was speaking.&nbsp; Upon reaching home, he woke up his mother and they transferred Crispin to another vehicle.&nbsp; Two policemen later on blocked and asked them where they were taking the victim.&nbsp; One of their companions instead uttered ‘Putang-ina ninyo, mamamatay na ang tao pinipigilan pa ninyo.’ He knew the assailants of his brother because he was once a fisherman like them.&nbsp; Accused Andring de Leon frequents the billiard hall in their place.&nbsp; He remembers the incidents that transpired between Crispin and accused Rudy Manlapaz alias Talakitok when his brother denied the request of the accused for some fish catch.&nbsp; Accused Manlapaz threatened Crispin that should they see each other again he would kill him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></u><br></div><br>Denial and alibi are alleged by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He faults the trial court for having given probative value to the supposed dying declaration of the victim.&nbsp; The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo,</span> he adds, erred in giving too much weight and credence to the allegedly doubtful testimony of the prosecution’s principal witness.&nbsp; Appellant presents the following version of the facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote>“Accused CONRADO DE LEON testified that on June 23, 1995, he was in Montalban, Rizal with his in-laws.&nbsp; He was particularly with his mother-in-law, his wife and his children.&nbsp; He started living in Montalban since he was released from jail in July 31, 1994 up to August 1996 when he and his wife separated.&nbsp; After his separation from his wife, he then went home to Navotas.&nbsp; On April 21, 1997, he was arrested at Petron Gas station at Tangos, allegedly in connection with a stabbing incident that took place in Navotas.&nbsp; He [did] not know at all, the victim in this case.&nbsp; He came to know that he was being implicated in this case when the parole officer went to him at Montalban to inform him that he was being accused of the stabbing incident in Navotas.&nbsp; Thereafter, he went to see Barangay Captain Armando Roque and the latter told him that the killers of the victim at the Navotas stabbing incident were already known and he (accused) was not involved.&nbsp; According to Brgy. Captain Armando Roque, the killers were Alejandro de Leon, his (accused[’s]) cousin and a certain Rudy Talakitok whom he [did] not know personally at all.<br><br>“ARMANDO ROQUE testified that on June 23, 1995, at around 3:00 o’clock a.m., his attention was called by the Barangay tanods regarding a stabbing incident that took place at M. Naval St., Tangos, Navotas, Metro Manila.&nbsp; He went to the scene of the incident.&nbsp; There, he conducted an investigation of the vicinity.&nbsp; A waitress at the KC Snack House told him that it was Andring de Leon and Talakitok who stabbed the victim Crispin dela Peña.&nbsp; After he conducted the investigation, he went home as it was already early morning.&nbsp; He was not able to prepare a report because their secretary was no longer present at that time.&nbsp; He disclosed that he [was] related to Andring de Leon since the wife of Andring de Leon [was] her relative.&nbsp; Two months after the incident, Conrado de Leon dropped by at the Barangay to inquire about his alleged involvement in the stabbing incident.&nbsp; He told Conrado de Leon that what he (appellant) was thinking [was] not true because he (witness) conducted his own investigation and only 2 persons were implicated namely Andring de Leon and Talakitok.<br><br>“ELENITA LIRIO y VILLACARTA testified that she knows the accused Conrado de Leon because he was her common law husband since 1986.&nbsp; They lived together in Montalban.&nbsp; On June 23, 1995, he was in Montalban together with the accused Conrado de Leon, her mother and children.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>In finding appellant guilty of murder, the RTC gave full faith and credence to the testimony of the prosecution’s witness, Reynaldo de la Peña, who had positively identified the former as one of the perpetrators of the crime.&nbsp; It likewise accepted the dying declaration of the victim regarding his death and deemed such declaration to have been made under the consciousness of his impending death.&nbsp; These circumstances were held to prevail over appellant’s defense of denial and alibi.&nbsp; Finally, the lower court also ruled that the killing was attended by treachery.<br><br>Not satisfied with the judgment, appellant has lodged this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></div><br>In his appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“I<br></div><br>The trial court erred in giving probative value to the supposed dying declaration of the victim despite the fact that the same was not made under the consciousness of an impending death.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“II<br></div><br>The trial court erred in giving credence to the testimony of prosecution eyewitness Reynaldo Dela Peña.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“III<br></div><br>The trial court erred in not giving any probative value to the defense of alibi interposed by accused-appellant.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“IV<br></div><br>The trial court erred when it directly participated in the active cross-examination of defense witness Armando Roque.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“V<br></div><br>Assuming <i>in arguendo</i> that the accused-appellant is guilty, the trial court erred in convicting him as a principal instead of just [as] an accomplice, in view of the fact that there is no evidence which shows that he acted in conspiracy with his co-accused.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“VI<br></div><br>The trial court committed reversible error when it ruled that treachery attended the commission of the crime.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>We shall discuss the assigned errors in the following sequence:&nbsp;

Being in the middle of the scene when the stabbing incident occurred, he was in a natural situation in which to look at the persons involved in the brawl.&nbsp; Experience dictates that precisely because of the unusual acts of violence committed right before their eyes, witnesses can remember with a high degree of reliability the identity of criminals at any given time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>More telling is the fact that the victim was the witness’ very own brother.&nbsp; De la Peña could not just have sat there and remained indifferent to the whole incident.&nbsp; In fact, he said in his testimony that he had come to his brother’s aid.&nbsp; With a chair, he tried to parry the further thrusts of the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Because he was directly involved in the face-to-face assault, it would have been highly improbable for him not to have observed their faces.<br><br>This Court has noted in many crimes of violence that the most natural reaction of persons involved in an attack is to strive to see the faces and the appearances of the assailants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> to observe the manner in which the crime was committed, and to approximate what might be the latter’s next move, either as an instinctive reaction or as a measure to fend off any further attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Time and time again, this Court has declared that when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court.&nbsp; That is, unless it plainly overlooked certain facts or circumstances of substance and value which, if considered, might well affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This doctrine is premised on the undisputed fact that, since the trial court had the best opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while on the stand, it was in a position to discern whether or not they were telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The unbending jurisprudence is that its findings on the matter of credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Appellant has not given the Court sufficient reason to deviate from this doctrine.<br><br><u><b><i>Discrepancy Between the Sworn<br>Statement and the Court Testimony</i></b></u><br><br>Appellant also faults De la Peña for having made an assertion in his Sworn Statement that was inconsistent with his court testimony.&nbsp; In his Affidavit, the question “<i>Bakit talo-talo na ba tayo?</i>” supposedly came from him; in his testimony, he said that these words were uttered by his brother, the victim.<br><br>This inconsistency is minor and does not shatter the credibility of the witness and his testimony.&nbsp; We have repeatedly held that minor disparities in the narration of witnesses do not detract from their essential credibility, as long as their testimonies are coherent and intrinsically believable on the whole, particularly<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> when, as in this case, there is consistency in the narration of the principal occurrence and in the positive identification of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Neither does the alleged conflict between the Sworn Statement and the testimony of De la Peña in open court vitiate his credibility.&nbsp; It has been held that affiants are not necessarily discredited by discrepancies between their testimonies on the witness stand and their generally incomplete <i>ex parte</i> statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Basic is the rule that affidavits taken <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> are considered to be incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which witnesses may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for their accurate recollection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Affidavits are generally subordinated in importance to open court declarations, because the former are often executed when affiants’ mental faculties are not in such state as to afford them a fair opportunity to narrate in full the incidents that have transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Moreover, testimonial evidence carries more weight than an affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>What is clear is that the responsibility of appellant for the victim’s death was indubitably established by both his Sworn Statement and his testimony.<br><br><u><i><b>Denial and Alibi</b></i></u><br><br>Appellant vigorously denies any participation in the death of Crispin de la Peña, maintaining that he was at the house of his mother-in-law in Montalban, Rizal when the stabbing incident occurred.<br><br>In the light of the positive identification of appellant as the perpetrator of the crime, his denial and alibi cannot be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Well-settled is the rule that the positive identification of the accused, when categorical and consistent and without any ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defenses are negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In any event, alibi is the weakest of all defenses, because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.&nbsp; For it to prosper, proof that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed is insufficient; he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> We quote with approval the findings of the trial court on this matter:<br><blockquote>“In his defense, accused Conrado de Leon denied any involvement in the incident at issue.&nbsp; He insinuated that he could not have committed the act complained of on June 23, 1995 because he was staying at the house of his mother-in-law in Montalban, Rizal from the time he was released from jail on July 31, 1994 and it was only in August 1996 when he returned to Navotas.&nbsp; It is by now a stale and trite principle that for alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed.&nbsp; It must likewise be demonstrated that he was also so far away that he could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that the evidence for the defense is bereft of any showing that it is highly improbable for accused Conrado de Leon to be at M. Naval St., Tangos, Navotas at the time of the commission of the crime charged[,] considering [that] the distance of the two places can be negotiated [in] just a matter of hours, nothing was established to prove that the accused could not in any way have participated in the killing of the victim.&nbsp; The defense suffers infirmity because it was only corroborated by the former live-in partner of the accused whose previous relationship with him would not erase the motive of helping her common-law-husband even to the extent of testifying falsely.&nbsp; Similarly, the declaration of Bgy. Tanod Armando Roque should likewise be rejected not only on account of being hearsay but likewise his relation to the wife of one of the accused is sufficient enough to cast doubt on his credibility.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>This finding of the trial court is based on the well-entrenched rule that when the alibi of the accused can be confirmed only by relatives and friends who may not be impartial witnesses, a denial merits scant consideration, especially in the face of an eyewitness’ affirmative testimony on the presence of the accused in the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><u><b><i>Participation of the Trial Judge</i></b></u><br><br>Neither can appellant find solace in his attack against the trial judge who, allegedly “itching to convict the accused-appellant[,] started cross-examining the witness even before the public prosecutor could ask his first question, thereby taking over from the prosecution the task of impeaching Armando Roque’s credibility.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As this Court has held, the participation of judges in the conduct of trials cannot be condemned outrightly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> They cannot be expected to remain always passive and stoic during the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> After all, they are not prohibited from asking questions when proper and necessary.&nbsp; In fact, this Court has repeatedly ruled that judges "must be accorded a reasonable leeway in asking [witnesses] questions x x x as may be essential to elicit relevant facts and to bring out the truth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This means that “questions designed to clarify points and to elicit additional relevant evidence are not improper.&nbsp; Also, the judge, being the arbiter, may properly intervene in the presentation of evidence to expedite and prevent unnecessary waste of time.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Trial judges may examine some of the witnesses for the defense for the purpose of ferreting out the truth and getting to the bottom of the facts.&nbsp;

An accusation of unfairness cannot be supported when his intention was merely to elicit the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As this Court has already ruled, judges may ask questions that would elicit the facts of the issues involved, clarify ambiguous remarks by witnesses, and address the points that may have been overlooked by counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Second Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Antemortem Statement</i></b></u><br></div><br>Equally important is the fact that the evidence for the prosecution is corroborated not only by De la Peña’s positive identification of appellant, but also by an antemortem statement of the victim given to the latter’s mother, Simeona de la Peña.&nbsp; The victim identified appellant and his co-accused as the perpetrators of the crime.<br><br>Antemortem statements are governed by Section 37 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court, which we quote below:<br><blockquote>“Sec. 37. <i>Dying declaration</i> - The declaration of a dying person, made under the consciousness of an impending death, may be received in any case wherein his death is the subject of inquiry, as evidence of the cause and surrounding circumstances of such death.”</blockquote>A dying declaration, also known as an antemortem statement or a statement <i>in articulo mortis</i>, is one that refers to the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death and is made under the consciousness of impending death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Because of its necessity and trustworthiness, it is admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.&nbsp; Necessity, because the declarant’s death makes it impossible for him to take the witness stand;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and trustworthiness, for when a person is at the point of death, every motive for falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>An antemortem statement is admissible, provided the following requisites are present: (1) death is imminent and the declarant is conscious of that fact; (2) the declaration refers to the cause and surrounding circumstances of such death; (3) the declaration relates to a fact that the victim is competent to testify to; and (4) the declaration is offered in a case wherein the declarant’s death is the subject of the inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Appellant disputes the victim’s antemortem statement for not having been made under the consciousness of impending death.&nbsp; This issue is a matter of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> It must be shown that the declaration was made under a realization that one’s demise or at least its imminence, not so much its rapid occurrence, was at hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This may be proven by the statement of the victim or inferred from the nature and the extent of the victim’s wounds or other relevant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The attendant circumstances in this case point to no other conclusion than that the victim must have realized the seriousness of his condition and was therefore under an impression of impending death.&nbsp; This was borne out by his physical condition, especially the nature and the extent of his wounds.&nbsp; This much was found by the RTC which ruled:<br><blockquote>“x x x.&nbsp; While the prosecution did not establish in so many words that the victim, when he spoke of the incident, was conscious of his impending death, this Court believes that the exception of dying declaration has been substantially complied with, it appearing that on the said occasion the victim was in a serious condition, was speaking very softly, his eyes were already drooping and could hardly communicate unless [he] moved closer to the ears of his mother.&nbsp; Furthermore, judged by the nature of the stab wounds inflicted, the victim could not ignore the seriousness of his condition.&nbsp; It may be deduced with certainty that although the victim’s mind seemed clear, yet [he] did not express that he felt he was dying and that he lost all hope of surviving the stabbing incident, still he was [in] that condition.&nbsp; In fact, minutes after the victim made the statements, he expired.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote>This finding is supported by the testimony of the mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to whom the declaration was communicated.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Third Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Proof of Conspiracy</i></b></u><br></div><br>Appellant argues that there is no showing that he had any previous agreement or understanding with his co-accused to kill the victim.&nbsp; Appellant then submits that, assuming he is guilty, his participation in the crime is limited to holding the hands of the victim while the latter was being stabbed by the co-accused.&nbsp; Thus, appellant argues that he can be held only as an accomplice.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; There is no doubt that appellant and his co-accused acted in conspiracy because of their concerted actions in attacking and stabbing the victim.&nbsp; Direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy; it may be inferred from the acts of the assailants before, during, and after the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In a conspiracy, it is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim; what is important is that all participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to indicate an unmistakably common purpose or design to bring about the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Thus, the act of one becomes the act of all, and each of the accused will thereby be deemed equally guilty of the crime committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>To be sure, there must be a showing that each co-accused cooperated in the commission of the offense, either morally -- through advice, encouragement or agreement -- or materially through external acts indicating a manifest intent to efficaciously supply aid in the perpetration of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Appellant held the hands of the victim and rendered the latter helpless while being stabbed by Andring de Leon.&nbsp; These acts showed that appellant had knowledge of his companions’ criminal design, and that he had indispensable participation therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It is immaterial that he merely held the hands of the victim while the latter was being stabbed by the co-accused.&nbsp; In view of the presence of conspiracy, all the perpetrators of the crime bear equal responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Fourth Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Presence of Treachery</i></b></u><br></div><br>However, we do not agree with the finding of the trial court that treachery attended the killing.&nbsp; Well-settled is the rule that treachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence as conclusively as the killing itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The same degree of proof to dispel any reasonable doubt is required before treachery may be considered as an aggravating or a qualifying circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Any doubt as to its existence must be resolved in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person while employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof, tending directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> To prove treachery, the following must be shown: (1) the employment of such means of execution as would give the person attacked no opportunity for self-defense or retaliation and (2) the deliberate and conscious adoption of the means of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Inevitably, where treachery is alleged, the manner of attack must be proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Without any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act that resulted in the victim’s death unfolded, treachery cannot be appreciated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> It is not sufficient that the victim was unarmed and that the means employed by the malefactor brought about the desired result.&nbsp; The prosecution must prove that appellant deliberately and consciously adopted such means, method or manner of attack as would deprive the victim of an opportunity for self-defense or retaliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the prosecution’s principal witness testified that he had actually witnessed the stabbing, but not the commencement of the attack.&nbsp; In fact, he himself declared that the commotion had begun outside the establishment he was in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Where, as in this case, there is no proof of the circumstances surrounding the manner in which the aggression commenced, appellant should be given the benefit of the doubt and treachery cannot be considered.&nbsp; Because there was no showing of the particulars on the manner in which the aggression was commenced or how the act that resulted in the death of the victim began and developed, we cannot hold that treachery has been established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Neither can the commencement of the aggression be established conclusively by the victim’s antemortem statement.&nbsp; Although, taken together with the witness’ testimony, it indubitably established the fact that the accused and his co-defendants were the victim’s assailants, it did not state how the attack began.<br><br>True, the essence of treachery is the swiftness and the unexpectedness of an attack upon an unsuspecting and unarmed victim who has not given the slightest provocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> However, the suddenness of the attack does not, by itself, suffice to support a finding of <i>alevosia</i> even if the purpose is to kill, so long as the decision is sudden and the victim’s helpless position is accidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In order to appreciate treachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression, as in the present case, it must be shown to have been present at the inception of the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Since the presence of treachery at the commencement of the aggression was not conclusively established by the prosecution, this circumstance cannot be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Thus, appellant can be convicted only of homicide,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> for which the penalty that may be imposed under the Revised Penal Code is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance that can properly be appreciated, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> after the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<br><br>As regards appellant’s pecuniary liabilities, we affirm the award of P50,000 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>, consistent with current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> and P30,000 as moral damages.&nbsp;
