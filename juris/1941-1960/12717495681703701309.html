				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In October&nbsp; 1954 Josefina&nbsp; Mortel&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Manila court&nbsp; of&nbsp; first instance a&nbsp; complaint against Anacleto F. Aspiras&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cesar Aspiras&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 24414)&nbsp; alleging substantially:<br><br>That posing as a bachelor Anacleto&nbsp; courted her in 1952 in Romblon province, and&nbsp; persuaded her to come to&nbsp; Manila for their&nbsp; wedding; that for&nbsp; such purpose she arrived in the city, and&nbsp; stayed in the house of her sister&nbsp; in&nbsp; Pasay, where Anacleto,&nbsp; repeating his&nbsp; assurances&nbsp; of&nbsp; marriage lived with her as her husband; that subsequently, heeding plaintiff's insistence on the wedding, Anacleto accompanied her to the&nbsp; City Hall&nbsp; to obtain&nbsp; a marriage license; that there he&nbsp; introduced his son&nbsp; Cesar&nbsp; to her&nbsp; as&nbsp; a nephew, and&nbsp; then left them both in&nbsp; the building, after&nbsp; saying that Cesar already knew&nbsp; what to do; that&nbsp; with the help of Atty. Moises Espino&nbsp; both&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; a marriage license; that several days later plaintiff was made to marry Cesar Aspiras in the presence of Anacleto, who led her to&nbsp; believe she was really marrying&nbsp; him thru Cesar&nbsp; Aspiras as a proxy; that after such marriage ceremony she continued to live with Anacleto&nbsp; as his wife—never with&nbsp; Cesar,&nbsp; with whom she never had amorous relations; and that she had a baby born January 24, 1954 of defendant Anacleto Aspiras, who turned out to be&nbsp; married to another woman. She asked&nbsp; for annulment&nbsp; of&nbsp; her marriage to Cesar Aspiras, and&nbsp; for judgment&nbsp; requiring defendants to&nbsp; pay her, jointly and severally, a&nbsp; monthly allowance of P150.00 and damages&nbsp; in&nbsp; the total&nbsp; sum of P72,580.00.<br><br>On&nbsp; November 9,&nbsp; 1954 defendants filed a motion to dismiss on&nbsp; two&nbsp; grounds:&nbsp; no&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action, and&nbsp; prior judgment in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 19115 of the same court.<br><br>On February 11, 1955, the court issued an order saying,<br><blockquote>"Upon motion&nbsp; of the defendants this case is dismissed it being a repetition of Civil Case No. 19115 (Josefina Mortel <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span> Anacleto Aspiras and&nbsp; Cesar Aspiras) which was dismissed upon separate motions of the parties in the order of this Court of April 11, 1953."</blockquote>The plaintiff moved for reconsideration, but her motion was denied in&nbsp; a court resolution explaining that this case "is a reiteration substantially of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old case No. 19115" *&nbsp; * * which&nbsp; was&nbsp; "dismissed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; separate&nbsp; motions of both parties" and such "dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions of Sec- 4, Rule 30 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court".<br><br>Consequently the plaintiff appealed to this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; alleging error in the application of Rule 30 section 4, inasmuch as the matter&nbsp; was&nbsp; governed by sec. 1 of same Rule 30.<br><br>Civil Case No. 19115 was admittedly filed March 1953. The allegations of&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; therein were practically the same&nbsp; as those&nbsp; in the present litigation; before&nbsp; filing of the answer, plaintiff Josefina Mortel submitted on April 9,&nbsp; 1953 a motion to dismiss her complaint "stating that .she was in fact and&nbsp; in truth married to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Cesar Aspiras&nbsp; and&nbsp; that Anactieto F. Aspiras&nbsp; participated in&nbsp; the solemnization of the&nbsp; marriage as father of Cesar Aspiras, and that she filed her&nbsp; said complaint at the height of anger and thus the contents thereof did not represent her true sentiments"&nbsp; (29 Record on Appeal).&nbsp; It is also admitted that on April&nbsp; 1, 1953 the defendants&nbsp; in said Civil Case No.&nbsp; 19115 presented a motion to dismiss, asserting the&nbsp; plaintiff had no cause of action because she&nbsp; "was a school&nbsp; teacher, knew that she contracted marriage with Cesar Aspiras and there was no misrepresentation or fraud perpetrated against her."&nbsp;&nbsp; (15, 29 Recdrd on Appeal.)<br><br>There is no question that on April 11, 1953 the court issued, in&nbsp; said civil case, an order&nbsp; stating, "upon separate motions of both parties the complaint is hereby dismissed".<br><br>For&nbsp; the sake of clearness&nbsp; the rules&nbsp; cited by both sides are&nbsp; quoted:<br><blockquote>"SECTION&nbsp; 1. Dismissal by the plaintiff.—An action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without&nbsp; order of court by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service of the answer. Unless otherwise stated in the notice, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that&nbsp; * * *.<br><br>"SEC.&nbsp; 4. Effect of dismissal on other&nbsp; grounds.—Unless otherwise ordered by&nbsp; the court, any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, operates an adjudication&nbsp; upon the merits."&nbsp; (Rule&nbsp; 30, Rules of&nbsp; Court.)<br></blockquote>There is another section that may&nbsp; be pertinent:<br><blockquote>"SEC,&nbsp; 2. By order of the court.—Except as provided in&nbsp; the preceding section,&nbsp; an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court&nbsp; and&nbsp; upon such&nbsp; terms and conditions as the court deems proper.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Unless&nbsp; otherwise specified in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order, a dismissal under&nbsp; this paragraph&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be without prejudice.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>In the light of the above provisions, let us examine what transpired in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 19115.&nbsp; Before the&nbsp; answer was&nbsp; made, plaintiff filed a "Motion&nbsp; to Withdraw&nbsp; and/or Dismiss";&nbsp; and she asked the court "that the complaint * *&nbsp; * be withdrawn and/or&nbsp; dismissed".&nbsp; At first glance her&nbsp; pleading does not fall exactly <i>within the letter</i> of the "notice" contemplated by Section 1.&nbsp; In addition it asked for a court order of dismissal.<br><br>But if it does not fall under section&nbsp; 1, it may be considered as&nbsp; a motion which the court could dispose of under section 2.&nbsp; When acting under such section to court could consult the wishes&nbsp; of the defendant.&nbsp; The defendant may <i>object;</i> but the court may order dismissal, and such order is without prejudice.&nbsp; Wherefore if the defendant <i>agrees,</i> the order is&nbsp; a <i>fortiori</i>&nbsp; also without prejudice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless otherwise&nbsp; expressly stated,&nbsp; of&nbsp; course.<br><br>Now then, the defendants' motion to dismiss in April 1953 could in legal contemplation be deemed&nbsp; a conformity to plaintiff's motion to withdraw.&nbsp; Therefore, the&nbsp; court's order upon both motions should be without prejudice, under section 2.<br><br>On the other hand, viewing the pleading with liberality<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[a]</sup> and seeing thru the form to the substance, the plaintiffs "motion&nbsp; to withdraw or dismiss"&nbsp; of April 9&nbsp; amounted practically to a "notice" of dismissal, before service of the answer, because it advised the defendants of plaintiff's desire to withdraw.&nbsp; Its caption did not alter nor disguise its nature as&nbsp; plaintiff's statement of her determination to drop&nbsp; the matter.&nbsp; It contemplated,&nbsp; it is true, a court order of dismissal; but it was&nbsp; not thereby&nbsp; taken&nbsp; out of the purview of section 1, since even after a "notice" given under said section, a court's order of dismissal would not be incongruous.&nbsp; Defendant's conformity, if openly given, would&nbsp; be surplusage, and would not modify the ensuing juridical situation.<br><br>As we see section 1, when the plaintiff files the&nbsp; notice, the matter is dismissed without <i>the necessity&nbsp; of a court</i> order; but a court order&nbsp; may subsequently be entered definitely taking cognizance of the withdrawal and shelving the <i>ezpediente,</i>&nbsp; without thereby throwing&nbsp; the matter out of the scope of said section 1 (<i>b</i>).<br><br>Being&nbsp; then of the opinion that the proceedings In&nbsp; Civil Case No. 19115 could be classified either under section 1 or under section 2, we cannot but declare&nbsp; section 4 to be inapplicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, we hold the dismissal to be without prejudice.&nbsp; At most, defendants may contend that the order of April 11,&nbsp; 1953 was also an&nbsp; order sustaining their motion to dismiss for lack of cause of action, such order barring^ subsequent litigation.&nbsp; In fact such was their contention in the court below,&nbsp;&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 27 Record on Appeal.) However, we do not believe that the court's order meant to declare that plaintiff had no cause of action.&nbsp; It did not say, "for the reasons stated in defendant's motion" the case is dismissed.&nbsp; It merely stated "upon separate motions of both parties the complaint is dismissed"—which ordinarily could mean "since both parties ask for dismissal, the case is dismissed".&nbsp; In all probability the&nbsp; court did not stop to consider the merits of the controversy"&nbsp; Indeed it would be a debatable point whether the court could still properly delve into the merits of the case <i>after plaintiff</i> had with drawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[b]</sup><br><br>Anyway, even granting that the court's order also held that no cause of action&nbsp; existed, the situation would be one wherein the order was&nbsp; both provisional and final in character (if that is legally possible).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then&nbsp; it would not&nbsp; be fair&nbsp; to apply such finality&nbsp; to plaintiff,&nbsp; since she would thereby be forever barred from submitting her&nbsp; claim&nbsp; to the courts, although she had reasons to believe the&nbsp; order was&nbsp; a provisional dismissal.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; considering the order as provisional, defendants would not&nbsp; be unduly prejudiced&nbsp; nor definitely harmed, because they are not&nbsp; deprived of the opportunity to&nbsp; defend themselves. Defendants should have insisted either that the court make a specific ruling upon their&nbsp; motion&nbsp; or that the dismissal be expressly made <i>with</i> prejudice.<br><br>It may be stated in this connection that we are all the more inclined to permit this new&nbsp; litigation, because&nbsp; in another expediente we&nbsp; have just decided, (of which we may take judicial notice) (Adm. Case No. 154, Mortel <i>vs.</i> Aspiras), evidence has been introduced indicating that the plaintiff's motion for dismissal had been prepared at the request of defendant Anacleto Aspiras who promised plaintiff full support,—and that there is<i> prima facie</i> merit to her claims for annulment and damages.<br><br>This is verily one instance requiring liberal construction of the Rules for the purpose of&nbsp; assisting the parties to obtain just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their controversies—without regard to technical objections that do not square with the ends of justice.<br><br>The&nbsp; appealed order&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby reversed&nbsp; and&nbsp; the case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[a]</sup> Pleadings to be liberally construed.&nbsp; Sec. 17 Rule 15.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[b]</sup> It might be argued that under section 1 the notice automatically dismissed the case "without prejudice" and the order of the court was&nbsp; a&nbsp; surplusage,&nbsp; in no way construable&nbsp; as&nbsp; implying dismissal with prejudice.<br></div>
