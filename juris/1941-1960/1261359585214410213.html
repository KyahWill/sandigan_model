				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners-appellants herein seek to review by&nbsp; way of certiorari a decision&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, dated June 18,&nbsp; 1957, which in effect affirmed&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of the trial court of October 18, 1956, for immediate execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; its order of January 3, 1956, ordering the defendants herein petitioners, to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P2,238.50, which was found to be their share in the income of the property&nbsp; in controversy.&nbsp; The assignment of errors presented before us is as follows:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>"THE HONORABLE&nbsp; COURT OF APPEALS&nbsp; ERRED IN HOLDING&nbsp; THAT THE&nbsp; PETITIONERS-APPELLANTS&nbsp; HAVE&nbsp; CONSISTENTLY&nbsp; DENIED&nbsp; TO THE&nbsp; RESPONDENTS THE RIGHT TO SHARE IN THE INCOME&nbsp; IN THE PARCEL&nbsp; OF LAND SUBJECT&nbsp; OF&nbsp; LITIGATION&nbsp; IN&nbsp; THE&nbsp; CIVIL&nbsp; CASE NO. 813 IN THE&nbsp; COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE&nbsp; OF RIZAL,&nbsp; PASAY CITY BRANCH.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>"THE HONORABLE&nbsp; COURT OF APPEALS&nbsp; ERRED IN HOLDING&nbsp; THAT THE&nbsp; SAID CIVIL&nbsp; CASE NO. 313 HAS BEEN DRAGGING ON SINCE 1947.<br><br><center>Ill<br></center><br>"THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AS WELL AS THE HONORABLE COURT&nbsp; OF ORIGIN ERRED AND&nbsp; COMMITTED&nbsp; A SERIOUS ABUSE&nbsp; OF DISCRETION&nbsp; IN&nbsp; NOT&nbsp; COMPLETING "WITH&nbsp; THE REQUIREMENTS&nbsp; OF RULE 39, SECTION 2 OF THE RULES OF COURT.<br></blockquote>It is apparent that the first two errors assigned involve findings of fact of the Court of Appeals, which under the law we may not change or modify.&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining alleged error&nbsp; is as&nbsp; to whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; both courts committed&nbsp; a serious abuse of discretion "in not completing [complying] with the requirements of Rule 39, Section&nbsp; 2, of the Rules of Court."<br><br>The facts in this case as found by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals are&nbsp; contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; decision, the pertinent portions&nbsp; of which we are&nbsp; quoting below for purposes of reference:<br><blockquote>"It appears that on March 13, 1954 the respondent Judge&nbsp; ordered the parties&nbsp; in the aforesaid Civil Case&nbsp; No. 313&nbsp; to present&nbsp; their evidence before a Deputy Clerk&nbsp; of Court, who was duly authorized as commissioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive the evidence, in order to resolve the question of accounting of&nbsp; the income from the salt and fish products of the parcel&nbsp; of land object&nbsp; of said case; that hearings were subsequently held before said commissioner; that on June 21, 1955, the commissioner submitted his report of the hearings on the account; that&nbsp; on, January 3,&nbsp; 1956 the&nbsp; respondent Judge&nbsp; issued an&nbsp; order approving said report and finding the plaintiffs in the aforementioned case,&nbsp; respondents herein,&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of P2,238.80&nbsp; as their share in the&nbsp; income of&nbsp; the land controverted therein, and ordering the defendants to pay to the&nbsp; plaintiffs the above-mentioned amount; that on April 17, 1956, the defendants therein—petitioners here—filed a motion for reconsideration and new trial, which motion was&nbsp; denied by the respondent court;&nbsp; that on September&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1956 plaintiffs filed a motion for&nbsp; immediate execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of January 3, 1956; that&nbsp; on October 18, 1956&nbsp; the respondent Judge issued&nbsp; an order granting the motion for&nbsp;&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; execution; that&nbsp; on November 14, 1956,&nbsp; defendants filed a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; of the order of October 18, 1956;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on December 14, 1956, the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; issued an order denying&nbsp; the motion for reconsideration and the&nbsp; filing of a supersedeas bond;&nbsp; that on January 8, 1957, defendant filed the&nbsp; present petition&nbsp; for certiorari with&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court; and&nbsp; that, while said petition was pending here, or on February 28, 1957, the respondent court approved the amended record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal filed by defendants,&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioners."<br></blockquote>The position taken by the petitioners-appellants is that the order granting the order for&nbsp; immediate execution did not&nbsp; contain specific and good reasons te&nbsp; qualify&nbsp; it as "special" and that,&nbsp; furthermore, neither could&nbsp; the bond filed by the respondents be considered&nbsp; as special reasons considering its meager amount which is inadequate to cover the consequential damages that may be&nbsp; suffered by&nbsp; reason of the immediate execution of the order; and, lastly, that the trial&nbsp; court had no sufficient&nbsp; justification&nbsp; for denying the&nbsp; supersedeas bond&nbsp; offered&nbsp; by petitioners.<br><br>It may be&nbsp; that the&nbsp; order&nbsp; granting the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for immediate execution did not exactly mention the good&nbsp; and special reasons&nbsp; required&nbsp; by Rule 39,&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of Court and that&nbsp; it could well&nbsp; have&nbsp; mentioned the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; However, we have authorities <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect that statement by reference in the order is sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this&nbsp; case, the order made&nbsp; reference to the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for execution itself which motion&nbsp; stated or alleged the reasons justifying immediate execution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; said good reasons may be found in the&nbsp; record of the&nbsp; case and were found as facts&nbsp; in the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, thus:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; main action in said&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 313 has been dragging&nbsp; on since 1947.&nbsp; It&nbsp; has already been decided therein by final&nbsp; judgment that the respondents are co-owners of the land in question. As a consequence, the respondents&nbsp; are entitled to share&nbsp; in the income of the parcels of land.&nbsp; The petitioners have consistently denied to the respondents the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; share in the income of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said parcel of&nbsp; land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners took&nbsp; their own&nbsp; sweet time&nbsp; to perfect their appeal.&nbsp; Respondents have offered to file—and did file—a bond to answer for any damage which the petitioners may suffer by reason of&nbsp; the enforcement of the writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution.&nbsp; These&nbsp; are among the reasons alleged in&nbsp; their motion for immediate&nbsp; execution of the judgment&nbsp; (Annex "7" of respondent's Answer) which the respondent Judge granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe and hold that the same are&nbsp; good&nbsp; and valid reasons for the issuances of the&nbsp; order of execution complained of&nbsp; It has been held by the Supreme&nbsp; Court that where&nbsp; an intestate proceeding has&nbsp; been pending&nbsp; for several years, an immediate execution of&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; is in&nbsp; order (Crisanto de Borja <i>vs.</i> Judge Encarnacion et al, L-4179, May&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1951), and that the filing of bond by&nbsp; the successful&nbsp; party is&nbsp; a&nbsp; special ground for ordering execution.&nbsp; (Hacienda Navarra, Inc. <i>vs.</i> Labrador, et al., 70 Phil., 48.)<br></blockquote>It has&nbsp; been held&nbsp; that the&nbsp; dilatory nature of&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal and the&nbsp; filing of a bond by the&nbsp; appellee may be regarded as&nbsp; good and special&nbsp; reason&nbsp; within the meaning of Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court:<br><blockquote>"The above section simplifies and clarifies the old provision.&nbsp; It provides&nbsp; that prior to&nbsp; the expiration of&nbsp; the time&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; the court may issue&nbsp; execution on motion of&nbsp; the prevailing party&nbsp; and with notice to the adverse&nbsp; party, upon good reasons&nbsp; to be stated in a special order, regardless of&nbsp; whether such order is&nbsp; issued before or after the filing of the record on appeal.&nbsp; The good reasons&nbsp; are required to be stated in the special order, but it has been&nbsp; held that statement by reference is&nbsp; sufficient, as when such reasons appear in&nbsp; a motion for execution, and reference thereto&nbsp; is made in&nbsp; the special order as&nbsp; ground therefor.&nbsp; The element that give&nbsp; validity to an order of&nbsp; execution&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of the&nbsp; good reasons if they may&nbsp; be found distinctly&nbsp; somewhere in the&nbsp; record.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In&nbsp; this connection, it has been held that the filing of bond by the successful party is a good reason for&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; execution.&nbsp; That the appeal is being taken for purposes of delay, is also a good reason."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. I,&nbsp; pp. 539-540, 1957&nbsp; Edition; Italics is supplied,)<br></blockquote>In the cases of Presbitero, et al. <i>vs.</i> Rodas, et al-, 73 Phil., 300 and Iloilo Trading <i>vs.</i> Rodas,&nbsp; 73 Phil., 327, this Court had already passed upon&nbsp; the same question&nbsp; and had ruled that the appeal being taken for&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of delay, is&nbsp; a good and special&nbsp; reason for&nbsp; ordering execution pending appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rulings&nbsp; in those cases are&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; The court stated in its order that the appeal was being taken for&nbsp; the purpose of delay.&nbsp; Assuming, as we must, that such statement&nbsp; is&nbsp; true, it&nbsp; not having been&nbsp; assailed in&nbsp; the petition, we consider it good and&nbsp; sufficient reason upon which to issue execution of the judgment pending appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dilatory tactics constitute a great drawback&nbsp; to&nbsp; the administration&nbsp; of&nbsp; justice and&nbsp; cannot be countenanced by the courts.&nbsp; We hold that the trial court neither exceeded its jurisdiction nor&nbsp; committed a&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion in ordering the execution&nbsp; of its judgment pending&nbsp; appeal, upon the reason given."&nbsp; (Presbitero, et al. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Rodas, et al., supra.)<br><br>"The&nbsp; question raised herein&nbsp; has been decided by&nbsp; us adversely to the petitioner in the recent case of Jacinto&nbsp; Presbitero, et al. <i>vs.</i> Judge Sotero&nbsp; Rodas,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp;&nbsp; (October 11, 1941)', G.&nbsp; R. No. 48121, 40&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 3673, wherein&nbsp; we held&nbsp; that&nbsp; section 2&nbsp; of Rule 39 empowers&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, in its discretion, to&nbsp; order the execution&nbsp; of its judgment pending&nbsp; appeal provided it states. good reasons&nbsp; for so doing;&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; statement of the court in its order that the appeal was being taken for&nbsp; the purpose of delay is good&nbsp; and sufficient reason&nbsp; upon which to issue execution of the judgment pending appeal, because dilatory tactics constitute a great drawback&nbsp; to&nbsp; the administration of&nbsp; justice and&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; countenanced by the courts."&nbsp; (Iloilo Trading Center and Exchange <i>vs.</i> Rodas, supra.)<br></blockquote>And in the&nbsp; cases of Hacienda Navarra, Inc.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Labrador, et al., 65 Phil.,&nbsp; 536, and Peoples Bank <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; San Jose,&nbsp; 96 Phil., 895, this Court held that&nbsp; the filing of bond by the prevailing party is a good and special reason for ordering execution pending&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; Said this Court in those cases:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The filing of the bond required by the respondent judge in the order&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be annulled constitutes a&nbsp; special&nbsp; ground authorizing&nbsp; the court to issue a writ of execution&nbsp; pending appeal, in conformity with the provisions of section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hacienda Navarra,&nbsp; Inc. <i>vs.</i> Labrador, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)<br><br>"Furthermore—and this is conclusive—there is the bond promising return of all such allowances (not exceeding P33,250.00)&nbsp; 'should it be decreed later that' Sophie M. Seffert 'was&nbsp; not entitled thereto'. It should be observed in this connection&nbsp; that the order of December 29&nbsp; expressly provides 'that the&nbsp; payments of the said&nbsp; monthly allowances&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; exceed&nbsp; the aforesaid amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P33,250.00'." (Peoples Bank <i>vs.</i> San Jose, <i>supra</i>.)<br></blockquote>As&nbsp; to the&nbsp; offer of&nbsp; petitioners-appellants&nbsp; in&nbsp; the lower court to file the&nbsp; supersedeas&nbsp; bond to stay execution, it is a well-settled&nbsp; doctrine that the approval and&nbsp; acceptance of&nbsp; a supersedeas bond to&nbsp; stay execution lies within the sound discretion&nbsp; of the trial court:<br><blockquote>"<i>Stay&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution; supersedeas&nbsp; bond;&nbsp; courts&nbsp; discretion</i>.—The power&nbsp; to grant a motion for execution before the expiration of the period for appeal is discretionary before trial&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; All&nbsp; that the law requires is&nbsp; that there be good reason which&nbsp; must be stated in the order, Rule 39, section 2, Rules of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; Execution of course may be stayed upon approval by the&nbsp; Court of a&nbsp; sufficient bond. But the&nbsp; court is not obliged to&nbsp; approve any kind of supersedeas bond filed by the parties.&nbsp; It has the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to determine in its discretion whether the supersedeas bond would sufficiently&nbsp; protect the rights of the winning party and&nbsp; accomplish the&nbsp; ends&nbsp; of justice. And in the determination of this matter&nbsp; the&nbsp; court may avail&nbsp; of reasons found in the record.&nbsp; Alliance Insurance &amp; Surety Co. <i>vs.</i> Hon. Tan, et al., 52&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 7634., December&nbsp; 31, 1956."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Velayo' Digest, 1956 Supplement&nbsp; [A], pp. 429-430).<br></blockquote>and that&nbsp; even after&nbsp; the supersedeas&nbsp; bond&nbsp; is&nbsp; filed, the lower court may&nbsp; still&nbsp; disregard it&nbsp; and&nbsp; order&nbsp; immediate execution.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of De Leon <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Soriano, 95 Phil, 806, we said:<br><blockquote>"Even&nbsp; after the filing of supersedeas bond by an appellant, intended to stay&nbsp; execution, the trial&nbsp; court may&nbsp; in its&nbsp; discretion still disregard said supersedeas bond and order&nbsp; immediate execution provided&nbsp; that there&nbsp; are&nbsp; special and compelling reasons&nbsp; justifying immediate execution."<br></blockquote>In view of the foregoing",&nbsp; we find that the trial court committed no error in granting the motion for&nbsp; immediate execution and that the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the petition seeking&nbsp; to review&nbsp; and&nbsp; annul&nbsp; said writ of immediate execution.&nbsp; Consequently, the appealed decision of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeal&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
