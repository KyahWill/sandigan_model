				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On April  6, 1950, in the Leyte court of  first  instance, plaintiffs sued defendants to  recover  P23,400.00 as damages.  On April 17, 1950,  defendants answered denying the allegations of the complaint, and setting up a counter-claim of P36,800.00.  After hearing the case on the merits, the court rendered judgment on September 5,  1953, requiring plaintiffs to pay "indemnity and  damages  in the sum of F8,325.00 to defendant  Raymond  Tomasi;  to the defendants Santiago  Gangcayco and  Manuel Gangcayco, attorneys' fees  and  expenses  of litigation in  the sum  of P700.00, and to defendant Manuel Gangcayco, damages in the sum of P210.00 <em>with legal interest on all  said sums." </em>(Italics supplied.)</p>
<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed  the judgment <em>in toto</em> on January 27, 1956.  And on petition for review, this Court  held  on  August 29, 1958, "we find  no  error in the appealed decision of the  Court of Appeals, and  so we affirm the same, with  costs."  Our  decision became final, and on the return of the expediente for execution, the judge issued this order:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the  writ of  execution to be issued in  this  case, the  legal interest to be ordered collected  on each of the  sums specified in the dispositive portion  of  this  Court's <em>decision dated  September 5, 1953,</em> should be  computed from <em>the date of said decision;</em> and only one set of costs should be taxed in favor of all the defendants collectively."   (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excepting to the  order  plaintiffs came to  this  Court. The interest,  they  contend,  should be  computed  from the time the judgment became final (August 1958) i.e., after confirmation on appeal, and not from September 5,  1953. The plaintiffs, argues their  counsel, <em>had a right to appeal</em> so there could be no demand for payment in the meantime, and therefore,  they  incurred  no  delay for  which  they should pay interest during  the pendency of their appeal.</p>
<p>The argument overlooks  the fact that <em>judicial  demand</em> for payment  was  contained in defendants'  answer.   The judgment should have required interest from that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  But since  it  ordered  interest without  specifying when  it shall  begin, and the order was affirmed <em>in toto,</em> the question arises, when  does interest  begin?  The court itself says,  from September 5, 1953.  That  is correct: not only from the  tenor of   its original  judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which  was affirmed,  but also  because  sec. 510 of  Act No.  190 provides :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC 510.<em> Interest  on Judgment Affirmed.</em>â€”When the Supreme Court shall affirm a judgment of a court below, for the recovery  of money, or shall reverse  a judgment of  a court below, and award a sum of money as debt or damages, it shall direct that interest be added to the original  judgment or sum determined to be  due, from the date of  the former judgment until the  date of the  final judgment, at the rate  of six  per  cent per annum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New Rules  of  Court did not expressly repeal  this provision.   Sec. 5  of  Rule 53 of the New Rules of Court does not conflict with it.</p>
<p>And  in  several  cases  we  have, under  analogous  circumstances,  computed  legal interest  to begin with  the decision of the court  of first instance, not  from the confirmatory  judgment   of  the appellate  court.   (See Lim Tuico <em>vs</em>. Cu-Unjieng, 21 Phil., 493; Ed. A. Keller <em>vs</em>. Ellerman, 38 Phil., 514; Cu-Unjieng <em>vs</em>. Mabalacat Sugar  Co., 54  Phil., 976.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Final judgment was rendered against plaintiff for a certain sum with interest due thereon "until the debt  shall  have been completely paid."   Defendants appealed and  judgment was  affirmed whereupon  plaintiff deposited with the court the sum and interest from  the  date  of the order of execution of the judgment.  The court  ordered payment of interest  from the date of the obligation until  the  order of execution.  Plaintiff  appealed.  <em>Held</em>:  Interest was payable as  ordered by the lower court; the appeal of defendants did not stop the running of  such interest; plaintiff could have deposited  the amount of the  judgment when  the same  was  first rendered and stopped  the  running of interest thereafter."   (Banal <em>vs</em>. Safont and Puig, 19 Phil.,  372, 19 J.  F.  386)  [Phil.  Digest, Vol.  3, pp. 2500-2501.] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed  order is affirmed, with costs.</p>
