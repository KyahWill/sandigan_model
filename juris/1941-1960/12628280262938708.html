A.&nbsp; Jones&nbsp; St.. Dumaguete&nbsp; City,&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; initiated&nbsp; the present petition in the Court of First Instance of Negros&nbsp; Oriental, wherein they prayed for a clear declaration of their rights, if&nbsp; any, under the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1180 otherwise&nbsp; known as the Retail Business Act, and for&nbsp; the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; against&nbsp; the respondent City Mayor of Dumaguete to prohibit him from issuing an&nbsp; order&nbsp; for the closing&nbsp; of their store mentioned above.<br><br>After the&nbsp; parties had&nbsp; joined issues&nbsp; and the&nbsp; case duly, heard,&nbsp; the court rendered its&nbsp; decision, the&nbsp; dispositive part of which&nbsp; is&nbsp; as follows; <br><blockquote>"Premises considered, the Court is&nbsp; of the opinion and so holds that: (1)&nbsp; The "Cebu Department Store*'&nbsp; owned and operated by Petitioners and opened to the public on&nbsp; June 11, 1951, is a new retail business in&nbsp; Dumaguete City and as such was not in existence&nbsp; in this City on May 15, 1954;&nbsp; (2) Petitioners&nbsp; do not fall within the exception provided for in paragraph 1 of Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1180, in so far as the Government&nbsp; of Dumaguete&nbsp; City is concerned; (3)&nbsp; There is no necessity for construing the provisions of the last paragraph of the same&nbsp; Section 1, as prayed for, the reason being that said provisions are not pertinent and relevant to the situation covered&nbsp; by their&nbsp; Petition;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4) In&nbsp; the&nbsp; event that respondent Mayor shall order the closure of the business of Petitioners, such action shall&nbsp; be valid and legal,&nbsp; being&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of the "Retail Business&nbsp; Act". </blockquote>Not satisfied&nbsp; with&nbsp; the decision, the petitioners perfected their appeal and now seeks its&nbsp; reversal on the ground that the trial court erred: <br><blockquote><ol><li> In holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners-appellants are not entitled&nbsp; to continue "with their&nbsp; retail business in Dumaguete&nbsp; City, as such transfer&nbsp; made by them from Cebu City&nbsp; to&nbsp; Dumaguete City if&nbsp; allowed would defeat the very&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp; Republic 1180 was granted; <br></li><li> In holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; transfer' of&nbsp; petitioners-appellants' retail business from Cebu&nbsp; City to Dumaguete&nbsp; City was done at their risk since by virtue of&nbsp; the nationwide publicity of the law given by leading newspapers they should have been aware of the same; <br></li><li> In holding that&nbsp; the "Cehu&nbsp; Department Store" of petitioners-appellants in Dumaguete City is a new business; and <br></li><li> In&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; should respondent-appellee order the&nbsp; closing of the store of petitioners-appellants, the same would be valid and legal, being in accordance with&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act 1180." </li></ol></blockquote>The question raised in the case at bar calls for the construction and application of Section 1 of Republic Act 1180 and Section 199 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code which reads as&nbsp; follows: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. (Republic Act 1180.)&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; person who is not a citizen of the Philippines, and&nbsp; no&nbsp; association, partnership,&nbsp; or corporation, the capital&nbsp; of which is not wholly owned by citizens of the&nbsp; Philippines, shall engage directly&nbsp; or indirectly in the&nbsp; retail business: <i>Provided</i>, That a person who is not&nbsp; a citizen&nbsp; of the Philippines, or&nbsp; an association, partnership,&nbsp; or&nbsp; corporation, not wholly owned by&nbsp; citizens of the Philippines, which is actually engaged in the said business on May 15,&nbsp; 1954, shall be entitled to continue to engage therein, unless its&nbsp; license is forfeited in&nbsp; accordance herewith, until&nbsp; his&nbsp; death&nbsp; or voluntary retirement from&nbsp; said business, in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; a&nbsp; natural person,&nbsp; and for a period of&nbsp; ten years from the&nbsp; date of the approval of this&nbsp; Act&nbsp; or until the expiration&nbsp; of the term of the association or&nbsp; partnership, or&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporate existence&nbsp; of the corporation, whichever&nbsp; event comes first in the case&nbsp; of juridical persons. Failure to renew a&nbsp; license&nbsp; to&nbsp; engage retail business shall&nbsp; be considered voluntary retirement. <br><br>"The license of any person who&nbsp; is not a citizen of the Philippines and of any association, partnership or corporation not wholly owned by citizens of the Philippines to engage in retail business, shall be forfeited for any violation of any provision of laws on nationalization, economic&nbsp; control, weights&nbsp; and measures, and labor&nbsp; and&nbsp; other laws relating to trade, commerce, and industry. <br><br>"No license shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued to any person&nbsp; who is not a citizen of the Philippines and to any association, partnership or corporation not wholly owned by citizens of the Philippines,&nbsp; actually engaged in the retail business, to establish&nbsp; or open&nbsp; additional stores or branches for retail business."<br><br>"Sec. 199.&nbsp; (Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code.)&nbsp; <i>Removal of business to other location.</i>—Any business for which the privilege tax has been paid may,&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; the&nbsp; regulations of the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; of Finance, be removed and&nbsp; continued in&nbsp; any&nbsp; other&nbsp; place without payment of additional&nbsp; tax during the&nbsp; term for which the payment was made." </blockquote>It&nbsp; is an undisputed&nbsp; fact that prior to the1 approval&nbsp; of Republic Act&nbsp; 1180, the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; were alien merchants actually engaged&nbsp; in the retail business and, under the provisions of said&nbsp; act, those actually&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; retail business&nbsp; at the time it was&nbsp; approved shall&nbsp; be entitled to continue&nbsp; to engage&nbsp; in&nbsp; the business&nbsp; unless their&nbsp; license is forfeited in&nbsp; accordance with law, or until the death of the retail merchant or his&nbsp; voluntary retirement from business, in the case&nbsp; of natural persons, and for a&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; ten years from the date of the approval&nbsp; of said act or until the expiration of&nbsp; the association or&nbsp; partnership,&nbsp; or of the corporate existence of the corporation,&nbsp; whichever&nbsp; event comes first,&nbsp; in the case of juridical persons."&nbsp; There&nbsp; can be no doubt, therefore,&nbsp; that under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the aforequoted law,&nbsp; the herein petitioners have right to continue their business and&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; the corresponding licenses therefor.&nbsp; There&nbsp;&nbsp; arises,&nbsp; however,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; question whether&nbsp; under the provisions&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 1180&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; could&nbsp; be considered as&nbsp; having retired&nbsp; voluntarily from business&nbsp;&nbsp; because they&nbsp; closed their&nbsp; store&nbsp; in Cebu City&nbsp; and transferred&nbsp;&nbsp; it to Dumaguete&nbsp; City.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; evidence on&nbsp; record&nbsp; shows&nbsp; that when the petitioners closed their business in Cebu City, their intention was not to retire&nbsp; voluntarily from&nbsp; business, but only, to transfer it to&nbsp; Dumaguete City in view of the failing condition of their&nbsp; business in&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; City. <br><br>The trial court dismissed the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; on two principal grounds:&nbsp; (1) That the petitioners cannot validly transfer their&nbsp; business from Cebu to Dumaguete; and (2) That the "Cebu Department Store" of petitioners in Dumaguete City is "a&nbsp; new business, a new enterprise in the City of Dumaguete&nbsp; and one that&nbsp; was not existing therein&nbsp; on May 15, 1954."&nbsp; It overlooked entirely, however, the clear provision of Section 199 of the Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code, quoted above, which has not been&nbsp; repealed either expressly or impliedly by Republic Act 1180, and the fact that the petitioners, before transferring their business from Cebu to Dumaguete, secured the annotation of such transfer on the reverse side of the privilege tax, Exhibit "A".&nbsp; The&nbsp; legality of&nbsp; such transfer,&nbsp; therefore, can in no wise be&nbsp; questioned and consequently petitioners' business in Dumaguete should not be considered as a new one in&nbsp; the contemplation of the aforementioned Republic Act 1180.&nbsp; We do not lose sight of the fact that, under the last paragraph of&nbsp; Section 1 of Republic Act 1180, the&nbsp; establishment&nbsp; or opening of additional stores or branches for retail business is prohibited, and that no license therefor shall be issued to any person who is not a citizen of the Philippines, or to&nbsp; any association, partnership&nbsp; or corporation not wholly owned by citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in this particular&nbsp; case,&nbsp; we find that the "Cebu Department Store" of the petitioners in&nbsp; Dumaguete is not an additional store or branch of their&nbsp; Department Store in Cebu City, which was closed,&nbsp; so the provisions of the last&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; of section 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; 1180 is not applicable to&nbsp; the case.<br><br>Accordingly, we hold that, under the law governing the case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners are entitled to engage in the retail business in Dumaguete City and to secure the corresponding license therefor and to pay the&nbsp; taxes due thereon. <br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; decision appealed&nbsp; from is hereby&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and the&nbsp; preliminary injunction issued in this case made permanent, enjoining the respondent Mayor not&nbsp; to close the petitioner's&nbsp; store and ordering him to issue the corresponding license for their store, without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
