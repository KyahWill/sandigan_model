				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the 
province of Quezon, which found Primitive Osi guilty of treason in all the five 
charges contained in the information and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>, with the accessory penalties of civil interdiction 
and perpetual absolute disqualification from public office, to pay a fine of 
P15,000 and the costs.
<p>This appellant is a native born Filipino citizen, married and a resident of 
Sariaya, province of Quezon, formerly enrolled in the first year of the high 
school and, before the last war, was an employee of the Manila Electric Company 
as lighting inspector. From Our perusal of the record, We find that the 
prosecution has established the following facts in connection with each 
count.</p>
<p>Under the first count, it has been shown that between 1931 and 1935, 
Primitivo Osi was the secretary of the Sakdalista Party in the municipality of 
Sariaya under Benigno Ramos. At the beginning of the Japanese occupation, he was 
the chief electrician of the Electric Light Plant in said municipality, and in 
1943, Mayor Mendoza of Sariaya appointed him president of the Japanese 
organization known as the neighborhood association in the <em>barrio</em> of 
Mamala, Sariaya. On October 20, 1944, he voluntarily joined the "Mataichi 
Kabushiki Kaisha," otherwise known as <em>Nacoco</em>, as its foreman No. 3 with 
a monthly compensation of P150. At the same time, he acted as interpreter of the 
Japanese manager of the Nacoco. On January 31, 1945, Espiridion Saracas and 
Leopoldo Luce, the first and second foreman respectively of the <em>Nacoco</em>. 
having been killed by the guerrillas in Mamala, Sariaya, his Japanese employers 
promoted this accused to the position of foreman No. 1, with the rank and title 
of "Captain." Since then, he had under his command between 300 and 400 
<em>Makapili</em> soldiers of the <em>Nacoco</em> Military Police, whom he was 
seen drilling regularly. Soon after appellant's promotion, he and his soldiers, 
jointly with the Japanese, were seen conducting punitive campaigns against 
guerrillas and their sympathizers in the municipalities of Sariaya and 
Candelaria; he and his men, without compensation, commandeered foodstuffs from 
the residents of the neighboring <em>barrios</em>, which were turned over to the 
Japanese garrison and the <em>Nacoco</em> Military Police. In December, 1944, 
this appellant posted his men at the main highways leading to the 
<em>poblacion</em> of Sariaya in order to prevent the infiltration of the 
guerrillas. Finally, upon the return of the Americans, Primitivo Osi and his 
<em>Makapili</em> soldiers, with the Japanese civilian officials of the 
<em>Nacoco</em>, retreated to the Sierra Madre mountains in the province of 
Laguna and with his Japanese masters surrendered to the American forces.</p>
<p>In support of the charge made in this count, several witnesses were put on 
the stand for the prosecution. Leonila Albiela, a resident of Candelaria, 
province of Quezon, testified that she knew Primitivo Osi as captain of the 
<em>Makapili</em> Filipino soldiers who caused the arrest of guerrilla, 
suspects, and ordered the burning of houses. Captain Osi was seen by her always 
carrying a revolver and a hand grenade. She learned that her sons and 
daughter-in-law were arrested by the <em>Makapilis</em> and upon receiving such 
information she visited Captain Primitivo Osi in his headquarters. Osi told her 
that he caused their arrest because they were suspected as guerrillas. Upon her 
supplications, Captain Osi told the witness that her sons and daughter-in-law 
would be released provided they leave the poblacion of Candelaria. After having 
been detained for about four days, the suspects were in fact released, but were 
soon arrested again.</p>
<p>At about midnight of Sunday, February 11, 1945, Captain Osi came to the house 
of the witness to re-arrest the same persons who have been released, namely, 
Iñigo Javier, Bernardo Javier, Rufino Javier, Crisanto Cristobal, Jovito 
Albiela, Marcelo Castillo, Ananias Dimayuga, and the brothers Quintin and 
Simeon. Upon the suggestion of one of the <em>Makapili</em> soldiers, the 
witness, Leonila Albiela, went to the <em>Makapili</em> garrison with food for 
the captives. After the second arrest of those persons, the witness never saw 
them again and neither knew what happened to them. Replying to questions 
propounded by the court, the witness said that Captain Osi was always seen in 
the town of Candelaria giving commands to his soldiers, the Makapilis. At about 
midnight of Sunday, February 11, 1945, the <em>Makapilis</em> burned the houses; 
led by Captain Osi, they were seen holding dried coconut leaves which they used 
as torches to burn the houses of the <em>poblacion</em> for three consecutive 
nights.</p>
<p>Another witness, Urbano Javier, husband of Leonila, landowner and a resident 
of Candelaria, said that, although at the beginning he did not know his name, 
Primitive Osi became a familiar figure in the torn of Candelaria since January, 
1945. He became well-known in the town as a man who was in command of the 
<em>Makapili</em> soldiers, who arrested persons suspected as 
<em>guerrilleros</em> and took from their owners personal belongings, including 
jewelry. He was responsible for the arrest and detention of many persons 
including his brother Iñigo Javier, his son Rufino, his nephew Bernardo and 
Jovito Albiela, and also Crisanto Cristobal, Ananias Dimayuga, the brothers 
Quintin and Simeon and one by the name Castillo. He had been inquiring about the 
means to secure their release and he was referred to Captain Osi. Captain Osi 
told him that they would be released provided they leave the <em>poblacion</em> 
of Candelaria. In the morning of Sunday, February 11, 1945, the persons arrested 
were released. But at midnight of the same clay, they were arrested again and 
conducted to the house of Dr. Nadres, which was being used at that time as the 
<em>Makapili</em> garrison. The witness went to the <em>Makapili</em> garrison 
and approached Captain Osi who promised that he would do his best for the 
release of those persons.</p>
<p>A third witness, Marcela Asinas, a resident of Candelaria, strongly 
corroborated the two previous witnesses regarding the arrest of the above-named 
persons and the fact that after their second arrest they have not returned to 
their homes and have never been seen alive again.</p>
<p><em>Count No. 2</em>. Two witnesses were placed on the stand to testify for 
the prosecution in support of this charge. Clemente Vallecer, a landowner of 
Sariaya, stated that at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of February 1, 1945, in 
company with Japanese soldiers, a group of about five <em>Makapilis</em> of the 
<em>Nacoco</em> Garrison, Sariaya, under the command of Captain Osi, called at 
his house in Sariaya. Captain Osi and two of his Filipino soldiers were each 
armed with a .45 caliber revolver. They took along his son Dominador Vallecer on 
the pretext that he was a <em>guerrillero</em>. In the morning of February 2, 
1945, the witness found the body of his son in the <em>barrio</em> of Pili with 
14 bayonet urounds, together Tilth the bodies of other victims, Dr. Wenceslao 
Rodrigo, Dominador Lopez and Eusebio Cortez. Captain Osi, who was leading the 
party of soldiers who arrested and killed his son, was known to him for the 
previous ten years, had become the head of the Nacoco garrison at Sariaya 
sometime in January, 1945, and had under his command between 300 to 400 Filipino 
soldiers. The witness further stated that on another occasion, a group of 
<em>Makapili</em> soldiers with four Japanese soldiers arrested and killed 15 
persons, residents of Sariaya.</p>
<p>The second witness Francisco Lopez, testifying in connection with this second 
count, said that he was the father of Dominador Lopez, one of those persons who 
were massacred by the <em>Makapilis</em> in the barrio of Pili on February 1, 
1945. His son was arrested by pro-Japanese Filipinos including Captain Primitive 
Osi, Bedoyo, Zoilo Remeyo and Florio Ortiola and brought to a nearby barrio and 
bayonetted to death. At about 8 o'clock in the evening of said day, Dominador 
Vallecer passed in front of his house under the custody of Primitive Osi and his 
soldiers. The appellant, with whom he was acquainted since 1932, was armed with 
a .45 caliber revolver. His son Dominador and Dominador Vallecer were arrested 
on suspicion of being guerrillas. The so-called Nacoco garrison composed of 
Japanese collaborators, and organized as a military group under the command of 
Captain Osi, without compensation commandeered foodstuffs for themselves and the 
Japanese members of the garrison in Sariaya and guarded the highways leading to 
the poblacion of Sariaya to prevent the infiltration of guerrillas.</p>
<p><em>Count No. 3</em>. Three witnesses, namely, Leonila Albiela, Urbano Javier 
and Marcela Asinas, who testified in support of the first count, also gave their 
statements in connection with this count. According to Leonila, her sons Rufino 
and Iñigo Javier and her nephews Bernardo and Jovito Albiela, who were arrested 
by the <em>Makapilis</em> under Captain Osi on suspicion of being guerrillas, 
and who were detained at the garrison for four days and released, to be 
re-arrested a few hours afterwards, by order of the appellant, were brought by 
the Japanese to the municipality of Tiaong where they were killed; in fact, up 
to the time of the hearing of this case they have not been heard from. 3he also 
testified in connection with the burning of the houses in the business district 
of Candelaria, and in the <em>barrios</em> of Pahigna, Sta. Catalina and 
Kinatahan of the same municipality, when the <em>Makapili</em> soldiers of the 
appellant, with dried coconut leaves, set fire to the buildings and houses in 
obedience to the command of Captain Osi. The accused was also seen zonifying the 
town of Candelaria, on which occasion several persons were arrested, brought to 
the Japanese garrison and were presumed to be killed by the Japanese, because of 
the fact that they were never seen nor returned home.</p>
<p>The testimony of the second witness, Urbano Javier, is of the same tenor, it 
being practically a repetition of the narration made by his wife Leonila 
Albiela. This witness made reference, however, to the arrival of Captain Osi and 
his <em>Makapili</em> soldiers in December, 1944, when they fired a machine gun 
at the cockpit, and as a result of which, a woman on the family way, was 
killed.</p>
<p>The third witness, Marcela Asinas, confirming the declarations of Leonila 
Albiela and Urbano Javier, said that on February 7, 1945, six Japanese soldiers 
with fixed bayonets and several Filipino soldiers commanded by Captain Osi, 
arrested several persons including her son Ananias Dimayuga. On that occasion, 
appellant was armed with a .45 caliber pistol and a hand grenade. Those persons 
were arrested on suspicion of being <em>guerrilleros</em> and although they were 
released after having been detained during four days, they were immediately 
re-arrested, brought to Tiaong and since then have never seen alive again or 
heard from.</p>
<p>We now come to the consideration of Count No. 4. Corazon Siscar, a public 
school teacher of Candelaria, testified that at about 6:30 p.m. of February 11, 
1945, her husband Gregorio, together with Father Raymundo Esquinet, a Belgian 
priest, Isabelo Martinez, Juan Nadres and Florencio Abaca were arrested by a 
group of ten or eleven <em>Makapili</em> soldiers, accompanied by five Japanese 
soldiers under the command of Captain Primitivo Osi. Her husband Gregorio was 
charged with being a <em>guerrillero;</em> his hands were bound and, with his 
companions, was brought to the headquarters of the Japanese garrison, and then 
taken to the <em>barrio</em> of Taguan, Candelaria, and bayonetted to death. She 
learned of the killing of her husband from her cousin Juan Maala who was made to 
drive a carabao cart which brought the prisoners to the place of their 
execution. In May, 1945, she recovered the remains of her husband in Taguan and 
identified the same by a wedding ring which the deceased was wearing when he was 
taken by the appellant and his soldiers. She also found in the same place the 
remains of other victims, Father Esquinet, Isabelo Martinez and Florencio 
Abaca.</p>
<p>Luisa Arceo de Abaca, widow of Florencio Abaca, one of the victims of 
appellant and his soldiers, testifying about the arrest of her husband and his 
companions by a group of <em>Makapilis</em> under the command of appellant, said 
that the deceased Florencio Abaca was a <em>guerrillero</em>. Florencio and his 
companions were brought to the barrio of Taguan where they were bayonetted to 
death. Juan Maala who was present at the execution of Florencio Abaca and his 
companions informed Luisa about it and sometime after their killing, she 
recovered the remains of her husband and was able to identify the same by a 
badge which the deceased was carrying. She likewise stated that she saw the 
remains of Father Esquinet, Isabelo Martinez, Gregorio Siscar and Juan Nadres. 
Leonila Albiela, testifying in regard to this count, stated that Father Esquinet 
and his four companions were arrested and executed by order of appellant. Father 
Esquinet was executed because he was suspected of having in his possession an 
American flag.</p>
<p>The fifth count was proven by the prosecution by the testimonies given by 
Arcadia de Ramos and Mariano Medrano. Arcadia de Raraos, an octogenarian, 
declared that on February 13, 1945, in the <em>barrio</em> of Malabanban, 
Candelaria, she was in the house of Mariano Medrano. In the evening, three 
Japanese soldiers and four Filipinos with appellant Primitivo Osi raided the 
place and brought along Mariano Medrano and ten members of his family. The 
witness was left behind because she was too old to be able to walk with the 
party. Before leaving the premises, appellant who has given order to his men, 
ordered that the house of Medrano be burned and his men: did it. Appellant, 
carrying a firearm, ordered his men that only inmates of the Medrano house be 
bound and as a result of that raid they arrested and took along with them 
Silvestre Alcantara, Maria Alcantara, Ceferino Manalo, Mariano Medrano and ten 
members of his family. The captives were conducted to the Japanese garrison and 
one week afterwards they were brought by the Japanese <em>Makapili</em> to the 
<em>barrio</em> of Sta. Catalina where they were killed and buried in a 
foxhole.</p>
<p>Mariano Medrano, one of those arrested in the raid conducted by appellant and 
his men at about 2 o'clock a.m. of February 13, 1945, testified that it was the 
appellant who ordered a Filipino <em>Makapili</em> soldier by the name of 
Abundio Belmo to tie all the inmates of the house. With the exception of Arcadia 
de Ramos, the rest of the family were brought by the raiders to the garrison at 
Pulong Niogan. During the raid, some people made an attempt to escape but were 
fired upon by the appellant and his companions and thus several persons were 
killed, including Paulino Medrano, brother of the witness, and Genara Magpantay, 
his mother. They were suspected of being connected with the underground movement 
and before leaving the house, on orders of the appellant, the raiders burned the 
same. Upon reaching the <em>barrio</em> of Pulong Niogan, the raiders had 
already burned about 50 houses. During those operations, the appellant was on 
horse back and was carrying a revolver. There were about 50 captives who were 
bound by the hands together, and upon reaching the place, they were brought to a 
foxhole made near the garrison and were killed <em>en masse</em> by the Japanese 
and <em>Makapilis</em>. This witness was among those persons who were bound to 
be executed, but fortunately was able to escape before reaching the place of the 
execution.</p>
<p>Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, admitted that between 1930 and 1935, 
he was the secretary of the Sakdalista party under Benigno Ramos in Candelaria; 
he also admitted that in October, 1944, he voluntarily accepted employment as 
foreman No. 3 of the Japanese <em>Nacoco</em> in Candelaria with a monthly 
salary of P150, and acted as interpreter of the Japanese manager of the company 
until the arrival of the Americans. He likewise admitted having drilled the 
laborers of the <em>Nacoco</em> and having retreated with the Japanese officials 
to the Sierra Madre mountains in the province of Laguna when the American forces 
came to said province.</p>
<p>The rest of the testimony of appellant is a denial of all the charges made 
against him. A defense witness, Simplicio Badillo, also an employee of the 
<em>Nacoco</em> in that locality in 1943, stated that there was a raid conducted 
by the Japanese in the<em> barrio</em> of Sta. Catalina, Sariaya, and as a 
result thereof, several residents of the <em>barrio</em> were killed and 
numerous houses were burned by the raiders; that the raid was conducted by the 
Japanese because it was suspected as hideout of the guerrilla group of one 
Medrano who testified for the prosecution in this case; in fact said Medrano was 
arrested by the raiding party on that occasion. Nevertheless, Badillo claimed 
that Primitive Osi was not in the raiding party on that occasion. The testimony 
of Badillo was corroborated by Pedro Luna, a relative of appellant who stated 
that Primitive Osi was not in the group.</p>
<p>As will be seen from the above, the main defense of this appellant consists 
at mere denials of appellant's participation in the treasonous acts imputed to 
him in the five charges; and appellant, believing that he had succeeded in 
side-stepping the imputations made against him by the prosecution, rested his 
case. As aptly remarked by the Solicitor General, it is well established in the 
law of evidence that affirmative testimony is stronger than negative. (Da Gala 
<em>vs</em>. De Gala, 42 Phil. 77l). In the ease at bar, our detailed 
examination of the testimonies given by the witnesses for the prosecution 
convince Us that they were telling the truth and the facts established by their 
respective testimonies clinch the case against this appellant.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that appellant has failed to substantiate his claim 
that the lower court erred in its findings. On the contrary, the evidence 
strongly show not only the adherence of this appellant to the enemy, but also 
his having given him aid and comfort in the municipality of Candelaria in the 
manner and form described by more than two witnesses who testified against him 
in each of the five counts. (People <em>vs</em>. Adriano, 44 Off. Gaz., 4300; 
Cramer <em>vs</em>. U.S., 65 Sup. Ct. 918).</p>
<p>In view of the above premises, We hereby affirm <em>in toto</em> the judgment 
of the lower court, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor,</em> 
and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C. J.</i>, Mr. Justice Paras voted for the affirmance of the judgment appealed from, 
but, on account of his being on leave at the time of the promulgation of this 
opinion, his signature does not appear herein. </p><p><i>Feria, J.</i>, no part.</p></div>
