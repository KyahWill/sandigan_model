				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 6, 1952, Pacifico S. Asico and his wife Emma B. de Asico filed in 
the court of first instance of Negros Occidental, a verified petition for the 
reconstitution, under Republic Act No. 26, of the original as well as the 
owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17920 in the name of 
Hilarion Martir, covering Lot No 990 of the Bago Cadstre, same province.
<p>Publication and notices were duly made. None opposed the petition. Evidence 
was submitted proving the following facts:</p>
<p>Lot No. 990 of the Bago Cadastre was originally decreed and registered in the 
name of Gododredo Gison (Original Title No, 4193). Upon the latter's death, it 
was inherited by Amparo Gison, in whose favor Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
179191 was issued upon cancellation of the original title. This Transfer 
Certificate was subsequently substituted, on July 18, 1936, with another 
transfer certificate of title No. 17920 in the name of Hilarion Martir, widower, 
who had purchased the land from Amparo Gison. On August 13, 1938, Hermogenes 
Martir, as heir of Hilarion Martir, mortgaged the land to Soledad Jalandoni and 
the deed of mortgage was duly inscribed in the office of the Register of Deeds 
on November 25, 1938, and was entered on the back of Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 17920. In February 1941, Soledad Jalandoni instituted foreclosure 
proceedings, which in October 1950 culminated in the sale at public auction of 
Lot No. 990, by the Provincial Sheriff, to the highest bidders, Pacifico Asico 
and his wife, which sale was in regular course confirmed by the proper court and 
recorded in the Registry of Deeds.</p>
<p>Now, there being no question that the original as well as the owner's 
duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17920 had been lost during thu 
last war, the court, in view of the evidence hereinabove outlined, ordered the 
Register of Deeds, "to reconstitute the original as well as the owner's 
duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17920 (in the name of Hilarion 
Martir, widower, and resident of Bacolod, Negros Occidental), covering Lot No. 
990 of Bago Cadastre, on the basis of the cancelled Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 17919 in the name of Amparo Gison (Exh. "C"), the Deed of Sale (Exh. 
"H") executed by said Amparo Gison in favor of Hilarion Martir, and on other 
available records still existing in his office pertinent to the aforesaid 
certificate of title, x x x Once the reconstitution herein ordered is duly 
accomplished, let a 2nd owner's duplicate certificate of title be issued to the 
petitioners." (Record on Appeal pp. 32-33).</p>
<p>However it inserted the proviso<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
that "all liens and encumbrances affecting the aforementioned property which 
appear recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds to be existing at the 
time of the loss or destruction of the said certificate of title shall be 
annotated on the reconstituted title".</p>
<p>Objecting to this proviso, the petitioners filed a motion to reconsider, 
contending that it amounted to an undue delegation of judicial power to the 
Register of Deeds, in that the latter was authorized thereby to reconstitute 
other liens or encumbrances not duly proven before the court. Besides, 
petitioners' argued, if the proviso is allowed to stand, "a situation may arise 
where a contract affecting the property and entered in his Day Book, but NOT 
NOTED ON THE CERTIFICATE OF TITLE, for some reason or another perhaps because 
the owner's copy was not surrendered at the time of its presentation - may be 
reconstituted by the Register of Deeds on the Certificate of Title." (Record on 
Appeal pp. 39-40)</p>
<p>Before the motion could be acted upon, Carmen Vasquez Trinidad entered her 
appearance, and opposing the motion, she alleged that Kormogenes Martir had sold 
the same property to her, with <em>pacto de retro</em> on May 23, 1940, the deed 
of sale having been registered in the office of the Register of Deeds of Negros 
Occidental on May 24, 1940, as entry No. 1128. In another motion, she alleged 
that her failure to appear at the hearing of the petition for reconstitution was 
not due to her fault or negligence (for reasons not neces sary to mention here). 
She therefore petitioned for a chance to prove her allegation of sale with 
<em>pacto de retro</em>.</p>
<p>The motion of the Asicos, and the motion of Vasquez were both denied. The 
first appealed in due tine; but the second did not. She even failed to submit a 
reply to appellant's brief in this Court.</p>
<p>We believe the petitioners had good reasons to object to the proviso inserted 
by the court. For one thing, the purpose should be to reconstitute the title No. 
17920 <u>as it was</u> when lost, And the evidence shows the only incumbrance 
annotated thereon was the mortgage in favor of Soledad Jalandoni. (p. 32 Record 
on Appeal). Other encumbrances recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds 
but not transcibed on said title are naturally beyond the scope of the 
proceedings.</p>
<p>If it be argued that the proviso was intended to protect other incumbrances 
annotated on said title but not proven in this <em>expediente</em>, the answer 
would be: Such encumbrances are either foreclosed by this proceeding because not 
presently shown, or they are not affected and may afterwards be proven in other 
subsequent petitions. If the first, the proviso is clearly erroneous; if the 
second, it is unnecessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>We may therefore uphold the petitioners1 objection, specially because, 
probably the only encumbrance to be effected is that asserted by Carmen Vasquez 
Trinidad, which encumbrance practically became meaningless for two reasons: (a) 
having failed to appeal from the order denying her motion to establish it, she 
lost all her rights, if any; (b) and said sale having been executed <u>after the 
registration</u> of the mortgage of Jalandoni, <u>it is subordinate</u> to such 
mortgage, and to the rights of purchasers at the public auction resulting from 
the foreclosure, i.e., the Asico spouses.</p>
<p>Another amendment which petitioners desired in their motion to reconsider was 
the annotation, on the reconstituted title, of the mortgage by Hermogenes Martir 
in favor of Soledad Jalandoni. It is obvious that inasmuch as said mortgage and 
annotation had been duly proven the court should have instructed the Register of 
Deeds to annotate such encumbrance on the duplicate certificate to be 
issued.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with the elimination of the proviso, and the annotation of 
Jalandoni's mortgage, the appealed order is affirmed with costs against 
appellee. So ordered.</p>
