<h3 align="center"><strong>DISSENTING: </strong></h3>
<p><strong>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.,: </strong></p>
<p>Tito V. Tizon and Marciano Lim, together with three others, were 
candidates for the office of Representatives for the second district of 
Samar. After elections, copies of all election returns coming from all 
precincts of said district were delivered to the Provincial Board of 
Canvassers. Before the Board could finish the canvass, seven, cases were
 instituted in the Court of First Instance of Samar where the 
correctness of the election returns for six precincts in the 
municipality of Gandara and one precinct in the municipal district of 
Matuguinao was challenged with respect to the number of votes appearing 
therein.</p>
<p>It was alleged that the number of votes originally appearing in the 
returns for candidates Tizon and Lim was erased and a higher number of 
votes was written for Tizon and a lesser number for Lim. Not all the 
members of the board of inspectors asked for the correction of the 
returns, as in six of the precincts involved one inspector objected, and
 in one two inspectors, in sworn statements submitted by them to the 
court. Motions to dismiss were filed by respondents on the ground of 
lack of jurisdiction, but they were denied. Hence this petition for 
certiorari and mandamus.</p>
<p>The provision of law invoked by petitioning inspectors in favor of 
the correction in section 154 of the Revised Election Code which 
provides that "After the announcement of the result of the election in 
the polling place, the board of inspectors shall not make any alteration
 or amendment in any of its statements, unless it be so ordered by 
competent court." It is contended, and the majority opinion of this 
Court has so held, that this legal provision applies to the present case
 even if the nature of the error to be corrected is controversial in 
character. I dissent from this finding.</p>
<p>I agree with the majority that there need not be a unanimity on the 
part of the inspectors in their desire to seek the correction of an 
election return from the court under section 154. The majority of them 
would suffice to bring the matter to court. What I contend is that when 
one at least of the inspectors disputes the fact that an error has been 
committed, the issue becomes controversial and it takes the case out of 
the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious. If the issue is controversial, there might 
need a long, tedious, and protracted hearing where considerable evidence
 has to be presented which of necessity will delay the proclamation of 
the winner to the prejudice of public interest. And the situation is 
aggravated by the fact that the controversy is made dependent upon 
secondary evidence. The court is powerless under the law invoked to 
resort to the ballots. To allow the court to act on such controversy 
merely on circumstantial evidence would be to set wide open the door to 
collusion and fraud. In my opinion, the subject which might be 
cognizable under section 154 merely refers to errors that are clerical 
and which do not involve any argument or dispute. To hold otherwise 
would be a flagrant encroachment on the functions of the House Electoral
 Tribunal.</p>
<p>We do not need to go far to look for precedents. Right in this 
jurisdiction we have one which is on all fours with the present 
controversy. I refer to the case of Benitez <em>vs</em>. Paredes and 
Dizon, 52 Phil., 10. In that case, where Tomas Dizon and Eulogio Benitez
 were candidates for governor for the Province of Laguna, Dizon brought 
an action No. 1 of Longos to correct the copies of the election returns 
of that precinct so as to show that 157 instead of 207 votes were 
erroneously counted and adjudicated to Eulogio Benitez. In view of lack 
of unanimity on the part of the inspectors in so far as the correction 
of the return is concerned, this Court ruled that the respondent Judge 
lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case. This Court, in a lucid 
language, said: "From the moment that the inspectors or any of them do 
not agree with the corrections of the returns, the case becomes 
contentious and, as such, requires the presentation of evidence in order
 that the court may determine on what ground to grant or not to grant 
authority to amend the returns in question. Such procedure must, of 
necessity, be subject to contingencies which will prevent the prompt 
termination of elections, which must be avoided in the interest of 
public good."</p>
<p>The law on this matter remains the same. This ruling is still a good 
law. The majority opinion has not advanced any plausible reason why it 
should be disregarded in the present case. I vote for granting the 
petition.</p>
<p>Se deniega el recurso.</p>
