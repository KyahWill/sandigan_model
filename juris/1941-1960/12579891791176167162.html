				<H3>GERMAN DE ORTUBE, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. JUSTINIANO T. ASUNCION AND JACOBO R. ASUNCION, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals from the judgment-of Sorsogon 
court of first instance requiring them to pay the plaintiff P4,700,00 with 
interest at 12% plus costs. However, as the case disclosed no factual questions, 
it was forwarded to this Court.
<p>It appears that in October 1957, German de Ortube filed his complaint to 
recover, from defendants, a debt of P4,700.00 evidenced by a promissory note 
payable on or before November 7, 1956, with interest as stated. The complaint 
copied the note, and alleged non-payment notwithstanding repeated demands.</p>
<p>The answer admitted the due execution of the note, but asserted that 
defendants "have paid on their obligation certain amounts, probably in full, and 
they will ascertain from their records the amount of such payments."</p>
<p>The hearing of the case was set for June 6, 1958. But on June 5, 1958, 
defendant Justiniano Asuncion sent a telegram to the court requesting 
postponement on the ground of sickness of his counsel, and promising submission 
of the medical certificate later. On the same date, he sent a similar telegram 
to his opponent's attorney.</p>
<p>On June 6, 1958, neither the defendants nor their counsel appeared in court. 
On the same day, the judge rendered the following decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *"</p>
<p>"Del testimonio del demandante y del Exhibito A se desprende que el 7 de 
Noviembre de 1955, los demandados otorgaron y suscribieron mancomunada y 
solidariamente un pagarS por la suma de P4,700.00, con interes de doce por 
ciento (12%) anual y pagaderos al plazo de un afio desde la fecha del pagare. No 
existe ninguna duda sobre la autenticidad y debido otorgamiento de dicho pagare 
puesto que en la contestacion de los demandados esta admitido expresamente tal 
hecho. Segiin el demandante, apesar de haber vencido el 7 de Noviembre de 1956, 
el pago no se ha verificado Jiasta el presente. He tratado de notificar a los 
demandados, pero las dos cartas certificadas que a este efecto se les han 
remitido, han sido devueltas por no haber sido recogidas.</p>
<p>Habiendose probado los hechos alegados en la demanda.</p>
<p>Por la Presente, se dicta sentencia condenando a los demandados a pagar * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 12, 1958, defendants filed the medical certificate of illness which 
their telegram had promised to submit. And on July 8, 1958, they moved for the 
setting aside of the decision, copy of which they had received on June 12, 1958, 
reiterating the illness of their counsel and asserting a "good defense." Their 
motion was supported by an affidavit of Jutiniano Asuncion, the material portion 
of which said "defendants have a good defense and the result of the case would 
probably be substantially changed if they were allowed to present evidence, 
primary and secondary, of certain payments made by them both on the interest and 
the principal obligation mentioned in the Complaint." As the court denied the 
motion, defendants appealed claiming error in the denial of their motion to 
postpone and of their set-aside petition.</p>
<p>The matter of affording relief from the failure of the party or his counsel 
to appear at the trial is largely discretionary with the judge. It should not be 
interfered with unless abuse is patent on the record.</p>
<p>In the case now before us, we note: first, the motion for postponement was 
not under oath nor supported by a medical certificate; second, it was signed by 
only one defendant; third, on the day appointed, none of defendants appeared to 
ratify under oath, the contents of the telegram; fourth, according to plaintiff, 
this was the second postponement on the ground of illness requested by 
defendants; fifth, and most important, the affidavit of merit supporting the 
motion for new trial did not specify the payments made, i.e., the amounts and 
dates thereof, although the defendants had more than six months to "ascertain 
from their records" as they had announced in their answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Even in their brief here, defendants make 
no specification.</p>
<p>Considering the admitted genuineness of the promissory note and the existence 
of the debt, the defendants' maneuvers smack of mere delay.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed, with costs against appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
<p>
</p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This is vital, for obviously, if 
defendants had made two five-peso payments, Justiniano would not have falsified 
the affidavit; but the matter would not be sufficient cause to re-open the court 
proceedings. </p>
