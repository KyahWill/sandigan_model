The defendant admits having received from the plaintiff the sum of P30,000&nbsp; but,&nbsp; as a counterclaim, ho alleges&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; took delivery&nbsp; of 420,678 tons of&nbsp; copra&nbsp; at the&nbsp; price of&nbsp; P172.50 per ton, or&nbsp; a total of P72..566.96,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff only&nbsp; paid to&nbsp; the defendant the amount of&nbsp; P38,000,&nbsp; including the&nbsp; initial payment&nbsp; of P30,000, mentioned in plaintiff's complaint, leaving an unpaid balance of P34,566.96, which the defendant seeks&nbsp; to recover from the plaintiff.<br><br>"The&nbsp; plaintiff, in his answer&nbsp; to defendant's&nbsp; counterclaim, alleges that he was able to haul a net total of 287,362&nbsp; kilos (287.352 tons), after&nbsp; deducting&nbsp; tho&nbsp; allowance&nbsp; of&nbsp; 12½ per cent,&nbsp; as provided for in the contract at P172.50&nbsp; per ton,&nbsp; or&nbsp; a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of P49,568.22, and not P72,566.96, as alleged in&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; counterclaim,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; defendant received,&nbsp; aside from tho P30,000,000, an additional sum of&nbsp; P8,498.10 as&nbsp; proceeds of part of the copra sold to Yek&nbsp; Hua Trading.<br><br>"The negotiations between tho .plaintiff and the defendant&nbsp; for the sale by&nbsp; the latter of his copra to the former commenced on&nbsp; August 10,&nbsp; 1946, which resulted&nbsp; in the execution by the parties&nbsp; of an option given, by the&nbsp; defendant to the plaintiff for the&nbsp; sale of from 800 to&nbsp; 1,000 tons of copra at P18.50 per 100 kilos&nbsp; under the terms and&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; specified therein.&nbsp; This document,&nbsp; marked Exhibit A, signed hy Claro, Rivera and Amadeo Matute, executed in August, 1946, reads as follows:<br><br>'Que yo, Amadeo Matute, mayor do edad, soltero y&nbsp; residente en la Ciudad de Manila, por la presente doy opcion al Sr. Claro Rivera, mayor do&nbsp; edad,&nbsp; easado y&nbsp; residente en&nbsp; el&nbsp; Municipio&nbsp; de&nbsp; Malabon, Rizal,&nbsp; para comprar de ochocientos&nbsp; (800) a&nbsp; mil&nbsp; (1,000)&nbsp; toneladas de coprax resecado cosechado&nbsp; parte antes&nbsp; de la&nbsp; Guerra&nbsp; y parte dura«te a la ocupacion de Japones&nbsp; de&nbsp; diecioclio pesos con&nbsp; cincuenta centavos&nbsp; (P18.50)&nbsp; por eada cien&nbsp; (100)&nbsp; kilos, bajo las condiciones siguientes:<br><br>'1.

While the defendant&nbsp; claims that the&nbsp; said document (Exhibit 1) is&nbsp; a&nbsp; supplement to the contract of sale Exhibit&nbsp; B, the plaintiff contends that&nbsp; it is a supplement to the option Exhibit A. "It&nbsp; is not disputed that when the&nbsp; option Exhibit A was executed the plaintiff had not yet inspected defendant's copra&nbsp; in the latter's haciendas in the Province of&nbsp; Dayao, and that when the contract of sale Exhibit B was executed.on August&nbsp; SO,&nbsp; 1946, it&nbsp; was after the plaintiff had inspected&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; copra in his haciendas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement A&nbsp; (Exhibit 1)&nbsp; bears&nbsp; the following post-script; "The coprax above mentioned&nbsp; is the&nbsp; same that&nbsp; I saw&nbsp; in the bodega".&nbsp; It is evident&nbsp; that when Supplement "A" was&nbsp; executed, . it&nbsp; was after the plaintiff had 'inspected defendant's copra in&nbsp; his&nbsp; haciendas&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Province of Davao.&nbsp; It may be concluded, therefore, that said document was intended as a supplement to the contract of&nbsp; sale Exhibit B, and not to the option Exhibit A.&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; contract of sale between&nbsp; the parties is&nbsp; Exhibit Bf supplemented by Supplement 'A' (Exhibit 1).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, "when there is ambiguity in any&nbsp; of the terms and&nbsp; conditions of the contract of&nbsp; sale or doubt as to its interpretation,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; may&nbsp; resort to&nbsp; previous&nbsp; dealings&nbsp; or&nbsp; preliminary transactions&nbsp; between the&nbsp; parties regarding&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject-matter&nbsp; of said&nbsp; contract of&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the conditions&nbsp; and terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the option Exhibit A,,as an aid to interpretation with&nbsp; a&nbsp; view to ascertaining&nbsp; the true&nbsp; intention,&nbsp; and&nbsp; agreement of&nbsp; the contracting parties. "Premised&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale Exhibit&nbsp; B was&nbsp; supplemented&nbsp; by the agreement Exhibit 1, the copra sold&nbsp; by the defendant to the plaintiff consisted&nbsp; of the&nbsp; copra made during and before the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; occupation,&nbsp; estimated&nbsp; to&nbsp; be from 800 to 1,300 tons then in stock and&nbsp; deposited in defendant's haciendas&nbsp; at ha Union,&nbsp; Sigaboy, Monserrat,&nbsp; Mag-dug,&nbsp; Tigalawan and Pundaguitan in the Province of&nbsp; Davao&nbsp; with a&nbsp; deduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; 12M: per cent from the total weight for shrinkage, except the&nbsp; 100 tons of new&nbsp; copra&nbsp; deposited&nbsp; under defendant's in La Union.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the time&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; was entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, the latter's copra in&nbsp; stock and&nbsp; deposited in his aforementioned haciendas in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Davao&nbsp; was estimated by Ms "encargados" and employees&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; haciendas&nbsp; to&nbsp; be from 1,380 tons.&nbsp; (See testimonies of&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; Perez, trial of August 6, 1948,&nbsp; page 34-1, t.s.n., Vicente&nbsp; Alonso, September 3, 1948, page 396,&nbsp; t.s.n., Nicolas&nbsp; Gloushenko,&nbsp; November 19, 1948, page 476, t.g.n., Valeriano Medel, July 27, 1949, page 447, t.s.n., and Celestino Alonso, August 31, 1949,&nbsp; page 20,&nbsp; t.s.n.).<br><br>"From&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; testimonies&nbsp; of defendant's witnesses, it is clear that the defendant sold to&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; 1,300&nbsp; tons&nbsp; of copra according to the contract of sale Exhibit B, as supplemented by the agreement Exhibit 1,&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendant had more than 1,300 tons of copra in stock in his haciendas named&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed at the time, of the sale&nbsp; on August 30, 1946, and the evidence shows, without&nbsp; any&nbsp; indication&nbsp; to&nbsp; the contrary,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; parties had&nbsp; in mind said copra&nbsp; in stock as the subject matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sale.<br><br>"A more direct&nbsp; and&nbsp; evident proof&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; sold&nbsp; trt the plaintiff&nbsp; 1,300 tons&nbsp; of&nbsp; copra, is the receipt&nbsp; in Spanish, dated November&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp; signed&nbsp;

1946, the vendor Amadeo Matute&nbsp; would furnish all the sacks and&nbsp; oilier necessary materials to be&nbsp; used in&nbsp; sacking the copra.<br><br>"There is conflict-in the evidence as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the quantity and sizes of tho empty&nbsp; sacks in the various haciendas&nbsp; of the defendant Amadeo Matute at tho time the&nbsp; aforementioned contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; between&nbsp; him and the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Claro Rivera.&nbsp; While&nbsp; the plaintiff contends and&nbsp; presented evidence&nbsp; in support of his contention that the delay&nbsp; in sacking the copra sold to him by the defendant was due to the insufficiency of empty sacks, the defendant claims and presented oral evidence that ho had empty sacks&nbsp; in&nbsp; his haciendas enough to&nbsp; contain the&nbsp; 1,300&nbsp; tons of copra sold by him&nbsp; to the plaintiff, and that&nbsp; the delay in sacking the copra was&nbsp; due to plaintiff's fault.<br><br>After the defendant&nbsp; Amadeo Matute&nbsp; had extended to&nbsp; the plaintiff Claro&nbsp; Rivera an option to buy the&nbsp; former's copra in&nbsp; his haciendas (Exhibit A), the said defendant wrote to the plaintiff a letter&nbsp; dated August 16, 1946 (Exhibit A~4),&nbsp; which reads as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>'Apreciable,&nbsp; amigo, La g'emana&nbsp; pasada&nbsp; me dijo Ud.&nbsp; que deseaba salir&nbsp; para&nbsp; Davao,&nbsp;

copra,&nbsp; rogandole sirvase decirme cuando espera realgar&nbsp; dicho. viaje.' <br><br>"On&nbsp; October SO, 1946,&nbsp; tho&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Amadeo&nbsp; Matute wrote a letter&nbsp; to his&nbsp; encargados&nbsp; in&nbsp; Davao and&nbsp; Monserrat (Exhibit&nbsp; F-2), the pertinent&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of which reads&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>'Claro Eivero, me dico saldra en aeroplano para esa mañana para ir activando la preparacion de la copra, Sacos vacios, por el vapor de la casa&nbsp;

and later&nbsp; on&nbsp; 6,000 empty .sacks&nbsp; that would probably&nbsp; contain&nbsp; 180 tons of copra.&nbsp; Inasmuch aa the said 10,000 sacks&nbsp; together&nbsp; with&nbsp; the empty sacks already in defendant's haciendas&nbsp; were not sufficient- for&nbsp; sacking&nbsp; the&nbsp; 1,300 tons of copra which the defendant&nbsp; sold to&nbsp; the plaintiff,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter,&nbsp; on ''November 20, 1946, bought 10,000&nbsp; empty sacks worth P10,000&nbsp; (Exhibit H) which he sent&nbsp; to Antonio Perez,&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; encargado in Davao,&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 22, 1946, in 400 bundles&nbsp; (Exhibit H-l). ' The plaintiff paid to the De la Rama Steamship Co., Inc., the corresponding freight charges for said sacks in&nbsp; the amount of P227.50 '(Exhibit H-2).&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant was advised by&nbsp; the plaintiff of the fact that the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; had sent&nbsp; 10,000&nbsp; empty sacks&nbsp; to Davao&nbsp; on November 22, 1946 (Exhibit H-l).<br><br>"After a thorough study of this case, the Court has arrived at the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the evidence of&nbsp; the plaintiff clearly&nbsp; outweighs the&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; on the&nbsp; following facts:<br><br>"After the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale Exhibit B was signed&nbsp; by the parties on August 30,&nbsp; 1946, the&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; Claro Rivera,&nbsp; plaintiff herein told the&nbsp; vendor Mateo Matute,&nbsp; defendant herein, to prepare empty sacks&nbsp; for the sacking and packing of the copra which the former -would&nbsp; load in&nbsp; raid-November,&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; (session of&nbsp;&nbsp; Febuary 25, 1948, ,pp.&nbsp; 87 and&nbsp; 90,&nbsp; t.s.n.).<br><br>"On October&nbsp; 17, 1946, Claro&nbsp; Rivera&nbsp; sold 2,000&nbsp; long tons&nbsp; of&nbsp; copra&nbsp; to the&nbsp; South Cotton&nbsp; Oil&nbsp; Co., New&nbsp; Orleans, represented&nbsp; by John J.

It is true as stated by the trial court that these sacks were donated by Rivera to Matute.&nbsp; However, the donation had a purpose and a consideration, namely: that the defendant with the use of said&nbsp; sacks would&nbsp; be enabled to comply with his contract&nbsp; on&nbsp; time.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; donation was rendered useless and in vain due not only to defendant's failure to employ&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary laborers to sack,&nbsp; weigh and pack the copra but also because he&nbsp; suspended further delivery of copra on December 28, 1946.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, on moral grounds alone the cost&nbsp; of the sacks and the expense of&nbsp; transporting them to Davao should be reimbursed to the plaintiff.&nbsp; Even from the legal standpoint, the act of the plaintiff in&nbsp; giving the sacks free may be considered, a conditional donation, conditioned on the full delivery of the 1,300 tons of copra on time so as to load it on the boat that called at the port of Davao, and that because of the failure to comply with the condition, the donation may be said to&nbsp; have been automatically revoked.<br><br>Now, as regards the measure of damages, we agree with the trial court that it should be the difference between the stipulated price&nbsp; per ton of P172.50 under the contract and the market price on the date agreed upon for delivery, which was around&nbsp; December 28,&nbsp; 1946.&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; Tiimself according to his brief (page 53) agrees to this basis for computing damages.&nbsp; Later&nbsp; on, however,&nbsp; he insists that damages should&nbsp; be computed on the basis of the difference between the P172.50 and the P380.00 which was the price per ton of the copra sold by Matute to Clark, Jamilla &amp; Co., Inc! on March 29, 1947.&nbsp; Said basis would clearly be unreasonable and untenable.&nbsp; The difference in&nbsp; point of time between December 28, 1946 and March 29, 1947, was considerable.&nbsp; There is no assurance that had Matute complied with his contract,&nbsp; Bivera would&nbsp; have waited three months,&nbsp; until March 1947, before selling in order to realize a bigger&nbsp; profit.&nbsp; He could not have waited&nbsp; because he had no warehouse in Davao in which to store said copra. In fact, in December 1946, plaintiff entered into a formal contract with Escudero&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; offering to&nbsp; sell the latter 1,200 long tons of copra, apparently the same commodity&nbsp; he had&nbsp; bought from the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; at the rate of P860 per short ton, but as correctly stated by the trial court, this P360 was not the net price because it included the cost of sacking, weighing&nbsp; and hauling and other expenses that may be incurred in&nbsp; transportation from the <i>bodegas</i> in the different haciendas&nbsp; of Matute to the vessels engaged by the&nbsp; buyer, as well as&nbsp; the&nbsp; freight and marine insurances, because it was c. i. f. Pacific Coast (U.S.A.).<br><br>Had Matute in December 1946, when&nbsp; he breached hia contract with Rivera, already found a buyer for a higher price, then said higher&nbsp; price might yet be adopted as the basis for computing damages.&nbsp; But the record shows that Matute found&nbsp; a&nbsp; buyer&nbsp; only three months&nbsp; after, that is, on March 29, 1947.<br><br>After considering the different price quotations of copra in Manila, Cebu and Iloilo in the month of December, 1946, the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court arrived at the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P250&nbsp; as the average price per ton to serve as a basis or measure for damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the conditions obtaining at the time, and&nbsp; in the absence of more satisfactory and reliable data or evidence&nbsp; on this point,&nbsp; we believe and&nbsp; find that the price of P250 fixed by the trial court is&nbsp; a fair, reasonable and conservative&nbsp; estimate of the price of&nbsp; copra in Davao on or about December 28,&nbsp; 1946, and that it may be used as a legitimate basis on which to compute the damages suffered by plaintiff.<br><br>In finding&nbsp; P54,271.80&nbsp; as the&nbsp; amount of damages to which&nbsp; the plaintiff is entitled,&nbsp; as stated at the beginning of this decision,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; to ascertain the number of tons of copra&nbsp; undelivered, to&nbsp; be used as a basis, subtracted from 1,300 tons&nbsp; stipulated in the&nbsp; contract, only 289.376 the equivalent of the 330.715 tons&nbsp; actually delivered, after&nbsp; deducting from the 330.715 the&nbsp; amount of shrinkage of&nbsp; 12%&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent equivalent to 41.339 tons, to arrive at the&nbsp; balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1,010.624.&nbsp; In this,&nbsp; the lower court erred.'&nbsp; What should have been done was to subtract the 330.715 tons&nbsp; gross, without&nbsp; deduction&nbsp; for&nbsp; shrinkage, from the 1,300 thereby leaving a balance of 969.285 tons also&nbsp; gross undelivered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this&nbsp; is that the 1,300 tons stipulated in the contract was&nbsp; gross, that ih, without reduction for shrinkage.<br><br>Now, to determine the sum of which Rivera&nbsp; would have realized in the sale of&nbsp; this copra not delivered, we&nbsp; shall multiply the&nbsp; 969.285 tons by&nbsp; the&nbsp; price of P250 per ton fixed by the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court, which&nbsp; would&nbsp; give the amount of P242,321.25.&nbsp; To ascertain Rivera's net profits, we have to deduct&nbsp; from this gross sum, the amount which the undelivered 969.285 tons would have cost him.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Rivera did not have to pay&nbsp; for&nbsp; all this balance of 969.285 tons because he was entitled to 12% per cent shrinkage which is equivalent to 121.161 tons.&nbsp; Subtracting this amount of shrinkage from 969.285 will give a net balance of 848.124 tons.&nbsp; Multiply this by the price of P172.50 per ton fixed in the contract, will&nbsp; give P146,301.39 the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; which Rivera would have paid&nbsp; to Matute had the&nbsp; latter made delivery.&nbsp; To this we should add the expense which Rivera would have incurred in hauling this copra from the different bodegas in Davao to the boat,&nbsp; which is P12.50 per ton. Multiplying this amount&nbsp; by 969.285&nbsp; will give P12.116.06 which added to 146,301.39 will give a total of P158,417.45,&nbsp; the amount which Rivera&nbsp; would have&nbsp; paid&nbsp; for the undelivered&nbsp; copra and the expense he would&nbsp; have incurred to place it at the pier for shipment.&nbsp; The difference between P242,821.25 and&nbsp; P158,417.45&nbsp; which is P83.903.80&nbsp; is the amount of the&nbsp; profits or&nbsp; damages&nbsp; to&nbsp; which Rivera is entitled.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this should be added the P10.227.50, the cost and expense for transportation&nbsp; of the 10,000&nbsp; empty sacks already mentioned, giving&nbsp; a&nbsp; total of P94.131.30.<br><br>Again,&nbsp; Matute does not&nbsp; have to pay the above&nbsp; entire amount for the reason that Rivera has not yet fully paid him&nbsp; for&nbsp; the P330.715&nbsp; gross&nbsp; tons&nbsp; delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; should first deduct from the&nbsp; 330.715&nbsp; gross tons&nbsp; the 12 1/4 per cent&nbsp; shrinkage equivalent to 41.339 giving a balance of 289.376 tons net.&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiplying this by P172.50,&nbsp; the price per ton&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract will&nbsp; give P49.917.36 which&nbsp; is the price of the copra delivered.&nbsp; Deducting&nbsp; from this the sum&nbsp; of P30.000 advanced by Rivera&nbsp; and P8,498.10 paid&nbsp; by Yek Hua Trading &amp; Co. and applied to Rivera's account or a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of P38.498.10 would&nbsp; leave a balance of Pll.419.26&nbsp; still owing by Eivera to Matute.&nbsp; Subtracting this amount from P94,131.30 gives P82.712.04, the amount&nbsp; now payable to plaintiff Rivera&nbsp; by Matute.<br><br>&nbsp;Plaintiff claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; interest should&nbsp; be paid on the&nbsp; amount of damages&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the filing of the complaint&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of from&nbsp; the date of&nbsp; decision of the trial court.&nbsp; If suit&nbsp; were for the payment of a&nbsp; definite sum of money the contention might be tenable.&nbsp; However, "it&nbsp; is&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages,&nbsp; unliquidated&nbsp; and&nbsp; not known&nbsp; until definitely&nbsp; ascertained,&nbsp; assessed and&nbsp; determined&nbsp; by the courts&nbsp; after&nbsp; proof&nbsp; (Montilla <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Corporacion de P. P. Agustinos, 25 Phil., 447; Lichauco <i>vs.</i> De Guzman, 38 Phil., 302).&nbsp; So we agree with the trial&nbsp; court that&nbsp; interest should be&nbsp; from the date of the decision.<br><br>Plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; maintains the theory that from the date of the. contract, Exhibit "A", he became the owner of the copra sold to him.&nbsp; Consequently, defendant Matute had no right to dispose of the same as&nbsp; he did in selling said copra to Clark, Jamilla &amp;&nbsp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; We disagree. The commodity or article sold to him under the contract, Exhibit "A",&nbsp; was part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the copra stored in the&nbsp; different bodegas of Matute.&nbsp; It was indeterminate and not identified.&nbsp; It had&nbsp; first&nbsp; to be separated from the whole&nbsp; stock, then placed in sacks, weighed and packed and then delivered to the plaintiff.&nbsp; Only then, could plaintiff consider himself . the owner thereof.&nbsp; Before that time, it was still&nbsp; under the custody and ownership of the defendant.&nbsp; Were We to accept the&nbsp; theory of&nbsp; plaintiff on&nbsp; this part, let us suppose that before delivery of the copra to him the bodega or warehouse had burned&nbsp; down resulting in the&nbsp; destruction or loss of the copra,&nbsp; or&nbsp; supposing&nbsp; said copra had been stolen, would plaintiff&nbsp; have been willing to&nbsp; assume&nbsp; the loss?&nbsp; Again, if plaintiff had really&nbsp; considered himself the owner of said copra&nbsp; from the time&nbsp; of the execution of the&nbsp; contract, Exhibit&nbsp; "A", then having full&nbsp; custody and right of disposal&nbsp; as owner, he&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp; taken charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sacking, weighing&nbsp; and packing; employed the number of laborers required&nbsp; and&nbsp; provided the sacks necessary to be used&nbsp; as&nbsp; containers in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; prepare the&nbsp; said&nbsp; copra for loading into the&nbsp; vessels, and then charged the expenses incurred by him in sacking, weighing and packing, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; When he&nbsp; did not do all this in, order&nbsp; to be able to load the copra into&nbsp; the waiting vessels in Davao, it was&nbsp; because he must have known and believed&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; not yet the&nbsp; owner of the copra and so could not dispose of it.&nbsp; If he considered himself the owner, why did he in frustration&nbsp; cross his arms and allow Matute to&nbsp; delay&nbsp; the sacking,&nbsp; weighing&nbsp; and packing of the&nbsp; copra,&nbsp; and later&nbsp; abide&nbsp; by Matute's&nbsp; order from Manila suspending further delivery, when as&nbsp; owner,&nbsp; as&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; claims, he&nbsp; could have&nbsp; disregarded such&nbsp; suspension&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordered his own&nbsp; men&nbsp; and&nbsp; laborers to&nbsp; take charge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; <i>bodega,</i> and&nbsp; sack,&nbsp; weigh&nbsp; and pack&nbsp; the copra for&nbsp; transportation to the pier? We&nbsp; hold that considering the attending circumstances, the mere execution of the contract&nbsp; did not serve to&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; title" over the copra to&nbsp; Rivera. <br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the foregoing,&nbsp; with the modification that the amount to be awarded to plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; Rivera be increased&nbsp; from&nbsp; P54.271.30&nbsp; to&nbsp; P82.712.04, with legal&nbsp; interest from the date of this judgment, the decision appealed from, is hereby affirmed with costs.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C. J., Padilla, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Endeneia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><br><i><center><br>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING:<br></center></i><br><br><b>REYES, J. B. L., J., </b><br><br>I concur with the decision except as to the acceptance of the price of P250 per ton found by the lower Court as a&nbsp; basis&nbsp; for the computation&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; damages,&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the basis should be the highest price between the date of delivery and, "the&nbsp; filing of the&nbsp; action; i.e.,&nbsp; plaintiff's contract with Escudero and&nbsp; Co., Inc.,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the price of P360&nbsp; a ton, or else the price at which&nbsp; defendant sold his copra to Clark, Jamilla &amp;&nbsp; Co., Inc, P380 per ton, considering that the copra thus&nbsp; sold&nbsp; should have been delivered&nbsp; to plaintiff herein,&nbsp; and&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; partly paid for in advance by him (Suiliong&nbsp; &amp; Co. <i> vs. </i> Nanyo Shoji Kaisha,&nbsp; 42 Phil., 722; 46 Am. Jur. 804-805).<br><br>As the decision stands now, we are&nbsp; giving Matute&nbsp; a premium&nbsp; for&nbsp; his deliberate breach of the contract with plaintiff-appellant, and&nbsp; allowing him to&nbsp; keep the&nbsp; profit he&nbsp; has made&nbsp; (P380 less P250,&nbsp; per ton)&nbsp; in selling&nbsp; and delivering the copra to Clark, Jamilla &amp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; Where, as in this&nbsp; case, the breach is intentional and deliberate, we&nbsp; are faced&nbsp; by&nbsp; plain malice&nbsp; or fraud (dolo), which is immoral&nbsp; and odious&nbsp; in&nbsp; law; and it&nbsp; should be sternly repressed by wiping out as much-as possible the&nbsp; profit derived by&nbsp; the seller from&nbsp; his&nbsp; acts in bad faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospect of&nbsp; better profits can never be&nbsp; an excuse&nbsp; for violating lawful and&nbsp; binding contracts.</div>
