				<H3>J. MARIANO DE SANTOS, PETITIONER, VS. CATALINO CONCEPCION AND HONORABLE  GUILLERMO S.  SANTOS, AS EXECUTIVE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner J.  Mariano de Santos is seeking a review of the decision of the Court  of  Agrarian Relations,  dated <br><br>August 1, 1956, denying his petition for authority to eject his tenant Catalino Concepcion, filed way back in  May, 1954. <br><br>Petitioner is the owner of an <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda</span> in the Municipality of Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, and in the year 1954, Concepcion was cultivating a parcel of three hectares of said <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda,</span> as a tenant.   On  May 25, 1954, petitioner filed with the Court  of  Industrial Relations  an action for the  ejection of Concepcion on  the  ground that said  tenant of his, for lack of work  animals, was  always late in planting; that he was lazy and disobeyed the orders of  his landlord about cleaning and keeping the dikes and canals in shape, and removing the  weeds from the rice plantation,  as a result of which, he could harvest only 80 cavans from his holding, instead of the regular harvest of 180 cavans. <br><br>Although served with  summons, Concepcion failed to file an answer to the petition.   The case was assigned by the Industrial Court to a commissioner to receive  evidence, but despite  notification  of the hearing and  several postponements thereof, Concepcion failed to appear either personally or through counsel.  So, on March 24, 1955, on the date of the  last postponement,  he was declared in default upon motion of counsel for the petitioner,  and the latter was allowed to present his evidence, which consisted of the testimony of one  Melecio  Rivera, overseer of the petitioner.   Said testimony  is  to the effect that  Concepcion had no work animal, and so was always late in planting his parcel; that he was lazy, failed to raise the height of the dikes  and  remove  the weeds that interfered with the healthy growth  of the growing crop; that he failed to secure  the irrigation  of  his parcel on  time,  all  this in disobedience to the orders given to him; that as a result, for the agricultural year 1958-54, he could harvest only 80  cavans  of  palay, which  was way below the average production of  the land, namely, 180  cavans. <br><br>With the approval of Republic Act No. 1267, tenancy cases were transferred to  the Court of Agrarian Relations. Acting in the case, and after reading the transcript of the stenographic notes taken of the evidence presented by the petitioner, as already stated, Judge Guillermo S. Santos denied the petition. <br><br>As previously said,  there was no other evidence  except that of the petitioner, which evidence was  the testimony of his overseer.   Without giving any reason, respondent Judge Santos said that said evidence was not sufficient to establish  petitioner's allegation as to Concepcion's wilful disobedience to his orders, in connection with his farm work or his neglect to do the necessary farm work, so as to insure a good harvest, and for that reason, denied the petition to eject  Concepcion. <br><br>In  the lengthy answer  to the  petition to review  his decision, filed on  behalf of respondent Judge by his attorneys,  it is stated that although a  party  (Concepcion) was declared in default, and so did not adduce any  evidence in his defense, nevertheless,  a court is not  bound by  the uncontradicted evidence of  the plaintiff.   In  his  reply memorandum, the same respondent Judge claims  that  the landlord  has  the burden of proof to establish the existence of a lawful cause for the ejectment of his tenant, and that considering the announced  public policy to afford  security of tenure to agricultural tenants,  the landlord,  to  eject said  tenant, must  prove his case by substantial evidence. We gather from said memorandum that the main,  if  not the only  reason of respondent Judge in not favorably considering  the  testimony of the overseer was  that said testimony was  uncorroborated  and because he was an  interested witness. <br><br>We are not prepared to consider  such a  reason  as a valid  one.  The testimony of a lone witness, if  credible, is sufficient to prove  a point or  claim, and  the fact that the witness  is an  employee or an  overseer of a  party is not sufficient  to discredit his testimony.  Respondent Judge could not even gauge the credibility of said witness because of his demeanor on the witness stand because it  was not he who received the  testimony, but the commissioner to which the case was, originally assigned by the  Industrial Court,  and respondent Judge only read the transcript of the stenographic notes.   For this  reason, we are  inclined to accept  and consider  the evidence of the petitioner as substantial and reliable.<br><br>However, in the interest of justice, we believe that the tenant  should be given another opportunity to present his side of the case and the petitioner given an equal opportunity to present additional evidence, if any, to corroborate the testimony of the overseer as desired  by respondent Judge.   Moreover,  about four years have passed since the petition for ejectment of the tenant was  filed in  1954. During the interval, many things may have  occurred, such as, if it was true that the tenant by his acts or omission had given valid ground  for  his ejectment, he  may have mended his ways and become a good tenant; or if on the contrary, he had up  to  now continuously  neglected  the cultivation  of his  landholding and disobeyed the orders of  his landlord, then  this  would be additional proof  of his incompetence as a tenant, and  therefore, he should be ejected; or if on the other hand, said tenant could  present evidence to the effect that  he had  always been  a  good tenant,  and done his  farm work as a good father of a family,  and that all the claims of his landlord  against him were  unfounded,  then he shall have established  his right to continue and preserve the  status of tenancy. <br><br>In view  of the  foregoing,  the  decision  sought to be reviewed is hereby set aside and the case is  ordered remanded to the  Court of Agrarian Relations  for  further proceedings.  No costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, Reyes, J. B.
