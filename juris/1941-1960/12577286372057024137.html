				<H3>MARIANO A. ALBERT, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING CO., INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by defendant from the ordjer of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila for the issuance of a writ of execution ordering it to pay plaintiff 
through the administrator of the intestate estate of Mariano A. Albert, the sum 
of P15,000.00, plus legal interests thereon from filing of the complaint until 
fully paid and P22.00 as costs.
<p>It appears that for the sum of P30,000.00 to be paid in 8 quarterly 
installments, plaintiff agreed to write a manuscript for defendant and deliver 
it on or before December 31, 1948. Defendant defaulted after having paid 
P7,000.00, so plaintiff sued for the balance of P23,000.00. Defendant claimed 
that plaintiff failed to deliver the manuscript on time. However, the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, finding that defendant had breached the contract, 
ordered it to pay plaintiff P23,000.00 (Civil Case No. 9267). On appeal, this 
Court reduced the dantages to P15,000.00, and with this modification affirmed 
the lower court's decision (G R. No. L-9300, April 18, 1958). Plaintiff having 
moved for execution upon finality of the decision, the trial court issued the 
order now subject of appeal.</p>
<p>Defendant claims that it should be made to pay only P8,000.00, arguing that 
the P7,000.00 it had previously paid to plaintiff must be deducted from the 
P15,000.00 which this Court ordered it to pay.</p>
<p>Defendant's stand is untenable. For breach of contract, the trial court found 
defendant liable to plaintiff for liquidated damages of P30,000.00, deducted 
from this the P7,000.00 and, in the dispositive part of its decision, ordered 
defendant to pay plaintiff "P23,000.00 with legal interest from the date of the 
filing of the complaint until the whole amount shall have been fully paid." In 
equitably reducing the liquidated damages to P15,000.00, this Court had already 
taken into consideration the fact that the trial court had deducted the 
P7,000.00 from the amount of P30,000.00. The same P7,000.00 cannot be deducted a 
second time from the P15,000.00 liquidated damages awarded by this Court, it 
having been previously deducted in arriving at the amount of P23,000.00. 
Defendant's appeal was from the judgment ordering it to pay P23,000.00, the very 
amount which was reduced by this Court to P15,000.00.</p>
<p>This being the sole modification made on the lower court's judgment, 
defendant should, therefore, pay legal interests from the filing of the 
complaint until it pays in full the amount of P15,000.00.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed</em>.</p></div>
