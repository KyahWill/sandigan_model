<p>Claudio Degollacion is appealing the order of the Court of First Instance of 
Cebu in Civil Case No. R-4024, dismissing his complaint on the ground of 
prescription.</p>
<p>The facts in this case are not controverted. In the month of September, 1949, 
plaintiff-appellant Degollacion was an employee of Chua Leh in his istore and in 
his soap factory at Talisay, Cebu. On September 29 of that year, plaintiff, his 
employer Chua Leh, and Filemon Legaspina were riding in Leh's delivery truck 
S-1325 to deliver soap to customers. On the way home, within the town of Carcar, 
Cebu, and while said delivery truck was stopping on the correct side of the road 
to allow the "Bisaya" truck T-16969, owned by Li Chui alias Ong Pong, and driven 
by his employee, Telesforo Sagayno, to pass, the latter truck bumped the 
delivery truck from behind, causing it to fall into a precipice with its three 
passengers. As a result, the delivery truck waa demolished, its cargo scattered 
in all directions, and the occupants suffered physical injuries.</p>
<p>On December 13, 1949, Sagayno, the driver of Ong Pong, was charged in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Carcar, Cebu, in Criminal Case No. 304, with less 
serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence. After trial, he was found 
guilty and sentenced to suffer one month and twenty days imprisonment, with 
coata. He appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance of Cebu where, 
after repeated postponements at his instance, the case was on February 16, 1954, 
dismissed <u>without prejudice</u>. The dismissal was due to the alleged failure of 
Chua. Leh, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, to appear on the date of 
the last hearing set.</p>
<p>On May 14, 1955, after failing to have the criminal case reinstated through 
the Fiscal's Office, plaintiff-appellant Degollacion filed the present civil 
action for damages against defendant-appellee Li Chui alias Ong Pong, employer 
of the driver, Sagayno. Acting upon a motion to dismiss the complaint on the 
ground that the plaintiff's cause of action had already prescribed, the trial 
court on July 25, 1955, dismissed the complaint without pronouncement as to 
costs. This is the order of dismissal being appealed directly to us, involving 
as it does only questions of law.</p>
<p>The theory underlying the motion to dismiss as well as the order of dismissal 
is that the period of prescription of four years within which to enforce the 
right to damages for physical injuries suffered, began to run from the date of 
the accident on September 29, 1949, and consequently, when the present action 
was filed in 1955, the period of prescription had already run out. Appellee 
contended that the civil action for damages is separate from the criminal 
action, and so, the filing of the criminal charge in the Justice of the Peace 
Court in 1949 against Sagayno for less serious physical injuries through 
reckless imprudence, did not interrupt the running of the period of 
prescription. We find this theory untenable. Rule 107 (a) of the Rules of Court 
provides thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * "(a) When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for 
recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged is impliedly 
instituted with the criminal action, unless the offended party expressly waives 
the civil action or reserves his right to institute it 
separately."</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as the offended party in the criminal case (Degollacion) neither 
expressly waived the civil action nor reserved his right to institute it 
separately, then the said civil action for recovery of civil liability was 
deemed impliedly instituted with the said criminal case. Under Article 1973 of 
the Old Civil Code and Article 1155 of the New Civil Code, the institution of 
said criminal action interrupted the running of the period of prescription 
during the time that the case was pending in court. The period again continued 
to run when the said criminal action was dismissed in 1954. It is therefore 
clear that considering this interruption, comprising the period from December 
13, 1949 to February 16, 1954, the period of four years, starting from September 
29, 1949, had not yet expired.</p>
<p>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised by appellee.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the appealed order of dismissal is reversed and 
this case is hereby remanded for further proceedings. With costs.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
