				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to set aside&nbsp; among others, the resolution.of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals dated April 12, 1957 dismissing defendants' appeal from the decision of the trial court.<br><br>This&nbsp; petition stems&nbsp; from&nbsp; an action for partition instituted by plaintiffs, now respondents, against defendants, now&nbsp; petitioners,&nbsp; before the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Ilocos Sur.&nbsp; Petitioners interposed&nbsp; as a defense that the property sought to be&nbsp; partitioned is paraphernal of Juana Alonzo and hence respondents have no interest in the same.<br><br>When the case was initially called&nbsp; for trial, the parties submitted&nbsp; a partial&nbsp; stipulation of facts, reserving&nbsp; their right to submit additional evidence.&nbsp; On the date set for trial, after several postponements granted&nbsp; at the&nbsp; request of both parties,&nbsp; counsel for petitioners failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear due&nbsp; to&nbsp; lingering illness, whereupon respondents were allowed to present their evidence.&nbsp; And on April 11,&nbsp; 1955, the trial court rendered decision declaring the property conjugal in nature and decreeing its partition.&nbsp; On May 26, 1955, 1&nbsp; month&nbsp; and&nbsp; 15 days&nbsp; from the rendition&nbsp; of the decision, a verified motion to set aside the decision on the grounds of mistake and excusable negligence was filed by petitioners under Section 3, Rule 38, of the Rules of Court. This motion was&nbsp; denied on the ground that it was not accompanied by an affidavit of merits as required.&nbsp; As second motion for reconsideration was filed&nbsp; by petitioners reiterating the same&nbsp; grounds for relief.&nbsp; This was again denied,&nbsp; and forthwith petitioners took the case&nbsp; on appeal to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On February&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1957, counsel for&nbsp; petitioners received notice to file their brief within 45 days from receipt&nbsp; as required by the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on February 10,1957, the same counsel received a copy of a&nbsp; motion to dismiss the appeal filed by respondents.&nbsp; On February 20,1957, counsel for petitioners received copy of&nbsp; a resolution of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals directing him to answer the motion to dismiss within&nbsp; 10 days from&nbsp; notice.&nbsp; On March 1,&nbsp; 1957, counsel filed&nbsp; his&nbsp; opposition to the&nbsp; motion to dismiss as ordered praying at the same time that,&nbsp; in view of the time&nbsp; to be spent incident to the motion to dismiss, he be allowed to file the&nbsp; brief&nbsp; of petitioners&nbsp; from the time&nbsp; notice&nbsp; is received of the resolution of the court on said motion if the same is&nbsp; denegatory.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 2, 1957, the&nbsp; Court of Appeals issued a resolution denying the motion to dismiss, but it also&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the motion of counsel for extension of time&nbsp; to&nbsp; file brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of this resolution, counsel filed an urgent petition for reconsideration praying that, if the same is denied, he be given at least&nbsp; 15&nbsp; days, to be computed from said date, within which to&nbsp; file petitioners' brief.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals not only denied this motion but also dimissed the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; in&nbsp; a resolution entered on April 12,1957, which is now subject of the present appeal.&nbsp; This resolution notwithstanding, counsel filed petitioners' brief&nbsp; on&nbsp; April 17,&nbsp; 1957.<br><br>It should be noted that counsel for petitioners&nbsp; received notice to file their&nbsp; brief within 45 days from receipt on February&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; February 10, 1957,&nbsp; counsel for respondents filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to dismiss&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; and&nbsp; on February 20,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; counsel for petitioners&nbsp; was&nbsp; required to answer the same within 10 days from receipt.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; counsel complied with by submitting a written&nbsp; opposition and praying that in view of the motion to dismiss, he be allowed to file petitioners' brief&nbsp; within the required&nbsp; period&nbsp; from the time he receives notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the resolution&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals, if the same is denegatory.&nbsp; And&nbsp; on April 12, 1957, the resolution came denying not only the motion to dismiss but also the motion for extension as prayed for.<br><br>It&nbsp; would therefore&nbsp; appear&nbsp; that if the&nbsp; period during which the motion to&nbsp; dismiss is pending consideration is included in the computation of the period granted to petitioners to&nbsp; file&nbsp; their brief, we would have that&nbsp; the 45-day period&nbsp; would&nbsp; have&nbsp; long been&nbsp; covered for&nbsp; the resolution denying said motion came only on April 12, 1957,&nbsp; whereas that period would have&nbsp; expired on March 22, 1957.&nbsp; It was therefore&nbsp; practically&nbsp; impossible for&nbsp; petitioners to file their brief as required, considering the pendency of the motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is for this&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that counsel for petitioners asked that that period&nbsp; be deemed&nbsp; to run&nbsp; from the date he&nbsp; receives notice of said&nbsp; resolution. But this petition was denied.<br><br>We find the&nbsp; denial of this petition to be improper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Section 4, Rule 8,&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, insofar as actions&nbsp; in&nbsp; the courts of&nbsp; first&nbsp; instance are concerned, a motion&nbsp; to dismiss "interrupts the time to plead", and in Torres <i>vs.</i> Ribo,&nbsp; 83 Phil., 642; 46&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; Supp.&nbsp; 11, 95, In connection with the period&nbsp; within which a&nbsp; protestee should file&nbsp; his&nbsp; answer&nbsp; when protestant&nbsp; files&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; said:&nbsp; "A&nbsp; <i>bona-fide</i>&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss&nbsp; an&nbsp; election protest suspends the period&nbsp; within which&nbsp; the&nbsp; protestee&nbsp; should file&nbsp; his answer&nbsp; until said motion&nbsp; is finally&nbsp; decided,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; should said motion for dismissal prosper there would be no need for protestee to answer."&nbsp; Although&nbsp; the rules&nbsp; concerning proceedings in the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; do not&nbsp; contain&nbsp; a similar&nbsp; provision,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; applied by&nbsp; analogy for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; if&nbsp; the motion to dismiss the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is granted, there&nbsp; will be&nbsp; no&nbsp; need for the appellant to&nbsp; submit&nbsp; his brief.&nbsp; Otherwise, the&nbsp; result would be&nbsp; that appellant&nbsp; would have&nbsp; unnecessarily&nbsp; undergone the&nbsp; work of preparing the brief and&nbsp; incurred the expenses incident thereto.&nbsp; Our ruling, 'therefore, is that the period consumed during the pendency of the motion to dismiss&nbsp; should be excluded from the period given to petitioners to submit their brief, and if this is done,&nbsp; the brief submitted&nbsp; by them on April&nbsp; 17, 1957&nbsp; may be deemed presented in due&nbsp; time.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals dated April 12, 1957 dismissing the appeal is hereby set aside.&nbsp; The case&nbsp; is remanded&nbsp; to said court for decision on the merits.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
