				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; June&nbsp; 5, 1951, petitioner Romulo&nbsp; Cuyo, a regular member of the&nbsp; Baguio&nbsp; Police Department since February 20, 1946, was&nbsp; suspended from&nbsp; office pending investigation, by councilor Luis&nbsp; Lardizabal&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baguio, of the administrative&nbsp; charges preferred against him&nbsp; (Cuyo) by the then&nbsp; City Mayor,&nbsp; involving&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; irregularities in the performance of his&nbsp; duties and violation&nbsp; of law and duty, said to&nbsp; have been committed as follows: <br><blockquote>"December 31,&nbsp; 1946, Administrative charge filed against him for Insubordination&nbsp; and Reprehensible&nbsp; Conduct; <br>"October 21, 1948, Conduct "Unbecoming a Peace Officer,&nbsp; for which he was reprimanded and warned; <br>"April&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1951, Telling a Lie, for&nbsp; which he&nbsp; was&nbsp; severely reprimanded; <br>"May 13, 1961, Abandoning&nbsp; his Post&nbsp; Without Proper Relief&nbsp; and Authority; and <br>"May&nbsp; 16, 1951, Absent&nbsp; Without&nbsp; Leave&nbsp; (AWOL)."&nbsp; (Folder of Exhibits,&nbsp; p. 5.)</blockquote>In line with&nbsp; the report of&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; conducted by said councilor, who found Cuyo guilty of said charges,&nbsp; on July 20, 1951, the City Council of Baguio passed Resolution No. 204 ordering&nbsp; his&nbsp; dismissal effective on June&nbsp; 5, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal taken therefrom, the&nbsp; Civil Service Commissioner, in a decision&nbsp; dated December 20,&nbsp; 1951, held—- after&nbsp; considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; Cuyo had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been&nbsp; punished for the individual offenses aforementioned, and that, being responsible for the maintenance&nbsp; of peace and order in the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baguio, the&nbsp; City Council&nbsp; and&nbsp; its Mayor should have some discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; choice of the members&nbsp; of its police forces—that said officers of the City were&nbsp; not guilty of abuse of discretion and that there was "nothing reversible" in said resolution of the City&nbsp; Council.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; dis- positive&nbsp; part of said decision, however, reads: <br><blockquote>"Wherefore, and in line with&nbsp; the action taken&nbsp; by this Office&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of Patrolman Quintin Bugasto of the same organization, respondent-appellant Cuyo should be, as he&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; transferred to&nbsp; another branch&nbsp; of the Baguio&nbsp; City Government.&nbsp; The decision ordering his dismissal from&nbsp; the service&nbsp; is thus modified."&nbsp; (Folder of&nbsp; Exhibits, p. 11.)</blockquote>A&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; this decision was&nbsp; denied by the Commissioner of Civil&nbsp; Service&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1952.&nbsp; On August&nbsp; 1, 1955,&nbsp; Cuyo instituted&nbsp; the present action, for mandamus and damages, in the Court of First Instance of Baguio,&nbsp; against its Mayor, Council and&nbsp; Treasurer.&nbsp; In his petition he&nbsp; prays: <br><blockquote>"(1) that the investigation&nbsp; had, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; made in the administrative charge against the petitioner be declared&nbsp; illegal, null and void ab ibtio; <br>"(2) that the respondent City Mayor of Eaguio be&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; to reinstate&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; as&nbsp; member&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Baguio&nbsp; City&nbsp; Police Department; <br>"(3) that the respondents&nbsp; be&nbsp; ordered to pay to the petitioner his salary from June 5,&nbsp; 1951, until actually&nbsp; reinstated; <br>"(4) that the respondents&nbsp; be condemned to&nbsp; pay to the petitioner the sum of P1,000.00 as&nbsp; attorney's fees,&nbsp; plus the costs of this suit; and<br>&nbsp;"(5) that the petitioner be granted all reliefs and remedies deemed just and equitable in the premises." </blockquote>In&nbsp; due course,&nbsp; said&nbsp; court rendered a decision, the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part of which follows: <br><blockquote>"Judgment is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; rendered against Respondents, ordering them to place Petitioner&nbsp; in&nbsp; another branch of the City&nbsp; Government;&nbsp; Petitioner shall be&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to his back&nbsp; pay as policeman from June 5, 1051;&nbsp; No attorney's&nbsp; fees&nbsp; are awarded Petitioner as this is a&nbsp; case of good faith on the part of Respondents; No special pronouncement as to costs." </blockquote>The case is&nbsp; now before us on appeal taken by the respondents.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; maintains that his dismissal by the City&nbsp; Council of Baguio is null and&nbsp; void, the administrative charges&nbsp; preferred against&nbsp; him having been&nbsp; investigated,&nbsp; not by said Council, but by&nbsp; one of&nbsp; its members, in violation of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 557, as construed in Festejo vs.&nbsp; Municipal Mayor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nabua&nbsp; (96&nbsp; Phil., 286, 51 Off. Gaz., 121).&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; repeatedly&nbsp; held that administrative charges against members of the local police force&nbsp; must,&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 557,&nbsp; be investigated by the Municipal&nbsp; or City&nbsp; Council,&nbsp; and that an investigation conducted by,&nbsp; either a&nbsp; member, or a committee thereof, is null&nbsp; and void,&nbsp; even if the&nbsp; Council shall have&nbsp; approved the action and recommendation&nbsp; of&nbsp; its investigating member or committee (see Covacha vs. Amante, L-8358,&nbsp; May 25, 1956; Carmona vs. Amante,&nbsp; 99&nbsp; Phil., 716; Senarillos vs.&nbsp; Hermosisima, 100 Phil., 501,&nbsp; 53&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., [4] 1043). <br>&nbsp;<br>It&nbsp; is,&nbsp; also,&nbsp; settled, however, that the reinstatement of an&nbsp; officer illegally dismissed may not be secured by mandamus,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; action therefor is&nbsp; filed over&nbsp; one (1) year after his dismissal.&nbsp; The reason for this rule is that the right to a public office may be lost by abandonment thereof, which may be deduced from his failure to seek reinstatement within said&nbsp; period of one (1) year (Florentino Jose, Jr., vs. Arsenio H. Lacson, L-10477, May 17,&nbsp; 1957; Unabia vs.&nbsp; Hon. City&nbsp; Mayor,&nbsp; 99&nbsp; Phil., 253), and&nbsp; that "it&nbsp; is not proper&nbsp; that the title to public office should be subjected to&nbsp; continued&nbsp; uncertainty, and people's&nbsp; interest requires that such right should be determined as speedily as practicable" (Tumulak vs. Egay,&nbsp; 82 Phil., 828,&nbsp; 48 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 3693, 3695). <br><br>In the case at bar, Cuyo's motion for reconsideration of the&nbsp; decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service, substantially affirming the action taken by the City Council of Bagnio, was denied by&nbsp; said officer&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 13, 1952. Although the resolution&nbsp; of said Council, dismissing Cuyo, was modified by the&nbsp; Commissioner of&nbsp; Civil Service, in&nbsp; the sense that petitioner&nbsp; "should be,&nbsp; as he is hereby transferred to another branch of the Baguio&nbsp; City Government,"&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; seemingly, understood the decision of said Commissioner&nbsp; as sustaining the removal of Cuyo from the police force.&nbsp; What is more, said decision, as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the attitude or inaction of the City Government of Baguio, was&nbsp; similarly construed by the petitioner, for, in his petition herein, Cuyo alleges that&nbsp; he "should not have been <i>separated</i> as member of&nbsp; the police force&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baguio, <i>until</i> and unless he is 'transferred to another branch of the City Government of Baguio in accordance&nbsp; with the decision of the Commissioner of Civil Service" (paragraph VII), and that "respondents&nbsp; failed and&nbsp; still fail, neglected and&nbsp; still neglect, refused and still refuse to <i>reinstate</i>&nbsp; the petitioner to his&nbsp; position as member of the Baguio City Police Department"&nbsp; (paragraph VIII).&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; Cuyo&nbsp; understood the aforementioned&nbsp; decision&nbsp; as authorizing&nbsp; his <i>dismissal</i> from said&nbsp; department, upon his transfer to&nbsp; another branch&nbsp; of the City Government, and regarded&nbsp; the action&nbsp; taken by the latter as amounting to his <i>removal</i> from the police force, prior to said transfer, and, yet,&nbsp; he did not bring this&nbsp; case&nbsp; until August 1,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; or about three&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; years and live (5) months after the&nbsp; denial of his aforesaid motion for&nbsp; reconsideration.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of the legality or&nbsp; illegality&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; resolution of the&nbsp; City Council of Baguio, Cuyo's petition for mandamus is barred by the implied abandonment of his office&nbsp; and, also, by&nbsp; laches.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a&nbsp; consequence,&nbsp; his claims&nbsp; for backpay&nbsp; and damages&nbsp; must,&nbsp; also,&nbsp; fail.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision&nbsp; appealed from must be, as it is hereby reversed, and the&nbsp; petition dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bantista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Reyes, J.
