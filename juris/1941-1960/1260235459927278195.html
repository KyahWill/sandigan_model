				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; by Tia Fong <span style="font-style: italic;">alias&nbsp;</span> Ah Sam against a judgment&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Misamis Oriental finding the' said Ah Sam, Maximo Alcantar,&nbsp; Florencio Bahala&nbsp; and&nbsp; Rufino Palarca guilty of homicide and sentencing each of them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> to fourteen (14)&nbsp; years and eight&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; months of reclusion temporal, to indemnify the heirs of the&nbsp; deceased Lian Kaw in the amount of P3,000 and to pay the costs.&nbsp; Only the said Ah Sam has appealed.<br><br>It appears that early in&nbsp; the morning&nbsp; of&nbsp; February 21, 1950 the Municipal&nbsp; Mayor of Mambaiao, Misamis Oriental, was informed that&nbsp; a dead body was lying in the coconut plantation&nbsp; of&nbsp; one&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Juan Neri&nbsp; in said municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Mayor and some of his1 policemen and the President of the&nbsp; Sanitary&nbsp; Division went to the place indicated, and there they found the dead body&nbsp; of a Chinaman named Lian Kao, 28 years of age, son of Chinaman Wong&nbsp; Kiat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sanitary&nbsp;&nbsp; Division found&nbsp; the&nbsp; body in&nbsp; a state of rigidity and calculated that death must have occurred from 9&nbsp; to 12 hours before' the discovery.&nbsp; He found an incised wound one inch in length on the right&nbsp; brow,&nbsp; a&nbsp; depressed wound ½ inch in depth at the vertex of the head, ecehymosis with slight tumefaction of the head&nbsp; and the upper part of the neck above a line which appeared to be the line&nbsp; of strangulation.&nbsp; The body&nbsp; was found&nbsp; with a&nbsp; belt tied&nbsp; around the neck,&nbsp; and the president&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sanitary division was of the&nbsp; opinion that death was caused by suffocation or by strangulation after the&nbsp; victim had become unconscious.<br><br>The.authors of the crime could not be immediately determined until a lieutenant of the Constabulary by the name of Alberto N. Chavez was detailed&nbsp; to conduct the&nbsp; investigation. He&nbsp; began making&nbsp; inquiries in and&nbsp; about the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; He suspected Florencio Bahala,&nbsp; who was living in the neighborhood, and subjected him to a rigid questioning.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; noticed that his&nbsp; statements did not agree with&nbsp; those&nbsp; of his common-law&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; After some time Chavez succeeded in convincing him, through the&nbsp; help of the wife,&nbsp; to own his part in the crime.&nbsp; Bahala made a confession,on March 9, 1950.&nbsp; The confession of Maximo Alcantar&nbsp; and Rufino Palarca were also secured.&nbsp;&nbsp; So an information was filed on March 9, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was amended&nbsp; on March 10, 1950.&nbsp; The&nbsp; persons accused&nbsp; were the three&nbsp; above-mentioned&nbsp; who&nbsp; has confessed, and Heracleo Limbaco and the appellant Tia Fong alias Ah Sam.&nbsp; Both Limbaco and Ah Sam denied complicity in the crime.&nbsp; At the trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; other defendants repudiated&nbsp; the confessions they had&nbsp; made.&nbsp; This&nbsp; notwithstanding,&nbsp; the court found four&nbsp; of them guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Heracleo Limbaco was&nbsp; acquitted of the charge.&nbsp; As only Ah Sam has appealed the decision, only such facts as are relevant to the charge against him , "will be considered.<br><br>Sometime before the incident, Ah Sam was in partnership&nbsp; with Wong Kiat&nbsp; and other&nbsp; Chinamen.&nbsp; Ah Sam separated from Wong Kiat and the others and established a store of his own.&nbsp; A&nbsp; compadre of his&nbsp; by the name of Hermogenes&nbsp; Tago&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that at eight o'clock&nbsp; in the everjng of&nbsp; February&nbsp; 20, 1950, after he&nbsp; had closed the store and while he was outside, he&nbsp; saw Tia Fong pass by and&nbsp; had occasion to&nbsp; converse with the latter.&nbsp; Ah Sara complained&nbsp; that&nbsp; his&nbsp; business&nbsp; was&nbsp; flying because&nbsp; Wong Kiat, the father of the deceased, and his companions&nbsp; would not sell him bread to sell in his store.&nbsp; Ah Sam after a while said it is better that Wong Kiat and Lian Kaw be whipped.<br><br>The&nbsp; evidence mainly relied upon&nbsp; for the conviction of Ah Sam is his silent participation in the&nbsp; reenactment of the crime by&nbsp; his co-accused Florcncio Bahala, Maximo Alcantar and Rufmo&nbsp; Palavca.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the confessions of these three accused on hand, Lt. Chavez and a subordinate of his, Sgt.&nbsp; Fernandez, asked the accused to reenact the crime and photographs of the acts reenacted were&nbsp; caused to be&nbsp; taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; all the&nbsp; most important incidents&nbsp; and details of the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp; Ah&nbsp; Sam took part, although&nbsp; silently, under&nbsp; the direction of the&nbsp; Constabulary and his three co-accused.<br><br>In Exhibit "Q" Tia Fong reenacted his position while wailing for&nbsp; his co-accused.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Exhibit "II" he reenacted his own position when he and his co-accused were talking together planning the commission of the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Exhibit "R" Ah&nbsp; Sam also&nbsp; reenacted&nbsp; his own&nbsp; position or participation while he and his co-accused were waiting for Erak (Heracleo Limbaco), who had gone out to look for the&nbsp; intended&nbsp; victim&nbsp; and present&nbsp; him to&nbsp; them.&nbsp; In Exhibit "K" Ah&nbsp; Sam also re on acted his&nbsp; own&nbsp; position in relation&nbsp; lo&nbsp; the other&nbsp; accused&nbsp; when Erak accompanied the victim&nbsp; and the other accused&nbsp; followed them—Erak and&nbsp; tho victim.<br><br>Exhibit "M" represents the positions of all the accused, Ah Sam included, as the&nbsp; victim fell unconscious after he had&nbsp; been assaulted.&nbsp; In this same&nbsp; exhibit,&nbsp; Ah Sam&nbsp; re-enacted the&nbsp; part he took in untying&nbsp; the belt of the' victim, In Exhibit&nbsp; "N"&nbsp; Ah&nbsp; Sam played&nbsp; his own part, shoving the method in which he strangled&nbsp; the victim.&nbsp; Exhibit "U" is the photograph of the manner in which appelant tied the belt which he took&nbsp; from the victim's&nbsp; waist .and with&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter was strangled,&nbsp; while Exhibit "W" reenacts the distribution of the money by&nbsp; him to his co-accused.<br><br>The witnesses for the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; especially Lt. Chavez, testified that Ah Sam took part in the reenactment of the crime and without any opposition on his&nbsp; (Ah&nbsp; Sam's) part. He (Ah Sam)&nbsp; neither&nbsp; opposed nor denied to take part. On one occasion Ah&nbsp; Sam himself, according to Lt. Chavez, corrected&nbsp; his&nbsp; co-accused&nbsp; as&nbsp; they were reenacting their respective positions&nbsp; as&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "K" was being taken,&nbsp; as witness&nbsp; the&nbsp; following testimony—<br><blockquote>" * * *<br>A. Tia&nbsp; Fong did not object&nbsp; neither did he&nbsp; show&nbsp; signs of complaint when his co-accused&nbsp; indicated&nbsp; their relative positions&nbsp; in the picture.<br><br>Q. In what pictures or scenes which were photographed, was it in all occasions in which Tia Fong ever made any correction or complaint regarding their relative positions?<br><br>A. As a matter&nbsp; of fact, in one of those picture, Tia long after his&nbsp; co-accused indicated his&nbsp; relative position in the picture, complained to the fact that his position was not&nbsp; right, and consequently, he said that he was not supposed to be on the right side of the picture but on the extreme left of the road or street.<ifl not ="" right,="" and="" consequently,="" said="" that="" he="" was="" not="" supposed="" to="" be="" right="" side="" picture="" but="" on="" extreme="" left="" of="" the="" road="" or="" srteet.=""><br>* * * "<br></ifl></blockquote>Ah&nbsp; Sam testified that&nbsp; before the reenactment of the crime&nbsp; ho was told before hand&nbsp; to obey&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; instructions&nbsp; Sgt. Fernandez would give, and that he&nbsp; (Ah Sam) tried&nbsp; his&nbsp; best&nbsp; to&nbsp; obey&nbsp; said instructions According to him, Sgt. Fernandez would first read the paper (confession of his co-accused), then direct&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused to assume the positions,&nbsp; and&nbsp; lastly ordered&nbsp; pictures&nbsp; to be taken. Ah Sam further declared that he Just&nbsp; followed&nbsp; the directions given&nbsp; by&nbsp; Sgt.&nbsp; Fernandez&nbsp; because he&nbsp; had&nbsp; already been maltreated.&nbsp; The supposed maltreatment consisted in having been&nbsp; boxed in&nbsp; the <i>solar plexus</i>&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; of which he involuntarily urinated.<br><br>The trial judge held that the&nbsp; guilt of&nbsp; Ah&nbsp; Sam&nbsp; was proved&nbsp; by his participation in&nbsp; the reenactment of&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp; His counsel, on this appeal, argues that it&nbsp; was error for the trial court to consider said participation as an evidence against; him, because&nbsp; all that the appellant did&nbsp; during the entire&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; reenactment was to remain silent and do what he was told and directed to do. Against this contention the Solicitor&nbsp; General argues that the appellant himself voluntarily took part in the reenactment and in one instance corrected the position which he was .directed to take.<br><br>We have carefully reviewed the evidence, especially the testimony&nbsp; of the appellant on the&nbsp; circumstances leading to his participation in the reenactment,&nbsp; and we&nbsp; find&nbsp; no evidence to sustain the claim&nbsp; that he was forced against his .will to participate therein.&nbsp; It is 'true&nbsp; that&nbsp; Ah&nbsp; Sam stated that he' was boxed on the <i>solar plexus,</i> and Was&nbsp; later brought to, a&nbsp; toilet where he was compelled to&nbsp; put his face in&nbsp; the&nbsp; bowl, but these supposed instances of&nbsp; maltreatment&nbsp; relate to attempts to extract a confession from him, not to compel him to take part in the reenactment of the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stated that Sgt. Fernandez&nbsp; had&nbsp; warned him. to obey his orders&nbsp; in the reenactment otherwise&nbsp; he . would again be subject to maltreatment, put we find nothing to&nbsp; corroborate&nbsp; the making of the supposed&nbsp; threat and appellant's willing conduct throughout the&nbsp; reenactment does not evince the supposed threat.&nbsp; We have&nbsp; searched the&nbsp; record in vain for any act or&nbsp; word of&nbsp; protest from appellant,&nbsp; either&nbsp; before the reenactment or&nbsp; during the entire period&nbsp; thereof, against&nbsp; his taking part&nbsp; therein. Appellant's counsel himself admits that the appellant was silent, doing what he was told to do.<br><br>But&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for the&nbsp; appellant contends&nbsp; that as&nbsp; the appellant was under&nbsp; arrest at the time of the reenactment,&nbsp; his&nbsp; taking part therein should not&nbsp; be considered as evidence against him.<br><br>The principle that may govern the relevancy and admissibility of appellant's participation in the reenactment is stated in section 8 of Rule 123 of the Rules, which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. S. <i>Admission by&nbsp; silence.</i>—Any act&nbsp; or declaration made in the presence and "within&nbsp; the observation of a party who does or says nothing when&nbsp; the act or&nbsp; declaration is such as naturally to call for action or comment if not true, may be given in evidence against&nbsp; him."<br></blockquote>In tine case decided by us, U. S. <i>vs.</i> Bay, 27 Phil., 495, the defendant was accused before the councilman&nbsp; of&nbsp; a barrio with having criminally assaulted the offended party.&nbsp; The defendant kept silent&nbsp; as the latter&nbsp; explained the&nbsp; assault, neither admitting&nbsp; nor denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; imputation.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; the trial he allege that the imputation was false,&nbsp; but we held that if it were so, he would have instantly and indignantly denied the imputation when made before the councilman.<br><br>But in&nbsp; another case, we also said that if a defendant remains silent during&nbsp; an official investigation&nbsp; by a IFiscal, such silence&nbsp; is no evidence&nbsp; of his&nbsp; guilt, as&nbsp; said&nbsp; official investigation was no occasion for denying the imputation then being made against him&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> De&nbsp; la Cruz,&nbsp; 12 Phil., 87).<br><br>There are&nbsp; other related principles,&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with the silence of an accused in&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; cases, namely, that his failure or refusal to&nbsp; testify may not&nbsp; be taken as evidence against him (Rule 111, section&nbsp; 1 [c],&nbsp; and that&nbsp; he may&nbsp; refuse&nbsp; to answer an incriminating question&nbsp; [Rule 123,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 79].&nbsp; It&nbsp; has also&nbsp; been&nbsp; held that while&nbsp; an accused is under custody his&nbsp; silence&nbsp; may not be&nbsp; taken as evidence against him as he has a right to remain silent; his silence when&nbsp; in custody may not be used as&nbsp; evidence against him, otherwise his right of silence would be illusory.<br><blockquote>"Section&nbsp;&nbsp; 1259 (d)&nbsp; Silence under&nbsp; Arrest.&nbsp; Some of the&nbsp; courts have held that the fact that&nbsp; one is under arrest&nbsp; and in the custody of an officer, when he is silent under accusation, prevents his&nbsp; silence or the statements themselves from being&nbsp; admissible&nbsp; against him, on the ground that&nbsp; under such circumstances he is not called upon to speak. Other courts have held that this circumstance alone does not render the evidence inadmissible, and that an&nbsp; accusation of crime calls for reply even from a person under arrest or in the custody of an officer, -where the circumstances&nbsp; surrounding him indicate that he is free to answer.if he chooses so to do.&nbsp; * * *", (16 C. J. 633.)<br><br>"Sec. 574. <i>Accused under Arrest or in custody.</i>—The authorities are divided&nbsp; as to the effect on the admissibility of an incriminating statement made&nbsp; in the presence, of an accused,&nbsp; and not denied&nbsp; by him, of the fact that lie was&nbsp; Tinder arrest or in&nbsp; custody under a criminal charge&nbsp; at the time the statement was made.&nbsp; According to some decisions,&nbsp; the mere fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; arrest, alone, is&nbsp; not sufficient to render the testimony inadmissible, but such, fact deserves&nbsp; consideration only as one of&nbsp; the circumstances under which the accusation was made,&nbsp; in determining whether the accused&nbsp; was&nbsp; afforded an opportunity to deny&nbsp; and whether he was naturally called to do so. Another view supported by many&nbsp; authorities is that the&nbsp; mere fact that an accused&nbsp; was&nbsp; under arrest is sufficient to render inadmissible the fact&nbsp; of the failure of the accused&nbsp; to&nbsp; deny&nbsp; accusatory statements made in his presence and bearing.&nbsp; According&nbsp; to this view, it&nbsp; is common knowledge and belief&nbsp; of men&nbsp; in general that silence while under arrest is most conducive to the welfare of an accused, whether he,&nbsp; is&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; or&nbsp; innocent.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * " (20&nbsp; Am, Jur. 486.)<br></blockquote>But the better&nbsp; rule&nbsp; is to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; in each&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; decide&nbsp; the&nbsp; admissibility of&nbsp; the silence accordingly.<br><blockquote>"(4)&nbsp; Certain&nbsp; situations&nbsp; in&nbsp; particular&nbsp; may&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; a positive motive&nbsp; for&nbsp; silence without regard to the&nbsp; truth or falsity&nbsp; of the statement. Whether&nbsp; the fact that the party is at the time under arrest creates such&nbsp; a situation has been the subject&nbsp; of opposing opinions;&nbsp; a few Courts (for&nbsp; the most part&nbsp; in acceptance&nbsp; of&nbsp; an early Massachusetts&nbsp; precedent), by a rule of thumb exclude the statement invariably; but the better rule is to allow some flexibility according&nbsp; to&nbsp; circumstances: *&nbsp; * * "&nbsp; (IV&nbsp; Wigmore,&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 80-81.)<br></blockquote>Let us now&nbsp; examine the facts and&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of the reenactment in&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; above principles.<br><br>The reenactment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime was&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; a formal official&nbsp; investigation like one conducted by a justice of the peace or&nbsp; a&nbsp; provincial fiscal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reenactment was a policy contrivance, designed, to test the truthfulness&nbsp; of the statements&nbsp; of the&nbsp; witnesses who&nbsp; had&nbsp; confessed the commission of the offense.&nbsp; If the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; herein had not really taken part in the commission of the crime,&nbsp; his immediate reaction when he became aware that the&nbsp; crime was to&nbsp; be reenacted, should have been to protest against the implication&nbsp; of-the&nbsp; reenactment or&nbsp; to refuse his indicated participation therein.&nbsp; One of&nbsp; the accused, Heraeleo Limbaco, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; admit participation in&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp; Like the appellant,&nbsp; he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; confess yet&nbsp; he was&nbsp; not&nbsp; asked to participate&nbsp; in the reenactment.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand the appellant readily&nbsp; took&nbsp; part therein.&nbsp; If he did&nbsp; own participation in the offense he should have refused,&nbsp; at least in the&nbsp; beginning, to&nbsp; participate in the reenactment or to follow the&nbsp; directions&nbsp; indicated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from doing so, he acquiesced and willingly took&nbsp; part in the reenactment as directed.&nbsp; If the appellant had the courage to refuse to own his guilt&nbsp; when he was boxed on&nbsp; the <i>solar plexus,</i> or when he was&nbsp; forced to put his face in the toilet bowl, why did he not have the courage to protest his participation in the reenactment before or while it was being conducted ?<br><br>It is to be noted that the implication of guilt in the case at bar&nbsp; is not&nbsp; derived from mere silence;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is inferred from&nbsp; appellant's silent&nbsp; acquiescence in&nbsp; participating in the reenactment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than mere&nbsp; silence, appellant committed&nbsp; positive acts without protest or denial when he was&nbsp; free to refuse..&nbsp; Had&nbsp; he not&nbsp; actually participated in the&nbsp; commission of the offense for which he is charged, he would have protested being made to take part in the reenactment thereof; he would have- informed&nbsp; the public officials&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of the reenactment, or immediately&nbsp; prior thereto,&nbsp; that he did not actually take part in the commission of the offense.&nbsp; We, therefore, find that the trial court&nbsp; committed no error in taking into account appellant's participation in the reenactment as voluntary and in considering it as evidence&nbsp; against him.<br><br>The circumstances or evidence submitted against&nbsp; the appellant in this&nbsp; case are as follows: he was the only one among&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; who&nbsp; had a&nbsp; motive&nbsp; for causing&nbsp; the death of Lian&nbsp; Kaw; had he&nbsp; not actually participated in the commission of the offense&nbsp; he would have been&nbsp; able to introduced&nbsp; positive&nbsp; evidence that&nbsp; he was either&nbsp; not present or was somewhere&nbsp; else and, therefore, could&nbsp; not have taken part&nbsp; in the said crime; the&nbsp; confession of&nbsp; his co-accused as to&nbsp; the reason for the killing and as to&nbsp; the manner in which the offense&nbsp; was committed corroborates or indicates the probability of the appellant having participated therein; and his silent acquiescence&nbsp; in&nbsp; taking part in the reenactment and his voluntary and ready participation therein produce conviction as to his actual participation in the commission of the offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; The above circumstances convince us that the appellant Ah Sam participated in the commission of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime,&nbsp; inducing&nbsp; his co-accused to help him perpetrate it, he himself actually taking direct part therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find, therefore,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; trial court committed no error in&nbsp; finding him guilty as charged.<br><br>The Solicitor General calls attention to the fact that the crime committed is not mere homicide, but murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The information charges murder, and the facts&nbsp; found show that the killing of the deceased is attended by one qualifying circumstance,&nbsp; that of' evident premeditation.&nbsp; The other aggravating circumstances. possibly attending the commission of the crime cannot be imputed to the appellant herein, so the offense&nbsp; with which&nbsp; he may be convicted&nbsp; is&nbsp; that of simple murder qualified by the circumstance of evident premeditation.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is hereby modified&nbsp; and instead&nbsp; of homicide the appellant Tia Fong <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Ah&nbsp; Sam is found&nbsp; guilty of murder, without any&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; or mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; The sentence imposed upon him by the trial court is therefore raised&nbsp; to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua.</span>&nbsp; In all other respects, the sentence imposed is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against the appellant.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.
