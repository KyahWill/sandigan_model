				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DEMETRIO CAIMBRE, ET AL., DEFENDANTS. EDILBERTO JUSTIMBASTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Edilberto Justimbaste, Demetrio Caimbre and Vicente Caimbre were charged with 
murder in the Court of First Instance of Leyte. Upon arraignment, Demetrio 
Caimbre pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of homicide and was sentenced 
accordingly. After trial upon a plea of not guilty, Edilberto Justimbaste and 
Vicente Caimbre were convicted, as co-principals by inducement, of the crime of 
murder, and each sentenced to life imprisonment, to indemnify, jointly and 
severally, the heirs of the deceased Angel Olimpo in the amount of P6,000.00, 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 
proportionately the costs.
<p>From said decision, only Edilberto Justimbaste interposed the present 
appeal.</p>
<p>The prosecution evidence shows that at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of 
May 4, 1956, Angel Olimpo and Fausto Broa arrived at the house of Esteban 
Caimbre at Sitio Cabaluran, Dagami, Leyte, and sat themselves on a mortar. 
Shortly thereafter, Demetrio Caimbre arrived, sat on the same mortar and then, 
without any provocation, slashed Angel Olimpo with a bolo. Olimpo ran to a 
nearby palay seed bed pursued by Demetrio up to the border of the ricefield 
where he was overtaken by his pursuer who slashed him) again several times with 
his bolo and then left him in the ricefield. During the pursuit appellant told 
Demetrio: "You had better killed him". Upon the suggestion of Fausto Broa, the 
victim was removed from the ricefield and taken to higher ground. When Vicente 
Caimbre noticed that he was still alive, he told his brother, Demetrio: "Finish 
him, finish him". Whereupon, Demetrio cut Olimpo's neck, saying: "He would be 
lucky if he could still survive".</p>
<p>Upon the above facts—and considering that in a criminal case all doubts 
should be resolved in favor of the accused— we are of the opinion that the 
appealed decision should be reversed and appellant Justimbaste acquitted.</p>
<p>In the first place, the determining causes of the crime appear to have been 
Demetrio's own determination to kill and his brother's inducement and not that 
which allegedly came from appellant when he uttered the words: "You had better 
killed him". It is true that thereafter Demetrio overtook his victim and started 
attacking him anew with his bolo, but he afterwards left him prostrate in the 
ricefield from which place he was later taken to higher ground. It was then 
that, noticing that the victim was still alive, Demetrio's brother urged him to 
finish him up, and, obeying the suggestion, Demetrio severed the head of his 
victim from the trunk. In this connection it does not affirmatively appear that 
the wounds already inflicted upon Angel Olimpo before his head was cut off were 
necessarily mortal.</p>
<p>In the second place, in determining whether the acts or utterances of an 
accused are sufficient to make him guilty as co-principal by inducement, it must 
be shown that the inducement was of such a nature and made in such a way as to 
become the determining cause of the crime, and that such inducement was offered 
precisely with the intention of producing the result. In other words, it must 
appear that the inducement was made directly with the intention of procuring the 
commission of the crime and that such inducement was the determining cause 
thereof. In the present case, there is nothing to show that appellant had any 
reason at all to have Angel Olimpo killed. On the other hand, even before he 
allegedly uttered the words attributed to him, Demetrio Caimbre had already 
boloed his victim several times and when the latter ran away he pursued him 
until he overtook him in a nearby palay seed bed where he slashed him again 
several times with his bolo. Obviously he needed no exhortation from appellant 
to .persuade him to kill his victim. To this we must add the circumstance that 
there is no evidence to show that appellant had sufficient moral influence over 
Demetrio Caimbre as to make the latter obey him blindly.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby reversed and appellant Edilberto 
Justimbaste is acquitted, with his proportionate share of the costs <em>de 
oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
