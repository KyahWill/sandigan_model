				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; a petition for certiorari filed&nbsp; by the Pangasinan Transportation&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (pantranco) ' seeking&nbsp; to review the order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations dated June 14, 1955, finding said Company guilty of unfair labor practice under&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 4&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875.&nbsp; The facts of the case may be abridgedly stated ,as follows: <br><br>On November 3, 1953,&nbsp; a complaint was filed with the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Acting Prosecutor of said Court, upon charges filed by the pelta (Pangasinan Employees, Laborers &amp; Tenants Association)&nbsp; against the panteanco (Pangasinan Transportation Co.), its Traffic and Shop Superintendents, John McGuinness and Juan Andreu, respectively (Case&nbsp; No. 67-ULP).&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint alleged that on March 20, 1953, a petition for compulsory arbitration of certain demands was filed by complainant pelta against the respondent pantranco (Case No. 842-V) ; that during the pendency of said case, and&nbsp; with the filing of case No. 28-ULP&nbsp; (wherein the petitioning Union charged the defendant Company of committing unfair labor practices), respondent Corporation through Traffic Superintendent John McGuinness, arbitrarily dismissed Patricio Tuliao on August 13, 1953, Santiago Asido on September&nbsp; 12, 1953, and that Shop Superintendent Juan Andreu refused to give work to Cornelio Reyes from September 16 to&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 19S3, allegedly for being members of the Union, said Prosecutor certifying that he had conducted&nbsp; an investigation&nbsp; of the complained acts and that there were reasonable grounds to believe that same&nbsp; had been committed by the&nbsp; respondents. <br><br>The&nbsp; record&nbsp; further&nbsp; shows that before&nbsp; this complaint was filed, the Union, through counsel, filed&nbsp; an "Amended Complaint" with the CIR, dated September&nbsp; 24, 1953,&nbsp; and bearing Case No. 67-ULP, alleging that complaining Union had no&nbsp; less than 500 members&nbsp; employed in the Company, among whom are Patricio Tuliao, conductor, Santiago Asido, driver, and Cornelio Reyes, blacksmith; that John McGuinness and Juan Andreu arbitrarily dismissed the said&nbsp; employees&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; for being&nbsp; members of the Union; that there was a labor dispute pending before&nbsp; that Court&nbsp; bet- ween the same parties. (Case No. 842-V), and praying that defendant be ordered to cease&nbsp; and desist&nbsp; from such acts of unfair labor practices; that the maximum penalty be imposed on the person responsible for&nbsp; such acts;&nbsp; that if the person responsible was a foreigner, after investigation, the&nbsp; records&nbsp; of the ease&nbsp; be forwarded to the&nbsp; Deportation Board&nbsp; for&nbsp; appropriate proceedings;&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; aforementioned members of the Union be ordered reinstated immediately with back wages and for such&nbsp; other relief that may be just and equitable in the premises.&nbsp; It seems that this "Amended Complaint" was the basis&nbsp; of the complaint filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Acting Prosecutor of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations, both being numbered Case No. 67-ULP. <br><br>It&nbsp; also appears&nbsp; on record&nbsp; that on&nbsp; October 23,&nbsp; 1953 before&nbsp; the institution of the complaint by the Prosecutor, the petitioning Union&nbsp; and its&nbsp; members declared a&nbsp; strike and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the President of the Philippines certified the case to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations for compulsory arbitration&nbsp; pursuant to&nbsp; Section 10 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 875, docketed&nbsp; as&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1-IPA.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations, <i>en banc</i>, issued a&nbsp; resolution dated January&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; ordering the members&nbsp; of the Union to return&nbsp; to work not later than January 18, 1964, stating that&nbsp; upon agreement&nbsp; of the parties "those workers who are subject of ULP cases pending in this Court and those under criminal investigation or accused in any&nbsp; court&nbsp; of justice, shall not be. readmitted by the&nbsp; management for the present, but&nbsp; their cases shall be heard by the&nbsp; corresponding courts until final determination". <br><br>After trial on the merits, the lower Court issued an order dated June&nbsp; 14, 1955,&nbsp; finding that&nbsp; unfair labor practices were committed by John McGuinness in&nbsp; suspending Patricio Tuliao and by Juan Andreu in&nbsp; suspending Cornelio Reyes,&nbsp; but upheld the dismissal of Santiago Asido.&nbsp; It, therefore, ordered respondents:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><ol><li>To cease and desist from dismissing-, discharging or otherwise prejudice or discriminate&nbsp; against their employees for their union affiliations&nbsp; and/or for having; filed charges or&nbsp; for having given or being&nbsp; about to give testimony under Republic Act No. 875; and <br></li><li>To make whole&nbsp; Patricio Tuliao and Cornolio Reyes for any loss of pay each may have suffered by reason of the respondents' discrimination&nbsp; against&nbsp; them,&nbsp; by&nbsp; payment&nbsp; to&nbsp; each of them of a sum equal to the&nbsp; amount which each normally would have earned as wages from the date of respondents'&nbsp; discrimination to the date they&nbsp; are actually re-admitted.&nbsp; Tuliao&nbsp; and Reyes&nbsp; are&nbsp; entitled to the benefit of vacation and sick leave with pay from the date of their re-admission computed on a&nbsp; basis of continuous service which covers the period&nbsp; between the&nbsp; date of their suspension up to the date&nbsp; of their re-admission, without prejudice to seniority or other rights or privileges".<br></li></ol></blockquote>The&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Company having been denied by the Court en&nbsp; bane, said defendant filed the present certiorari case, and in this instance alleges that the respondent Court committed grave and serious error of law and grave and serious abuse of discretion in ignoring and disregarding evidence&nbsp; favorable to&nbsp; herein petitioners; in&nbsp; concluding&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners John McGuinness and&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Andreu committed&nbsp; unfair labor practices; and&nbsp; in ordering petitioners&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; respondents Patricio Tuliao and Cornelio Reyes&nbsp; their wages from the time they were suspended up to the&nbsp; date of their actual readmission to service. <br><br>Pending the action of this Court on the petition for certiorari filed by the&nbsp; PANTRANCO, respondents pelta, Patricio Tuliao and Cornelio Reyes filed with the lower court&nbsp; a motion for execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; which was opposed by the Company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before said motion&nbsp; was resolved by the court below, this Court gave due&nbsp; course&nbsp; to the present certiorari&nbsp; case by resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; October 5, 1955, and upon motion of&nbsp; the respondent Prosecutor, he was excluded on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; not a necessary&nbsp; party&nbsp; to this action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondents&nbsp; PELTA,&nbsp; Reyes and&nbsp; Tuliao filed their answer within&nbsp; the reglementary&nbsp; period, admitting some of the allegations of the petition and denying others, maintaining that&nbsp; no error or&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; had&nbsp; been committed by the trial court in&nbsp; promulgating the order in question,&nbsp; and praying&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; be&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; and that they&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted such other relief that may&nbsp; be just and equitable in the premises.<br><br>The respondent&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations, represented by counsel, also timely&nbsp; filed its answer contending&nbsp; that there had been no abuse&nbsp; of discretion&nbsp; on the part of said Court; that the respondent Court did not intend to declare that&nbsp; Cornelio&nbsp; Reyes was suspended for being lazy, and as could be inferred from the succeeding sentences, there must have been a&nbsp; clerical error in the omission&nbsp; of the word "allegedly" which should properly appear before the phrase "for being&nbsp; lazy";&nbsp; that&nbsp; the order&nbsp; sought to&nbsp; be reviewed involves purely findings of fact,&nbsp; and, therefore, prayed for the dismissal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petition. <br><br>Meanwhile, or&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 8, 1955, the lower&nbsp; court issued an order in&nbsp; connection with the motion for execution previously filed by petitioners&nbsp; therein, holding that&nbsp; in virtue of the express provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 6 of Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 875, said Court&nbsp; had no other alternative but&nbsp; to execute the order&nbsp; of June 14, 1955,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of any writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; injunction from&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court restraining the former from&nbsp; enforcing the&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein&nbsp; petitioner moved to reconsider said&nbsp; order which was denied by resolution of that&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; February&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; with Acting Presiding&nbsp; Judge Jose S. Bautista dissenting. <br><br>Petitioner, therefore, filed&nbsp; with this Court&nbsp; an urgent- petition for a&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of injunction on the ground that the execution of the decision appealed from during the pendency of the present action will&nbsp; not&nbsp; only cause the herein petitioners&nbsp; irreparable injury but&nbsp; would&nbsp; also&nbsp; work&nbsp; injustice to them, further aggravating and multiplying the issues in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; said petition was denied by this Court by resolution of February 22,&nbsp; 1956. <br><br>It was alleged&nbsp; by petitioner&nbsp; that Cornelio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; was suspended by Juan Andreu&nbsp; from September&nbsp; 16 to September 30, 1953, for&nbsp; laziness, which, according to the trial court, was not proved.&nbsp; The proof of the Company to this effect consisted&nbsp; merely of the testimony of&nbsp; Juan Andreu, the Shop Superintendent&nbsp; who&nbsp; suspended him, which&nbsp; was denied by said&nbsp; employee.&nbsp; This is a question of&nbsp; fact which<br><br>Pangasinan&nbsp; Trans.&nbsp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; et al. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al. concern's the credibility of witnesses and&nbsp; We cannot disturb the finding of the lower court not only because it had the opportunity to hear them testify and observe their demeanor while so testifying,&nbsp; but also because "the findings of fact of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; with respect to questions&nbsp; of fact, if supported by substantial&nbsp; evidence on the record&nbsp; shall be conclusive.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appeal to the Supreme Court shall be limited to questions of law"&nbsp; (Section 6, Rep. Act&nbsp; No. 875).&nbsp; This&nbsp; Court is not empowered&nbsp; to look into the&nbsp; correctness of&nbsp; the findings of fact&nbsp; in an award, order or decision of the Court of Industrial Relations, *&nbsp; * *.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Carmen de&nbsp; la Paz Vda. de Ongsiako vs. Teodoro&nbsp; Galnban et al., 86 Phil., 50, 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 5612). <br><blockquote>"We cannot reverse a decision&nbsp; or order of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations&nbsp; on pure questions of fact" (Central&nbsp; Azucarera&nbsp; de Tarlac as. Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations, G. R. No. 16843;&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Electric Company&nbsp; vs. National Labor&nbsp; Union,&nbsp; G. R. No. 47279, and many others). <br><br>"It "would be idle for "us to&nbsp; review the findings of the&nbsp; Industrial Court.&nbsp; This we&nbsp; are not&nbsp; supposed to do both under the Rules&nbsp; of Court and the law&nbsp; creating that&nbsp; body" (Destileria Ayala&nbsp; y Cia., Inc. vs. Lipa Naeional Obrera de Filipinas and Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations, G. R. No. 48346). </blockquote>There&nbsp; is one aspect of&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; defense&nbsp; that&nbsp; merits consideration.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; worker (Cornelio Reyes)&nbsp; that he was reinstated on October 1 and worked up to October&nbsp; 23, 1953, joining the strike&nbsp; staged by the members of the respondent Union on&nbsp; October 24, 1953.&nbsp; Before&nbsp; the strike was&nbsp; settled,&nbsp; or sometime&nbsp; in October, 1953, the Company learned that Reyes was convicted of the crime of theft and thus considered him automatically dismissed as of that date, on the ground that the provisions of Section 47,, Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission in relation to&nbsp; Section 21 of the Public Service Act, precluded&nbsp; them&nbsp; from&nbsp; employing him&nbsp; any&nbsp; further. . This was disputed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; employee who testified that Mr. Andreu knew his previous conviction for it&nbsp; was even he, Mr. Andreu,&nbsp; himself who&nbsp; recommended&nbsp; him to the&nbsp; job.&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 146, known as the Public Service Act, provides the following: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 21.&nbsp; Every&nbsp; public service&nbsp; violating1 or failing&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply with the terms and conditions of any certificate or any&nbsp; orders, decisions or regulations of the Commission shall be&nbsp; subject to a fine of&nbsp; not exceeding two hundred pesos per day for every day during which such&nbsp; default&nbsp; or violation continues; and the Commission is hereby authorized and&nbsp; empowered to impose&nbsp; such fine, after&nbsp; due notice and hearing. <br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*."</center></blockquote>And in amplification of the above-quoted provision, certain rules and&nbsp; regulations were&nbsp; promulgated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Service&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; Section 47 of which&nbsp; prescribes the following:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 47. COURTESY, CHARACTER, RECORD, ETC.—Each operator shall employ in his&nbsp; service only such chauffeurs,&nbsp; conductors, agents, inspectors,&nbsp; auditors and <i>other employee</i>, who&nbsp; are courteous and&nbsp; of good&nbsp; moral character; and <i>in&nbsp; no&nbsp; case shall he employ any&nbsp; person who has&nbsp; been&nbsp; convicted by a&nbsp; competent&nbsp; court</i> of homicide and/or serious physical injuries&nbsp; through reckless imprudence, ordinary serious physical injuries, theft, estafa, robbery and crimes against chastity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Operators&nbsp; are prohibited from employing as&nbsp; chauffeurs persons who&nbsp; do not&nbsp; have&nbsp; professional drivers' license"&nbsp; (Rules and Regulations of the Public&nbsp; Service Commission), </blockquote>The record bears out the fact that Coraelio&nbsp; Reyes was convicted of the&nbsp; crime of theft by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangasinan&nbsp; but&nbsp; this was&nbsp; not considered&nbsp; as a justifiable&nbsp; ground for&nbsp; his dismissal&nbsp; by the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations because "he was accepted by the former&nbsp; (company) after the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; (Reyes) was convicted of such crime".&nbsp; We fail to see the logic of this&nbsp; reasoning. It&nbsp; seems that the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; considered&nbsp; the&nbsp; company estopped&nbsp; from alleging now that said&nbsp; conviction&nbsp; could be made the basis of his separation&nbsp; which is evidently erroneous&nbsp; under the terms of the law and&nbsp; regulations aforequoted. <br><br>Section 47 of the Rules and Regulations of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Publie Service Commission&nbsp; is couched&nbsp; in unmistakable mandatory terms; it forbids the employment of persons convicted of&nbsp; offenses&nbsp; enumerated therein, one of&nbsp; them&nbsp; being&nbsp; the crime of theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; believe that this&nbsp; restriction&nbsp; equally applies&nbsp; to&nbsp; those who are&nbsp; already&nbsp; employed&nbsp; as well as those merely seeking&nbsp; admission to the service.&nbsp;&nbsp; The allowance&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; of the operation of the&nbsp; principle of estoppel&nbsp; on the&nbsp; management would set a dangerous&nbsp; precedent which&nbsp; could give&nbsp; a leeway for&nbsp; the circumvention of said regulation or result in the unnecessary punishment of an employer&nbsp; who may have taken under his employ a person convicted of&nbsp; any of the&nbsp; crime embraced in the regulations and&nbsp; would thus suffer the penalty imposed by Section 21&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Public Service&nbsp; Act despite his desire to comply therewith upon discovery of the disqualification. <br><br>Finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; a public&nbsp; service&nbsp; operator has&nbsp; a&nbsp; right to refuse employment or terminate&nbsp; the services of&nbsp; an&nbsp; employee so as to comply with the aforementioned regulation. We will now proceed&nbsp; to determine whether those working in the company's shop&nbsp; (as Cornelio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; was at the time of his dismissal)&nbsp; are included&nbsp; among those enume- rated therein. <br><br>Section 47 of&nbsp; said regulations speaks of chauffeurs,&nbsp; conductors,&nbsp; agents,&nbsp; inspectors, auditors and&nbsp; other employees. The&nbsp; term "<i>other employees</i>" is explicit, and&nbsp; embraces all persons in&nbsp; the company's employ&nbsp; including those working in the shop even if their kind of work is not specifically indicated among the&nbsp; classes mentioned therein, for they certainly fall within the classification of "other employees". The&nbsp; reason behind this requirement of courtesy and good moral character cannot be assailed and is understandable. A public service&nbsp; operator deals directly with the patronizing community&nbsp; and the&nbsp; nature&nbsp; of such undertaking&nbsp; necessarily demands of the company the maintenance of a personnel with unquestionable record of good moral character, for the public entrust their lives,&nbsp; properties and interests in said&nbsp; services and&nbsp; deserve utmost courtesy, efficiency and&nbsp; safety in return.&nbsp; As there&nbsp; is no question&nbsp; that the promulgation of these regulations was in consonance with the grant of&nbsp; authority to issue rules provided for by&nbsp; Section 16 (d) of the Public Service Law, and as the refusal of the Company to re-employ Cornelio Reyes is apparently based&nbsp; on this&nbsp; prohibition (independently of whether his dismissal might also be due to his union activities), said termination&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; an unfair labor practice. <br><br>Anent the case of Patricio Tuliao, it was not&nbsp; disputed that he was&nbsp; suspended for 30 days for having driven the company's bus No.&nbsp; 221 to&nbsp; a shed inside the&nbsp; PANTRANCO terminal at&nbsp; Alaminos, Pangasinan,&nbsp; the&nbsp; distance covered being admittedly about&nbsp; 5 or 6 meters only.&nbsp; Tuliao was not the authorized driver of said bus, he being&nbsp; its conductor at the time, and although&nbsp; this act was a violation of the regulations of the company, yet considering the circumstance&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was raining and&nbsp; that said conductor, who was then unloading cargoes from the vehicle, merely wanted&nbsp; to&nbsp; avoid the goods from&nbsp; being&nbsp; soaked and damaged, We believe that the&nbsp; Company was too drastic&nbsp; in imposing that penalty upon&nbsp; him.&nbsp; It was the Company's assertion that Tuliao was with the driver Santiago Asido, who was suspended for having utilized the Company's bus in bringing 2 lady teachers from Santa Cruz to&nbsp; Candelaria in&nbsp; the&nbsp; province of Zambales,&nbsp; places in which&nbsp; the Company had no&nbsp; authority or line, and thus dismissed said conductor after his suspension.&nbsp; The said&nbsp; driver's suspension and dismissal&nbsp; was upheld&nbsp; and considered&nbsp; justified by the Court of Industrial Relations but this fact does not imply that the conductor of the bus could likewise be adjudged guilty of the same act.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; common sense would dictate that the conductor who was not at&nbsp; the wheel cannot be made answerable for the&nbsp; wrongful act of the driver in bringing the&nbsp; vehicle outside of its authorized route, unless it could be proved that he&nbsp; instigated or forced the driver&nbsp; to&nbsp; commit that violation.&nbsp; But such&nbsp; faet&nbsp; did not come out during the hearing in the court below, nor was it even&nbsp; alleged therein.&nbsp; We, therefore, feel&nbsp; safe&nbsp; to say that there being no serious&nbsp; cause&nbsp; or&nbsp; irregularity committed by respondent Patricio Tuliao, the trial Court did not err in pronouncing that said employee&nbsp; does&nbsp; not deserve the penalty of&nbsp; suspension&nbsp; and&nbsp; later dismissal resorted to by petitioner.&nbsp; Although no proof was adduced to establish&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; steps&nbsp; were taken&nbsp; due to&nbsp; respondent's union affiliation, certainly they are whimsical and unjustified. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is reversed in so far as&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; it orders the petitioner Pangasinan&nbsp; Transportation Company&nbsp; to reinstate&nbsp; Cornelio Reyes to his position of blacksmith and to pay him for any loss he may have&nbsp; suffered&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of any&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; discrimination made against him as well as a sum&nbsp; equal&nbsp; to the amount which he normally would have earned as wages from the date of said petitioner's discrimination to the actual date which (by said decision)&nbsp; he was to be readmitted (or up to the date when Cornelio Reyes&nbsp; was&nbsp; actually admitted to work in virtue of the order of execution&nbsp; of the judg- ment of the&nbsp; lower court, as per&nbsp; its order of&nbsp; December 8, 1955, if it was ever&nbsp; carried out—p. 181 of&nbsp; the record); and&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; it&nbsp; declares&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Cornelio&nbsp; Reyes Is entitled to the benefit of vacation and sick&nbsp; leave with pay from the date of&nbsp; his readmission computed on a basis of continuous service which involves&nbsp; the period between the date of his suspension up to the date of his&nbsp; readmission. The decision appealed from is affirmed in all other respects, without costs.&nbsp; It is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Conception, Reyes,&nbsp; J.
