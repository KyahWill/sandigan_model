				<H3>LBONCIO DAYATA, ALIAS SEE  SING TOW, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. HONORABLE VICENTE DE LA CRUZ, AS COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, RESPONDENT  AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, enjoining the Commissioner of Immigration from causing the arrest of Leoncio Dayata alias See Sing Tow, a  resident of China, without benefit of bail  or bond until his petition for  admission as a  Filipino citizen could be resolved by  the Board  of Special  Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration.</p>
<p>From the pleadings, stipulation of facts and papers referred to therein, it appears that the said  Leoncio Dayata had applied for documentation as a Filipino citizen with the Philippine consulate in Amoy and later in Hongkong when the  consulate in  Amoy was closed.   Favorably  recommended  by  the Philippine consulate  in  Hongkong,  the matter was referred by the Department of  Foreign Affairs to the Bureau of Immigration for comment and recommendation.  The bureau returned  the papers on October 27, 1950, stating that it could not make a favorable recommendation in view of inconsistencies between the testimony of the said Dayata and that of hia alleged  mother, but suggesting further investigation.</p>
<p>On December 17, 1953, Dayata carrfe  to  Manila on the <em>"S/S President Wilson</em>" as a transit passenger and, allowed to land on shore pass solely for the purpose of undergoing a blood test to be conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation to determine his relationship with the alleged mother, he  petitioned the Commissioner of Immigration that he be  landed and temporarily released on  bond to enable him  to  file an  application  for  admission into this country.   This petition was  denied.  But on the strength of a report subsequently submitted by the National Bureau of Investigation that  "Leoncio  Dayata  is a possible son of the couple Coo Lu and Filomena Dayata," the denial was reconsidered and  on  December 18,  1953  Dayata was allowed to land under bond to guarantee  his temporary stay in this country "during the pendency of his petition for documentation as a Filipino citizen."</p>
<p>In connection with the said petition for documentation, Attorney  Constacio  Trias of the Bureau of Immigration was named  investigator, and in the investigation held by him, Dayata was allowed to present his evidence in support of his application.  But before  Trias could render his report, Dayata, on  December 28, 1953, filed the present action in  the Court of First Instance  of Manila, alleging that the Commissioner of Immigration had threatened to cause his  arrest on pain  of detention without  benefit of bail or bond if he did not proceed to Hongkong on December 29, 1953,  with  his  petition  for admission  as a  Filipino citizen still unresolved, and praying that  the Commissioner be enjoined from  doing so.  Upon the action being  filed, the  court, without  hearing the Commissioner, on  that same day granted a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>On March 15, 1954,  Trias,  the investigator,  submitted his  ''finding and recommendation" stating  that he  felt safe to  conclude that Leoncio Dayata was  in  truth the illegitimate  issue of Filomena Dayata, a Filipina,  by her common law husband Coo  Lu, a Chinese, and was, therefore, a  Filipino  citizen  at  birth,  and  recommending approval of Dayata's application for  documentation as  a Filipino  citizen.   On March  22, 1954, the Acting First Deputy  Commissioner forwarded the record of the  investigation of Dayata's application  for documentation as Filipino citizen to the Department of Foreign Affairs, and that department in turn referred the record to the Department of  Justice  on March  30.  After  going  over the papers,  the Department of  Justice on May 14, through the  Undersecretary  of Justice, gave its opinion,  disapproving of the finding and recommendation  of  Trias and declaring in effect that Dayata  "is  an  impostor."  The opinion  says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This Department, in Opinion No. 131, s. 1952, and Commissioner of Immigration Diaz in his indorsement  of  October  27, 1950, ruled that because of glaring Inconsistencies in the evidence, See Sing Tow, the applicant, cannot  be held to be the same person as  Leoncio Dayata,  alleged illegitimate child of Filomena  Dayata.</p>
  <p>"The  attempt  to  explain  the  inconsistencies strengthens  the conviction that the applicant; is an impostor.</p>
  <p>"One of the inconsistencies pointed out is that while the applicant testified  that his mother, Filomena Dayata,  has gone to China, she and his father, Coo Lu, having accompanied him to China  in 1932, Filomena Dayata, on the other hand, said that she did  not go with his son on that occasion or any other occasion, for the truth is that she has  never left  the  Philippines.  The  applicant's alleged father explains  this  contradiction by  saying that his son's  belief must have been due to the fact that a woman, their neighbor, was with them when they left  Cagayan for Cebu on their  way to China. This explanation is absurd because it is tantamount to  saying that an  eight-year old boy (Leoncio was that old) cannot recognize his mother,  with  whom he had been living  since birth.</p>
  <p>"The explanation of the second inconsistency is an incredible as that of  the first.  The applicant deposed that  after accompanying him to China in 1932, his father never returned to the Philippines, having died in China  in 1941, while the mqther declared  that Coo Lu came back to the  Philippines and is in fact presently residing in Cebu  City.  The supposed  father  explains  this by saying that his son must  have thought that he died in China in 1941 because of the war in that year.  The  applicant  himself gives the  lie to this  explanation  when he  said, in attempting to reconcile the conflicting statements, that he was misunderstood.  By  this,  he  necessarily meant to  say that  he did not make4 the statement that his father did not return  to the Philippines and that he died  in  China in 1941,  and  that it  was due  to  misunderstanding that he was erroneously thought to have made such statement.  The contradiction was  caused  then, according  to  the  applicant, not  because  he erroneously thought  that  his father  died in  China but because he was mistakenly understood to have  made  such  statement. As to the applicant's claim that he was misunderstood,  it is  not seen how one  could possibly misunderstand  the  simple  assertion that his father returned to  the Philippines and  that he did not die in China  in 1941  if  these are what he  really  said.</p>
  <p>"The  third  inconsistency is that while the  applicant declared that he is the only child born  to  Filomena  Dayata and Coo Lu, the  applicant's supposed  mother, Filomena  stated  that  she has an  elder  child  named Conchita.  The  explanations  given by the applicant  and  his alleged mother  mutually  destroy one  another. The  mother declared that  the applicant must have  forgotten that he had  a sister.  The applicant, on the other  hand, said that he thought it was not necessary to  state  that  he had a  sister, she being already  deadâ€”impliedly admitting that he  knew he had  a sister,  contrary to his mother's  allegation that he  had  forgotten he had a  sister.</p>
  <p>"The  inconsistencies remain unexplained,  and as they are of such a character that they could not  occur  in the  testimonies of persons who are what  they really  claim  to be, this Department reiterates its previous ruling and that of Commissioner  Diaz denying See's  application for documentation  as a  Filipino citizen.</p>
  <p>"This  Department  does not  consider  itself  bound  under the law  by the  finding  of the  Board  of  Special Inquiry  that the applicant  is a  Filipino citizen.  Section  27  of  the Immigration Act, as amended, it is believed, gives finality to the decisions of boards of special inquiry only  in so  far as  they  relate to the  right of an  alien  to enter  the  Philippines but not in so far  as they declare  him  to be a  Filipino citizen.  Besides, as  already  noted, Commissioner of Iftimigration Diaz had previously ruled  that the applicant  is not  a  citizen  of the  Philippines.  It is doubtful, moreover, whether the provision  was meant  to  preclude  an inquiry into the identity  of an  alien  allowed to  land  as  citizen where, as in  the present case, there are  grounds  to believe  that he is  an  impostor and consequently subject to deportation.  Section 37 of  the  same  act authorized the  deportation  of  an alien who has succeeded in entering the Philippines thru false  and misleading statements within  five years after  the  cause  for  the deportation arises."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the facts above set forth, the lower court found that the  "finding  and  recommendation"&nbsp;  of  Trias  were sustained by the evidence, that the said "finding  and recommendation" were the decision of the Special Board of Inquiry, and that as the  decision had not been appealed to or reviewed and reversed by the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration within one year from March 15, 1954, the decision  had become final in accordance with section 27(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the Philippine  Immigration Act  of 1940, so that Dayata was entitled to be documented as a Filipino citizen.   The court therefore made  permanent the preliminary injunction already issued.  From this decision the Commissioner  of Immigration  appealed to the Court of Appeals,  but that court has  certified the case  here as involving only questions of law.</p>
<p>It is contended in the first place that it was error for the lower court to consider the finding and recommendation of Trias as the decision of the  Board of Special  Inquiry. The point is, in our opinion, well taken.  As pointed out by the Solicitor General, the law specifically provides that "every board of special inquiry shall be  composed of a chairman and two members who shall be appointed by the President of the Philippines."    (Section 27(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>),  Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended.)  This means that one man  alone  cannot take the  place  of the  whole board nor could his "decision" be taken or have the effect of a decision  of  a board of special inquiry legally constituted. This point is important because the object of the law in having  the  investigation conducted  by a  board of three members  is  to  minimize the danger  from corruption to which cases of this kind frequently give rise.  Needless to say, adherence  to  the  requirement  that  there be  three members in the board is  essential to the  accomplishment of the purpose of the law.   And surely that purpose would be defeated or circumvented  if a lone investigator were to take the place of a board of three members.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  a board of  special  inquiry is  created to inquire  into cases  for  admission into  the  Philippines (section 26 and 27, Philippine Immigration Act of 1940) and not to pass upon applications  for documentation aa a Filipino citizen.   As pointed out by the Solicitor General, inquiry into an application for documentation is a different and distinct  process.   He says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A case for documentation, it  should be  an explained, involves an original application for registration  as a Philippine  citizen in a Philippine Consulate abroad.  In pursuance with  the administrative procedure adapted  to coordinate investigations concerning claims to Philippine citizenship, such application is endorsed to the Bureau of Immigration for investigation of  such persons in  the Philippines, who  may be able to establish the alleged  Philippine citizenship of the applicant  abroad.  The records of  such  investigation are then  referred  to the Department  of Justice  for opinion.  Once said opinion is rendered, the papers of the case  are then returned to the  Department of Foreign Affairs, which in the  last analysis, has the final authority  to decide whether to approve  or deny  the application for documentation.  In making its decision, the Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  may  or  may  not follow  the  opinion rendered  by the Department  of Justice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is pointed out, however, that following the  submission of  the report of the  National  Bureau of  Investigation, Dayata  filed  his petition  for  admission  as   a Filipino citizen, and this seems to be borne  out by  what appears on  pages  20  to  25 of the record on appeal. But it does not appear  that a board of special  inquiry was  formed to  inquire into  a  petition  of that  kind.   On  the other hand,  Trias's report itself  says  that he treated Dayata's motion for investigtaion as one  for  a "reconsideration of the previous decision denying the original  application of the subject for  documentation/'  And even  assuming that Trias  also inquired  into the  question  of  the appellee's right to admission  to the Philippines,  he could not by himself alone  render a  binding decision  for  the Board of Special Inquiry  because under  section  27(6) of  the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended by  Republic Act No. 543, for  a decision of  the board to be valid and binding  the concurrence of any two of its members  is necessary.  The action taken by the Acting First Deputy  Commissioner of Immigration,  Francisco de la Rosa, in  forwarding the record of the investigation made by  Trias to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs  for transmittal "to the  Philippine consulate  in  Hongkong for whatever   action  it  may deem  proper to  take in  the premises" cannot be legally taken as concurrence on De la Rosa's part in  Trias' findings and recommendations, first, because the letter of transmittal does  not so state, and second,  because De la Rosa does not appear to have been designated a member  of a board of special  inquiry to look  into  the  matter of  Dayata's admission  into  this country.  It  does not even appear that any such board was  appointed, and the statement in De la Rosa's indorsement (on page  60  of  the record on  appeal) that  the investigation was "conducted by the Board of Special Inquiry,"  is  without factual  basis.</p>
<p>It must not  also  be overlooked that section 27(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the Immigration Act  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The decision of any two members of the  board shall prevail and  shall be final unless reversed on appeal by the Board of Commissioners as hereafter stated, or, in the absence of an appeal, unless reversed by the Board of Commissioner after a review by it, <span style="font-style: italic;">motu propio </span>of the entire proceedings within one year  from the promulgation of said  decision."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in that connection, we have to agree with the Solicitor General that the lower court was in error in saying that the "decision"  of Trias as the decision  of the Board of Special  Inquiry became final because it was not appealed to, reviewed <span style="font-style: italic;"> motu propio </span> or  reversed  by  the  Board of Commissioners  within one year from its promulgation on March 15,  1954.  The court's  statement is without basis because its own decision,  which contains the  statement, is dated August 27, 1954, and at that time barely 5 months had elapsed  from  the time  Trias rendered his  so-called decision, which  Was on March 15 of that same  year.</p>
<p>In view  of the  foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and the  writ of injunction issued by the  court below ordered dissolved, with costs against the appellee.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.  J.,  Bengzon,  Padilla,  Motemayor,  Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endenda, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
