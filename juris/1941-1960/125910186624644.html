				<H3>MANILA  ELECTRIC COMPANY, PETITIONER VS. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  AND PEDRO J. VELASCO,  RESPONDENTS. DR. PEDRO J.  VELASCO, PETITIONER,  VS.  MANILA ELECTRIC COMPANY, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These  two  appeals  relate to one complaint filed with the Public Service Commission by Pedro J. Velasco against Manila Electric Co.  for violation of the latter's franchise and the Public Service  Act.  After hearing the complaint, the Commission found the Manila Electric guilty, and sentenced it to pay a fine of P200.00.  Velasco appealed (G. R. No. L-14035)  alleging  that the fine was  ridiculously negligible.   Manila Electric also appealed (G. R. No. L-13992). contending there had  been  no  violation,  and  that  such violation, if any,  had prescribed.</p>
<p>These two appeals should have been decided together; but  having  taken up the former without  knowledge of the  latter,  we decided it on  May 31, 1960.   Its record (G.  R.  No. L-14035)  made  no  mention of the  Manila Electric's appeal.   In fact, the defendant  corporation filed no brief as appellee  therein.   So,  the decision of Velasco's appeal contained  these  statements:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The respondent did not  appeal.  It  filed no brief nor memorandum.  We are thus spared  the necessity of going over its defenses, and of discussing the possible issue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the complainants's  right to appeal for a higher  punishment upon the offender,  where the latter chose not to challenge the disciplinary  order."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,  our  attention  was  timely called to  Manila Electric's pending appeal  (L-13992) and we immediately suspended, by  our resolution of June 22, 1960, the effects of the aforesaid  decision  of May  1960.  Such decision, it will  be  recalled,  substantially  said:  "no question  about Manila  Electric's  violation, <em>since it did not  appeal,</em> and the only issue is  the adequacy of the  penalty;"  and then it held:  in view  of  the circumstances,  the penalty should be increased to Pl,000.00.</p>
<p>Now,  as  stated, Manila Electric appealed.  Hence  we must now  decide the question whether there  was  such violation, plus the incidental  defense  of  prescription.</p>
<p>The charge against Manila Electric is that it constructed an  electrical sub-station  at the corner  of  South  6  and South D Streets of Quezon  City, without having previously obtained the approval of the Public Service Commission.</p>
<p>Admitting the fact of  construction  without permit,  the Manila  Electric claims here it was  unnecessary for her to ask for such  permission,  because Republic  Act  No.  150, effective June  14,  1947,  giving  it  authority to construct electric  substations, did  not mention any  requisite permit from  the  Public Service  Commission.   (The  section  of the law is quoted in the margin.)    This point was raised before  the  Commission, which  Body  adequately  resolved it in  these words and phrases:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We find nothing in Republic  Act No. 150 which may be  construed as repealing Section 20 (b) of the Public  Service  Act which requires an electric plant operator to obtain the authority of this Commission before making new installations  or  additions to its service.  The provision of Republic Act No. 150 cited by respondent is not incompatible with Section 20 (b) of Commonwealth Act No. 146 which provides that respondent should secure the authority of this Commission to install additions  to its system,  such  as electric generating equipment  and sub-stations.  The  respondent  should make the  additions required  in Republic Act No. 150 in  accordance with Section 20 (b) of the Public  Service Law.  Republic Act No. 150 cannot  be interpreted as granting authority to respondent to install indiscriminately any additions to its  system.  Such additions may be unnecessary to the rendition of an adequate and satisfactory service  and  may have the  effect of increasing or  preventing the reduction of respondent's rates of  charges  for its  service.  The  approval of this Commission of additions to the systems  of electric  plant operators is essential  to the determination and authorization of just and reasonable rates.  In the exercise of its regulatory authority, it is  the function of this Commission to inquire into the necessity of  any addition to respondent's system  and disapprove  it if the necessity  for such addition is not established in  order not to burden the customers of respondent with unreasonably excessive rates.  *  *  *  Furthermore,  construction of the substation in  question was started in  September 1953 and  was finished in  the  following November. It was therefore constructed after the expiration of the period of five years provided  for in Republic Act  No.  150, which was  approved on June 14,  1947.  Therefore, assuming  for the sake of argument, that applicant had the authority under Republic Act No. 150 to make any addition to its  system within five (5) years from the approval of said Act on June 14, 1947, the authority expired on June 14, 1952, the end of the five year period provided for therein.  *  *  *".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant next contends that the sub-station in question was nothing but an assemblage of transformers and, therefore, no permission was  needed to build  it.   Again, this argument  was  presented  to the  Commission, which dismissed the  contention. After explaining what is regarded as a  sub-station, the  Commission .said,  "it appears that  a substation is characterized by its size or complexity.   The size of the  substation which is the subject matter of this complaint is  10,000/12,500 KVA.  It incorporates one or more buses, several circuit breakers and is  the sole receiving point of electric energy in bulk from two supply circuits or  feeders.   Compared to a simple pole-mounted transformer, the suhstation at the corner  of  South 6 and South D  Streets is of such  size or  complexity  that  ic should  be  classified as a  substation.  Taking into consideration the size or complexity of a substation, the investment involved in its construction may affect  the rates to be charged  by respondent.  The safety or  efficiency of an equipment of  the  size  or  complexity of  a substation should be looked into prior to its construction.   A  sub-station therefore should be considered as a unit or a facility or an  addition to respondent's service  within the meaning of Commonwealth Act No. 146, as  amended."</p>
<p>On this partly factual  and  partly technical issue, we fail to  discover  in  the record sufficient data  to overrule the Commission.  Indeed,  we  note that Manila Electric itself admitted the  structure to be a sub-station when it included it  in its petition  of  March  28, 1955 (Case No. 86354)  seeking approval  of <em>new sub-stations</em> in  Manila and Quezon City.</p>
<p>On the question of prescription, it is enough to indicate that,  at the time of the hearing,  the sub-station  was  still standing at  the  street corner specified by  complainant.</p>
<p>If, as explained, its construction was  an  offense,  it constituted a  continuous  offense  against which  the defense of prescription  did  not begin  to run.   (22 Corpus  Juris Secundum,  Criminal Law, sec.  277.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision, in so far as it declares the Manila  Electric guilty, is affirmed.   But it is modified as to the penalty imposed  (G. R. No. L-14035) :  the fine is  raised to Pl,000.00.  The suspension by resolution of June  22, 1960 is hereby lifted.</p>
