				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of Industrial Relations, three separate petitions were 
registered: Case No. 491-MC, by Yard Crew Union, Case No. 494-MC, by Station 
Employees' Union; and Case No. 507-MC, by Railroad Engineering Department Union. 
The Kapisanan Ng Mga Manggagawa Sa Manila Railroad Company, intervened. They 
were treated jointly by the respondent Court because they involved identical 
questions. On appeal, three separate petitions for certiorari were presented by 
the Kapisanan Ng Mga Mangagawa Sa Manila Railroad Company (G.R. Nos. L-16292-94) 
and three separate petitions for certiorari by the Manila Railroad Company (G.R. 
Nos. L-16309, L-16317 and L-16318.)
<p>We glean from the record the following facts: </p>
<p>On March 7, 1955, the Kapisanan Ng Mga Manggagawa Sa Manila Railroad Company, 
hereinafter called Kapisanan, filed a petition (Case No. 237-MC), praying that 
it be certified as the exclusive bargaining agent in the Manila Railroad 
Company, hereinafter called Company. A decision was promulgated on September 29, 
1956, affirmed by the Court <em>en banc</em> on January 16, 1957, in which the 
respondent Court found three unions appropriate for purposes of collective 
bargaining, to wit: (1) The unit of locomotive drivers, firemen, assistant 
firemen and motormenâ€”otherwise known as the <em>engine crew unit</em>: (2) the 
unit of conductors, assistant conductors, unit agents, assistant route agents 
and train posters, otherwise known as the train <em>crew unit</em>, and (3) the 
unit <em>of all the rest of the company personnel, except</em> the supervisors, 
temporary employees, the members of the Auditing Department, the members of the 
security guard and professional and technical employees, referred to by the 
respondent court as the <em>unit of the rest of the employees</em>. To these 3 
units, the following unions were respectively certified as the exclusive 
bargaining agents: (1) The Union de Maquinistas, Fogoneros, Ayudantes y 
Motormen; (2) Union de Empleados de Trenes (conductors); and (3) the Kapisanan 
Ng Mga Manggagawa Sa Manila Railroad Company.</p>
<p>After the decision had become final, Case No. 491-MC was filed on September 
20, 1957, amended on August 13, 1958, by the Manila Railroad Yard Crew Union, 
praying that it be defined as a separate unit; Case No. 494-MC, on September 25, 
1957, amended on August 13, 1958, by the Station Employees' Union, praying that 
it be constituted as a separate bargaining unit, and Case No. 507-MC, on 
November 30, 1957, by the Railroad Engineering Department Union, praying that it 
be defined as a separate bargaining unit. All asked that they be certified in 
the units sought to be separated. The respondent unions are legitimate labor 
organizations with certificates of registration in the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>The Kapisanan and the Company opposed the separation of the said three units 
on the following grounds:</p>
<p>(1) That the Kapisanan had been duly certified as the collective bargaining 
agent in the <em>unit of all of the rest of the employees</em> and it had 
entered into a collective bargaining agreement on November 4, 1957, and this 
agreement bars certification of a unit at least during the first 12 months after 
the finality of Case No. 237-MC (contract bar rule).</p>
<p>(2) That the Court had denied similar petitions for separation of unit as was 
ordered in Case No. 488-MC, wherein the petition for the separation of 
Mechanical Department Labor Union was dismissed by the respondent Court on April 
25, 1958 and in the case of the Benguet Auto Lines Union, Case No. 4-MC-PANG) 
dismissed on July 18, 1958.</p>
<p>(3) That the three unions in question are barred from petitioning for 
separate units because they are bound by the decision in Case No. 237-MC, for 
having been represented therein by the Kapisanan.</p>
<p>After due hearing, the respondent Court, through the Hon. Arsenio Martinez, 
Associate Judge, handed down an order, dated June 8, 1959, the dispositive 
portion of which recites as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, all the foregoing considered, and without passing upon the basic 
questions raised herein and as part of its fact finding investigations, the 
Court orders a plebiscite to be conducted among the employees in the three 
proposed groups, namely; the Engineering Department, the Station Employees and 
the Yard Crew Personnel. The employee in the proposed groups minus the 
supervisors, temporary employees, members of the Auditing Department, members of 
the security group, professionals and technical employees, shall vote, in a 
secret ballot to be conducted by this Court, on the question of whether or not 
they desire to be separated from the <em>unit of the rest of the employees</em> 
being represented by the Kapisanan. In this connection, the Court requests the 
cooperation of the Manila Railroad Company to extend its facilities for the 
holding of this plebiscite, particularly the payrolls for the month to be agreed 
upon by the parties. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>The respondent Court also declared that the collective bargaining agreement 
could not be a bar to another certification election because one of its 
signatories, the Kapisanan President, Vicente K. Olazo, was a 
<em>supervisor</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In considering however such eixsting contract between the Kapisanan and the 
Company, the Court cannot close its eyes and fail to observe that among the 
signatories thereto, on the part of the Kapisanan, is the President of the 
Union, Vicente K. Olazo. </p>
<p>"In Case No. 237-MC, one of the important and fundamental questions raised 
was whether or not Vicente K. Olazo is a supervisor within the meaning of 
Section 2(k) of Republic Act 875. The Trial Court, as well as the majority of 
the Court <em>en banc</em>, reached the conclusion in same Case No. 237-MC that 
he is a supervisor.</p>
<p>* * *. For this reason, the Court believes that his existing coil-tract, 
though embodying terms and conditions of employment and with a reasonable period 
to run, would not be a bar to a certification proceeding."</p></blockquote>
<p>A motion for reconsideration of the order of June 8, 1959, was presented by 
the Kapisanan, and same was denied on August 20, 1959, in an order, concurred in 
by three Judges of the Court, with two Judges dissenting, against, which the 
Kapisanan on November 28, 1959, filed its notice of appeal. Appeals by 
certiorari were filed by the Kapisanan and the Company. In this Court, 
respondents presented motion to dismiss the petitions, on the ground that the 
order of the respondent court on June 8, 1959 and the resolution of the 
respondent court <em>en banc</em> dated August 20, 1959, to hold a plebiscite, 
were interlocutory, not subject to appeal. They also allege the same in their 
answers, as one of the defenses. The case, therefore, poses three questions, to 
wit:</p>
<p>1. Are the appealed orders interlocutory in nature?</p>
<p>2. Is the order of the respondent court, granting groups of employees to 
choose whether or not they desire to be separated from the certified unit to 
which they belong, during the existence of a valid bargaining contract entered 
into by a union close to the heels of its certification, contrary to law?</p>
<p>3. Is it legal error for the respondent court to hold that the bargaining 
agreement in question does not bar certification proceedings, only because one 
of the signatories for the union was adjudged by the majority of such court to 
be a supervisor, in a previous case?</p>
<p>The pertinent portion of the order of the respondent Court, dated June 8, 
1959, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, all the foregoing considered, and without passing upon the basic 
question raised herein and as part of its fact finding investigation, the Court 
orders a plebiscite to be conducted among the employees in the three proposed 
groups, namely: the Engineering Department; the Station Employees, and the Yard 
Crew Personnel."</p></blockquote>
<p>The resolution <em>en banc</em>, dated August 20, 1959, partially states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be further noted that it is just a part of the investigatory power 
of the Court to determine by secret ballot the desire of the employees 
concerned. What has been ordered is merely a plebiscite and not the 
certification election itself. * * *. Proceedings may still continue and an 
order whether denying the petition or not would necessarily ensue. In a word, 
something else has to be done within the premises and the order does not deny or 
grant the petition in the above entitled case."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Democratic Labor Association <em>vs</em>. Cebu Stevedoring 
Co., G. R. No. L-10321, February 28, 1958, we stated that because of the modern 
complexity of the relation between both employer and union structure, it becomes 
difficult to determine from the evidence alone which of the several claimant 
groups forms a proper bargaining unit; that it becomes necessary to give 
consideration to the express will or desire of the employees-a practice 
designated as the "Globe doctrine," which sanctions the holding of a series of 
elections, not for the purpose of allowing the group receiving an over all 
majority of votes to represent all employees, but for the specific purpose of 
permitting the employees in each of the several categories to select the group 
which each chooses as a bargaining unit; that the factors which may be 
considered and weighed in fixing appropriate units are: the history, extent and 
type of organization of employees; the history of their collective bargaining; 
the history, extent and type of organization of employees in other plants of the 
same employer, or other employers in the same industry; the skill, wages, work 
and working conditions of the employees; <em>the desires of the employees</em>; 
the eligibility of the employees for membership in the union or unions involved; 
and the relationship between the unit or units proposed and the employer's 
organization, management and operation, and the test in determining the 
appropriate bargaining unit is that a unit must effect a grouping of employees 
who have substantial, mutual interests in wages, hours, working conditions and 
other subjects of collective bargaining.</p>
<p>It is manifest, therefore, that "the desires of the employees" is one of the 
factors in determining the appropriate bargaining unit. The respondent Court was 
simply interested "in the verification of the evidence already placed on record 
and submitted wherein the workers have signed manifestations and resolutions of 
their desire to be separated from the Kapisanan." Certainly, no one would deny 
the respondent court's right of full investigation in arriving at a correct and 
conclusive finding of fact in order to deny or grant the petitions for 
certification election. On the contrary, all should declare it a paramount duty 
of the said respondent court, or any court for that matter, to investigate 
before acting, to do justice to the parties concerned. And one way of 
determining the will or desire of the employees is what the respondent court had 
suggested: a plebiscite-carried by secret ballot. A plebiscite and not the 
certification election itself. A plebiscite not to be conducted by the 
Department of Labor, as contemplated in a certification election under Sec. 12 
of the Magna Charter of Labor, R. A. No. 875, but by the respondent court 
itself. As well observed by the respondent court, "the votes of the workers one 
way or the other, in these cases will not by any chance choose the agent or unit 
which will represent them anew, for precisely that is a matter that is within 
the issues raised in these petitions for certification".</p>
<p>The test in determining whether an order or judgment is interlocutory or 
final is "Does it leave something to be done in the trial court with respect to 
the merits of the case? If it does, it is interlocutory; if it does not, it is 
final" (Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 Ed., Vol. I, p. 41). Having 
in view the avowed purpose of the orders in question, as heretofore exposed, one 
should not stretch his imagination far to see that they are clearly 
interlocutory, as they leave something more to be done in the trial court and do 
not decide one way or the other the petitions of the respondent unions. We are, 
therefore, constrained to hold, as we do hereby hold, that the present appeals 
or petitions for review by certiorari, are not authorized by law and should be 
dismissed (Section 2, Rule 44, Rules of Court). There is, moreover, nothing, 
under the facts obtaining in these cases and the law on the subject, which would 
warrant this Court to declare the orders under consideration, illegal.</p>
<p>The herein petitioners contend that the collective bargaining agreement, 
executed on November 4, 1957 (Case No. 237-MC), is a bar to the certification 
proceedings under consideration. The respondents counter that it is not so, 
because one of the signatories in the said agreement for the Kapisanan, Vicente 
K. Olazo, was found to be a supervisor under section 2(k) R. A. 875, in 
Kapisanan, etc, <em>vs</em>. CIR, etc., 106 Phil., 607; 57 Off. Gaz. (2) 254. 
Having, however, reached the conclusion that the orders in question are not 
appealable and that the respondent court has not as yet decided on whether the 
said collective bargaining agreement is a bar or not to the petitions 
for<br>separate units and for certification election, which could properly be 
determined after the result of the plebiscite shall have been known by the 
respondent court, the consideration of this issue is premature.</p>
<p>In view hereof, the petitions or appeals for review by certiorari are 
dismissed, without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Petitions dismissed.</em></p></div>
