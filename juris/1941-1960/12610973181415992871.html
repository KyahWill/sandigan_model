				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal, taken by&nbsp; defendant Honorato&nbsp; Asunsion from&nbsp; an order denying a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for relief&nbsp; from an order declaring him in&nbsp; default&nbsp; and a judgment by default.<br><br>On June&nbsp; 12, 1953, plaintiff, Vicenta Pantaleon, instituted this action, in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, to&nbsp; recover, from&nbsp; said&nbsp; Asuncion, the sum of&nbsp; P2,000.00, with interest thereon, in addition to attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The summons originally issued&nbsp; was returned by the sheriff of Nueva Ecija unserved, with the statement that, according to&nbsp; reliable&nbsp; information, Asuncion&nbsp; was residing&nbsp; in&nbsp; B-24 Tala Estate,&nbsp; Caloocan,&nbsp; Rizal.&nbsp; An alias&nbsp; summons&nbsp; was issued,&nbsp; therefore, for&nbsp; service in the place last mentioned.<br><br>However, the&nbsp; provincial sheriff of Rizal returned&nbsp; it unserved,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; information that&nbsp; Asuncion had left the Tala Estate since February 18, 1952, and that diligent efforts&nbsp; to locate him proved to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; plaintiff's motion, the court ordered,&nbsp; on March 9, 1955, that defendant be&nbsp; summoned by publication, and&nbsp; the summons was published on March 21 and 28, and April 4, 1955, in the "Examiner", said to be&nbsp; a newspaper of general&nbsp; circulation in Nueva Ecija.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having failed to appear&nbsp; or answer the complaint within the period stated in the summons, defendant was, by&nbsp; an order dated July&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1955, declared in default.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; or on September 8, 1955,&nbsp; after a hearing held in the absence of the defendant and&nbsp; without&nbsp; notice to him, the&nbsp; court rendered judgment for the plaintiff&nbsp; and against&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P2,300.00, with interest thereon at the legal&nbsp; rate, from October 28, 1948, and costs.<br><br>About forty-six (46) days later, or on October 24, 1955, the&nbsp; defendant filed a petition for relief from said order of July 12, 1955, and from said judgment, dated September 8, 1955, upon the&nbsp; ground of mistake and excusable negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Annexed to said petition were defendant's affidavit and&nbsp; his&nbsp; verified&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; In the affidavit,&nbsp; Asuncion stated that, on September 26, 1955, at 34 Pitimine Street, San&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; del&nbsp; Monte&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; his residence, he received notice of a registered letter at the Post Office&nbsp; in&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jose,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, his&nbsp; old&nbsp; family residence; that he proceeded&nbsp; immediately&nbsp; to the&nbsp; latter municipality to claim&nbsp; said&nbsp; letter,&nbsp; which he received&nbsp; on September 28, 1955; that the letter contained copy of said order of July 12, 1955, and of the judgment&nbsp; of September 8, 1955, much to his&nbsp; surprise,&nbsp; for he had not been summoned&nbsp; or notified&nbsp; of the hearing of this case;&nbsp; that had copy of the summons and of the order for its publication been sent to him by mail, as provided in Rule 7, section 21,&nbsp; of the Rules of Court said&nbsp; summons and order would have reached him, "as&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment herein had"; and that his&nbsp; failure to appear before the court is&nbsp; excusable it being due to the mistake&nbsp; of the&nbsp; authorities concerned in not complying with the provisions of&nbsp; said section.<br><br>Upon denial of said petition&nbsp; for relief, defendant perfected his&nbsp; present appeal, which is predicated upon the theory that the aforementioned summons by publication had not been made in conformity with the Rules of Court. More specifically, defendant maintains that copy of the summons and of the order for the publication thereof were not&nbsp; deposited "in the post office, postage prepaid, directed to the defendant&nbsp; by&nbsp; ordinary mail&nbsp; to&nbsp; his last&nbsp; known address", in violation of Rule&nbsp; 7, section 21, of the Rules of Court, and that, had this provision been complied with, said summons and order of publication would have reached him, as had the&nbsp; decision appealed from.&nbsp; Said section 21 reads:<br><blockquote>"If the service has&nbsp; been made by&nbsp; publication, service&nbsp; may be proved&nbsp; by the affidavit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the printer, his&nbsp; foreman&nbsp; or principal clerk, or of the editor, business or advertising manager, to which affidavit a copy of the&nbsp; publication shall be attached,&nbsp; and by an affidavit showing the deposit of a copy of the summons and order for publication in the post&nbsp; office, postage prepaid, directed to the defendant by ordinary mail to his last known address**&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Plaintiff alleges,&nbsp; however, that the provision applicable to the case at bar&nbsp; is not this section 21, but section&nbsp; 16, of Rule 7, of the Rules of Court, which&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"Whenever the defendant&nbsp; is designated as an unknown owner, or the like, or whenever&nbsp; the address&nbsp; of a defendant is&nbsp; unknown&nbsp; and cannot be ascertained by diligent inquiry, service may, by leave of court,&nbsp; be effect upon&nbsp; him by&nbsp; publication in&nbsp; such places&nbsp; and&nbsp; for such times as the court may order."<br></blockquote>It is, moreover, urged by the plaintiff that the requirement, in Said section 21, of an affidavit showing that copy of the summons&nbsp; and&nbsp; of the order for its publication had been sent by&nbsp; mail&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; last known&nbsp; address, refers&nbsp; to the&nbsp; extraterritorial service of summons,&nbsp; provided for in section 17 of&nbsp; said Rule 7, pursuant to which:<br><blockquote>"When&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; does not&nbsp; reside and&nbsp; is not found in&nbsp; the Philippines and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff or relates to, or the subject of which is, property within the Philippines, in which&nbsp; the defendant has or claims a lien or interest, actual or contingent, or in which the relief demanded&nbsp; consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the&nbsp; defendant from&nbsp; any interest therein, or&nbsp; the property of the defendant has been attached within the Philippines, service&nbsp; may,&nbsp; by leave&nbsp; of court, be effected out of the&nbsp; Philippines by personal service as under section 7; or by registered mail; or by publication in such&nbsp; places and&nbsp; for such time as the court may order, in which case a&nbsp; copy of the&nbsp; summons and order of the court shall be sent by ordinary mail to the&nbsp; last&nbsp; known address of&nbsp; the defendant; or&nbsp; in any other&nbsp; manner the court may deem sufficient. Any&nbsp; order granting such&nbsp; leave shall&nbsp; specify a&nbsp; reasonable time, which shall&nbsp; not be&nbsp; less than sixty (60) days after&nbsp; notice, within which the defendant must answer."<br></blockquote>Said section 21, however, is unqualified.&nbsp; It&nbsp; prescribes the "proof of service by publication", regardless of whether the&nbsp; defendant is a&nbsp; resident&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines or not. Section 16 must be read in relation to section 21,&nbsp; which complements it.&nbsp; Then, too, we conceive of no reason, and plaintiff&nbsp; has suggested none,&nbsp; why&nbsp; copy of the&nbsp; summons and of the&nbsp; order for its publication should be mailed to non-resident defendants,&nbsp; but not to resident defendants. We can not&nbsp; even say that defendant herein, who, according to the return of the Sheriff of Nueva Ecija, was reportedly residing&nbsp; in&nbsp; Rizal—where he,&nbsp; in fact (San Francisco del Monte and&nbsp; Quezon City&nbsp; used&nbsp; to&nbsp; be part&nbsp; of Rizal), was residing—could reasonably be&nbsp; expected to read&nbsp; the&nbsp; summons published in a&nbsp; newspaper said to be a general circulation in Nueva Ecija.<br><br>Considering&nbsp; that strict compliance with the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of the statute&nbsp; is necessary to confer jurisdiction through service by publication&nbsp; (Bachrach Garage&nbsp; and Taxi Co. <i>vs.</i> Hotchkiss&nbsp; and Co.,&nbsp; 34&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 506;&nbsp; Banco&nbsp; Espanol-Filipino&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Palanca, 37&nbsp; Phil., 921; Mills&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Smiley,&nbsp; 9 Idaho 317,&nbsp; 325,&nbsp; 76&nbsp; Pac.&nbsp; 785; Charles&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Marrow, 99 Mo.&nbsp; 638; Sunderland,&nbsp; Cases&nbsp; on&nbsp; Procedure, Annotated, Trial&nbsp; Practice,'p. 51), the conclusion is inescapable that the lower court had no authority&nbsp; whatsoever&nbsp; to&nbsp; Issue the order of&nbsp; July 12,&nbsp; 1955, declaring the defendant&nbsp; in default and&nbsp; to render the decision of September 8,&nbsp; 1955, and that&nbsp; both are null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio.</span><br><br>Apart&nbsp; from the foregoing, it is a well-settled&nbsp; principle of Constitutional Law that,&nbsp; in an action strictly <span style="font-style: italic;">in personam</span>, like&nbsp; the one at bar, personal service of summons, <span style="font-style: italic;">within </span>the forum, is essential to the acquisition of jurisdiction&nbsp; over the&nbsp; person of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; who&nbsp; does not voluntarily submit himself to the authority of the&nbsp; court. In other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; summons&nbsp; by publication cannot—consistently with the due process clause in the Bill of Rights— confer upon&nbsp; the court jurisdiction over said defendant.<br><blockquote>"Due process of law requires personal service to support a <span style="font-style: italic;">personal </span>judgment, and, when the proceeding is <span style="font-style: italic;">strictly in personam</span> brought to determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; personal rights and&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; of the parties, personal&nbsp; service within&nbsp; the state&nbsp; or&nbsp; a voluntary appearance in the case&nbsp; is <span style="font-style: italic;">essential to the acquisition of jurisdiction so as to constitute compliance with the constitutional requirement&nbsp; of due process</span>. *&nbsp; * *<br><br>"Although a state legislature has more control over the form of service on its&nbsp; own residents than nonresidents, it&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; held that&nbsp; i<span style="font-style: italic;">n actions in personam * * * service by publication on resident defendants,</span> who are personally within the state and can be found therein <span style="font-style: italic;">is&nbsp; not 'due process of law'</span>,&nbsp; and a s<span style="font-style: italic;">tatute allowing it is unconstitutional"&nbsp;</span> (16A CJ.S., pp. 786, 789; Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Lastly, from&nbsp; the&nbsp; viewpoint of&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; justice&nbsp; and equity,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the opinion&nbsp; that defendant's&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; relief should&nbsp; have been&nbsp;&nbsp; granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin&nbsp; with, it was&nbsp; filed well within the&nbsp; periods&nbsp; provided in the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Secondly, and, this is more important, defendant's verified answer, which&nbsp; was attached to said petition, contains&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; which,&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp; true,&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; a&nbsp; good defense.&nbsp; Thus, for&nbsp; instance, in&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the "special denials" therein, he&nbsp; alleged:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; it is not true that he failed to pay the said indebtedness of his said&nbsp; wife,&nbsp; as alleged in paragraph 3 of the complaint,&nbsp; for as a matter of&nbsp; fact, plaintiff and defendant&nbsp; agreed upon a settlement of the said indebtedness of the latter's&nbsp; deceased wife on December 5, 1948, whereby defendant was allowed to pay it out of his monthly salary by&nbsp; installment of P10.00 monthly beginning January, 1949, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance therewith,&nbsp; defendant paid&nbsp; unto&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; the following sums:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
