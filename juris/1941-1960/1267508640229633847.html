				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 10, 1948, in obedience to an order of the Court of First Instance 
of Leyte, the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Tolosa, proclaimed Cesario R. 
Colasito as mayor elected in the elections of.November 11, 1947, with one 
thousand thirty votes or a majority of thirty eight over his opponent, Luis C. 
Trinchera, who received nine hundred ninety two votes.<br><p>On February 23, 
1948, Trinchera filed a protest alleging that sixty stray votes were unlawfully 
adjudicated to Colasito in Precinct No. 3, while thirty nine votes validly cast 
for Trinchera in Precincts Nos. 3, 6, and 7 were not counted in Ms favor, and 
that, otherwise, Trinchera would have won the election.</p>
<p>On February 28, 1948, Colasito filed a motion to dismiss the protest alleging 
that the question therein raised has been already decided in the mandamus 
proceedings No. 143 of the Court of First Instance of Leyte and the resolution 
of the Supreme Court in L-1887; that the motion of protest could have been 
properly presented as a counter protest in election protest No. 314 of the Court 
of First Instance of Leyte, and Trinchera's failure to do so constitutes a 
waiver of his right to raise the question at any other time; and that the motion 
of protest was filed out of time.</p>
<p>On March 19, 1948, the lower court issued an order dismissing the protest, 
with costs against Trinchera, upon the ground that the points at issue in the 
protest had been finally decided by the Supreme Court in its resolution in 
L-1887.</p>
<p>The order appears to be erroneous, and Trinchera appealed. The resolution of 
this Court dismissing the petition in L-I887, issued on January 28, 1948, reads 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioners in The Board of Election Inspectors et al <em>vs.</em> Edmundo 
S. Piccio, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, et al., L-1887, prayed 
for the issuance of a writ of <em>certiorari</em> for the annulment of the 
orders of respondent judge of December 5 and 13, 1947, in <em>mandamus</em> case 
No. 143, Colasito <em>vs.</em> The Board of Election Inspectors, et al, of the 
Court of First Instance of Leyte, and that the petition for mandamus in said 
case be ordered dismissed.</p>
<p>"It is alleged that in the elections of November 11, 1947, Cesario R. 
Colasito and Luis C. Trinchera were candidates for mayor of Tolosa. On November 
12, 1947, the municipal board of canvassers made a canvass and proclaimed Luis 
C. Trinchera as mayor-elect. On November 15, Cesario R. Colasito filed with the 
Court of First Instance a petition for <em>mandamus</em> with preliminary 
injunction (<em>a</em>) to prevent the board of election inspectors from making 
a final election return for precinct No. 8 of Tolosa, unless the same is in 
accordance with the true result of the election, (<em>b</em>) to prevent the 
municipal treasurer from submitting to the board of canvassers a false election 
return for precinct No. 8, and (<em>c</em>) to order the board of election 
inspectors to file an election return in accordance with the true result of the 
election as regards the office of mayor, to order the municipal treasurer to 
submit the true election return to the municipal board of canvassers, and to 
order the latter to proclaim Cesario R. Colasito elected mayor in the election 
of November 11, 1947.</p>
<p>"The petition is based on the allegation that in a certificate issued by the 
election inspectors of precinct No. 8 appears that the votes cast for mayor 
were: 112 for Cesario R. Colasito and 92 for Luis C. Trinchera, but the board of 
inspectors issued a false return giving to Colasito only 62 votes Instead of the 
112 he received in the election, and gave Trinchera 142. votes instead of 92 
which he received in the elections, and the changes made in the election returns 
had the effect of changing the result of the election.</p>
<p>"Motion to dismiss the petition for <em>mandamus</em> with injunction was 
denied. A motion to reconsider the order of denial met with the same fate. Judge 
Edmundo S. Piccio ordered, accordingly, the revision of the ballots contained in 
boxes from Precinct No. 8. Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari </i>against 
Judge Piccio and candidate Colasito, which is the second one filed with the 
Supreme Court by the sane petitioners. the first one filed in L-1852, dated 
December 6, 1947, seeking to restrain Judge Piccio from enforcing the order of 
November 26, 1947, commanding the opening of the ballot boxes of Precinct No. 8 
of Tolosa.</p>
<p>"Attached to the record there are two telegrams from the clerk of the Court 
of First Instance of Leyte giving information to the effect that the ballot 
boxes were opened on December 31, 1947, and upon the revised ballots, it appears 
that they support the contention of Colasito as to the true result of the 
election. Petitioners allege that Colasito filed an election protest against 
Trinchera in case No. $lk of the Court of First Instance of Leyte.</p>
<p>"Considering that respondent judge has jurisdiction to take cognisance of the 
petition for <em>mandamus</em> that he did not.abuse his discretion in refusing 
to dismiss the petition for <em>mandamus</em> was a proper remedy under the 
facts alleged therein, which happen to be justified by the result of the 
recounting of the ballots made by the court on December 31, 1947, and that the 
remedy by election protest can be sesorted to only after a canvass and 
proclamation has been made by the municipal board of canvassers upon the 
authentic election returns of all the precincts of the municipality, the 
aggrieved party being entitled to remedy against an illegal canvass or 
proclamation or one based on one or more false election returns, petition 
dismissed."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above resolution does not decide the questions of fact raised in the 
protest as to counting and adjudication of votes in Precincts Nos. 3, 6, and 7 
of Tolosa. Neither does it decide the question as to whether or not the election 
of Colasito should be annulled and Trinchera should be declared elected to the 
office of mayor of Tolosa, as prayed for in the protest.</p>
<p>The appealed order of dismissal of the protest is set aside and the lower 
court is ordered to proceed with the protest on the merits with costs of this 
appeal against appellee.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, paras, Pablo, Bengzon,
