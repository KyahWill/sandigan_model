				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendant-appellant herein was indicted in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila on an information which charged him with serious physical injuries 
through reckless imprudence, committed in the City of Manila on the 27th day of 
March 1948. Upon arraignment on April 19, 1948, he pleaded not guilty, but 
through representations made by counsel that appellant, who was a student, be 
permitted to finish "the present semester of the school year before entering 
Jail," the hearing of his case was postponed to January 4, 1949.
<p>On that date, the accused withdraw his former plea of not guilty and, soon 
after the reading for the second time of the information filed against him, 
entered a plea of guilty. In view thereof, and in answer to a question by the 
court, the accused having stated that on March 27, 1948, he drove the motor 
vehicle mentioned in the information, without license, with the recommendation 
of the prosecution, and pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (<em>d</em>) of 
Section 67 of Act No. 3992, the court, on January 4, 1949, sentenced him to 
imprisonment for one year, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>On the same date of the judgment, and without objection of the fiscal, the 
accused moved for the reconsideration thereof, praying that in view of his 
voluntary plea of guilty "a lighter indeterminate sentence" be given him. Said 
petition for reconsideration was set for hearing on January 10, 1949, but, on 
the same date, defendant filed a notice of appeal. The record shows that when 
this case was before the lower court for the hearing of the motion for 
reconsideration, the accused, either by himself or his lawyer, failed to appear 
and the court, having lost jurisdiction to act, by reason of the appeal, on said 
motion for reconsideration, denied the same on January 10, 1949.</p>
<p>In his brief the accused assails the correctness of the Judgment of the lower 
court on the ground that the latter erred: (1) in not taking into consideration 
"the sickly condition and appearance of the accused at the trial," and in 
imposing upon him "a rather heavy and excessive penalty not commensurate with 
the offense committed;" (2) in "questioning the accused notwithstanding the fact 
that he had pleaded guilty only to the charge or offense as alleged and set 
forth in the information, which in effect compelled the accused to testify 
against himself 5" and (3) in imposing an unusually heavy penalty on the accused 
contrary to the usual and generally accepted practice in the courts on similar 
offenses.</p>
<p>The brief of the accused contains a statement wherein he recites facts which 
are not alleged in the information, and which We, for obvious reasons, cannot 
consider reliable. As already stated, upon his withdrawal of the plea of not 
guilty and his plea of guilty, no evidence was taken at the hearing of this case 
in the lower court. His plea of guilty is an admission of all the allegations 
and facts set forth in the information which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 27th day of March, 1948, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused, being the driver and person in charge of civilian 
Jeep bearing Plate No. 2783 with defective brakes, did then and there willfully 
and unlawfully drive, operate and manage the same in a reckless, negligent and 
imprudent manner westward along Legarda St., in said City, by then and there 
giving the said vehicle a speed greater than was reasonable and proper under the 
circumstance, and by not taking the necessary precautions to avoid damage to 
property and accident to persons, causing as a consequence of his said 
recklessness, imprudence and lack of precautions the said vehicle so driven, 
operated and managed by him to hit, as in fact it hit, one Dimas Serrano who was 
at the time boarding civilian Jeepney bearing Plate No. TPU-14383 parked in 
front of House No, 613 Legarda, thereby inflicting upon the said Dimas Serrano 
physical injuries, to wit: (1) Fracture, simple, pertrochanteric, femur, right 
with varus deformity; (2) Wound lacerated, antero-medial ankle, left, which have 
required and will require medical attendance for a period of from six to eight 
months and which have incapacitated and will incapacitate him from performing 
his customary labor for the same period of time."</p></blockquote>
<p>As may be seen, the latter part of the information which describes the nature 
and seriousness of the physical injuries inflicted by appellant upon Dimas 
Serrano, and which "required and will require medical attendance for a period of 
from six to eight months and which have incapacitated and will incapacitate him 
from performing his customary labor for the same period of time," have 
undoubtedly guided the court in imposing upon this appellant the penalty of one 
year of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Appellant criticizes the lower court in questioning him as to whether or not 
he had a license to drive a motor vehicle. But the accused having answered the 
question voluntarily, he cannot now contend that he was compelled to testify 
against himself. It is well settled that, in cases like the one before Us, the 
trial judge has discretion to ascertain the true facts before rendering judgment 
against an accused who has pleaded guilty. (Sec. 5, Rule 140, Rules of Court; 
U.S. <em>vs</em>. Talbanos, 6 Phil. 541; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Rota, 9 Phil. 426; 
U.S. <em>vs</em>. Agcaoili, 31 Phil. 91; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Jamad, 37 Phil. 
305.)</p>
<p>Moreover, the court could not have taken judicial cognizance of the sickly 
condition and appearance of the accused at the trial of this case, because, as 
stated above, his plea of guilty dispensed with the necessity of taking any 
evidence to substantiate the allegations of the information. Neither his alleged 
sickly condition and appearance (Art. 13, par. 9, Rev. Penal Code), as 
exemplified by a medical certificate Exhibit A annexed to the supplementary 
petition for reconsideration of the judgment, can have any bearing on the 
instant case as a mitigating circumstance. This accused is charged and convicted 
of a violation of a special law (Act No. 3992, The Revised Motor Vehicle Law) 
and the provisions of the Revised Penal Code are, pursuant to its Article 10, 
not, therefore, applicable thereto.</p>
<p>Upon carefully viewing this case, We are of the opinion that if appellant was 
really in such physical condition, as is described in said Exhibit A, he should 
not have driven that civilian jeep "with defective brakes," along Legarda street 
of this City, and thus violated the provision of paragraph (<em>d</em>) of 
Section 67 of Act No. 3992. This law, approved on December 3, 1932, after the 
enactment of Act No. 3315 (The Revised Penal Code) which tools effect on the 1st 
day of January 1932, has superseded the provisions of Article 365 of the Revised 
Penal Code in cases of offenses resulting from criminal negligence of the 
offender while operating a motor vehicle; the purpose of the lawmaker being to 
curb such violations by prescribing therefor a more severe penalty than that 
provided by the Revised Penal Code for ordinary cases of reckless 
imprudence.</p>
<p>Premised on all the foregoing, we, therefore, modify the judgment appealed 
from in the sense that the penalty imposed upon this appellant shall consist of 
an indeterminate penalty, ranging from six months and one day to one year and 
six months of imprisonment. With costs.</p>
