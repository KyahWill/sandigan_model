				G.R. No. L-1918, May 18, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PEDRO L. FLORES, PETITIONER, VS. PERFECTO R. PALACIO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAMARINES SUR, EXCEQUIELA RABAJANTE AND JUAN A. PARCO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Excequiela Rabajante, married to Juan A. Parco, is the lessee 
of a public residential land in Naga, Camarines Sur, in a lease contract 
executed in her facor by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 
subject to the provisions of Public Land Act No. 141. Her husband Parco was 
transferred sometime in 1939 to Legaspi, Albay, then to Catanduanes, as interim 
provincial treasurer and later on to Santa Cruz, Laguna, as assistant provincial 
treasurer. The house Excequiela built in the land was burned to the ground in 
1942.
<p align="justify">With the permission of the mayor of Naga, Pedro L. Flores 
constructed a building on the lot in question and filed with the Bureau of Lands 
a protest against the continuance of the lease contract in favor of Excequiela. 
Pending determination of said protest, Excequiela and her husband filed with the 
Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur an action for ejectment against Flores. 
Having no defense in said civil case, as the contract of lease is still in force 
and not otherwise cancelled, Flores entered into an agreement with the 
plaintiffs promising ot vacate teh land wihtin three months from and after the 
signing of said agreement, Flores hoping that within said period his calim to 
the lot in question would have been already determined definitely and finally by 
the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Accordingly, decision was rendered 
and on December 11, 1947, a writ of execution was issued for the ouster of 
Flores from the lot in question.</p>
<p align="justify">Flores seeks the annulment of the agreement he entered into to 
vacate the lot and of the writ of execution of December 11, 1947, alleging that 
on October 4, 1947, he instituted with the Court of First Instance of Camarines 
Sur an action for mandamus to compel the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce 
to terminate the lease contract in favor of Excequiela and that the respondent 
judge acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction in not permitting Flores to 
continue in the possession of the lot in question until after the mandamus 
proceedings shall have been finally terminated.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is without merit. If, as petitioner claims, the 
agreement to vacate the lot in question was entered into by him against his 
will, he should have availed himself of the remedy provided to by Rule 38 to 
annul the same instead of restoring to the present petition for certiorari and 
prohibition.</p>
<p align="justify">As regards the mandamus case against the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Commerce initiated on October 4, 1947, with the Court of First 
Instance of Camarines Sur, it cannot in any way divest the respondent judge of 
his power and jurisdiction to issue or order the issuance of the writ of 
execution of December 11, 1947, which is based on a final decision rendered on 
the basis of an agreement entered into by the parties. Regardless of any merit 
the mandamus case may have, its result is speculative. A final decision of a 
court of justice cannot be suspended or annulled upon a speculation.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition denied with costs against petitioner.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
