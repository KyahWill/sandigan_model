				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Estanislao&nbsp; Serrano is&nbsp; appealing the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Jlocos Sur,&nbsp; Judge Jose G. Bautista presiding, declaring null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void the supposed donation, <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span> on which his complaint was based and dismissing the&nbsp; later&nbsp; upon&nbsp; motion of the&nbsp; defendant. The motion for&nbsp; dismissal was filed before&nbsp; the hearing but the&nbsp; trial court deferred&nbsp; action upon it until after submission&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence by the&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; Said parties entered into a stipulation of facts after which they declined to&nbsp; submit any other evidence&nbsp; except&nbsp; Exhibit "A", the supposed deed of&nbsp; donation <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias,</span> the&nbsp; translation of&nbsp; which, for purposes of reference, is reproduced&nbsp; below:<br><blockquote>"That, I Melchor&nbsp; Solomon,&nbsp; single, Filipino, of legal age, native of the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sinait, province of Ilocos Sur&nbsp; and&nbsp; residing at&nbsp; present&nbsp; in Sinait,&nbsp; having decided&nbsp; to get&nbsp; married with&nbsp; the consent&nbsp; of my parents,&nbsp; brothers&nbsp; or sisters and relatives,&nbsp; have announced&nbsp; and manifested&nbsp; my&nbsp; determination and&nbsp; desire&nbsp; to Mr. Estanislao&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; to&nbsp; whose&nbsp; family the flower I&nbsp; intend to win belongs, namely Miss&nbsp; Alexandria Feliciano single, born in Hawaii but is actually residing in Cabugao,&nbsp; Ilocos Sur.<br><br>This ardent desire favored&nbsp; by good&nbsp; luck and accepted by the noble lady the one concerned,&nbsp; is to be realized&nbsp; and complied&nbsp; with under agreement or&nbsp; stipulation which affirms, promotes and vivifies the union.&nbsp; This&nbsp; agreement donating all my exclusive properties in order that we shall have a basic capital for our conjugal life and in order that there will be ready maintenance and support of our offsprings has come out voluntarily&nbsp; and expontaneously from me, I the very one concerned.<br><br>These which I am&nbsp; donating my exclusive&nbsp; properties&nbsp; because I have&nbsp; honestly&nbsp; acquired the&nbsp; same&nbsp; with&nbsp; the sweat of my brows and I donate them gladly, to wit * * *;<br><br>The referred to properties&nbsp; are donated in accordance with the existing laws of the&nbsp; Philippines and our children out of the wedlock will be the ones to inherit same with equal shares.&nbsp; But <span style="font-style: italic;">if God will not blew our union with any</span> child one half of&nbsp; all my properties including the properties acquired during: our conjugal union&nbsp; will be given the (to) <i>my brothers&nbsp;&nbsp; or sisters or their heirs if I, the husband will die before my wife and if my beloved wife will die before me, one half of all my properties and those acquired by us will be given to those who have reared my wife in. token of my love to&nbsp; her</i>* * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Alejandria Feliciano, whose father went&nbsp; to&nbsp; Hawaii to seek his&nbsp; fortune and&nbsp; who&nbsp; until&nbsp; now resides&nbsp; there, had been left to her father's friend named Estanislao Serrano who took care of and raised her from the age of 12 until she&nbsp; readied womanhood.&nbsp; On June&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; defendant Melchor Solomon married Alejandria.&nbsp; On the same day of the marriage but before the&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; ceremony&nbsp; he executed the alleged Deed of Donation, Exhibit&nbsp; "A" above reproduced.&nbsp; Less than nine months, after the marriage, or&nbsp; rather on&nbsp; March 2,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; Alejandria&nbsp; died&nbsp; without issue.&nbsp; Several&nbsp;&nbsp; months thereafter&nbsp; Estanislao&nbsp; Serrano commenced the present action to&nbsp; enforce and&nbsp; implement the&nbsp; terms of the alleged donation particularly that portion thereof to the effect that if&nbsp; Alejandria died&nbsp; before her&nbsp; husband Melchor and left no&nbsp; children, then one half of Melchor's properties&nbsp; and those acquired&nbsp; by him and his wife would&nbsp; be given to&nbsp; those persons who had&nbsp; raised and&nbsp; taken care&nbsp; of her namely, Estanislao Serrano.<br><br>Acting upon&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; the trial court found that the donation could not be regarded as&nbsp; a donation <i>propter nuptias</i> for the reason that though it was executed before the marriage, it&nbsp; was not made in consideration of the marriage and, what is more important, that the donation was not made to one&nbsp; or both of&nbsp; the (marriage) contracting parties, but to a third person.<br><br>After a careful study of the case,&nbsp; we fully agree with the trial court&nbsp; Article 1327 of the Old Civil Code reads:<br><blockquote>"Art 1327. Donations by reasons of marriage are those bestowed before its celebration in consideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same, upon&nbsp; one or both&nbsp; of the spouses."<br></blockquote>This article was reproduced in the new Civil Code under Article 126.&nbsp; Whether&nbsp; we&nbsp; apply&nbsp; Article 1327 for&nbsp; the reason that the document Exhibit "A" was executed in 1948&nbsp; before the promulgation of the New Civil Code in 1950&nbsp; or whether we apply Article 126 of the New Civil Code the result would be the same.<br><br>Was the donation made&nbsp; in consideration of the marriage between Melchor and Alexandria or was it made in consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the death of either of them&nbsp; in the absence of any children? True, the Deed of Donation was executed on&nbsp; the&nbsp; occasion when&nbsp; they&nbsp; married.&nbsp; But, the marriage in itself was not the only consideration or condition under Which terms&nbsp; of the donation would be carried out&nbsp; The marriage would have to be childless and one of the spouses would have to&nbsp; die before the other before the&nbsp; donation would operate.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; strictly speaking, the&nbsp; donation&nbsp; may not be&nbsp;&nbsp; regarded as one&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the marriage.<br><br>But assuming for the&nbsp; moment&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; made&nbsp; in consideration&nbsp; of the marriage, still, we have the fact that the donation was being made not in favor of Alejandria, the wife, but rather in favor of those&nbsp; who acted&nbsp; as her parents&nbsp; and&nbsp; raised&nbsp; her from&nbsp; girlhood&nbsp; to&nbsp; womanhood&nbsp; in the absence of her father.&nbsp; That does not&nbsp; place it&nbsp; within the provisions&nbsp; of Article 1327&nbsp; and&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 126&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Old&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code and the&nbsp; New&nbsp; Civil Code, respectively. Manresa, in his commentary on&nbsp; Article 1327&nbsp; of the Civil Code, says the following:<br><blockquote>"Donations excluded are&nbsp; those&nbsp; (1) made in favor of the&nbsp; spouses after the celebration of marriage; (2) executed in favor of the future spouses but not in&nbsp; consideration of the marriage; and (3) <i>granted to persons other than the spouses even&nbsp; though they may be founded on the marriage</i> (6 M. 232)."<br></blockquote>Having come to the conclusion that the Deed of Dona tion does not fulfill the requirements of a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span> and that it might be considered a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos,</span>&nbsp; can it be considered valid and effective?&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardly, because it was never accepted by the donee either in the same instrument of donation or in a separate document as required by law.<br><br>Again, may the donation be regarded a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>,&nbsp; and given effect?&nbsp; The&nbsp; answer has to&nbsp; be in the negative for the reason that this Tribunal has&nbsp; heretofore consistently held that a donation to take effect after the death of the donor,&nbsp; is&nbsp; equivalent to&nbsp; a disposition&nbsp; or bequest of property by last will, and it should be executed in accordance with the requisites and&nbsp; strict&nbsp; provisions governing the execution of wills x; and Exhibit "A" does not fulfill said&nbsp; requirements.&nbsp; Moreover, in&nbsp; the present case, the donor is still alive and naturally,&nbsp; even if the donation were otherwise valid, still, the time and occasion have not arrived for considering its&nbsp; operation and implementation.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
