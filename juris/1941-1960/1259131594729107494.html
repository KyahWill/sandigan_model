				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal stems from a decision rendered in two cases which were jointly tried&nbsp; by the Court of First Instanee of Cebu.&nbsp;&nbsp; In one Pedro P. Arong, as owner of Liberty Theater operated in the City of Cebu, impleaded&nbsp; the mayor and treasurer of said city to recover the sum of P11,021:22 paid under protest as license&nbsp; fee collected under Ordinance No. 43, series of&nbsp; 1947, on the ground that said ordinances are illegal and oppressive and were enacted in violation of the City Charter (Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; R-728).&nbsp; In&nbsp; the other, John D. Young arid six other&nbsp; owners and, operators of theaters in the&nbsp; city likewise impleaded&nbsp; the same&nbsp; city officials to recover the amounts they had paid&nbsp; under protest which were collected as license fees under&nbsp; the same ordinances on the&nbsp; same ground that they are illegal&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra, vires</span> and&nbsp; were enacted in violation&nbsp; of the City Charter&nbsp; (Case No, R-1113).<br><br>Defendants alleged as special defense that&nbsp; the&nbsp; amounts collected from the plaintiffs&nbsp; are not taxes but license fees and&nbsp; so the enactment of the aforesaid&nbsp; ordinances comes within&nbsp; the power&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to the City of&nbsp;&nbsp; Cebu by&nbsp; its charter and are not <i>ultra vires.</i>&nbsp; They Arther averred that the amounts collected were merely for regulation and not for revenue and if the amounts are little&nbsp; excessive the excess,was merely&nbsp; incidental which cannot invalidate the ordinances.<br><br>Because the issues raised&nbsp; in the two&nbsp; eases are common both to plaintiffs and defendants, it was agreed that after, the parties submitted a stipulation of facts&nbsp; without prejudice of presenting&nbsp; additional evidence if they&nbsp; deem it necessary and, on March 6,1953, the court rendered decision declaring the&nbsp; two ordinances valid&nbsp; and&nbsp; absolving&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; From this decision&nbsp; the plaintiffs have appealed.<br><br>The amounts which plaintiffs seek to recover were&nbsp; collected under the provisions of Ordinance No. 25, approved on February 10, 1947.&nbsp; Section 1&nbsp; of the latter ordinance provides:<br><blockquote>"Section 1.—In addition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fees&nbsp; paid by cinematographs,<br><br>theaters,&nbsp; vaudeville companies, theatrical shows and boxing exhibitions, as&nbsp; provided for in Chapter Fifty-one of Ordinance. Numbered<br><br>Seventeen, entitled An Ordinance prescribing rules and regulations and fixing license fees&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; revenues;&nbsp; revised, amends&nbsp; and supersedes all previous ordinances&nbsp; on&nbsp; imposition&nbsp; and collection of municipal and other revenues; also&nbsp; rules and regulations&nbsp; governing the same, there&nbsp; shall be collected&nbsp; from the&nbsp; places of amusement, which are specifically mentioned above, the following fees on1 the price of every admission&nbsp; ticket sold by&nbsp; such enterprises:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) For every ticket sold the price of which is up to P0.99&nbsp; .......................................................................... &nbsp; P0.025<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket sold the&nbsp; price of which is from P1.00 to P1.99 .................................................,..............&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.05<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket sold the&nbsp; price of which is from P2.00 to P2.99 ................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.075<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket sold, the&nbsp; price of which is from P3.00 to P4.99 ................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.10 <br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket sold the&nbsp; price of which is from P5.00 to P9.99 ...................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.125<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket sold the&nbsp; price of which Is from P10.00 to 14.99 ...............................................................&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.175<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(g</span>) For&nbsp; every ticket gold the&nbsp; price of which is from P15 or more...................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.25"<br></blockquote>Has the City of Cebu&nbsp; the power&nbsp; to&nbsp; approve the above ordinances?&nbsp; This would&nbsp; require an inquiry into the&nbsp; legislative&nbsp; power granted to said city by its charter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pertinent provisions&nbsp; are embodied in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 17&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act No. 58,&nbsp; which we&nbsp; quote:<br><blockquote>"Sec,&nbsp; 17. <i>General powers and duties of the Board</i>.—Except as otherwise provided by law, and subject to the conditions and limitation thereof the Municipal Board shall liave the following legislative powers:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; To regulate and fix the&nbsp; amount of the&nbsp; license fees for&nbsp; the following:&nbsp; Hawkers, peddlers,&nbsp; hucksters, not&nbsp; including hucksters or peddlers who sell&nbsp; only native vegetables,&nbsp; fruits, or foods, personally carried by&nbsp; the&nbsp; hucksters&nbsp; or&nbsp; peddlers; auctioneers, plumbers, barbers or embalmers, collecting&nbsp; agencies,&nbsp; mercantile&nbsp; agencies, shipping and intelligence&nbsp; offices, private&nbsp; detective agencies, advertising agencies, massagists, tattooexs, jugglers acrobats, hotels, clubs, restaurants,&nbsp; cafes, slodging houses,&nbsp; boarding houses, livery garages, livery stables, boarding stables, dealers in large cattle, public billiard tables, laundries, cleaning and dyeing establishments, public&nbsp; warehouses, dance&nbsp; halls,&nbsp; cabarets, circus, and&nbsp; other&nbsp; similar parades, public&nbsp; vehicles,&nbsp; race tracks, horse races, bowling alley's; shooting galleries, slot machines,&nbsp; merry-go-rounds,&nbsp; pawn-shops,&nbsp; dealers&nbsp; in second-hand merchandise,&nbsp; junk dealers, brewers,, distillers, rectifiers, money' changers&nbsp; and brokers,&nbsp; public ferries,&nbsp; theaters,&nbsp; theatrical <span style="font-style: italic;">performances, cinematographs</span>;&nbsp; public exhibitions, circuses,&nbsp; and&nbsp; all other performances and&nbsp; places of amusements,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the keeping, preparation and&nbsp; sale of&nbsp; meat,&nbsp; poultry, fish, game,, butter, cheese, lard, vegetable,&nbsp; bread,&nbsp; and other&nbsp; provisions.&nbsp; (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>It should be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; with regard to&nbsp; the&nbsp; business of theatres, theatrical performances, cinematographs, and other&nbsp; places&nbsp; of&nbsp; amusements,&nbsp; the power that the charter gives&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Cebu&nbsp; is&nbsp; merely "to regulate and fix the amount of&nbsp; the license fees."&nbsp; It does not include the power to tax as is&nbsp; the&nbsp; case with regard to other businesses and occupations.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be clearly&nbsp; seen from a cursory reading of the&nbsp; law.&nbsp; When it desires to grant the power to tax it expressly so provides, otherwise it&nbsp; merely employs the words&nbsp; "to regulate" or "fix the&nbsp; license&nbsp; fees."&nbsp; The i&nbsp; question&nbsp; therefore, that now arises is:&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the ordinances in question impose a tax for purposes of revenue or merely fix a license fee for purposes&nbsp; of regulations?<br><br>The City of Cebu contends&nbsp; that they merely impose&nbsp; an additional license fee in order to raise funds to cover the expenses that&nbsp; are&nbsp; entailed by the city in. carrying out its duty to supervise&nbsp; and protect the&nbsp; theaters and different places of amusements that&nbsp; are operated&nbsp; within its limits against&nbsp; fire&nbsp; hazards&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; risk&nbsp; incidental to&nbsp; their business:&nbsp; Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that they were enacted to impose a tax to create a source of revenue for the city. <br><br>The issue raised&nbsp; is not new as.&nbsp; it has&nbsp; already been decided in at least&nbsp; two cases&nbsp; in this jurisdiction.&nbsp; The first is the&nbsp; Eastern&nbsp; Theatrical&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Inc., <i>vs.</i> Victor Alfonso, et al., 46, Off. Gaz. (supplement)&nbsp; p. 30, wherein a similar ordinance was&nbsp; enacted by the City of Manila which impose a&nbsp; fee on every price of admission tickets sold by cinematographs, theaters, vaudeville companies, theatrical shows and boxing exhibitions, in addition to other license fees paid&nbsp; by the same&nbsp; enterprises under another ordinance of the&nbsp; same city.&nbsp; This Court held that said&nbsp; ordinance imposes a tax&nbsp; on business and is not merely regulatory, although&nbsp; its enactment&nbsp; was within the grant of&nbsp; power vested in the City of Manila&nbsp; by its charter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other case is City of Baguio vs.&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Y. de la Rosa,&nbsp; et al., G. R. No.&nbsp; L-8268-70, wherein the City of Baguio&nbsp; enacted an ordinance which&nbsp; required every movie house&nbsp; or theater operated within the city&nbsp; to increase the price of its&nbsp; admission tickets&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows: for every ticket sold for the main floor, there was added&nbsp; an increase of P0.05, for&nbsp; every ticket sold for the balcony P0.10, and for every ticket sold fol the lodge&nbsp; P0.20.&nbsp; This Court also held that said ordinance imposes not merely&nbsp; a license fee but a tax for purposes of revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it cannot be pretended that the&nbsp; fees exacted the ordinance in question are merely&nbsp; for regulation for under Ordinance No. 25, series of 1946,&nbsp; of the City of Cebu, the&nbsp; theaters and other places of entertainment&nbsp; within its limits are already charged the corresponding license fees for&nbsp; their operation depending upon their&nbsp; classification,. Thus, for a first class&nbsp; theater or cinematograph an&nbsp; annual fee of&nbsp; P300 is charged and for those belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; the second class an annual fee&nbsp; of P300.&nbsp; It is therefore evident that under its charter the&nbsp; City of Cebu does not have the power to enact the ordinances in question&nbsp; and, therefore, are <i>ultra vires.</i><br><br>The next question to be determined is:&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the plaintiffs entitled to recover the fees they had paid&nbsp; Under said ordinances ?<br><br>We are constrained to hold that they are prevented from recovering them it appearing that&nbsp; these fees are paid not by the plaintiffs but by' the public.&nbsp; If any body has the right to claim them, it&nbsp; is those who paid&nbsp; them.&nbsp; This is what we held in the case&nbsp; of Esteban Medina, et al., <i>vs.</i> City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baguio,&nbsp; (91&nbsp; Phil., 854).&nbsp; In&nbsp; this, respect&nbsp; the decision of the lower court&nbsp; is correct.<br><br>Wherefore, we hereby modify the decision of the lower court in&nbsp; the sense that, while the ordinances in question are <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires,</span> plaintiffs cannot collect the fees they had paid&nbsp; thereunder and,&nbsp; therefore, this&nbsp; case&nbsp; should&nbsp; be dismissed, without" pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp; L., </i>and&nbsp; <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>concur.</div>
