				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1974, March 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CANDIDO INGALIA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The accused, a Filipino citizen, was charged with treason on 
thirteen counts, but evidence was presented only on four counts (Nos. 1, 9, 10, 
and 12) wherein it is alleged that during the Japanese occupation he gave aid 
and comfort to the enemy by leading raiding parties of Japanese soldiers against 
the guerrilla forces, helping them obtain information about guerrilla suspects, 
and participating in the torture and killing of those engaged in the resistance 
movement.
<p align="justify">The People's Court found that the accused had taken part in the 
torture of three guerrilla suspects named Merito Lim, Emilio Gallos, and Edison 
Garganera, and in the execution of the last two, and, declaring him guilty of 
what it called "the complex crime of treason and murders," sentenced him to 
death, to indemnify the heirs of Emilio Gallos in the sum of P2,000 and those of 
Edison Garganera in the same amount, to suffer the accessory penalties 
prescribed by law, and to pay a fine of P20,000 and the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">Because of the nature of the main penalty imposed, this Court 
is called upon to review the sentence.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question as to the findings of fact of the trial 
court, the same being accepted by defense counsel and supported by the testimony 
of witnesses whose credibility has not been put in doubt. Defendant's 
declaration that he had no knowledge of the alleged tortures and executions or 
that he had no participation therein is too weak to overcome the overwhelming 
proof against him.</p>
<p align="justify">But while both the defense and the Solicitor General recommend 
affirmance of the sentence, we find that this we cannot do. As already held by 
this Court in similar cases, the tortures and murders ascribed to defendant 
constitute, together with his other acts, the very elements of the crime of 
treason with which he is charged, and should, therefore, be considered as merged 
in that offense, with the result that the accused should only be declared guilty 
of treason and not of "treason with murders." (People vs. Labra, 81 Phil., 377; 
People vs. Prieto, 80 Phil., 138; People vs. Racaza, 82 Phil., 623; People vs. 
Roble, 83 Phil., 1.) </p>
<p align="justify">In determining the penalty to be imposed upon the accused, this 
Court can not but take notice of the vindictive cruelty exhibited by him in 
torturing and executing his victims. As the Solicitor General rightly observes 
in his brief, the savagery which characterized the inhuman punishment inflicted 
by the accused on those suspected of being in the resistance movement was beyond 
even that required for the accomplishment of his traitorous acts. It appears 
that one of those suspects, Merito Lim, was, in the dead of night, snatched from 
his bed by the accused, who, after denouncing him as a sergeant of the 
guerrillas, proceeded to strike him with his fists until he fell. The accused 
then repeatedly kicked him and, ignoring his plea for mercy, dragged him out of 
the house, tied his hands and neck and led him away, escorted by Japanese 
soldiers. The next morning Lim's corpse, with hands still tied, was found 
hanging down on the stiff side of a gully near the place where the Japanese 
usually executed their victims. Another suspect was Emilio Gallos, a member of 
the guerrilla forces. This man at first received fists blows from theaacused, 
and when he fell he was kicked and trampled upon by him until blood oozed out of 
his mouth and nose. Not content with this, the accused tied up Gallos' hands and 
neck with a rope, led him to the dock by the river where he made him kneel down 
and then lopped off his head with a Japanese saber. The third suspect tortured 
was Edison Garganera. The accused stripped this man of his clothes and then 
applied a lighted piece of paper to his private parts. Afterwards the accused 
wrapped him in a sack, tied a rope around his neck, dragged him to the river 
dock and stabbed him four times with a bayonet. These atrocities, which have 
been clearly proven, make it imperative for us to appreciate against the accused 
the aggravating circumstance of unnecessary cruelty, and since this circumstance 
is not offset by any mitigating circumstance, the penalty of <i>reclusion 
temporal</i> to death, which is prescribed for the crime of treason, should be 
applied in the maximum. However, as five members of this Court are not for 
applying the extreme penalty in this case, the accused could only be sentenced 
to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in addition to the other penalties imposed by the 
lower court.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the decision is modified and the accused declared 
guilty of the crime of treason and sentenced to suffer <i>reclusion 
perpetua</i>, to indemnify the the heirs of Emilio Gallos in the sum of P2,000 
and those of Edison Garganera in the same amount, to suffer the accessory 
penalties prescribed by law, and to pay a fine of P20,000 and the costs in the 
lower court.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, 
Briones, Tuason,</i> and <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
