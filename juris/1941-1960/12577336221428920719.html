				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from the decision 
of the Court of First Instance of Baguio (in Civil Case No. 667) declaring 
Resolution No. 323 of the City Council, dated November 29, 1956, null and 
void.
<p>In a petition filed in said court, Matilde Gaerlan and 15 others, allegedly 
the only persons considered by the Market Committee of Baguio City to 
participate in the drawing of lots relative to the adjudication of 16 stalls in 
the City's new market building, sought the nullification of Resolution No. 323 
of the City Council awarding, before and without the drawing of lots, Stalls 
Nos. 16, 20, and 24 in the said new market building to Magdalena Caluza, Manuela 
Petilla and Magdalena Caccam, respectively, claiming that said resolution was 
enacted in violation of Republic Act No. 37 and Department of Finance Order No. 
32.</p>
<p>After respondents City Council and City Mayor, as well as awardees Caluza, 
Petilla and Caccam, who were allowed to intervene in the case, had filed their 
separate answers, denying the allegations of the petition, the case was duly 
heard.</p>
<p>On April 5, 1957, the court rendered judgment holding that the adjudication 
of Stalls Nos. 16, 20, and 24 to in-tervenors, by means of the resolution in 
question, violated Department Order No. 32, specifically section 10 thereof, 
which makes mandatory the drawing of lots before market stalls may be 
adjudicated to applicants. Consequently, Resolution No. 323 was declared null 
and void and the Market Committee of Baguio ordered to hold a drawing of lots 
for the said 3 stalls. Hence, the instant appeal by the respondent City Council 
and the intervenors.</p>
<p>It is not controverted that from 1947 to 1954, inter-venors-appellants were 
cloth-vendors occupying makeshift stalls in the "two old buildings behind 
Alpatublan Building (Store Market building)"; and that they had to vacate the 
premises to give way to the construction of the new market building, upon 
requirements of the city authorities who, however, assured them that 
preferential rights would be given to them in the awarding of stalls in the new 
market building. (Exh. 1-Intervenors, dated May 14, 1954.) More than two years 
later, or on November 8, 1956, and when the new building was about to be 
completed, intervenors wrote the City authorities (Exh. 2-Intervenors) reminding 
them of the assurance that the new stalls occupying the place of their old 
"puestos" will be given to them (intervenors). And so, upon completion of the 
new building, but before, the drawing of lots<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> actually took place, the City Council of 
Baguio passed a resolution which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"RESOLUTION NUMBERED 323</p>
<p>"On motion of Vice-Mayor Bienvenido R. Yandoc, seconded by Mayor Alfonso 
Tabora, it was</p>
<p>"Resolved: That in pursuance of the commitment of the City Mayor in his 
letter of May 16, 1954, Mesdames Magdalena Caluza, Manuela Pctilla and Magdalena 
Caccam be, as they are hereby allocated Stalls Nos. 16, 20 and 24, respectively, 
in the new market building (Miscellaneous Souvenir Section), behind the Stone 
Market Bldg., <em>they being the former stall holders in the same area wow 
occupied by the new building</em>.</p>
<p>"Unanimously adopted." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>This resolution was declared null and void by the court below as running 
counter to the rules and regulations governing the lease of public market 
stalls,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> specifically Section 10 
thereof which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 10. <em>Market Committee</em>.-There is hereby created a Committee in 
each city and municipality, to be designated as Market Committee, whose duty it 
shall be to conduct the drawing of lots and opening of bids in connection with 
the adjudication of vacant or newly created stalls or booths in the city or 
municipal markets as prescribed in this Order, and to certify to the city 
treasurer or municipal treasurer, as the case may be, the result thereof. * * 
*."</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is to be noted, however, that the aforementioned procedure, prescribed by 
Department of Finance Order No 32, is observed only "in connection with the 
adjudication of <em>vacant or newly created stalls or booths</em>". Stalls Nos. 
16, 20, and 24, on the other hand, can not be considered either as newly created 
or vacant. They are not newly created because they merely replace the old 
"puestos" as a result of the construction of the new market building in place of 
the old. They are not vacant because, as stated before, intervenors-appellants 
had, for several years, conducted their business in the same place, in makeshift 
stalls in the "old buildings" replaced by the new edifice. The old or makeshift 
stalls were disoccupied only to give way to the construction of the new 
building, but not without their occupants first obtaining an assurance from the 
city authorities that they would have preferential right to occupy the new 
stalls. Hence, with the enactment of Resolution No. 323 alloting said stalls to 
intervenors, the City Council did not actually make an award, in the sense that 
said awardees received something new after losing their former privilege. They 
were deprived of their old stalls not for any reason attributable to them, but 
at the instance of the City. And neither could they be considered to have 
abandoned their privilege because said occupants even made representations with 
the City Council, before and after the termination of the work, to re-occupy 
their old places. The resolution involved herein in effect merely allowed 
intervenors to continue their enjoyment of such privilege which was momentarily 
interrupted by the construction of the new building. Such action of the City 
Council, which is not repugnant to any law, not even Department of Finance Order 
No. 32<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> invoked by appellees, is 
certainly a valid exercise of its authority to regulate the use of city markets 
(Sec. 2552-v, Revised Administrative Code).</p>
<p>We note in the Statement of Facts contained in appellants' brief (p. 8), an 
<em>uncontradicted</em> reference that herein appellees took part in the drawing 
of lots of the remaining jnew vacant stalls (excepting those involved in this 
case) subsequently held on March 11, 1957, and that since then, appellees 
actually occupied the stalls respectively drawn in their favor. If this is so, 
then no prejudice has been ! caused appellees by the adoption of the disputed 
resolution.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the decision appealed from is hereby 
reversed, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>
