				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Baguio City, Hon.&nbsp; Jesus de Veyra,&nbsp; presiding, denying the petition for&nbsp; naturalization of Anandram Dargani, a citizen of India.<br><br>The record discloses the&nbsp; following: Petitioner came to the Philippines in&nbsp; June 1936 and left&nbsp; for&nbsp; India&nbsp; in 1941. In 1940, he&nbsp; started as a salesman of his uncle's company, the Toloram Maljimar &amp; Co., and was&nbsp; obviously&nbsp; still&nbsp; employed in&nbsp; that capacity when he left for&nbsp; India&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1941.<br><br>When petitioner was in India he married an Indian citizen. and three of his four children were born there.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1947 he returned to the Philippines.&nbsp; On July 13, 1952 he filed his declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; intention to become a citizen of the Philippines and on July 15, 1955 he filed his application for naturalization.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges in his petition that he returned to the Philippines in 1947 soon after the resumption of the maritime transportation between&nbsp; the Philippines and India, and he states in his brief that he was unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; return to&nbsp; the Philippines from 1941 to 1947, because of the outbreak of the World War II.&nbsp; Witnesses Josefina Floresca and Antonio Rillera&nbsp; testified that they have personally known the petitioner as&nbsp; a student since 1936 and&nbsp; since his return&nbsp; to the Philippines.<br><br>There is no question about the&nbsp; qualifications of applicant for admission except the continuity of his residence, which is denied by the Government, and the competency of his witnesses as to his character and other qualifications.<br><br>The trial&nbsp; court gave two reasons for denying&nbsp; the application,&nbsp; namely: that petitioner&nbsp; has&nbsp; not continuously resided in the Philippines for the period&nbsp; of 10 years required by&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2 of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 473&nbsp; (otherwise known&nbsp; as Naturalization Law),&nbsp; and that&nbsp; petitioner's witnesses have not personally known him during&nbsp; the&nbsp; same period of time.<br><br>Appellant claims that the phrase "continuous residence" does not mean actual physical presence without interruption.&nbsp; He argues that absence for a&nbsp; short time does not destroy the&nbsp; continuity of his residence, citing several American cases, In re&nbsp; Conis, D. C. N. Y., 35 ed.&nbsp; 960,&nbsp; 961; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Cantini, Pa., 212, F. 925, 926,&nbsp; 129, C. C. A. 445; In&nbsp; re&nbsp; Schneider, 164,&nbsp; F.&nbsp; 335, 336,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Philippine case, Ramon Ting alias&nbsp; Tian Yu <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Republic, etc.,&nbsp; 101&nbsp; Phil., 1038; 54 Off. Gaz. (11), 3496. While these authorities cited by appellant affirm that absolute continuity without absence for short periods is not required, not one of them asserts that absence for six out&nbsp; of&nbsp; the ten&nbsp; years required does not disqualify an applicant.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other hand, the Solicitor General claims that continuous physical presence is required, and this may be implied from the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of&nbsp; Domingo Dy alias William Dy&nbsp; Cinco <i>vs.</i> Republic,&nbsp; 92 Phil., 278, 48 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; (11), 4813 and Wilfred Yu <i>vs.</i> Republic,&nbsp; 95 Phil., 890; 50 Off. Gaz., (10), 4781.<br><br>Petitioner's claim that actual physical presence is&nbsp; not required everyday of&nbsp; the statutory period is correct.&nbsp; Not every absence is fatal to continuous residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be a temporary absence which may&nbsp; not be considered as breaking the continuity of the applicant's residence, where there is "animus revertendi".&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; unreasonable to&nbsp; interpret&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; phrase&nbsp;&nbsp; "continuous residence"&nbsp; strictly&nbsp; and literally.&nbsp; Congress could not have intended absurd&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Naturalization&nbsp; Law Thus, this Court in&nbsp; the case of Ramon Ting alias Ting Yu, <i>supra</i> ruled:<br><blockquote>"The Government, however,&nbsp; claims that the petitioner failed to comply with the naturalization law requiring the filing&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaration of intention to become a citizen because although he may have come&nbsp; to the Philippines in 1920, nevertheless, he absented himself by going back to China in 1925, and although he returned to the Philippines after six months,&nbsp; the continuous residence of thirty years&nbsp; required&nbsp; by&nbsp; law for exemption from&nbsp; the duty or filing the aforementioned declaration should be computed&nbsp; from that year, 1925, in which case, when he filed his petition for&nbsp; naturalization on&nbsp; December 15, 1950, his continuous residence&nbsp; was only about twenty-five&nbsp; years.&nbsp; We do not believe that a&nbsp; short absence from the Philippines,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; the&nbsp; visit made by the petitioner to China for a period of six months&nbsp; in 1925, should be held&nbsp; to&nbsp; interrupt his residence begun in 1920.&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp; Leon Miranda Tio Liok <i>vs.</i> Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines,&nbsp; G. R. No.&nbsp; L-4545, prom.&nbsp; October 29, 1952, we held that absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; short duration from the Philippines did not interrupt or affect continuous residence of thirty years required by law for&nbsp; exemption from the duty to file&nbsp; a declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; intention."&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 64-65,&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Citizenship&nbsp; and Naturalization, Velayo).<br></blockquote>Whether in the case at bar&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to come back to the Philippines is&nbsp; not disclosed in the record. But his absence of six years from the Philippines is not of&nbsp; a short&nbsp; duration.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; during that period got married in India and raised his children there.&nbsp; There is no evidence that he left properties or was engaged&nbsp; personally in business in the Philippines when he left for India in 1941.&nbsp; He was only a salesman in the company of his uncle.&nbsp; His&nbsp; purpose of leaving&nbsp; the&nbsp; country is not known and there is no evidence that&nbsp; when he left&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; the positive intention to return.&nbsp; We hold that under the above circumstances his absence for six years from the country has broken the continuity of his residence.&nbsp; Consequently, the petition should be&nbsp; denied because petitioner does&nbsp; not have&nbsp; the 10-year continuous residence required by law.<br><br>Our conclusion on&nbsp; the first question make a consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; ground of&nbsp;&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; petition unnecessary.<br><br>The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcio,&nbsp; Endencia,&nbsp; Barrera, </i> and <i>Gutierrez David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
