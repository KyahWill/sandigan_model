				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant&nbsp; ascribes&nbsp; error to&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Sulu court granting&nbsp; Lay Kock's&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for naturalization on three grounds, namely, (a) failure to file with the&nbsp; Bureau of Justice his&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; intention one&nbsp; year before applying for citizenship;&nbsp; (6) lack of the&nbsp; requisite moral qualification&nbsp; and&nbsp; of sincere disposition to adopt Filipino ways&nbsp; of&nbsp; life,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; incompetency of&nbsp; his&nbsp; character witnesses.<br><br>As to the first ground,&nbsp; the&nbsp; record shows&nbsp; presentation of this petition on July 27, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing, petitioner swore to having forwarded his declaration of&nbsp; intention&nbsp; "sometime in&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1953."&nbsp; The&nbsp; money&nbsp; order attached to such&nbsp; declaration bears the&nbsp; date July 2, 1953. As against this evidence&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor General&nbsp; points to the receipt issued by his&nbsp; office (dated August&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1953) acknowledging payment of the fees for filing petitioner's declaration.&nbsp; We&nbsp; think&nbsp; however that this is&nbsp; not positive proof of the date of filing of the&nbsp; declaration. It is true, the petitioner&nbsp; did not specify&nbsp; the date he forwarded in but such&nbsp; omission&nbsp; obviously resulted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the absence of objection&nbsp; on that specific ground in the&nbsp; trial court; indeed the&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; who&nbsp; handled&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposition,&nbsp; failed to cross-examine him for&nbsp; particulars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if "sometime in July" meant&nbsp; on or before July 27, 1953 the one year condition precedent had been complied with.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, if it meant any day afterwards (July 28-31) there would be a&nbsp; shortage of&nbsp; one&nbsp; to&nbsp; four days.&nbsp; Now, would such&nbsp; small&nbsp; difference&nbsp; be&nbsp; fatal?&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; deem&nbsp; it necessary to discuss&nbsp; this aspect, partly because it was not raised in the lower court—it could have been&nbsp; raised—and partly&nbsp; because&nbsp; although appellee's&nbsp; brief asserts&nbsp; that "factually the declaration was received in&nbsp; the Office of the Solicitor General on July 11, 1953, as its records&nbsp; show" we discover no denial of such assertion in&nbsp; the pleadings or memoranda subsequently submitted to this Court.<br><br>On the second ground, appellant quotes appellee's own admission of having married&nbsp; his wife simply&nbsp; because she was his mother's choice and&nbsp; of&nbsp; having&nbsp; left&nbsp; the&nbsp; former in China to take care of the latter.&nbsp; This goes to show, argues appellant, Lay&nbsp; Kock's unwillingness&nbsp; to&nbsp; discard Chinese in&nbsp; favor of local customs; and considering that he has&nbsp; not brought his wife here, and has stopped sending her support ever since the last war, he may not be&nbsp; deemed to have observed a proper&nbsp; and irreproachable conduct.<br><br>Yet even&nbsp; among Filipino there are wives who have been selected by&nbsp; their respective mothers-in-law and who lived with&nbsp; and cared for them.&nbsp; As to appellee's failure to bring his wife to&nbsp; this&nbsp; country or to send her&nbsp; support,&nbsp; he explained that<br><blockquote>"I went to China in 1947.&nbsp; My aim was to find out what happened to my mother and my&nbsp; wife but the town people told me&nbsp; that my mother&nbsp; died during the Japanese Occupation in China and afterwards my wife have evacuated but they did not know so&nbsp; I stayed only for a few months trying to find her but I could not locate her so I leave words to the people of that&nbsp; place to inform me if they happen to see my wife. * * *.&nbsp; And now in recent years even with the information I received from friends&nbsp; in Hongkong not long after that I sent a letter to my friends "but that letter "was never&nbsp; answered and so I gave up hope&nbsp; communicating with her.&nbsp; I wanted to communicate with&nbsp; her but&nbsp; I could not."</blockquote>It&nbsp; is urged as a&nbsp; third ground&nbsp; of objection that petitioner's witnesses were incompetent because they&nbsp; did not know&nbsp; him&nbsp; <i>since&nbsp; 1923</i> when&nbsp; he&nbsp; began&nbsp; residing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; One witness, it would seem, became&nbsp; his acquaintance in 1925 and the others in 1927.<br><br>Although the law&nbsp; requires the&nbsp; witnesses to&nbsp; state that they&nbsp; "personally know the petitioner to&nbsp; be a resident of the Philippines for the period of time&nbsp; required&nbsp; by this Act"&nbsp; (section 7) we have already interpreted this "period" to mean ten years before the petition, under section 2 or five years under section 3 of the Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the said witnesses were competent on that score.<br><br>If the argument however is addressed&nbsp; not to their competency&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare on petitioner's&nbsp; residence,&nbsp; but&nbsp; on&nbsp; the latter's conduct "during the entire period of his residence in the Philippines" under section&nbsp; 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> our&nbsp; comment&nbsp; is that one does not need to personally know another&nbsp; from&nbsp; the moment of the&nbsp; latter's birth or age of&nbsp; reason, to&nbsp; qualify as witness to his proper&nbsp; and law-abiding behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing records,&nbsp;&nbsp; common&nbsp; reputation&nbsp; and mutual&nbsp; friends and acquaintances are available sources of information.<br><br>The appealed decision sets forth in detail the&nbsp; circumstances disclosed&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; of&nbsp; this petition&nbsp; which show petitioner's&nbsp; possession of all the qualifications prescribed by the&nbsp; Naturalization Law.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the objections of the appellant appear to be without merit,&nbsp; the said decision should accordingly be affirmed; and it is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
