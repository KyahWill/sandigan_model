Moreover, the court&nbsp; added: "It is&nbsp; not within&nbsp; the province of this&nbsp; Court to direct the removal of the house in question because it will&nbsp; be tantamount to modifying the decision which&nbsp; is already&nbsp; final."</p><p>While the order of April 20, 1954,&nbsp; from which defendants desire to appeal, is final in&nbsp; character&nbsp; because&nbsp; "it finally disposes of&nbsp; the pending action so that nothing&nbsp; more can be&nbsp; done with&nbsp; it in the trial court" (Mejia <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Alimorong, 4 Phil.,&nbsp; 57?; Insular Government <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Segovia, 17 Phil., 487; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Makaraig,&nbsp; 54&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 904), and in&nbsp; this&nbsp; respect the trial court&nbsp; is in error,&nbsp; however, we are of the&nbsp; opinion that the appeal would have no useful purpose for it clearly appears that what is&nbsp; intended by defendants&nbsp; in&nbsp; their motion&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 16, 1953 is to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; an order for the removal of&nbsp; the house belonging to&nbsp; plaintiffs without any indemnity&nbsp; on their part contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; the precise terms of the dispositive part of&nbsp; the decision rendered on October 3, 1952 In said dispositive part it is expressly&nbsp; decreed that defendants can only&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; the house&nbsp; after paying&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding indemnity to&nbsp; the plaintiffs or to compel plaintiffs to&nbsp; pay the value of the&nbsp; land if defendants should so elect,&nbsp; except when such value is much greater than that of the house, in which case plaintiffs could be required to pay a reasonable rent for the occupation of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision also decrees that if the parties&nbsp; could not reach an understanding as to the value of the land&nbsp; or the house,&nbsp; commissioners of appraisal may&nbsp; be appointed for that purpose.&nbsp; Evidently, the motion of petitioners above adverted to tends&nbsp; to subvert the nature of this&nbsp; decision for which reason the trial&nbsp; court refused&nbsp; to give&nbsp; course to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; We hold that the lower&nbsp; court did not&nbsp; err in this respect. </p><p>Wherefore, the&nbsp; petition is denied, without pronouncement as to, costs. </p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
