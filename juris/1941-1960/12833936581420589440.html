				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Manila court of first instance, Philippine National Bank 
sued defendants to recover several sums of money specified in thirty-one
 causes of action.
  <p>  After the hearing, said court found that, in order to guarantee 
the repayment of loans, drafts and other credits obtained or to be 
obtained from Philippine National Bank, defendants executed, on May 4, 
1946 and March 26, 1947, two deeds of mortgage encumbering real estate 
located in Manila, Quezon City and Rizal province; and that on various 
dates, they, or Yu Bon Chiong the principal debtor (the other defendants
 being solidary co-debtors) became indebted to Philippine National Bank 
on account of drafts, credits on current account, or letters of credit 
for certain sums which shall not be detailed here, there being no 
question in this appeal concerning the amount of liability nor the 
maturity dates of the corresponding instruments of credit.</p>
  <p>  The principal issue raised here, which defendants tendered in the
 trial court is the prematureness of plaintiff's suit for collection. 
Defendants alleged plaintiff had agreed to postpone recovery of the 
debts until after the defendant Yu Bon Chiong shall have won his lawsuit
 against certain insurance companies. The lower court, however, found 
there was no definite agreement with the Bank as to such postponement. 
The transcript of the stenographic notes taken at the trial not only 
confirms this finding but definitely shows that Yu Bon Chion's request 
for extension of the time for payment was rejected by the Bank.</p>
  <p>  In view of the amount received and paid, and the sums overdue in 
defendants' credit accounts with the Bank, the Manila court ordered 
defendants to pay plaintiff jointly and severally, </p>

  <p>    Said court likewise ordered that upon defendants' failure to 
pay the amounts stated within ninety days, the mortgaged properties  
shall be sold at public auction by the sheriff, the proceeds to be 
applied to the satisfaction of the judgment.</p>
  <p>    Without questioning the different amounts of credit, the 
appellants argue as a secondary issue, that 7% attorneys' fees is 
excessive, because it would require them to pay about P21,000.00 to the 
attorney who handled the case who was an employee of the Bank itself, 
apart from the fact that the trial involved no hard work, it having 
lasted about nine hours in three sessions, and the issue being a simple 
one û whether or not an extension had been granted.</p>
  <p>    In reply, the Bank points to appellants' written agreement to 
pay 10% attorneys' fees should collection be enforced by suit; it 
further avers the trial court acted quite liberally in reducing such 
fees to 7%. Bearing in mind the circumstances above mentioned, we think a
 5% fee should be enough, in this matter, we modify the court's 
decision.</p>
  <p>    It should be stated, at this juncture, that this appeal was at 
first transmitted to the Court of Appeals. But having realized that the 
amount in litigation exceeded P200,000.00, said court forwarded it to 
us. While the record was there, Uy Liam Chin alias Ong Ho, one of the 
defendants, requested for suspension of this case, alleging he had filed
 in the Manila court of first instance an action (Civil Case No. 33231) 
to annul the mortgage and to free himself from liability therefor 
because his signature had been forged, and alleging further that he had 
not been summoned and had not appeared herein through counsel. The Court
 of Appeals denied the request. Here Ong Ho reiterates this suspension 
request. Like the appellate court, we see no good reason to stop 
disposition of this appeal, the presumption being that the attorney who 
appeared for all the defendants was duly authorized. (Rule 127, sec. 
21.)</p>
  <p>    At any rate, Ong Ho may repeat this request in the lower court 
before execution of the judgment, should he have won a favorable verdict
 in said Civil Case No. 33251 or should he be able to convince the lower
 court of the truth of his allegations. The said court might, in its 
discretion, suspend execution as against him, considering that the 
responsibility of the defendants is joint and several, and that the 
plaintiff may, if it so desires, levy execution on the other defendants 
in the meantime.</p>
  <p>    Modified as to the attorneys' fees, the appealed judgment is 
affirmed. So ordered.</p>
