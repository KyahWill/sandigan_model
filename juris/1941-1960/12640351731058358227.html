				<H3>FREDERICK L. WORCESTER, PETITIONER, VS. RAMON LORENZANA, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is  an appeal by  certiorari  from  a judgment  of the Court of Appeals. <br><br>It appears  that the  appellant Frederick L. Worcester was the owner of  a piece of real  estate known as "La Cumbre de Guadalupe", situated  in San  Pedro,  Makati, Rizal,  which, in July, 1950, was sold by him to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila  through the mediation  of a broker named Benito V. Jalbuena. Claiming credit for having negotiated and brought about  the sale,  another broker, the herein appellee Ramon Lorenzana, asked Worcester  to pay him his brokerage commission and, upon the demand being refused, he brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila  to recover  commission and moral  damages.  Worcester  contested  the suit,  characterized its filing as "malicious  and unjustified",  and set up a counterclaim for actual and moral damages.  Replying to the counterclaim, Lorenzana  denied  its allegations and on his part set up a claim for  moral damages suffered on account thereof. <br><br>It also appears that once the suit was filed, Lorenzana had attachment levied on property belonging to Worcester upon  verified  petition  that the latter  was disposing  of his properties with the intent to  defraud him.   But the attachment was discharged upon the filing of the  required bond. <br><br>After trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila found Lorenzana  not entitled  to  any commission  and  rendered judgment dismissing his complaint and, on the other hand, awarding Worcester,  on  his  counterclaim, P5,895.80 as compensatory  damages  and P1,000.00 as  moral  damages. On appeal to the Court of Appeals, that court upheld the judgment of dismissal but revoked the award of damages. Protesting against the revocation of  the award, Worcester brought the case here on  appeal by  certiorari. <br><br>It  would  appear that the  award of damages in the Court  of First  Instance was based on the theory that plaintiff's action was clearly unfounded and that plaintiff was not entitled to the attachment of defendant's property. <br><br>After going  over  the record, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the award  of  damages to defendant was unwarranted. That court found from the evidence  that defendant had  placed  his property for sale  in the hands of  several brokers, among them  plaintiff himself  and Benito V. Jalbuena,  without giving any of them exclusive authority to sell,  but "on  a  winner  take  all basis",  by which it  was  meant  that  "the broker who could close the deal and sell  the property would receive the whole commission of 5%" which  defendant  had agreed  to pay; that once defendant had engaged  plaintiff's services  on that basis, plaintiff was able to interest the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila  as a prospective buyer to the extent of  having His Grace promise  that he would  study  the offer  of sale and inspect the property;  that though  he was informed  of  this development,   "defendant did  not then revoke the authority he had given plaintiff, but  allowed  the latter to  proceed with the  negotiations";  that informed  several days later by broker Jalbuena  that  he too had found a prospective buyer, who wag no other than the Archbishop of Manila, and seeing  that "plaintiff's and Mr. Jalbuena's prospects were the same,  the  defendant advised Mr. Jalbuena  that the plaintiff was ahead of him for about a week, and so he would be given a chance to close  the  deal"; that to this "Jalbuena agreed" and "the defendant communicated this  incident to  the  plaintiff"; that notwithstanding this fact, defendant, some time later, instructed plaintiff  to withdraw the  offer he  had made to the Archbishop and then got in touch  with Jalbuena and instructed  him  to proceed with his negotiations with His Grace;  that proceeding as instructed, Jalbuena was able to secure a definite offer from the Archbishop, which defendant accepted; that defendant  then  instructed  his lawyers to prepare  the necessary deed of sale, and upon the deed  being signed, the purchase  price paid and  the transaction  consummated,  defendant paid  Jalbuena his commission and thereafter left for Jamaica.   On the basis of these facts  the  Court  of Appeals ruled that plaintiff was not entitled to a  commission  on the  theory that  it was Jalbuena and not he "who was the  efficient procuring cause of the sale in question."   But that court also found that plaintiff's suit was not clearly unfounded and was not filed in bad faith.   It says:<br><blockquote>* * * The present  action  is not clearly unfounded. It is admitted that the appellant was engaged by the appellee to sell the property in question, and that he was the first to offer the property to the Archbishop of Manila, to  whom he wrote a letter containing the offer to sfell with a  detailed description  thereof, and  whom he interviewed several times for the  purpose. The appellant  is not a lawyer. He is not supposed  to know the intricacies of the law which regulates broker's commission in this jurisdiction.  Such being the case, it is not improbable that he believed in good faith that, as he had intervened, with proper authority, in  the  sale  of the property in  question, he was entitled to a commission  for its sale. In bringing this action, therefore, it cannot be held that  he acted in gross and evident bad faith."</blockquote> We  agree to this finding, for  it is obvious that plaintiff did really have some intervention in the sale to  the  extent and under circumstances  which might  lead an ordinary person to  believe in good faith  that he  was entitled  to a commission. <br><br>Defendant makes capital  of  the  fact  that the reply  to his counter-claim was  in the form of  a general  denial, which, according to him,  constitutes an  admission  of the averment  in  said  counter-claim  that  he  had incurred damages  as a  consequence of the  "malicious and unjustified" institution of the present action.  But while the rule is that the material  allegations in the complaint  other than those as to the amount of damages shall be deemed admitted when not specifically denied (section 8, Rule 9), it is to be noted that the counterclaim for damages  in the present  case is based  on the supposition  that plaintiff's action was "malicious  and  unjustified",  which  is a mere conclusion unsupported by the facts alleged in the counter-claim and which the Court of Appeals, as already stated, found to be without basis.  Needless to say, that conclusion cannot be deemed admitted even when not specifically denied. <br><br>With respect  to  the  premium on defendant's  bond for the lifting of the attachment, the Court of Appeals found and it is not disputed that  defendant at  the time this action was instituted was disposing of all  his properties in the Philippines, and this  fact  was known to plaintiff. Consequently,  we agree with the Court of  Appeals that plaintiff's action in seeking the  attachment  of defendant's property  was justified.  We  may add that,  as already stated, plaintiff  acted in good  faith and "this circumstance is fatal  to any award for damages."   (Beige et al.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Walter Bull &amp; Co., 84 Phil., 164; 47 Off .Gaz. 138). <br><br>There is nothing to  the contention that as plaintiff in his appeal to  the Court of Appeals did not present any argument in support of  the  setting aside  of the award of damages, that court erred  in so doing.  It is admitted that  plaintiff  in  his  brief  before that appellate  court, assigned  as errors the award of damages  by  the trial court, and even if they were not  properly argued, as claimed by defendant, the fact  remains that the Court of Appeals considered them.  It is well-settled  that the appellate  court,  at its  option, may determine  question not raised by appellant in his brief.  (Moran's Rules of Court, Vol. I, 1957 ed.; p. 738.) <br><br>In view of  the foregoing,  the judgment  appealed  from is affirmed, with costs  against  the petitioner. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
