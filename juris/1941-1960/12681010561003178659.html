				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The case concerns a proposed modification of a final judgment. The 
earnestness with which the petition is maintained will be our excuse for making 
this decision more lengthy than the nature of the case in other circumstances 
would warrant.
<p>Patricio Contreras and Jerusalem Gingco brought a suit against the China 
Banking Corporation, Inc., and Juan V. Molina and Teodora Arenas, husband and 
wife, to annul a mortgage executed by the spouses in favor of the Bank and to 
recover damages. The Court of First Instance of Manila, the Honorable Jose O. 
Vera presiding, absolved the Bank and condemned the other two defendants to pay 
various amounts in various concepts with certain deductions. The lower court's 
judgment in full is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Por los hechos y razones expuestos, se dicta decision en esta causa, 
declarando:</p>
<p>"(1) Que la hipoteca otorgada a favor de The China Banking Corporation es 
valida, pues el banco obro de buena fe;</p>
<p>"(2) Condenando a Juan V. Molina y Teodora Arenas a pagar a Jerusalem Gingco 
en concepto de indemnizacion de daños y perjuicios la cantidad de P2,000;</p>
<p>"(3) Obligando a los conyuges Juan V. Molina y Teodora Arenas a pagar la 
deuda hipotecaria al banco The China Banking Corporation a fin de que las 
accesorias y las dos puertas adicionales no tengan gravamen alguno. Si no lo 
hacen dentro de treinta dias despues de quedar firme esta sentencia, Jerusalem 
Gingco puede hacer ese rescate, cargando la deuda hipotecaria a cuenta de Juan 
V. Molina y Teodora Arenas, pudiendo incluirse en la ejecucion que se expida en 
esta causa el cobro de lo que Jerusalem Gingco pague al banco por dicha 
hipoteca;</p>
<p>"(4) Del credito de Jerusalem Gingco contra Juan V. Molina y Teodora Arenas 
de P4,836.31 en la causa No. 44960, se debe deducir el exceso de lo pagado por 
Teodora Arenas en la subasta publica que hubo con motivo de la ejecucion 
expedida en la causa No. 36669. Dicho exceso es de P576.25, que se debe deducir 
de los P4,836.31.</p>
<p>"(5) Que los conyuges Juan V. Molina y Teodora Arenas paguen a Jerusalem 
Gingco P2,520 por los alquileres de las dos puertas adicionales a razon de P30 
mensuales (P15 por puerta), correspondiente al periodo del 4 de Septiembre de 
1934 al 4 de Septiembre de 1941. Desde esta ultima fecha, dichos demandados 
deberan pagar a Jerusalem Gingco P30 mensuales hasta que dichas puertas 
adicionales sean entregadas a su propietaria Jerusalem Gingco.</p>
<p>"(6) Los demandantes, tan pronto hayan cobrado algo de los demandados Juan V. 
Molina y Teodora Arenas, deben pagar los derechos de escribania por esta 
causa.</p>
<p>"(7) Se condena a Juan V. Molina y a Teodora Arenas a pagar las costas del 
presente juicio."</p></blockquote>
<p>From that judgment, the plaintiffs appealed, but not any of the defendants. 
The parts of the decision to which the plaintiffs took exception were thus 
specified in the notice of appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) En cuanto declara valida la hipoteca otorgada por los demandados 
Juan V. Molina y Teodora Arenas a favor de su codemandada The China Banking 
Corporation, y al no condenar a esta a pagar indemnizacion a los 
demandantes.</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) En cuanto declara que, si los demandados Molinas dejaren de pagar 
su deuda hipotecaria al Banco demandado a fin de que las accesorias en cuestion 
esten libres de toda carga y gravamen, la demandante Jerusalem Gingco puede 
hacer el rescate, pudiendo incluirse en la ejecucion que se expida en esta causa 
el cobro de lo que esta pague al Banco por dicha hipoteca y,</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) En cuanto declara que, el credito de Jerusalem Gingco contra los 
demandados Molinas a cuenta del importe de la sentencia en el asunto civil No. 
44960 era solamente de P4,836.31 en vez de P6,951.31."</p></blockquote>
<p>In due time this court rendered judgment couched in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For all the foregoing, the deed of mortgage dated November 8, 1930, is 
declared null and void as to the one-half of the mortgaged property belonging to 
Jerusalem Gingco and rescinded as to the remaining one-half belonging to the 
spouses Molina, and the appealed decision is modified by ordering all the 
defendants to pay Jerusalem Gingco the amount of P6,951.31, plus the additional 
amount of P30 monthly from September 4, 1934, to September 4, 1941, and to 
continue paying the same monthly amount thereafter until the two new doors of 
the <i>accesoria</i> in question are delivered to said Jerusalem Gingco. The 
defendants shall also pay the filing fees of the complaint in the lower court 
and the costs in both instances." (Contreras and Gingco <i>vs</i>. China Banking 
Corporation, 76 Phil., 709, 716, 717.)</p></blockquote>
<p>After this judgment was entered, the case was sent back to the lower court 
and execution was issued. The sheriff at first undertook to collect from the 
China Banking Corporation one-half of the judgment, upon the indication, it is 
claimed, of the plaintiffs' attorney, but objection by the bank having been 
filed with the court, the Honorable Alfonso Felix, judge, one of the respondents 
herein, ordered that the portion of the judgment due from this defendant was 
only one-third. The latter amount was later paid by the bank and turned over to, 
and receipted for by, the plaintiffs' counsel. It so happened that the other 
defendants were insolvent, whereupon the execution creditors asked for an alias 
execution against the bank for the unpaid balance of the judgment. That motion 
was denied and the present petition for <i>mandamus</i> was the off-shoot.</p>
<p>It was contended below, and it is contended here, that the act of the bank 
was tortuous and falls under the provision of article 1902 of the Civil Code so 
that its liability is joint and several.</p>
<p>There is no dispute, and it can be said with confidence, that the China 
Banking Corporation's liability under the terms of the judgment of this court is 
merely joint, joint in the sense in which the word is understood in the civil 
law, "It is already a well-established doctrine in this jurisdiction that, when 
it is not provided in a judgment that the defendants are liable to pay jointly 
and severally a certain sum of money, none of them may be compelled to satisfy 
in full said judgments." (Oriental Commercial Co. <i>vs</i>. Abeto and Mabanag, 
60 Phil., 723, citing De Leon <i>vs</i>. Nepomuceno and De Jesus, 37 Phil., 180, 
and Sharruf <i>vs</i>. Tayabas Land Co. and Ginainati, 37 Phil., 655.) That 
ruling is in entire harmony with articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>Under that doctrine the lower court has no legal authority under any 
circumstances to make the change sought by the plaintiffs; and this court itself 
may not make the change after the judgment has become executory. According to 
that decision a mistake such as that here alleged, if it be a mistake, is not 
clerical; it goes to the very substance of the controversy.</p>
<p>Only clerical errors, or mistakes or omissions plainly due to inadvertence or 
negligence may be corrected or supplied after the judgment has been entered. 
"The power of courts to correct clerical errors and misprisions and to make the 
record speak the truth by nunc pro tunc amendments after the term does not 
enable them to change their judgments in substance or in any material respect. 
Consequently it is well settled that, in the absence of statute permitting it; 
the law does not authorize the correction of judicial errors, however flagrant 
and glaring they may be, under the pretense of correcting clerical errors." (1 
Freeman on Judgments, pp. 269-271.)</p>
<p>"The general power to correct clerical errors and omissions does not 
authorize the court to repair its own inaction, to make the record and judgment 
say what the court did not adjudge, although it had a clear right to do so. The 
court cannot under the guise of correcting its record put upon it an order or 
judgment it never made or rendered, or add something to either which was not 
originally included although it might and should have so ordered or adjudged in 
the first instance. It cannot thus repair its own lapses and omissions to do 
what it could legally and properly have done at the right time. A court's 
mistake in leaving out of its decision something which it ought to have put in, 
and something in issue of which it intended but failed to dispose, is a judicial 
error, not a mere clerical misprision, and cannot be corrected by adding to the 
entered judgment the omitted matter on the theory of making the entry conform to 
the actual judgment rendered." (<i>Id</i>., p. 273.)</p>
<p>Slight reflection will show the wisdom of this rule. The necessity of giving 
finality to judgments that are not void is self-evident. The interests of 
society impose it. The opposing view might make litigation "more unendurable 
than the wrongs it is intended to redress." It would create doubt, real or 
imaginary, and controversy would constantly arise as to what the judgment or 
order was. As this court has announced, "public policy and sound practice demand 
that, at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final 
at some definite date fixed by the law. The very object for which courts were 
instituted was to put an end to controversies." (Layda <i>vs</i>. Legazpi, 39 
Phil., 83; Dy Cay <i>vs</i>. Crossfield &amp; O'Brien, 38 Phil., 521.)</p>
<p>We have no cause to depart from this rule. It is a rule that must be adhered 
to regardless of any possible injustice in a particular case. It is not a legal 
concept of the flexible kind, capable of being individualized to meet the needs 
of varying conditions. "We have to subordinate the equity of a particular 
situation to the overmastering need" of certainty and immutability of judicial 
pronouncements. The loss to the litigants in particular and to society in 
general "would in the long run be greater than the gain if judges were clothed 
with power to revise" their decisions at will. "Perhaps, with a higher 
conception" of the administration of justice and its needs, "the time will come 
when even revision will be permitted if revision is in consonance with 
established standards" of court functions, "but the time is not yet."</p>
<p>It would be tedious to give illustrations of clerical mistakes, errors and 
omissions, correction of which might be permitted. It suffices for the purpose 
of this decision to say that the mistake under consideration, if it be a 
mistake, is not of the apparent exceptions, at least in this jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In truth, there is no proper and sufficient showing here that the alleged 
mistake was due to inadvertence on the part of the court. We have been through 
with the decision and have not detected in it any clear purpose or intention to 
make the defendants jointly and severally liable. In all probability, the nature 
of defendants' liability (whether joint or joint and several) was not touched 
upon at all by the parties and was not even given thought by them or by the 
court. The point was involved in obscurity. As the judgment of the lower court 
plainly indicates, the case was very intricate, complicated by a multiplicity of 
claims and counterclaims arising from different juridical acts and sought from 
different parties who sustained diverse relationships to the plaintiffs and to 
each other with reference to the separate items. It is not to be wondered at if 
the finer point of solidarity among the defendants was swallowed up and lost in 
the maze of these claims and counterclaims over the validity of which the 
three-cornered contest was centered and bitterly waged. The uncontroverted facts 
alone are so complex that more than one close reading of either decision is 
needed to get a comprehensive grasp of them.</p>
<p>The fact that the plaintiffs' attorney instructed the sheriff to levy 
execution on the bank for only one-half of the judgment, when it could have 
demanded the whole amount from that entity if its liability was joint and 
several, offers itself as possible proof that in the mind of the petitioners 
themselves this defendant was to bear only a <i>pro-rata</i> share of the 
indebtedness. In other words, if the bank's liability, in plaintiffs' opinion, 
was solidary, they had the option to exact the payment of the entire amount due 
from any of the defendants, subject to the right of the payor to collect from 
the others their proportionate shares of the obligation. It would seem that the 
plaintiffs became wise to the question of solidarity among the defendants only 
when the matter of whether the bank should pay one-half or one-third of the 
judgment came before the court below.</p>
<p>It is said that the judgment is at variance with the context of the decision. 
Granting this for the moment to be the case, yet the discrepancy pointed out is 
not of the nature that would justify modification of the judgment. The 
principles we have cited in the preceding paragraphs should put this matter at 
rest. More to the point is another well-recognized doctrine, that the final 
judgment as rendered is the judgment of the court irrespective of all seemingly 
contrary statements in the decision. "A judgment must be distinguished from an 
opinion. The latter is the informal expression of the views of the court and 
cannot prevail against its final order or decision. While the two may be 
combined in one instrument, the opinion forms no part of the judgment. So, * * * 
there is a distinction between the findings and conclusions of a court and its 
judgment. While they may constitute its decision and amount to the rendition of 
a judgment, they are not the judgment itself. They amount to nothing more than 
an order for judgment, which must, of course, be distinguished from the 
judgment." (1 Freeman on Judgments, p. 6.) At the root of the doctrine that the 
premises must yield to the conclusion is perhaps, side by side with the needs of 
writing finis to litigations, the recognition of the truth that "the trained 
intuition of the judge continually leads him to right results for which he is 
puzzled to give unimpeachable legal reasons." "It is an everyday experience of 
those who study judicial decisions that the results are usually sound, whether 
the reasoning from which the results purport to flow is sound or not." (The 
Theory of Judicial Decision, Pound, 36 Harv. Law Review, pp. 9, 51.) It is not 
infrequent that the grounds of a decision fail to reflect the exact views of the 
court, especially those of concurring justices in a collegiate court. We often 
encounter in judicial decisions, lapses, findings, loose statements and 
generalities which do not bear on the issues or are apparently opposed to the 
otherwise sound and considered result reached by the court as expressed in the 
dispositive part, so called, of the decision.</p>
<p>But is there really any conflict between the considerations or findings and 
the judgment of this court? It appears that the sole reliance of the petitioners 
is on the statement in the decision, <i>viz</i>.: that "the assignment of error 
is also well taken" and that "the China Banking Corporation must answer for the 
amounts above-mentioned as a consequence of our conclusion as to the nullity of 
the mortgage." That statement had reference to the second assignment of error 
which complained, in the words of this court, of the trial court's "failure to 
order the China Banking Corporation to indemnify Jerusalem Gingco in the amount 
of P6,951.31, which was adjudicated in her favor in Civil Case No. 44960 of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, and which appellant failed to collect in view 
of the third-party claim filed by said bank, and the rents which said appellant 
failed to collect from <i>accesorias</i> Nos. 1635, 1630 (1637) and 1639 at the 
rate of P65 a month, beginning from September 4, 1934." That comment and the 
second assignment of error did not exhibit any intention, let alone plain 
intention, to hold the China Banking Corporation liable <i>in solido</i>. The 
idea of solidarity is no more manifest than the idea of mere joint liability 
among the co-obligors. If there was any intention to make the defendants' 
obligation under the judgment solidary, it is not apparent from the language 
employed. If there was inadvertence on the part of the court, the omission was 
not so obvious as to justify rectification. Nowhere in the decision is there any 
reference to article 1902 of the Civil Code, or unequivocal declaration that 
each of the defendants was bound to the performance or payment of the entire 
judgment.</p>
<p>Even if the liability of the bank arose from tort and is <i>in solido</i>, it 
is now too late to enforce that liability in the manner specified in the 
applicable provisions. When a claim or demand has been put in suit and has 
passed on to final judgment, it is merged and swallowed up in the judgment and 
loses its vitality. All the particular qualities of the claim are merged in the 
judgment. And this rule applies to all claims or demand. (34 C. J., 752, 754.) 
In another connection this court has ruled: "It is of no consequence that * * * 
the obligation contracted by the sureties was joint and several in character. 
The final judgment, which superseded the action brought for the enforcement of 
said contract, declared the obligation to be merely joint, and the same cannot 
be executed otherwise." (Oriental Commercial Co. <i>vs</i>. Abeto and Mabanag, 
<i>supra</i>.) It is immaterial, therefore, whether the obligation of the 
defendants arose from law, contract or <i>culpa</i>. It is "the final judgment 
(that) determines and is the source of the rights and obligations of the parties 
* * *." (Oriental Commercial Co. <i>vs</i>. Abeto and Mabanag, 
<i>supra</i>.)</p>
<p>Emphasis is also laid on the fact that the spouses Molina and Arenas did not 
appeal. The petitioners advance the proposition that since these defendants did 
not appeal they were excluded from the appellate court's jurisdiction. They go 
so far as to insinuate or say that the China Banking Corporation alone is 
answerable for the judgment rendered by this court The position thus taken by 
the petitioners is highly untenable and inconsistent with their main thesis.</p>
<p>If Molina and Arenas did not question the trial court's decision, the 
plaintiffs did appeal from the judgment, not as it affected the bank only but 
also the other defendants. The notice of appeal will show that the plaintiffs 
opened up, among other questions, that of the extent of Molina's and his wife's 
liability to the plaintiffs as well as the bank's. The bank did not appeal 
either, for that matter, but it was condemned nevertheless. That Molina and his 
wife did not appear and Ale a brief in this court did not operate to rule them 
out of the case. The best refutation of the petitioners' contention is the fact 
that the amounts which Molina and his wife were sentenced to pay by the court 
below were increased by this court.</p>
<p>The authorities cited by the petitioners do not shed any light on this issue. 
It can be seen at a glance that there is no analogy between this case and the 
cases relied upon by counsel.</p>
<p>There is one feature of the case affecting the question of practice and 
procedure which should not be allowed to escape our attention.</p>
<p>A motion for reconsideration styled "Motion for Clarification" was presented 
in this court before the present petition was docketed. That motion was denied 
on the grounds that clarification was unnecessary and that the judgment had 
become final. (This, by way of parenthesis, may be said to mirror the concept 
which this court had of the alleged error; namely, that the error, if it be 
error, was of judicial and not clerical character.) By the motion for an alias 
execution the petitioners were after exactly the same thing that we had refused 
to grant them. They simply turned around and took a circuitous and narrower path 
that led to the same goal. By appealing from the lower court's denial to issue 
an alias execution, the plaintiffs now try to obtain by indirection what they 
failed to get directly. The procedure is indeed anomalous and success of the 
petition would lead to anomalous consequences. How?</p>
<ol><li>"It is well settled that a decision concurred in by the entire bench cannot 
be modified, except on regular reconsideration." (5 C. J. S., 1485.) The change 
the petitioners would have us make would constitute modification of the 
judgment; they would have a new matter of substance inserted therein. This 
matter—that the bank's liability is not joint but solidary—was not put in issue 
in the original case and there does not appear to have been any hearing or 
voting on this specific point. This matter goes to the merits, and hearing and 
voting thereon can properly be had only by going into the whole record of the 
main case. On the other hand, adequate study of the whole case can not be 
accomplished except on a regular motion for reconsideration such as the one we 
dismissed. In other words, for the purpose of modifying the judgment the 
proceeding must be direct and not, like the present proceeding, collateral. 
Direct proceeding on a regular motion for reconsideration would be all the more 
necessary, if the motion for amendment were to be entertained, because some of 
the justices who signed the decision have resigned and the new members who have 
taken their places did not have the benefit of hearing the arguments and going 
over the pleadings and evidence. The scope of our authority on a petition for 
mandamus, which is a special proceeding, is limited to an examination of the 
allegations therein and in the answer, and perhaps of the decision of this 
court, which was not attached to as part of the, petition. Under such petition 
the pleadings, the evidence and the briefs in the main cause are not legally 
brought before us. Quite apart from this technical barrier, the record of the 
case has actually been returned to the court of origin. 

<p></p></li><li>Granting of the petition for mandamus would not be an amendment by this 
court of its decision. In form, it would be a command to the court below to do 
as the petitioners asked. In its implications, it would be a sanction for 
inferior courts, in the process of execution, to change judgments of courts of 
superior jurisdiction in the light of what they believe is the intention of the 
higher court as gathered from statements in the body of the decision. It would 
be taken as a green-light signal for inferior courts to probe into the decisions 
of superior courts to verify if the judgment conforms to the text. The result of 
such practice would be intolerable. That the lower court's decision might be 
appealable would not remedy the situation greatly. In the present case there 
would be the added paradox that we would reverse the lower court for refusing to 
allow precisely what this court itself—the author of the decision which was in 
the best position to say what the decision meant—denied because the judgment was 
clear and had acquired finality.</li></ol><p></p> <p>For the foregoing considerations, the 
petition is denied without costs.</p>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em></div>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.:</strong></p>I concur with reluctance in the opinion of 
the majority. I say with reluctance, because I am convinced that the liability 
of the respondent bank is several (solidaria). It was the bank, as mortgagee, 
that caused the failure of the petitioner Jerusalem Gingco to collect the money 
judgment in civil case No. 44960 of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
because of its third party claim filed with the sheriff. That liability is 
tortious and not contractual as far as the petitioner Jerusalem Gingco is 
concerned; and for that reason, the liability arising therefrom is exclusively 
of the bank. Even assuming that the mortgage was valid, a mere mortgagee is not 
entitled to file a third party claim, because it is only title to, or right to 
possession of, the property levied upon execution that gives a party the right 
to file such claim (section 451, Act No. 190; section 15 Rule 39), and because 
the real right of the mortgagee is always protected and secured, if validly 
executed and registered, against subsequent claims and levies upon execution. I 
am also persuaded that the responsibility of the spouses Juan B. Molina and 
Teodora Arenas is of one party and not of two, so that if by the terms of the 
judgment the liability is joint (mancomunada), the bank's share of the 
responsibility must be one-half and not one-third. Nevertheless, I cannot but 
give my assent to the principles enunciated in the opinion of the majority, for 
there must be an end to a litigation, and the respondent court, when executing a 
final judgment, must strictly adhere to its terms. The respondent court is not 
authorized to construe a judgment by resorting to other parts of the decision 
upon which such judgment is premised. While I regret the unfortunate result for 
the petitioners, the benefits, however, to be derived from the observance of the 
sound rules set forth in the opinion of the majority more than offset the wrong 
intended to be remedied or redressed.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Many years ago, giving expression to a concept of profound wisdom, Mr. 
Justice Cardozo said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The law has outgrown its primitive stage of formalism when the precise word 
was the sovereign talisman, and every slip was fatal. It takes a broader view 
today." (Wood <i>vs</i>. Lucy, New York.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The present case shows a backward overleaping on the new concept chiseled by 
Mr. Justice Cardozo with unsurpassed mastery. The decision of this case offers a 
conclusive evidence of the need of rediscovering the legal truth already 
revealed in the above quotation.</p>
<p>Only because the stringent and unyielding verbal formula of "jointly and 
severally" has not been used, the victim of a fraud is unjustly deprived of 
two-thirds of the indemnity due her for the damages suffered. Because the 
hieratic words of the exorcismal shibboleth were omitted in a decision, full 
responsibility cannot be exacted from the perpetrator of the fraud, who is to be 
relieved and exempted from paying two-thirds of the damages caused. Again we are 
under the magic spell of the sovereign talisman of the precise word. Under its 
restored regime, while the victim of a fraud is made to suffer, the scoundrel is 
happily rewarded. Verbal rigidity burkes right and enthrones wrong. The 
hierograph of exorcism sanctifies fraud and smothers the claims of fairness, 
justice and equity.</p>
<p>Emancipation from the shackles of empty formalism is an enterprise that 
imposes new duties to the judiciary. That enterprise should be undertaken if 
many failures of justice are to be avoided. The system of justice by mantras 
belongs to the past. Right or wrong should not be judged upon the charm of a 
syllable or a group of syllables, as the Hindus would synthesize the triple 
constitution of the cosmos, the Absolute, the Relative and the relation between 
them, in the single sound of om. Words are not geometrical figures by which 
right or wrong may be measured with mathematical inflexibility. They are 
manifestations of life, and life is never geometrical, algebraic or 
mathematical. The law rules human relations, and human relations are expressed 
and manifested with infinite variety incompatible with the fixity of ritualistic 
words.</p>
<p>In the case of Contreras and Gingco <i>vs</i>. China Banking Corporation, the 
Second Division of the Supreme Court rendered on May 25, 1946, a decision 
declaring without effect the deed of mortgage, dated November 8, 1930, executed 
by defendant spouses Juan B. Molina and Teodora Arenas, in favor of their 
co-defendant, the China Banking Corporation and ordering "all the defendants to 
pay Jerusalem Gingco the amount of P6,951.31, plus the additional amount of P30 
monthly from September 4, 1934, to September 4, 1941, and to continue paying the 
same monthly amount thereafter until the two new doors of the <i>accesoria</i> 
in question are delivered to said Jerusalem Gingco." (76 Phil., 709, 716, 
717.)</p>
<p>Spouses Arcadio Gingco and Dolores Contreras were the owners of two 
<i>accesorias</i> made of strong materials located at Sande St., Tondo, Manila. 
On June 23, 1928, Dolores Contreras died, leaving as her only heirs her husband 
and their daughter Jerusalem Gingco. On November 6, 1928, the widower sold the 
<i>accesorias</i> to defendants Juan B. Molina and Teodora Arenas. On June 24, 
1930, action was instituted against the buyers for the annulment of the sale, 
and on August 22, 1930, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered decision 
declaring the sale null and void as to one-half of the <i>accesorias</i> which 
belong to Jerusalem Gingco.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding said decision, on November 8, 1930, defendants Juan B. Molina 
and Teodora Arenas mortgaged the two <i>accesorias</i> in favor of the China 
Banking Corporation to answer for a loan of P2,000. The deed of mortgage was 
drawn and executed in the law office of Attys. Feria and La O, who were the 
attorneys of the China Banking Corporation and at the same time were the 
attorneys who represented Juan B. Molina and Teodora Arenas in the case in which 
the Court of First Instance of Manila declared null and void the sale of 
one-half of the <i>accesorias</i> in question belonging to Jerusalem Gingco. At 
the time of the execution of the deed of mortgage, the decision was not yet 
final, because it was appealed, but it did soon become final and executory with 
the withdrawal of the appeals on December 29, 1930.</p>
<p>In another case, on February 28, 1934, Jerusalem Gingco secured from the 
Court of First Instance of Manila a decision ordering the spouses Molina to pay 
her the amount of P4,836.31, one-half of the rents of the <i>accesorias</i> 
pertaining to Jerusalem Gingco and collected by the spouses Molina, plus rents 
the defendants may continue collecting on the property from November, 1933. The 
decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court on May 10, 1935. To make said amounts 
effective, execution was issued and the sheriff announced a public auction of 
one-half of the <i>accesorias</i> belonging to the spouses Molina. The public 
auction was stopped because the China Banking Corporation, represented by Attys. 
Feria and La O, the same representing the spouses Molina, filed a third party 
claim, thus defeating the collection by Jerusalem Gingco of the several thousand 
pesos ordered by final decision to be paid to her by the spouses Molina.</p>
<p>One of the grounds for our decision, which was concurred in by Mr. Justice M. 
H. de Joya, Mr. Justice Emilio Y. Hilado, and Mr. Justice Cesar Bengzon, to 
declare null and void and rescind the deed of mortgage executed on November 8, 
1930, by the spouses Molina in favor of the China Banking Corporation, was that 
the said mortgage was fraudulent, both parties in the contract of mortgage 
having been equally guilty of the fraud. Even Mr. Justice Ozaeta, who dissented 
from the rescission of the mortgage with respect to one-half of the property 
belonging to the spouses Molina, concurred with our conclusion that with respect 
to one-half of the property belonging to Jerusalem Gingco the mortgage has been 
executed "in bad faith." The China Banking Corporation cannot escape from this 
pronouncement because at the time the mortgage was negotiated and executed, the 
bank was represented by the same attorneys who were representing the spouses 
Molina and in the very case where the decision intended to be defeated by the 
mortgage was rendered, and it was in their law office where the fraudulent deed 
of mortgage was drafted and signed.</p>
<p>As Jerusalem Gingco was unable to collect from the spouses Molina the amount 
of P6.951.31 and other amounts mentioned in our decision, because of the third 
party claim filed by the China Banking Corporation on the strength of the 
fraudulent mortgage, there should not be any doubt that the China Banking 
Corporation is fully responsible for said amounts in favor of Jerusalem Gingco. 
The responsibility of said bank cannot be affected, increased or diminished, 
upon the character of the responsibility of the spouses Molina or their ability 
to pay said amounts. The responsibility of the bank is independent from the 
responsibility of the spouses Molina. Each one of the parties to a fraud is 
solidarity answerable for all the harms and damages caused by the fraud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another by his fault or 
negligence shall be answerable for the damage caused." (Article 1902, Civil 
Code.)</p>
<p>"Moreover, we are of the opinion that both the owner and agent 
(<i>naviero</i>) should be declared to be jointly and severally liable, since 
the obligation which is the subject of this action had its origin in a tortious 
act and did not arise from contract. Article 1137 of the Civil Code, declaring 
that joint obligations shall be apportionable unless otherwise provided, has no 
application to obligations arising from tort." (Verzosa and Ruiz, Rementeria y 
Cia. <i>vs</i>. Lim and Siy Cong Bieng &amp; Co., 45 Phil., 416, 
423.)</p></blockquote>
<p>After the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of Manila for the 
execution of our decision, the respondent judge issued on July 23, 1946, an 
order for the execution of the decision, but with instructions to the sheriff 
that in carrying out the order of execution, the China Banking Corporation shall 
be made to pay only "one-third" of the total amount of the judgment of the 
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Petitioners came to us to secure a <i>mandamus</i> against the lower court, 
to compel it to order the execution for the total amount of the judgment against 
the China Banking Corporation.</p>
<p>The pivotal question in this case, undisguised by technical trappings, is 
whether a party to a fraudulent transaction should be granted the benefits of an 
exemption from the payment of two-thirds (2/3) of the reparation and 
indemnification due to the victim of the fraud.</p>
<p>Presented in another form, the question we are called upon to answer is 
whether we are empowered to disregard article 1902 of the Civil Code, by 
reducing to one-third (1/3) the responsibility therein provided for damages 
caused by fault, in the present case aggravated by "bad faith."</p>
<p>The dispositive part of our decision in Contreras and Gingco <i>vs</i>. China 
Banking Corporation, <i>supra</i>, the execution of which against the China 
Banking Corporation is in issue, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For all the foregoing, the deed of mortgage dated November 8, 1930, is 
declared null and void as to the one-half of the mortgaged property belonging to 
Jerusalem Gingco and rescinded as to the remaining one-half belonging to the 
spouses Molina, and the appealed decision is modified by ordering all the 
defendants to pay Jerusalem Gingco the amount of P6,951.31, plus the additional 
amount of P30 monthly from September 4, 1934, to September 4, 1941, and to 
continue paying the same monthly amount thereafter until the two new doors of 
the <i>accesoria</i> in question are delivered to said Jerusalem Gingco. The 
defendants shall also pay the filing fees of the complaint in the lower court 
and the costs in both instances."</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents would like to have it interpreted to the effect that the China 
Banking Corporation shall have to pay only "one-third" of the amounts 
adjudicated, following the rules of interpretation set in articles 1137 and 1138 
of the Civil Code, which read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Article 1137. The concurrence of two or more creditors, or of two or more 
debtors, in a single obligation does not imply that each of the former has a 
right to ask, or that each of the latter must give, in their entirety the things 
which are the object of such obligation. This shall obtain only when the 
obligation so expressly determines, by being constituted with the character of a 
solidary obligation.</p>
<p>"Article 1138. If from the context of the obligations referred to in the 
preceding article the contrary is not shown, the credit or the debt shall be 
presumed as divided into as many equal parts as there are creditors or debtors, 
each part to be considered as a distinct credit or debt from the 
others."</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents' position is based on the doctrine laid down in the case of 
Oriental Commercial Co. <i>vs</i>. Abeto and Mabanag (60 Phil., 723) decided on 
October 10, 1934, the said doctrine having been firstly enunciated in the case 
of De Leon <i>vs</i>. Nepomuceno and De Jesus (37 Phil., 180), decided about 
thirty years ago, on November 24, 1917.</p>
<p>An analysis of the decision in the case of De Leon <i>vs</i>. Nepomuceno, 
<i>supra</i>, will lead us to the conclusion that the doctrine was laid down on 
wrong foundations and, therefore, is liable to topple down at the slightest 
touch.</p>
<p>Three candidates ran for provincial governor of Tarlac: De Leon, Gardiner, 
and Torres. De Leon was declared elected. Gardiner protested, with notice to 
Torres, who was an unwilling party, having received a few complimentary votes 
and had no chance of being declared elected. Gardiner won the contest. Under 
sections 481 and 482 of the Administrative Code, the law then applicable, the 
costs shall be taxed "against the defeated party," which was De Leon. It 
happened, notwithstanding, that the Court of First Instance decided that the 
costs shall be paid "by the protestee and the intervenor." The decision was 
wrong, because, under the law, the costs shall be taxed only "against the 
defeated party" and it could not refer to anybody but De Leon. The wrong 
judgment was erroneously affirmed by the Supreme Court. Mr. Justice Malcolm then 
said: "The fixing of costs in election contests is therefore not a question of 
joint liability or joint and several liability, but is simply an application of 
the precise provisions of the law to the facts."</p>
<p>But the majority of the Supreme Court proceeded to set the doctrine that, 
unless the judgment should use the sacramental phrase "joint and several," the 
amount adjudged to be paid by two or more persons, shall be apportioned among 
them in equal parts, and each one shall pay only his quota and no more.</p>
<p>To lay down the doctrine, articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code and the 
Law of Louisiana as stated in Groves <i>vs</i>. Sentell (14 Sup. Ct., 898-901; 
153 U. S., 465; 38 Law ed., 785), were invoked.</p>
<p>It can be seen, therefore, that the doctrine is the result of the mental 
operation of disguising an error with the appearance of correctness by 
committing a second error tending to justify the first one. Refusal to admit or 
confess an error is very general human weakness. Even tribunals are not always 
free from that weakness. They are human institutions and it is natural that 
human virtues and weaknesses should be manifested in them.</p>
<p>In Sharruf <i>vs</i>. Tayabas Land Co. and Ginainati (37 Phil., 655) articles 
1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code have been correctly applied, because the issue 
there referred to a promissory note, and that is the reason why the Supreme 
Court declared: "We agree with the appellant that this promissory note evidences 
a joint and not a joint and several obligation, but it appearing that the trial 
judge correctly rendered judgment holding the defendants 'jointly' liable, there 
is no necessity for any modification of the terms of the judgment in that 
regard."</p>
<p>Evidently, we are facing here a case of forgetfulness when respondents failed 
to remember that articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code are circumscribed in 
their application only to contractual obligations, but never to quasi-contracts 
nor to tortious obligations. Manresa, the most weighty authority on Civil Code, 
invoking a decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, declared that articles 1137 
and 1138 of the Civil Code are not applicable to obligations born from 
quasi-contracts which by their very nature, are solidary. (Vol. VIII, pp. 193, 
194, 3d ed.) And this very Supreme Court had already decided that article 1137 
of the Civil Code has no application to obligations arising from tort, such as 
the obligation of the China Banking Corporation to pay Jerusalem Gingco, the 
amounts adjudicated in our decision. (<i>See</i> Verzosa and Ruiz, Rementaria y 
Cia. <i>vs</i>. Lim and Siy Cong Bieng &amp; Co., 45 Phil., 416, 423, quoted 
elsewhere in this opinion.)</p>
<p>The obligation of the China Banking Corporation to pay the amounts in 
question have arisen from a tortious act, committed with evident bad faith, and 
not from a contract. It is evident that the bank cannot profit by the exemptions 
or deductions authorized by articles 1137 and 1138 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>We do not see any reason why, in reading the plain words of the dispositive 
part of the decision in question, resort should be made to any unusual or 
abstruse means of interpretation, when the words of the decision are so clear to 
be understood by any common man. There is nothing so confusing, so irksome and 
distressing than when tribunals, pretending to voice the wisdom of the oracles, 
decide to reveal the riddle of a meaning which is beyond the ordinary 
understanding and shocks the sense of the common people. There is nothing to 
discredit so much the administration of justice.</p>
<p>The decision ordered "all the defendants to pay Jerusalem Gingco" the 
specified amounts. Is it not clear that each and every one of the defendants is 
responsible for the payment of all the amounts? Is there any word in the 
decision to support the idea that any one of the defendants, say the China 
Banking Corporation, is liable to pay but "one-third" of the amounts? The 
suggestion is so preposterous and repugnant to common sense to merit the dignity 
of a judicial pronouncement. According to the best lexicographic authority, 
"all," as adjective, means "<i>every member</i> or individual component of; 
<i>each one of</i>;—used with a plural noun."</p>
<p>The fraudulent character of the transaction from which the obligation of the 
China Banking Corporation to pay the amounts in question has arisen appears in 
the body of the decision and before the last paragraph containing the 
dispositive part. It is suggested that the dispositive part should be singled 
out as if, in effect, embodying the whole decision, and that the preceding 
paragraphs should be considered as superfluous decorative appendix. Invoking the 
authority of Freeman, it is suggested that the findings and conclusions in the 
body of a decision should be distinguished from the judgment in the dispositive 
part to the extent of making it completely apart from the judgment Thus, in this 
case, as the pronouncement of fraudulence is not embodied in the dispositive 
part of our decision, it should be completely ignored in reading and construing 
said dispositive part. The opinion, which may appear plausible under American 
statutes and jurisprudence, is completely out of place within the Philippine 
legal system.</p>
<p>Section 12 of Article VIII of our Constitution provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No decision shall be rendered by any court of record without expressing 
therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is 
based."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as clear as crystal that judicial decisions should not be read and 
construed piecemeal. The findings and conclusions of fact and law not inserted 
in the dispositive part are as part of the decision as the latter, and it is so 
by constitutional mandate. Severance cannot be made without violating the 
Constitution. Therefore, the pronouncement on fraudulence is as part of our 
decision as the last paragraph where we ordered the China Banking Corporation, 
with the other defendants, to pay the amounts in question.</p>
<p>There is much to deplore the fact that this case happens to be decided upon 
the assumption that petitioners are seeking a change in the dispositive part of 
our decision in question. There is nothing in the prayer at the bottom of the 
petition to support such an assumption. This initial error serves as a premise 
to reasonings that lead to mistaken conclusions.</p>
<p>To the majority it is not enough that this Court should have adjudged the 
China Banking Corporation guilty of bad faith in entering into a contract of 
mortgage with the spouses Molina. It is not enough that this Court should have 
rescinded and annulled the fraudulent mortgage. It is not enough that the 
victim, Jerusalem Gingco, should have been defrauded, thanks to the fraudulent 
mortgage and to the third party claim based on it, the amounts stated in the 
dispositive part of our decision. It is not enough that articles 1137 and 1138 
of the Civil Code should only be made applicable to contracts. It is not enough 
that this very Supreme Court had already held that said articles are not 
applicable to obligations arising from tortious acts, such as the ones committed 
by the China Banking Corporation, in connivance with spouses Molina, and with 
the active help of the common lawyers of both parties. It is not enough that the 
wrongdoer is legally responsible to the full extent of the damages caused by his 
fraud. It is not enough that in the dispositive part of our decision we made it 
clear in plain and simple words, understandable to any body who can read 
English, that the China Banking Corporation, including the other defendants, the 
spouses Molina, should pay to Jerusalem Gingco all the amounts therein 
specified. Not even the combined presence and concurrence of all the above facts 
is sufficient, according to the majority, to entitle Jerusalem Gingco to collect 
all the amounts from the China Banking Corporation, because the spouses Molina 
are insolvent, and they became insolvent after the fraudulent mortgage had been 
executed and the China Banking Corporation filed the third party claim that 
frustrated the execution of the final judgment in favor of Jerusalem Gingco for 
the collection of the amounts in question. The majority would require, besides, 
as an essential element, a condition <i>sine qua non</i>, that in the 
dispositive part of our decision should also appear the ritualistic words: 
"jointly and severally." This is the indispensable hierogram, without which the 
judicial grace cannot be obtained. Shall justice be administered by shibboleths? 
Shall the substance of justice be sacrificed for the sake of an empty 
technicality? Shall the rights of litigants be measured by rigid linguistic 
formulas, as if by algebraic equations? Are we to return to medieval darkness 
when judgments were rendered upon fire tests and stupid exorcismal ceremonies? 
How nonsensical it is.</p>
<p>With such an absurd way of thinking, the resulting decision cannot but be a 
revolting travesty of justice. How can we arrive at a fair conclusion upon a 
preposterous proposition, upon ideas that have no place in healthy reason, upon 
twisted logic? How can anyone accept that in our decision where we wrote that 
the China Banking Corporation should pay to Jerusalem Gingco the amounts therein 
stated, not only any portion of the amounts, there should be read as if we had 
written one-third (1/3) of the amounts? Can it be done without misrepresenting 
facts? Can it be done without choking the truth?</p>
<p>The majority decision cannot fail to produce trepidation. The injustice of 
depriving Jerusalem Gingco of two-thirds (2/3) of the amounts due her, to enrich 
correspondingly with them the China Banking Corporation, co-author of the fraud 
inflicted on her, is obvious. But it might not be so obvious to everybody that 
the decision, in effect, is a reward to fraud. Such a decision in the present 
incipient stage of our Republic, generally speaking, is demoralizing. The Augean 
state of affairs in some of our official agencies, the carrion smell in some 
social activities, shall make it so in superlative manner.</p>We vote for the 
annulment of the lower court's order, illegally reducing to one-third the 
amounts that, according to the decision of this Court, should be paid by the 
China Banking Corporation to Jerusalem Gingco and that a mandate be issued so 
that in the execution of our decision rendered in the case of Contreras and 
Gingco <i>vs</i>. China Banking Corporation (76 Phil., 709), the China Banking 
Corporation be required to pay all the amounts adjudicated to be paid to said 
Jerusalem Gingco.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISIDENTE</em></div>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.,</strong> con quien esta conforme <strong>PABLO, 
M.:</strong></p>
<p>Tanto en la ponencia como en la disidencia del Magistrado Sr. Perfecto los 
hechos se hallan expuestos con todo detalle; asi que me creo relevado de 
repetirlos en esta breve opinion disidente. Tiene razon el ponente cuando dice 
que se trata de hechos bastante complejos; pero, para los efectos de la 
resolucion del presente asunto, creo se puede reducirlos a una proposicion 
juridica harto sencilla, a saber: que la responsabilidad del Banco demandado no 
ha nacido de contrato, ni siquiera de cuasi-contrato, sino de un acto doloso, de 
culpa. Su responsabilidad es exigible bajo el articulo 1902 del Codigo Civil que 
reza: "El que por accion u omision causa daño a otro, interviniendo culpa o 
negligencia, esta obligado a reparar el daño causado". Y es elemental que esta 
clase de responsabilidad, cuando se comparte con otro, no es solo mancomunada 
sino solidaria. Por tanto, se equivoca la mayoria al declarar aplicables a este 
caso los articulos 1137 y 1138 del Codigo Civil, los cuales se refieren 
evidentemente a obligaciones contractuales. Asi que en el asunto de Verzosa y 
Ruiz, Rementeria y Cia. <i>contra</i> Lim y Siy Cong Bieng &amp; Co. (45 Jur. 
Fil., 437, 444, Nov. 15, 1923) hemos sentado categoricamente el siguiente 
pronunciamiento: "El articulo ll37 del Codigo Civil que declara que las 
obligaciones mancomunadas seran a prorrata, a menos que se disponga otra cosa, 
carece de aplicacion a las obligaciones <i>nacidas de culpa</i>."</p>
<p>Sin embargo, se arguye que no estamos autorizados para enmendar la parte 
dispositiva de una sentencia ya firme; que lo mas que se permite es la 
correccion de errores de forma (<i>clerical error</i>), citandose autoridades en 
apoyo de esta asercion; que, de otro modo, los litigios resultarian 
interminables y habria caos, confusion; que, por tanto, aun a trueque de alguna 
que otra injusticia aislada resultante de error judicial, razones de politica, 
de orden publico aconsejan que se mantenga con todo rigor la regla clasica sobre 
la inmutabilidad de las sentencias firmes y definitivas.</p>
<p>Hasta cierto punto estoy conforme con esta manera de razonar. Pero es que en 
el presente caso no se trata de alterar o enmendar sustancialmente la sentencia: 
se trata solo de dar efectividad al espiritu, al sentido esencial embebido en la 
misma. Es indudable que en nuestra decision que es ahora objeto de controversia, 
se condena al Banco demandado a pagar una indemnizacion a la demandante 
Jerusalem Gingco, no como resultado de algun contrato que aquel hubiera tenido 
con esta—pues, no hay tal contrato—sino porque el Banco tuvo parte esencial en 
un acto doloso que causo daño a dicha Jerusalem Gingco en una suma mayor de 
P6,000; en otras palabras, el Banco presento un escrito de terceria en unos 
procedimientos de ejecucion en que Jerusalem era la ejecutante y ejecutados los 
esposos Molina, co-demandados del Banco, a sabiendas de que la terceria dimanaba 
de una hipoteca fraudulenta. Como resultado de esta terceria, la ejecucion se 
dejo sin efecto y consiguientemente Jerusalem dejo de cobrar los P6,000 que 
tenia derecho a recibir de los Molina. Todo esto aparece clarisimo en el texto 
de nuestra sentencia discutida, faltando solo en la parte dispositiva las 
palabras sacramentales "mancomunada y solidariamente". La pregunta ahora en 
orden es la siguiente: ¿es bastante esta omision para derrotar el objetivo 
esencial de la sentencia que no es otro sino el de que la demandante pueda 
cobrar de los demandados <i>toda</i> la cantidad que se le debe, a tenor de 
dicha sentencia? En otros terminos: ¿es dicha omision sustancial, o es solo de 
forma, es decir, inadvertencia de amanuense, <i>clerical error?</i></p>
<p>Creo que es solo de forma. Creo que lo aqui debe regir, prevalecer, es el 
texto inconfundible, inequivoco de la sentencia. Creo que cuando hay vaguedad, 
deficiencia en la parte dispositiva (<i>judgment</i>) de la sentencia, ello se 
puede suplir con la lectura del texto. Hay que tener en cuenta que el 
"<i>judgment</i>" no es como el alma de Garibay suspendida en el aire, usando 
una locucion vulgar. El "<i>judgment</i>" es la conclusion de un silogismo, por 
decirlo asi; per tanto, presupone premisas, mayor y menor, y estas tienen que 
estar necesariamente en el texto de la sentencia. Lo que en todo caso no es 
parte de la sentencia es el <i>obiter dictum</i>. Estrictamente hablando todo lo 
que se pide en el presente recurso es que <i>ampliemos</i> la parte dispositiva 
de la sentencia con el concepto de la solidaridad, pero este concepto no es un 
elemento nuevo, extraño a la sentencia, sino que esta embedido en ella; en 
realidad, es el <i>leit-motiff</i>, es la <i>ratio decidendi</i> misma del 
asunto. Y lo es porque es la ley misma la que dice que cuando la obligacion nace 
de dolo o culpa, la responsabilidad es solidaria. Y esta clase de 
<i>ampliacion</i> la podemos hacer, la hemos hecho ya en otro asunto anterior, 
el de Rodriguez <i>contra</i> Caoibes (62 Jur. Fil., 152-159, Septiembre 24, 
1935). En este asunto se dijo lo siguiente:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"La presente causa es de ejecucion de hipoteca. Fue tramitada como tal tanto 
en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Batangas como en esta Corte en apelacion. 
Al revocar la decision apelada, <i>por omision involuntaria</i>, no se ordeno la 
consignacion en la escribania del Juzgado de origen, dentro de un plazo no menor 
de tres meses, el importe de la sentencia, y, en su defecto, la venta de las 
propiedades hipotecadas para hacer efectivo el pago de la deuda hipotecaria y 
las costas. Esta omision involuntaria de un mandato imperativo del articulo 256 
del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil, arriba transcrito, no puede alterar la 
naturaleza de la accion, y puede pedirse la enmienda de la decision para 
subsanar el defecto, puesto que tal provision es parte necesaria de ella.</p>
<p>"Sobre el particular, la jurisprudencia americana ha sentado la siguiente 
doctrina:</p>
<p>" 'A judgment or decree of foreclosure may be corrected after its rendition 
in respect of an <i>error or ommission</i>, so as to make it conform to the 
intention of the court or the facts of the case, * * *.' (42 Corpus Juris, 
158.)</p>
<p>" 'If anything has been omitted from the judgment which is necesarrily or 
properly a part of it, and <i>which was intended and understood to be a part to 
it</i>, but failed to be incorporated in it through the <i>negligence or 
inadvertence of the court</i> or counsel, or the clerk, the omission may be 
supplied by an amendment even after the term. * * *' (34 Corpus Juris, 235.)</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Aunque el auto del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Batangas de fecha 12 de 
marzo de 1934, arriba transcrito, contiene una orden mas amplia que la parte 
dispositiva de la sentencia de esta Corte, y aunque lo mas procedente hubiera 
sido el que se hubiese presentado una mocion ante esta Corte pidiendo que se 
enmendara dicha parte dispositiva, supliendo la omision, no habiendose causado 
perjuicio alguno con tal <i>ampliacion</i>, no creemos necesario revocar la 
mencionada orden enmendatoria, bastando que hagamos nuestra la ampliacion, como 
lo hacemos por la presente." (Las cursivas son nuestras.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Por la analogia se puede decir que en el asunto que nos ocupa la <i>omision 
involuntaria</i> puede subsanarse, puesto que la enmienda no añade nada nuevo a 
la sentencia. Derivandose de la misma ley el caracter solidario de la 
responsabilidad del Banco demandado, estrictamente hablando no habia por que 
declararlo en la parte dispositiva de la sentencia. Lo importante era establecer 
el hecho de la responsabilidad—la ley se aplica automaticamente. Se comprende 
que en las obligaciones contractuales sea absolutamente necesario el declarar la 
calidad de <i>in solido</i>, pues siendo la solidaridad mas onerosa que la 
simple mancomunidad no puede naturalmente presumirse sino que es preciso que 
haya habido previamente una manifestacion expresa de la <i>voluntad</i> al 
efecto.</p>
<p>Mucho me temo que con el fallo de la mayoria se este sacrificando la 
substancia, el fondo de la justicia, a la sombra de un formulismo. Es realmente 
deplorable que la demandante, despues de batallar por mas de 10 años para cobrar 
lo que se le debe en virtud de un acto doloso de los demandados, encuentre ahora 
que no puede cobrar mas que un tercio por una <i>inadvertencia</i>, una 
<i>omision</i> a todas luces <i>involuntaria</i> de esta Corte, usando las 
mismas palabras empleadas en el asunto de Rodriguez <i>contra</i> Caoibes, 
<i>supra</i>.</p>Se que hay casos en que la falibilidad humana puede causar 
injusticias irremediables, pero el presente no es indudablemente uno de ellos. 
Aqui podriamos reparar facilmente los efectos de nuestra falibilidad, de nuestra 
omision, sin causar injusticia contra nadie incluso el Banco demandado, y sin 
vulnerar ningun principio sano de politica publica. Todo lo mas que quedaria 
afectado seria un fetiche—el fetiche de una discutible inmutabilidad.</div>
