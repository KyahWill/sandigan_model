				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition  under Rule  46 to  review a judgment rendered by the Court of  Appeals in CA-GR No. 15767-R, Philippine  Resources  Development  Corporation  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  The Hon. Judge Magno Gatmaitan  et al. <br><br>The  findings of the Court of Appeals are, as follows: <br><blockquote>It appears that on May 6,  1955,  the Republic of the Philippines in representation of the Bureau  of Prisons instituted  against  Macario  Apostol and the Empire Insurance Co.  a complaint docketed as Civil Case No.  26166 of the Court  of First Instance of Manila. The complaint alleges as the  first cause of  action, that  defendant Apostol submitted the  highest bid  in the amount of P450.00 per ton for the purchase of 100  tons of  Palawan Almaciga  from the Bureau  of Prisons;  that a contract  therefor  was drawn and by virtue of  which, Apostol obtained  goods  from   the  Bureau  cf Prisons  valued P15,878.59;  that of said account, Apostol  paid  only P691.10  leaving  a  balance  obligation  of P15,187.49.  The  complaint further avers, as second cause  of action, that Apostol  submitted the best bid with the Bureau  of  Prisons for the purchase of  three million board feet of logs at P88.00  per  1,000 board  feet; that a contract was executed between the Director of Prisons and Apostol pursuant to which contract Apostol obtained deliveries of logs valued at P65,830.00; and that Apostol failed to pay a balance account  of P18,827.57. All told, the total  demand set forth in complaint against Apostol is for P34,015.06 with legal interests thereon from January 8, 1952.  The Empire Insurance Company was included in the complaint having executed a performance bond of P10,000.00 in favor of Apostol. <br>In  his  answer, Apostol interposed  payment as a  defense and sought the dismissal of the  complaint. <br><br>On July 19,  1955, the  Philippine  Resources Development  Corporation moved  to  intervene,  appending to  its motion,  the  complaint in  intervention  of  even  date.   The  complaint recites  that for  sometime prior to Apostol's transactions the corporate had some  goods  deposited  in  a  warehouse  at  1201  Herran, Manila; that  Apostol, then  the president of  the  corporation but without the  knowledge  or consent of  the  stockholders  thereof, disposed of  said goods by delivering  the same to the  Bureau of Prisons in  an attempt to settle his  personal  debts with the latter entity; that  upon discovery of Apostol's  act, the  corporation took  steps to  recover said  goods by  demanding  from the Bureau of Prisons the return thereof; and  that  upon  the refusal of  the Bureau to return said  goods, the  corporation  sought leave to intervene  in Civil  Case  No.  26166. <br><br>As  aforestated, His  Honor denied the motion  for intervention and thereby issued an order to  this effect on July 23, 1955.  A motion for  the  reconsideration  of  said order  was filed  by the movant corporation  and the same  was likewise denied  by His Honor on August 18,  1955. * * *   (Annex L.) </blockquote>On 3 September 1955, in  a petition for a writ  of certiorari filed in the Court of Appeals, the herein respondent corporation prayed  for the setting aside  of the order of the Court of First Instance that had denied the admission of its complaint-in-intervention and for  an  order directing the latter Court to allow the herein respondent corporation to intervene in the  action  (Annex  G).  On  12  December 1955  the Court of  Appeals  set aside the order denying the motion to  intervene and  ordered the respondent court to admit the  herein  respondent corporation's complaint-in-intervention, with  costs against Macario  Apostol. <br><br>On 9  January 1956 the  Republic of  the Philippines filed  this petition  in this  Court for the  purpose  stated at the beginning of this opinion. <br><br>The Government  contends that  the intervenor  has  no legal  interest  in the matter  in  litigation, because  the action brought in the Court of First Instance of  Manila against Macario Apostol and the Empire  Insurance Company (Civil Case No.  26166,  Annex A) is just for the collection from the defendant Apostol of a sum of money, the unpaid balance of the purchase  price of  logs and almaciga bought by him from  the Bureau of Prisons, whereas the intervenor seeks to recover  ownership  and possession of G.I. sheets, black  sheets, M.S. plates, round bars and G.I. pipes that it claims  it ownsâ€”an intervention which would change a personal action into one <span style="font-style: italic;">ad rem</span> and would  unduly delay the disposition  of the case. <br><br>The Court  of  Appeals  held   that:<br><blockquote>Petitioner ardently claims that the  reason behind its  motion to intervene is the desire to protect its rights and  interests over some  materials  purportedly belonging to it;  that said materials were unauthorizedly and illegally assigned and delivered  to the Bureau of  Prisons by petitioning  corporation's  president  Macario Apostol in payment of the latter's personal accounts with the  said entity; and that the  Bureau  of Prisons refused  to  return  said materials  despite  petitioner's demands to  do  so. <br><br>Petitioner refers to  the particulars recited  in Apostol's  answer dated  July  12,  1955  to  the effect  that Apostol  had paid  unto the  Bureau of Prisons  his accounts covered,  among others,  by BPPO 1077 for the  sum of P4,638.40  and  BPPO 1549  for the amount of  P4,398.54.  Petitioner, moreover, points  to the  Statement of Paid and Unpaid accounts of Apostol  dated  January  16, 1954 prepared by  the  accounting  officer  of the Bureau of Prisons (Annex B.  Complaint in Intervention), wherein  it appears that the  aforementioned accounts covered  respectively  by  BPPO  Nos. 1077 for 892 pieces  of GI  sheets and 1549 for 399 pieces of  GI pipes in the total sum of P9,036.94 have not been credited to Apostol's account in view of lack of supporting papers; and that  according to  the reply letter  of  the Undersecretary of  Justice,  said GI  sheets  and pipes  were  delivered by  Macario  Apostol  to  the Bureau of  Prisons allegedly in  Apostol's capacity  as owner  and that the black iron sheets were delivered  by  Apostol  as President of  the petitioner  corporation. <br><br>Respondents, on  the  other hand, assert that the subject  matter of  the original  litigation  is a  sum of money  allegedly due to the Bureau of  Prisons from Macario  Apostol and  not the  goods or materials  reportedly turned over by  Apostol in  payment  of  his private debts to the Bureau of  Prisons  and the recovery  of which is  sought by the petitioner; and that for this reason, petitioner has  no legal interest in the very  subject matter  in  litigation as to  entitle it  to  intervene. <br><br>We  find  no merit  in respondents'  contention.  It is  true that the very subject matter  of  the original case is a  sum of  money. But it is  likewise  true as borne out  by the records, that the materials  purportedly belonging  to the petitioner corporation  have been assessed and evaluated and their  price  equivalent in  terms of money have been determined;  and  that said materials for whatever price they have been assessed, have been assigned by defendant now respondent Apostol as tokens of  payment  of his private debts with the  Bureau  of Prisons.  In view  of these considerations,  it becomes enormously plain in the event the respondent judge  decides to  credit  Macario  Apostol with  the  value of the  goods  delivered by the latter to the Bureau of Prisons, the petitioner corporation stands to  be adversely affected by such  judgment.   The conclusion, therefore,  is inescapable that  the  petitioner  possesses  a legal interest in the matter in litigation and that such interest is of an actual,  material, direct and immediate nature as  to  entitle petitioner to  intervene.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * * * *<br></div><br>Section 3 of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court endows  the lower court with discretion to allow or disapprove a motion for intervention (Santarromana et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Barrios, 63  Phil. 456); and that in the exercise  of such  discretion, the court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights  of the original parties and  whether  or  not the intervenor's rights  may be fully protected in a  separate  proceeding. The petitioner in  the  instant  case  is positively authorized to file a separate action  against any of  all the respondents.  But  considering  that  the resolution  of the issues raised  in  and joined by the pleadings  in the main case, would vitally affect  the rights not only of the original parties but also  of the herein petitioner;  that far from unduly  delaying or  prejudicing the  adjudication of the rights  of the  original  parties  or bringing about  confusion in the original case, the  admission of the complaint in intervention would help clarify the vital issue of  the true and real  ownership of the materials involved, besides preventing an abhorrent multiplicity of suits, we believe that the motion to intervene should be  given due course.</blockquote>We find  no reason for  disturbing  the  foregoing  pronouncements.  The Government  argues that  "Price *  *  * is always paid in terms  of money  and the supposed payment being in kind,  it is no payment at all," citing  article 1458 of the new Civil Code.   However,  the same  article provides that the purchaser may pay  "a price certain in money or <span style="font-style: italic;">its equivalent</span>"  which means  that payment of the price need not be in money.   Whether the G.I.  sheets, black sheets, M.S. plates,  round bars and G.I. pipes claimed by  the  respondent corporation  to belong to  it  and delivered to  the Bureau  of Prisons by Macario  Apostol in payment  of his  account  is sufficient payment  therefor, is for the Court to pass upon and decide  after hearing all the parties  in the case.  Should the trial court  hold that it is  as to credit Apostol with the value or price  of  the materials delivered by him, certainly the herein respondent  corporation would  be affected adversely if its claim of  ownership of  such  sheets,  plates,  bars  and pipes  is true. <br><br>The Government reiterates its  original stand that counsel appearing for the respondent corporation has  no authority  to represent it  and/or  sue  in its  behalf.   The Court of Appeals held  that:<br><blockquote>Respondents  aver  also that petitioner  lacks legal  capacity to  sue and  that its counsel is acting  merely in a.n individual  capacity without  the  benefit  of  a corporate act authorizing him  to  bring suit.  In  this connection, respondents  invoke  among others section 20 of Rule 127 which  provision, in  our opinion, squarely  disproves their claim as  by  virtue thereof, the authority of petitioner's counsel  is presumed.  Withal,  the claim of the  counsel for  the  petitioner  that  a resolution  to  proceed  against Apostol, had  been unanimously adopted by the  stockholders of the  corporation,  has not been refuted. <br><br>Evidently, petitioner is a duly organized corporation with  offices at the Samanillo  Building and that as  such, it is endowed with a personality distinct and separate from that of  its  president  or  stockholders.  It has the right to bring suit to safeguard its interests and ordinarily, such right  is exercised at the instance of the president. However, under the circumstance now  obtaining, such right properly devolves  upon  the other officers  of the  corporation as said right is sought to lie exercised against the president himself who  is the very object  of the intended suit.</blockquote>The power of a corporation to sue  and be sued in any court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is lodged in the board of directors which exercises its  corporate powers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>and not  in the president,  as contended  by the  Government.  The "motion  for admission of complaint in intervention"  (Annex C)  and the "complaint in intervention"  attached thereto, signed by counsel and  filed  in the  Court of First  Instance begin with  the following statement:  "COMES NOW the above-named Intervenor,  by its undersigned counsel,  * * *,"  and underneath  his  typewritten  name  is  affixed  the  description <br><br>"Counsel for the Intervenor."  As counsel's authority to appear for the  respondent corporation was  never questioned in the Court of First Instance, it is to be presumed that he  was properly authorized to file the complaint-in intervention and appear for his client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  It was only in the Court of  Appeals where  his  authority  to  appear was questioned.  As  the  Court of Appeals  was satisfied that counsel was duly authorized by his client to file the complaint-in-intervention  and  to  appear  in  its  behalf,  the resolution of  the Court of Appeals on this point should not be disturbed. <br><br>Granting that counsel has not been  actually authorized by the board  of directors  to appear for and in behalf of the respondent  corporation, the fact that counsel is  the secretary-treasurer of  the  respondent  corporation and  a member  of the board of directors; and that the other members of the board, namely, Macario Apostol, the president, and  his  wife  Pacita R. Apostol,  who should  normally initiate  the action  to protect the  corporate properties and interests are the ones to be adversely affected thereby, a single  stockholder under such circumstances  may  sue in behalf of the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Counsel as a stockholder and director of  the respondent corporation may sue in its behalf and file the complaint-in-intervention in the proper court. <br><br>The judgment under review is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
