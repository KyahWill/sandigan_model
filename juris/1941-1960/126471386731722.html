				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal against an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila,  Hon.  Bienvenido A.  Tan,  presiding, dismissing the complaint as against Plaridel Surety and Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Complaint is by Philippine National  Bank  against Macapanga Producers  Inc.   and Plaridel  Surety  and  Insurance Co. Principal  allegations are:  On  December  26, 1952, Luzon Sugar Company leased a sugar mill located at Calumpit,  Bulacan to Macapanga Producers beginning with the crop year 1952-53 at a  minimum annual royalty of P50,000, which shall be a lien on the sugar produced by the lessee and shall be paid before sale  or removal of sugar from warehouse  (copy of lease  contract attached as Annex A  to the Complaint); on December  26,  1952, Macapanga Producers, as principal, and Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance, as surety, executed and delivered to plaintiff a performance bond in the amount of P50,000 for the) full and  faithful  compliance by Macapanga  Producers of all terms and conditions of the lease (copy  of  bond attached as Annex B to Complaint); on December 21, 1953, Luzon Sugar assigned  to plaintiff the payment due from Macapanga Producers in the sum of P50,000, representing royalty for the lease of the sugar mill for the crop year' 1952-53 (deed of assignment attached as  Annex C to Complaint); plaintiff notified Macapahga Producers and Plaridel Surety &amp;  Insurance  of said assignment; plaintiff had demanded from Macapanga Producers payment of said  royalty of P50,000, but the latter has refused and refuses to make payment; and  plaintiff also made demand on Plaridel Surety &amp;  Insurance for said payment, but the latter refused and refuses to make payment.</p>
<p>Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance moved to  dismiss the complaint for failure  to state cause of action, alleging that it  is a guarantor and as such is responsible only if  Macapanga  Producers has no property or assets  to pay its obligation as lessee.  Plaintiff opposed the motion calling attention to the provision of the performance bond in which Macapanga Producers  and  Plaridel  Surety &amp;  Insurance, the former as principal  and the  latter  as surety, agreed to be held and firmly bound unto Luzon Sugar iir the penal sum of P50,000, "for  the payment of  which,  well  and truly be made,  we bind ourselves,  our  heirs, executors, administrators,  successors, and assigns,  jointly and  severally."   Plaintiff  contended that, as  Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance bound itself solidarity  with  Macapanga  Producers,  it became a  surety  in accordance with  Article 2047, par. 2 of  the  Civil Code.</p>
<p>The trial court dismissed the complaint against Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance  and  subsequently denied a  motion to reconsider the order of dismissal.</p>
<p>The action joining Plaridel  Surety &amp; Insurance as party defendant is  justified  by  the following  provisions  and cases:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 2047.* * *</p>
  <p>If a person  binds himself solidarity with the principal debtor, the provisions  of  section 4, Charter  3, Title I of this Book  shall be observed.  In such  case  the contract is called a suretyship,"  (Civil Code.)</p>
  <p>"The sureties on the superedeas bond given  in this particular case,  were jointly  and  severally  liable  with principal  debtor and that an execution might  issue  against  their property concurrently with the execution  against the property, of the principal."  (Molina <em>vs.</em>  De la Riva, et al., 7 Phil., 345.)</p>
  <p>"Article  1822,  invoked  by the  appellant, provides  that 'if the surety bound  himself jointly with the  principal debtor,  the  provisions  of  section  fourth, chapter third,  title  first  of this  book shall be observed,' that  is  of book fourth of  the Civil Code.  Section fourth of the  chapter  title,  and  book  mentioned provides that 'a creditor may sue any of the joint debtor or all of them simultaneously.' <art. 1144).="" conformity="" this="" provision,="" sureties="" ti="" yap="" chatco="" having="" bound="" themselves="" solidum="" (jointly="" severally)="" with="" principal="" debtor="" pua="" te="" ching,="" creditor,="" that="" is,="" commerce,="" may="" sue="" any="" or="" all="" them="" simultaneously;="" which="" is="" what="" chinese="" did="" in="" filing="" suit="" against="" the="" joint="" and="" several="" debtors.="" (chinese="" chamber="" of="" commerce=""><em>vs.</em> Pua Te Ching, 16 Phil., 406.) "As the principal debtor's obligation  is valid  and has not been satisfied by his estate,  and as the defendant  sureties  bound themselves  solidarity, article  1144 of the Civil Code is applicable, which provides, as follows:</art.></p>
  <p>The creditor may sue any  of the solidary debtors or  all of them simultaneously.  An action instituted against one shall  not be a bar  to those  which may  be subsequently brought   against the others, as long as the debt has not been entirely  satisfied.  (Molina <em>vs.</em>  De la Riva, 7 Phil.,  345; Chinese Chamber of  Commerce <em>vs.</em> Pua Te  Ching,  16  Phil., 406;  Inchausti &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Yulo, 34 Phil., 978.)" (Ferrer <em>vs.</em> Lopez and  Santos, 56 Phil., 592.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also argued on behalf of Flaridel Surety and Insurance that as it was  not  a party to the assignment, and same was made without  its consent, it is, therefore, discharged  from  its obligation.   An  assignment  without knowledge  or consent of  the surety is not a material alteration of the contract, sufficient to discharge the surety. (Stearns Law of Suretyship, Elder, fifth edition, p. 113.) There is, besides, no allegation in the complaint, or provision in the  deed  of  assignment, or any change  therein that makes the obligation of Plaridel  Surety &amp; Insurance more onerous than that stated in the performance bond. Such assignment  did not, therefore, release the Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance from  its obligation under the  surety bond.  (Bank of P. I. <em>vs.</em> Albaladejo y Cia,  53  Phil., 141; Bank of P.  I. <em>vs.</em> Goocn, et al., 45 Phil., 514; Visayan Distributors, Inc.  <em>vs.</em> Flores,  et  al.,  92  PhiL, 145, 48 Off. Gaz., 4784; Del Rosario <em>vs.</em> Nava,  95 Phil., 637,  50 Off. Gaz., 4189.).</p>
<p>It is lastly  contended  that as plaintiff  or  the lessor had  a  lien in the sugar, produced and failed to proceed against it or enforce such lien, Piaridel Surety &amp; Insurance was released thereby.  There is no allegation to this effect in the complaint, that lessor or  plaintiff ever had possession or control of the sugar, or ever waived or released the lien  thereon.   Appellee cannot raise  the issue in a motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal is hereby reversed, and the appellee ordered  to answer the complaint, with costs.</p>
