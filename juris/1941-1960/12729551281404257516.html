				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction seeking to annul (<em>a</em>)
the order of respondent Judge Enrique A. Fernandez, dated March
19,1951, modifying his decision in civil case No. 13 after respondent
Carlos Iñigo had filed his notice of appeal therein; and (<em>b</em>)
the decision dated March 2, 1951, and the order of respondent Judge
Cirilo C. Maceren in civil case No. 558 for the immediate execution of
said decision, on the ground that they were all rendered and issued
with great abuse of discretion and in excess of their Jurisdiction.
<p align="center"><em> First Cause of Action</em></p>
<p> By virtue of Vesting Order No. P-254, the Philippine Alien Property
Administrates of the United States of America conveyed in fee simple to
the Republic of the Philippines the Bago Iñigo Estate, a parcel of land
containing an area of approximately 273 hectares, situated in the City
of Davao. On November 25, the President of the Philippines designated
the National Abaca and other Fibers Corporation, hereinafter referred
to as NAFCO, as the agency to take over and administer said Bago Iñigo
Estate. Oh May 8, 1950, Carlos Iñigo filed a complaint against the
NAFCO in the Court of First Instance of Davao, which was docketed as
civil case No. 13, praying, among other things, that notwithstanding
the agreement he had with the NAFCO to pay all the expenses and
improvements it had made on said estate and the fact that, as a
consequence of said agreement, he had taken possession of the estate,
the NAFCO still intends and is preparing to strip the hemp on said
estate, and for that reason he prayed that a writ of preliminary
Injunction be issued against the NAFCO, its officers, representatives,
employees and laborers restraining them from entering the property and
stripping the hemp. On May 11, 1950, the NAFCO answered the complaint
denying many of the allegations made therein and stating that the NAFCO
never granted the heirs of FelicianoIñigo permission to enter the
estate, nor to take possession thereof, as said estate is actually
occupied by tenants who had always recognized the NAFCO as the legal
administrator, and, therefore, Carlos Iñigo cannot and will not suffer
any irreparable loss or injury if the injunction prayed for is denied,
for which reasons the NAFCO prayed that the complaint be dismissed. </p>
<p>On May 29, 1950, upon agreement of the parties, the court placed the
property in question under receivership; the present receiver being
Colonel Rafael Ramos of the Philippine Constabulary. On July 22, 1950,
after due trial, respondent Judge Fernandez rendered decision holding
that the Philippine Republic is the owner of the estate, that the same
has not yet been transferred to the Philippine National Bank, and that
the NAFCO was in possession thereof, and ordered the dissolution of the
receivership. Hec dismissed the complaint without pronouncement as to
costs. On November 27, 1950, Carlos Iñigo filed his notice of appeal.
On February 20, 1951, Carlos Iñigo filed a motion stating that in civil
case No. 558 respondent Judge Cirilo C. Maceren rendered a decision
dated January 22, 1951, wherein, among other things, he declared the
heirs of Feliciano Iñigo owners of the Bago Iñigo Estate with full
rights of possession with the solidary obligation to pay to the
Philippine National Bank the sum of P 22,663.29 in fifteen equal annual
installments with interest at the rate of 6 l/2 per annum, ordering at
the same time the register of deeds to transfer and inscribe the title
of the property in the name of said heirs, for which reason Carlos
Iñigo prayed that the decision of respondent Judge Fernandez rendered
on July 22, 1950, be modified accordingly. After hearing the arguments
of both parties, respondent Judge Fernandez Issued an order on March
19,1951, granting the motion and ordering the receiver to turn over the
possession of the property to Carlos iñigo after rendering an
accounting of his administration within 10 days from notice and
ordering the dissolution of the receivership. The Republic of the
Philippines now claims that this order is illegal and arbitrary because
it deprives it of its property without due process of law in that it
was not a party to the proceedings and cannot be sued without Its
consent. This Is one of the orders which are now the subject of the
present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p align="center"><em> Second Cause of Action</em></p>
<p> It likewise appears from the record that on October 27, 1950,
Carlos Iñigo and Remedios Iñigo de Monfort filed a complaint against
the NAFCO and the Philippine National Bank in the Court of First'
Instance of Davao, which was docketed as civil case No. 558, alleging,
among other things, that the NAFCO has assigned the Bago Iñigo Estate
to the Philippine National Bank so that the latter could execute a deed
of sale of the property to the plaintiffs and that the Philippine
National Bank refused to convey the same as recommended by the NAFCO,
and praying that the NAFCO be declared to have lost .all its rights
over the property and the Philippine National Bank be ordered to
execute a deed of sale of said property in their favor. On November 15,
1950, the NAFCO filed its answer to the complaint averring that the
assignment made by the NAFCO of the Bago Iñigo Estate to the Philippine
National Bank was made subject to the approval of the President of the
Philippines who, however, has disapproved the assignment and the NAFCO
has no authority to convey, sell or assign the same. On December 28,
1950, the NAFCO filed a motion praying that plaintiffs be ordered to
include the Republic of the Philippines, the owner of the property, as
defendant, in accordance with the provisions of sections 7 and 11, Rule
3, of the Rules of Court, which motion was objected to by the
plaintiffs. On January 6, 1950, respondent Judge Maceren denied the
motion, whereupon the NAFCO filed with this Court a petition for a writ
of mandamus to compel said respondent Judge to direct the plaintiffs to
include the Republic of the Philippines as party-defendant, but this
Court, in a resolution issued on January 25, 1951, denied the petition,
stating that the question should be raised by appeal in due time. On
January 22, 1951, respondent Judge Maceren rendered decision in said
case No. 558, the dispositive part of which has been stated elsewhere,
from which decision the NAFCO appealed in due time. On February 20,
I95I, plaintiffs filed a motion praying that the execution of the
judgment rendered on January 22, 1951 be ordered in accordance with
Rule 39, section 2, of the Rules of Court, to which the NAFCO objected
offerring to file a supersedeas bond. Respondent Judge, however,
overruled the opposition and on March 2, 1951, issued an order granting
the immediate execution of the judgment. The Republic of the
Philippines now claims that respondent Judge Maceren acted arbitrarily
and without jurisdiction in rendering his decision of January 22,1951,
because it aims directly against the Republic of the Philippines as the
real party in interest in the subject-matter of the controversy and
said Republic is not a party to the proceedings and cannot be sued
without its consent. The decision of January 22, 1951, and the order of
execution of March 2, 1951, are also the subject of this petition for
<i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p align="center"><em> Relief</em></p>
<p> The petition before us seeks the following relief: (l) That the
order of respondent Judge Fernandez dated March 19, 1951, modifying his
decision in civil case No. 13 after respondent Carlos Iñigo had filed
his notice of appeal, be declared null and void as having been rendered
illegally, with great abuse of discretion, and in excess of his
jurisdiction;</p>
<p> (2) that the decision dated January 22, 1951 and the order of
respondent Judge Maceren dated March 2, 1951 for the immediate
execution of said Judgment be also declared null and void as having
been issued unlawfully, with great abuse of discretion, and in excess
of his jurisdiction; and</p>
<p> (3) that a preliminary injunction be issued prohibiting the
respondents, their agents, or representatives, and the register of
deeds of Davao city, from enforcing the order of March 19,1951, of
respondent Judge Fernandez in civil case No. 13, and the order of
respondent Judge Maceren, dated March 2, 1951&gt; issued in civil case
No. 558; or, in the alternative, if said orders have already been
carried out, that an order be issued declaring all acts performed
thereunder by respondents as null and void and of no effect.</p>
<p align="center"><em> Resolution</em></p>
<p> With respect to the first relief, we find that the NAFCO has
already filed its notice of appeal from the order of the court dated
March 19, 1951, stating in the notice that it was appealing to the
Court of Appeals (Annex "D"), and it is to be presumed that the appeal
has been given due course and the case is now pending appeal in the
Court of Appeals. The purpose of the appeal is to have said order
declared null and void not only because the court abused its discretion
and acted without Jurisdiction, but because it was contrary to law and
to the evidence. In other words, the appeal as thus submitted calls for
a decision on the merits. Such being the case, it would seem now
Improper for this Court to act on a petition which calls for the same
purpose and which raises a question which has already been submitted to
the proper court in the exercise of its appellate Jurisdiction. For
this Court to act now on the petition would be premature or would
create a situation which would place this Court in a position to act on
a matter which has already been submitted to the Court of Appeals. It
is, therefore, our considered opinion that, under the circumstances,
the proper course for us to take is to refrain for the present from
acting on this question until after the Court of Appeals had acted on
the appeal and the matter is taken to this Court in due time if we find
the appeal to be meritorious. The same consideration should be made
with respect to the second relief. We also find that the NAFCO and the
Philippine National Bank have already perfected their appeal to the
Court of Appeals from the decision of respondent Judge Maceren dated
January 22, 1951, in civil case No. 558, and it is to be presumed that
the case is now pending appeal in said court (Annex "M"). Said appeal
involves not only the validity of the decision but calls for a
determination of the issues on the merits. It, therefore, also involves
a determination of the same issues involved in this petition for
<i>certiorari</i>. For reasons ofppropriety and orderly Judicial process, we
likewise consider premature to act now on the petition, and we should,
therefore, refrain from acting thereon until such time when the matter
is brought to this Court (in due time) and we find the appeal
meritorious. </p>
<p>With regard to the claim that the order of respondent Judge Maceren
dated March 2, 1951, granting the immediate execution of the decision
rendered in civil case No. 558, was issued with abuse of discretion and
in excess of his jurisdiction, and, therefore, should be declared null
and void, it appearing that the case in chief is now pending in the
Court of Appeals, the petition for relief should be addressed to said
court it being a process in aid of its appellate jurisdiction (Section
h, Rule 67, of the Rules of Court, in connection with section 30 of
Republic Act No. 296).</p>
<p> It may be contended that the Republic of the Philippines can come
to this Court directly and invoke its protection in view of the fact
that the decisions and orders which are the subject of this petition
for <i>certiorari</i> affect said Republic directly because it is the owner in
fee simple of the property subject of the controversy, and it is not a
party to the proceedings and cannot be sued without its consent.
Whether the Republic of the Philippines is the real party in interest
or not, or whether its interest is properly represented by the NAPCO as
the agency expressly designated by the President of the Philippines to
administer the Bago Iñigo Estate and to dispose thereof in accordance
with law pursuant to the authority granted by Republic Act No. 8, we
are not now in a position to determine as the case in chief, wherein
all these questions are raised and controverted, is not before this
Court, but before the Court of Appeals. Be that as it may, we do not
consider 7it now opportune to act on this matter in view of the
resolution of this Court issued on January 25, 1951, wherein the right
of the Republic to Intervene in civil case No. 558 has been passed upon
(G.R. No. L-4493). In said resolution, we held that the question
regarding the Intervention of the Republic should be raised by appeal
in due time, and the case having been appealed, it is to be presumed
that the NAFCO has again raised the same question for the resolution of
the court. If the case later reaches this Court it will then be the
time for us to act on the matter if the issue Is again submitted for
our consideration. To act on the matter now would be premature.</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing, the petition should be dismissed, without
pronouncement as to costs. The preliminary injunction issued is hereby
dissolved.
