				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These cases are before this Court on appeal from an order of dismissal for failure to prosecute.
<p>The cases seek recovery of indemnity for cargo lost or damaged.
Commenced in the Court of First Instance of Manila in 1947, they there
lay idle for an unreasonable length of time and were for that reason
ordered dismissed on August 14, 1951, pursuant to section 3 of Rule 30,
Rules of Court. Plaintiffs asked for a reconsideration. But
reconsideration was denied. Hence this appeal.</p>
<p>The pertinent portion of the Rule cited says that "when plaintiff *
* * fails to prosecute his action for an unreasonable length of time, *
* * the action may be dismissed upon motion of the defendant or upon
the court's own motion." The dismissal of an action pursuant to this
rule rests upon the sound discretion of the court and will not be
reversed on appeal in the absence of abuse. The burden of showing abuse
of judicial discretion is upon appellant since every presumption is in
favor of the correctness of the court's action.</p>
<p>The appellants contend that under sections 1, 2, and 3 of Rule 31,
Rules of Court, it is the duty of the clerk of court and not of the
plaintiff to include a case in the trial calendar after the issues are
joined and that it is also the duty of the clerk of court and not the
plaintiff to fix the date for trial and to cause a notice to be served
upon the parties. But the duty imposed upon the clerk in these sections
of the Rules does not relieve the plaintiff of his own duty to
prosecute the case diligently, for the non-performance of that duty by
plaintiff is by section 3 of Rule 30 made an express ground for
dismissing the action. If the clerk, therefore, in the present cases
had been negligent, it was plaintiff's duty to call the court's
attention to that fact so that the administration of justice would not
suffer delay.</p>
<p>By way of justifying the long delay in the prosecution of these
cases, appellants alleged in their motion for reconsideration in the
court below that there were more than 500 of these cases and that the
attorneys for plaintiffs had been endeavoring to have their trial by
making proper representations to the different judges to which the
cases were assigned; that they also sought an understanding with
defendants' counsel to have a few of those cases considered as test
cases; that trial of those test cases was begun but was not finished
because of the pendency of many treason cases and the promotion of
Judge Dionisio de Leon, who was trying the said cases, to the Court of
Appeals; and that it was only recently that all these cases were
assigned to Branch C of the court and that the deputy clerk of court
has <em>motu proprio</em> been setting the more than 500 cases every
Tuesday and Thursday at the rate of 4 cases a day at the beginning and
later at the rate of two a day, so that there was no longer need for
plaintiffs to file any motion to set the cases for trial. Apparently
these excuses were not believed by the trial Judge, who was in a
position to know the truth, for he refused to reconsider his order of
dismissal. Moreover, explanations are refuted by counsel for the
appellee steamship companies, who state in their brief that there never
was any test case in the court below for the steamship companies
refused to agree to have a test case to determine their liability in
all the other cases because the facts and points of law involved in
said cases were not squarely identical; that the delay in terminating
the trial of those alleged test cases (Civil Cases Nos. 2934 and 3496)
could not have been due to the promotion of Judge De Leon to the Court
of Appeals because the trial was resumed on August 9, 1950, before the
successor of Judge De Leon, which was long before the dismissal of the
present cases; that the pendency of many treason cases was no
impediment for the prosecution of the civil cases; and that the fact
that the clerk of court had begun setting the cases since August 1,
1951, can be no justification for plaintiff's failure to ask for trial
long before that time.</p>
<p>The record before us does not clearly show that plaintiffs have made
a diligent and persistent effort to expedite the disposition of these
suits to a degree sufficient to justify a pronouncement on our part
that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering their dismissal
and in not granting plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of that
order. And plaintiffs' last minute attempt to place the cases on the
trial calendar three or four years after issues had been joined and on
or near the date the order of dismissal was handed down, in no way
strengthens their position.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal is therefore, affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
