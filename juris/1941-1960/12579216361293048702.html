				<H3>MARIANO S. GONZAGA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. AUGUSTO CE DAVID, AS REGISTRAR OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES OFFICE OF CAGAYAN, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The essential antecedents of this case are not disputed. On February, 1957, 
Mariano Gonzaga, as owner, registered with the Motor Vehicles Office a cargo 
truck and a passenger bus, paying the first installment for registration fees 
due on said vehicles for 1957. To cover the second installment for registration 
fees, Gonzaga remitted to the Provincial Treasurer of Cagayan, by registered 
mail, P500.00, under postal money orders Nos. 18553, 18554 and 18555, purchased 
from and issued by the Post Office of Camalaniugan, Cagayan. The postal 
cancellation mark on the envelope containing the remittance of Gonzaga bears the 
date August 31, 1957; so does the postal cancellation mark on the face of the 
money orders.
<p>The Registrar of the Motor Vehicles Office of Cagayan ruled that pursuant to 
Section 8(1), Act 3992, otherwise known as the Revised Motor Vehicle Law, the 
second installment for registration fees was payable on or before the last 
working day of August; that the last working day of August, 1957 was Friday, 
August 30, 1957; that consequently, the, remittance of Gonzaga bearing postal 
cancellation mark dated August 31, 1957 was made beyond the time fixed by law. 
Accordingly, said official sought to impose a 50% delinquency penalty, or 
otherwise, threatened to confiscate the certificate of registration for the two 
trucks (Annexes "B" &amp; "C").</p>
<p>Gonzaga brought this action in the Court of First Instance, which, upon a 
stipulation of facts, rendered judgment, the dispositive part reading—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Por tanto, el Juzgado dicta decision declarando, como por la presente 
declara, que el pago hecho con los giros postales Nos. 18553, 18554 y 18555, por 
el recurrente, se ha hecho dentro del plazo fijado por ley; y, por tanto, el 
reccurente no ha incurrido con morosidad en cuanto a dicho pago.</p>
<p>Se ordena al recurrido, sus agentes y representantes, que se abstengan de 
confiscar el certificado de registro de los dos trucks del recurrente, por la 
alegada morosidad del citado pago.</p>
<p>Sin costas.</p>
<p>ASI SE ORDENA."</p></blockquote>
<p>The only issue in this appeal, is wKether the remittance of petit 
umar-appelleecovering the second installment of registration fees for 1957, made 
by.registered mail with postal cancellation dated August 31, 1957, was within 
the time fixed by law. . </p>
<p>The following are the pertinent provisions of Act 3992, as amended— -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 8(I) "* * * The registration' fees provided in this Act for trucks may 
be payable in two equal installments, the first to be paid on or before the'last 
working day of February, and the second to be paid <em>on or before the 
last</em> working day of August." (Italics supplied)</p>
<p>Sec. 6(b) <em>"The date of ca/ncellation of the postage stamps</em> of 
envelopes containing money orders, checks, or cash shall be considered as the 
date of application. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>In support of its contention that August 30, and not August 31, was the last 
wording day of August, 1957, respondent-appellant invokes Republic Act No. 1880, 
otherwise known as the "40-Hour Week Law", pursuant to which government offices 
are to hold office from Monday to Friday only, unless one of those expressly 
exempted therefrom.</p>
<p>As correctly held by the court below, the fact that, pursuant to Republic Aet 
1880, the Motor Vehicles Office in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, had no office on 
Saturday, August 31, 1957, is immaterial1 in the case. The last working day 
contemplated in Sec. 8(1) of Act 3992 as amended should not necessarily mean the 
last working day for the Motor Vehicle office. Under Sec. 6(b) of said Act, 
providing for payment of registration fees by mail, the date of cancellation of 
the postage stamps of the envelope containing the remittance is considered the 
date of application. Consequently, Where the manner of payment falls under said 
Section 6 (b), the law, in recognizing the <em>date of cancellation</em> as the 
date of application, impliedly permits of a remittance or payment within that 
last day of August that the Post Office may still effect cancellation; and the 
remittance, in fact, bears a postal cancellation, dated August 31, 1957. 
Moreover, it is not pretended by respondent appellant that the Post Office 
ceased, or has ceased, to transact business and discharge its functions on 
Saturdays by reason alone of Republic Act No. 1880. Clearly, therefore, the 
remittance by petitioner-appellee was within the time fixed by law, as provided 
in "Section 8(1), in connection with Section 6(b) of Act 3992, as amended.</p>
<p>The fact that August 31, 1957 was declared a special public holiday by 
Proclamation No. 437 (dated August 21, 1957) of the President of the Philippines 
did not have the effect of making the preceding day, August 30, the last day for 
paying registration fees without penalty. On the contrary, Section 31 of the 
Revised Administrative Code provides—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 31. <em>Pretermission of holiday</em>.—Where the day, or the last day, 
for doing any act required or permitted by law falls on a holiday, the act may 
be done on the next succeeding business day."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Calano <em>vs</em>. Cruz, 91 Phil., 247, we ruled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The complaint filed by the petitioner herein was presented in the court 
<em>a quo</em> on November 23, 1951, exactlly on the eighth day after the 
proclamation of the respondent as duly elected councilor for the municipality of 
Orion, Bataan. It happens, however, that November. 22, 1951, the last day of the 
seven-day period prescribed by Section 173 of the Revised Election Code, was 
declared a "Special Public Holiday For National Thanksgiving" by Proclamation 
No. 290, serje's of 1951, of the President of the Philippines. The trial court 
Held that the provisions of Section 1 of Rule 28 of the Rules of Court could not 
be applied to the case at bar because it is an election case (Rule 132, Rules of 
Court), and declared that the complaint was filed outside of the period provided 
for by law. Assuming that Section 1 of Rule 28 of the Rules of Court is not 
applicable, the law applicable is Section 81 of the Revised Administrative Code, 
which provides that "Where the day, or the last day, for doing any act required 
or permitted by law falls on a <em>holiday</em>, the act may be done on the next 
succeeding business day." The court <em>a quo</em>, therefore, committed an 
error in declaring that the complaint was filed out of time." . 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The ruling is on all fours on the issue before us, and against 
respondent-appellant.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is affirmed. Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
