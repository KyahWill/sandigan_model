				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At about one o'clock in the afternoon of May 26,1927, the steamer <i>S. S. Negros</i>, belonging to petitioner here, Teodoro R. Yangco, left the port of Romblon on its return trip  to Manila.  Typhoon signal  No. 2 was then up,  of which fact the  captain was duly  advised and his  attention  thereto called by the passengers themselves before the vessel set sail.  The boat  was overloaded as indicated  by the loadine which was 6 to  7 inches below the surface of the water.  Baggage, trunks and other equipments were heaped on the upper deck, the hold being packed to capacity.  In addition, the vessel  carried thirty sacks of  crushed marble and about one hundred sacks of copra and some lumber. The passengers, numbering about 180,  were overcrowded, the vessel's capacity being limited to only 123 passengers. After two hours of sailing, the boat encountered strong winds and rough seas between the islands of Banton and Simara, and as the waves splashed the ladies' dresses, the awnings were ordered lowered.   As  the  sea  became  increasingly violent, the captain ordered the vessel to turn left, evidently to return to port, but in the maneuver, the vessel was caught sidewise by a big wave which caused it to capsize and sink.  Many of the passengers died in the mishap, among them being Antolin Aldana and his son Victorioso, husband and  son, respectively, of Emilia Bienvenida who, together with her other children and a brother-in-law, are respondents in G.R.  No.  47447; Casiana Laserna, the daughter  of  respondents Manuel Laserna and  P. A. de Laserna in G. B. No. 47448; and Genaro Basaña, son of Filomeno  Basana, respondent in G.R. No. 47449.   These respondents instituted in the Court of First Instance of Capiz separate civil actions against petitioner here to  recover damages for the death of the passengers  aforementioned. The court awarded the heirs of Antolin and Victorioso Aldana  the  sum of P2,000; the heirs of Casiana Laserna, P590; and those of Genaro  Basana, also P590.  After the rendition  of the judgment to this effect, petitioner, by a verified pleading, sought to abandon the vessel to the plaintiffs in  the three cases, together with all its equipments, without prejudice to his right to appeal.  The abandonment having been denied,  an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals, wherein all the  judgments were affirmed except that which awarded to the Aldanas  the sum of P2,000, which sum was increased to P4,000.  Petitioner, now deceased, appealed and is here represented by his legal representative.<br><br>Brushing aside the  incidental issues, the fundamental question here raised is: May the shipowner or agent, notwithstanding the total  loss of the vessel as a result of the negligence of its captain, be properly held liable in damages for the consequent death of its passengers?  We are of the opinion  and so hold that this question is controlled by the provision of article 587 of the Code of Commerce.  Said article reads:<br><br><blockquote>"The agent shall also be civilly liable for the indemnities in favor of third persons which arise from the conduct of the captain in the care of the goods which the vessel carried; but he may exempt himself therefrom by abandoning the vessel with all her equipments and  the freight he may have earned during the voyage."<br></blockquote><br>The provision accords a shipowner or agent the right of abandonment; and by necessary implication, his liability is confined to that which he is  entitled as of right to  abandon—"the vessel with all her equipments and the freight it may have earned during the voyage."  It is true that the article appears to deal only with the limited liability of shipowners or agents for damages arising from the misconduct of the captain in the care of the goods which the vessel carries, but this is a mere deficiency of language and in no way indicates the true extent of such liability.  The consensus of authorities is to the effect that notwithstanding the language of the aforequoted provision,  the benefit of limited liability therein provided for, applies in all cases wherein the shipowner or agent may properly be held liable for the negligent or illicit acts of the captain.  Dr. Jose Ma. Gonzalez de Echavarri y Vivanco, commenting on said article, said:<br><br><blockquote>"La letra del Codigo, en  el articulo 587, presenta una gravisima cuestion.  El derecho de abandono, si se atiende a lo  escrito, solo se refiere a las indemnizaciones a <i>que diere lugar la conducta del Capitan en la custodia de los efectos que cargo en el buque.</i><br><br>"¿Es ese el espiritu del legislador?  No; ¿habra derecho de abandono en las responsabilidades nacidas de obligaciones contraidas por el Capitan y de otros actos de este?  Lo reputamos evidente y, para fortalecer nuestra opinion, basta copiar el siguiente parrafo de la Exposicidn de motivos:<br><br>" 'El proyecto, al aplicar estos principios, se inspira tambien en los  intereses del comercio maritimo, que quedaran mas asegurados ofreciendo a todo el que contrata con el naviero o Capitan del buque, la garantia real del mismo, cualesquiera que sean las facultades o atribuciones de que se hallen  investidos.'"   (Echavarri, C6digo de  Comercio, Tamo 4, 2." ed., pags. 483-484.)</blockquote><br>A cursory examination will disclose that the principle of limited liability of a shipowner or agent is provided for in but three articles of the Code  of  Commerce—article 587 aforequoted and articles 590 and 837.  Article 590 merely reiterates the principle embodied in article 587, where the vessel is owned by several persons.   Article 837 applies the same principle in cases of collision, and it has been observed that said article is but "a necessary consequence of the right to abandon the vessel given to the shipowner in article 587 of the Code, and it is one of the many superfluities contained in the Code."  (Lorenzo Benito, <i>Lecciones</i> 352,  quoted in Philippine Shipping Co. vs. Garcia, 6 Phil., 281,  282.)   In effect, therefore,  only  articles 587  and 590 are the provisions contained in our Code of Commerce on the matter, and the framers of said code had intended  those provisions to embody the universal  principle of limited liability in  all cases.  Thus, in the "Exposicion de Motivos" of the Code of Commerce, we read:<br><br><blockquote>"The present code (1829)  does not determine the  juridical status of the  agent where such agent is not himself the owner of the vessel.  This omission is supplied by the proposed code, which provides in accordance with the principles of maritime law that by agent it is to be understood the person intrusted with the provisioning of the vessel, or the one who represents her in the port in which she happens to be.  This person is the only one who represents the vessel—that  is to say, the only one who represents the interests of the owner of the vessel.   This provision has therefore cleared the doubt which existed as to the extent of the liability, both of the agent and of the owner of the vessel.  Such  liability  is limited by the proposed code to the <i>value of the vessel</i> and other things appertaining thereto."</blockquote><br>In Philippine Shipping Co.  <i>vs.</i> Garcia  (6 Phil.,  281, 284-286), we have expressed ourselves in such a comprehensive manner as to leave no room for  doubt on the applicability of our  <i>ratio  decidendi</i>  not  only to cases of collision but also to those of shipwrecks, etc.  We said:<br><br><br><br><blockquote>"This is the difference which exists between the lawful acts and lawful
obligations of the captain and the liability which he incurs on account
of any unlawful act committed by him. In the first case, the lawful
acts and obligations of the captain beneficial to the vessel may be
enforced as against the agent for the reason that such obligations
arise from the the contract of agency (provided, however, that the
captain does not exceed his authority), while as to any liability
incurred by the captain through his unlawful acts, the ship agent is
simply subsidiarily civilly liable. This liability of the agent is
limited to the vessel and it does not extend further. For this reason
the Code of Commerce makes the agent liable to the extent of the value
of the vessel, as the codes of the principal maritime nations provide,
with the vessel, and not individually. Such is also the spirit of our
Code.<br><br>"The spirit of our code is accurately set forth in a
treatise on maritime law, from which we deem proper to quote the
following as the basis of this decision:<br><br>" 'That which distinguishes the maritime  from the civil law and even from the mercantile law in general is the <i>real and hypothecary</i>
nature of the former, and the many securities of a reed nature that
maritime customs from time immemorial, the laws, the codes, and the
later jurisprudence, have provided for the protection of the various
and conflicting interests which are ventured and risked in maritime
expeditions, such as the interests of the vessel and of the agent,
those of the owners of the cargo and consignees, those who salvage the
ship, those who make loans upon the cargo, those of the sailors and
members of the crew as to their wages, and those of a constructor as to
repairs made to the vessel.<br><br>" 'As evidence of this <i>real</i>
nature of the maritime law we have (1) the limitation of the liability
of the agents to the actual value of the vessel and the freight money,
and (2) the right to retain the cargo and the embargo and detention of
the vessel even in cases where the ordinary civil law would not allow
more than a personal action against the debtor or person liable. It
will be observed that these rights are correlative, and naturally so,
because if the agent can exempt himself from liability by abandoning
the vessel and freight money, thus avoiding the possibility of risking
his whole fortune in the business, it is also just that his maritime
creditor may for any reason attach the vessel it- self to secure his
claim without waiting for a settlement of his rights by a final
judgment, even to the prejudice of a third person.<br><br>" 'This  repeals the civil law to such an extent that, in certain cases,  where the <i>mortgaged property</i>
is lost no personal action lies against the owner or agent of the
vessel. For instance, where the vessel is lost the sailors and members
of the crew cannot recover their wages; in case of collision, the
liability of the agent is limited as aforesaid, and in case of
shipwreck, those who loan their money on the vessel and cargo lose all
their rights and cannot claim reimbursement under the law.<br><br>"
There are two reasons why it is impossible to do away with these
privileges, to wit: (1) The risk to which the thing is exposed, and (2)
the <i>real</i> nature of the maritime law, exclusively <i>real</i>,
according to which the liability of the parties is limited to a thing
which is at the mercy of the waves. If the agent is only liable with
the vessel and freight money and both may be lost through the accidents
of navigation it is only just that the maritime creditor have some
means to obviating this precarious nature of his rights by detaining
the ship, his only security, before it is lost.<br><br>" 'The liens,
tacit or legal, which may exist upon the vessel and which a purchaser
of the same would be obliged to respect and recognize are—in addition
to those existing in favor of the State by virtue of the privileges
which are granted to it by all the laws—pilot, tonnage, and port dues
and other similar charges, the wages of the crew earned during the last
voyage as provided in article 646 of the Code of Commerce, salvage dues
under article 842, the indemnification due to the captain of the vessel
in case his contract is terminated on account of the voluntary sale of
the ship and the insolvency of the owner as provided in article 60S,
and all other liabilities arising from collisions under articles 837
and 838.' " We are shared in this conclusion by the eminent
commentators on the subject. Agustin Vicente y Gella, asserting, in his
"Introduction al Derecho Mercantil Comparado" 1929 (pages 374-375), the
like principle of limited liability of shipowners or agent in cases of
accidents, collisions, shipwrecks, etc., said:<br><br><blockquote>"De las responsabilidades que pueden resultar como consequencia del comercio maritimo, y no s61o por hechos propios  sino tambien por las que  se ocasionen por los del capitan y la tripulacion, responde frente a tercero el naviero que representa el buque; pero el derecho maritimo es sobre todo tradicional y siguiendo  un viejo principio de la Edad Media la  responsabilidad  del  naviero se  organiza de un modo especifico y particularisimo que no encuentra similar en el  derecho general  de las obligaciones.<br><br>"Una forma corrientisima  de verificarse el comercio maritimo durante la epoca medieval, era prestar un propietario su navio para que cargase en el mercancias determinada persona, y se hiciese a la mar, yendo al frente de la expedici6n un patron del buque, que Uegado al puerto de destino  se encargaba  de venderlas y retornaba al de salida despues de adquirir en aquel otros efectos que igualmente revendia a su regreso, verificado lo cual los beneficios de la expedition se repartian entre el dueno del buque, el cargador y el capitan y tripulantes en la proportion estipulada. El derecho maritimo empez6 a considerar la asociaci6n asi formada como una verdadera sociedad mercantil, de respon- sabilidad  limitada, y de  acuerdo con los  principios que gobiernan aquella en los casos de accidentes, abordajes, naufragios, etc., se resolvia que el dueno del buque  perdia la nave, el cargador las mercancias embarcadas y el capitan y la tripulacion su trabajo, sin que en ningiin caso el tercer acreedor pudiese reclamar mayor cantidad de ninguno de ellos, porque su responsabilidad quedaba limitada a Io que cada uno aporto a la sociedad.  Recogidas estas ideas en el derecho comercial de tiempos posteriores, la responsabilidad del naviero se edifico sobre aquellos principios, y derogando la norma general civil de que del cumplimiento de sus obligaciones responde el deudor con todos sus bienes presentes y futuros, la responsabilidad maritima se considero siempre limitada <i>ipso jure</i> al patrimonio de mar.  Y este es el origen de la regla trascendental de derecho maritimo segun la cual el naviero se libera de toda responsabilidad abandonando el buque y el flete a favor de los acreedores."<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>From the <i>Enciclopedia Jitridiea Española</i>, Vol. 23, p. 347, we read:<br><br><blockquote>"Ahora bien: ¿hasta donde se extiende esta responsabilidad del naviero? ¿sobre que bienes pueden  los acreedores resarcirse?  fista es  otra especialidad  del  Derecho maritimo; en el Derecho comun la responsabilidad es limitada; tambien lo era en el antiguo  Derecho maritimo romano; se daba la <i>actio exercitoria</i> contra <i>el exercitor navis</i>  sin ninguna restriction, pero en la Edad Media una  idea nueva se introdujo en los usos maritimos.  Las cargas resultantes de las expediciones maritimas se consideraron limitadas por los propietarios  de las naves a los valores comprometidos por ellos en cada expedicidn; se  separd ficticiamente el patrimonio de los navieros en dos  partes que todavia se designan de una manera bastante exacta; fortuna de tierra y fortuna de mar o flotante; y se admitio la teoria de que esta era la que respondia s6o de las deudas provinientes de los actos del capitan o de la tripulacidn, es decir,  que el con junto del patrimonio del  naviero escaparia a estas cargas desde el momento en  que abandonara  la nave y los fletes a los acreedores.  *   *  *"<br></blockquote><br>Escriche in his<i> Diccionario de  la Legislaci&amp;n y Jurisprudencia</i>, Vol.  1, p. 38,  observes:<br><br><blockquote>"La responsabilidad del naviero, en el caso expuesto, se funda en el principio  de derecho comun  de ser responsable todo el que pone al frente de un establecimiento a una persona, de los danos o perjuicios que ocasionare esta desempefiando su cometido, y en que estando facultado el naviero para  la eleccion de  capitan de la  nave,  viene  a tener indirectamente culpa  en la negligencia o actos de este que o casionaron danos o perjuicios, puesto que no se aseguro de su pericia o buena fe.  Limitase, sin embargo, la responsabilidad  del naviero a la perdida de la nave, sus aparejos, y fletes devengados  durante el viaje;  porque no pudiendo vigilar de un modo directo e inmediato la conducta del capitan, hubiera sido duro hacerla extensiva a todos sus bienes que podria comprometer el capitan con sus faltas o delitos."</blockquote><br>The views of these learned commentators, including those of Estasen (Derecho Mercantil, Vol. 4, p. 259) and Supino (Derecho Mercantil, pp. 463-464), leave'nothing to be desired and nothing to be doubted on the principle.   It only remains to be noted that the rule of limited liability provi- ded for in our Code of Commerce reflects merely, or is but a restatement, imperfect though it is, of the almost universal principle on the subject.   While previously under the civil or common law, the owner of a vessel was liable to the full amount for damages caused by the misconduct of the master, by  the general maritime law of modern Europe, the liability of the shipowner was subsequently limited to his interest in the vessel.  (Norwich &amp; N. Y. Trans. Co. v. Wright, 80 U. 3. 104, 20  Law. ed. 585.)  A similar limitation was placed by the British Parliament upon the liability of English shipowners through a series of statutes beginning in 1734 with the Act of 7 George II, chapter 15.  The legislatures of Massachusetts and Maine  followed  suit in 1818 and 1821,  and finally, Congress enacted the Limited Liability Act  of March  3,  1851, embodying most of the provisions contained in the British Statutes (see 24 R. C L. pp. 1387-1389).  Section 4283 of the Revised Statutes  (sec. 183, Tit. 46, Code of Laws of U. S. A.)  reads:<br><br><blockquote>"LIABILITY OF OWNER NOT TO EXCEED INTEREST.—The liability of the owner of any vessel, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction, by any person, of any property, goods, or merchandise, shipped or put on board of such vessel, or for any loss,  damage, or injury by collision, or for any act, matter or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred without the privity, or knowledge of such owner or owners, shall in no case exceed the amount or value of the interest of such  owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending"<br></blockquote><br>The policy which the rule  is designed  to promote is the encouragement of shipbuilding and investment in maritime commerce.  (Vide: Norwich  &amp; N.  Y. Trans. Co. v. Wright, <i>supra</i>; The Main v. Williams, 152  U. S. 122; 58 C. J. 634.) And it is  in that spirit that the American courts construed the Limited Liability Act of Congress whereby the immunities of the Act were applied to claims not only for lost goods but also for injuries and "loss of life of passengers, whether arising under the general law of admiralty, or under Federal or State statutes."   (The <i>City  of Columbus</i>, 22 Fed. 460; The <i>Longfellow</i>, 104  Fed. 360; Butler v. Boston &amp; Savannah Steamship Co., 32 Law. ed.  1017; Craig v. Continental Insurance Co., 35 Law. ed. 836.)  The Supreme Court of the United States in Norwich &amp; N. Y. Trans.  Co. v. Wright, 80 U. S. 104, 20 Law. ed. 585,  589-590, accounting for the history of the principle, clinches our exposition of the supporting authorities:<br><br><blockquote>"The  history of the limitation of liability of shipowners is matter  of common knowledge.  The learned opinion of <i>Judge</i> Ware in the case of <i>The Rebecca</i>,  1 Ware, 187-194, leaves little to be desired on the subject.  He shows that it originated in the maritime law of modern Europe;  that whilst the civil, as well as the common law, made the owner responsible to the whole extent of damage caused by  the wrongful act or negligence of the master or crew, the maritime law  only made them liable (if personally  free from blame) to the amount of their interest in the ship. So that, if they surrendered the ship, they were discharged.<br><br>"Grotius, in his law of War and  Peace, says that men would be  deterred from investing  in ships if they thereby incurred the  apprehension of being  rendered  liable to an indefinite amount by the acts of the master and, therefore, in Holland, they  had never observed the Roman Law on that subject, but had a regulation that the ship owners should be bound  no farther  than the value  of their ship and freight.  His words are: '<i>Navis et eorum quae in navi sunt,</i>' 'the ship and goods therein.'  But he is speaking of the owner's  interest; and this,  as to the cargo, is the freight thereon, and in that sense he  is understood by the commentators.  Boulay Paty, Droit Maritime, tit. 3, sec. 1, p. 276; Book II,  c. XI, sec. XIII.  The maritime law, as codified in  the celebrated French <i>Ordonance de  la Marine</i>, in 1681, expressed the rule thus: 'The proprietors of vessels shall be responsible for the acts of the master, but they shall be discharged by abandoning the ship and freight/ Valin, in his commentary on this passage, lib. 2, tit. 8, art. 2, after specifying certain engagements of the master which are binding on the  owners, without any limit of responsibility, such as contracts for the benefit of the vessel, made during the voyage  (except contracts of bottomry)  says: 'With these exceptions it is just that the owner should not be bound for the acts of the  master, except to  the amount of the ship and freight.  Otherwise he would run the risk of being ruined by  the bad faith or negligence of his cap- tain, and the apprehension of this would be fatal to the interests of  navigation.  It is quite  sufficient that  he be exposed to the  loss  of his ship and of the freight, to make it his interest, independently of any goods he may have on board to select a reliable captain.'  Pardessus  says: The owner is bound civilly for all delinquencies  committed by the captain within  the scope of his authority, but he may discharge himself therefrom by  abandoning the ship and freight; and, if they are lost, it suffices for his discharge, to surrender all claims in respect of the ship and its freight/ such as insurance,  etc.  <i>Droit Commercial</i>,  part 3,  tit. 2, c. 3, sec. 2.<br><br>"The same general doctrine is laid down by many other writers on maritime law.   So that it  is evident that, by this law, the owner's  liability  was  coextensive  with his interest in the vessel and its freight, and ceased by his abandonment and surrender of these to the parties sustaining loss."</blockquote><br>In the light of all the foregoing, we therefore hold that if the shipowner or agent may in any way be held civilly liable at all for injury to or death of passengers arising from the negligence of the captain in cases of collisions or shipwrecks, his liability is merely co-extensive with his interest in the vessel such that a total loss thereof results in its extinction.  In arriving at this conclusion, we have not been unmindful of the fact that the illfated steamship Negros, as a vessel engaged in interisland trade, is a common carrier  (De Villata v.  Stanely, 32 Phil., 541), and that the as a vessel engaged in interisland trade, is a common carrier (De Villata v. Stanely, 32  Phil.,  541), and that the relationship between the petitioner and the passengers who died in the mishap rests on a contract of carriage.  But assuming that petitioner is liable for a breach of contract of carriage, the  exclusively "real and hypotheeary nature" of maritime law operates to limit such liability to the value of the vessel, or to the insurance thereon, if any.  In the instant case it  does not appear that  the vessel  was insured.<br><br>Whether the abandonment of the vessel sought by the petitioner in the instant case was in accordance with law or not, is  immaterial.  The  vessel  having totally perished, any act of abandonment would  be an  idle ceremony.<br><br>Judgment is reversed and petitioner is hereby absolved of all the complaints,  without costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.J., Abad Santos, Diaz, Laurel, Horrilleno</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ozaeta, JJ</span>.,  concur.</div>
