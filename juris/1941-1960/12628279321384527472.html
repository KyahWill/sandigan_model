				<H3>BENITO TAN CHAT, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. C. N. HODGES, ET  AL.,  DEFENDANTS; C.  N.  HODGES,  DEFENDANT  AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant-appellant, C. N. Hodges,&nbsp; was the owner of three lots which he sold on July 6, 1941 to the plaintiff-appellee,&nbsp; Benito Tan&nbsp; Chat,, for P15.105.&nbsp; The latter paid PS,105&nbsp; in cash and mortgaged the lots in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellant to secure&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of the balance&nbsp; of P12,000. The appellant&nbsp; handed over&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appellee a printed&nbsp; form of&nbsp; mortgage contract&nbsp; which the&nbsp; appellee more&nbsp; or less&nbsp; followed&nbsp; in drafting&nbsp; the deed of mortgage actually executed and signed by him.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of appellee's failure&nbsp; to comply with&nbsp; its conditions,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant filed a petition with&nbsp; the sheriff of Iloilo City for&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; of the&nbsp; mortgaged lots in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of Act No. 31S5 as amended.&nbsp; The corresponding notice was , made and the sale at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; was set for November&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1953. Whereupon&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee filed in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo&nbsp; a petition for prohibition with injunction.&nbsp; After&nbsp; trial&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision granting the petition&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordering the defendants C. N. Hodges and the sheriff of Iloilo&nbsp; City to desist from carrying out the scheduled sale.&nbsp; The defendant C. N. Hodges has appealed.<br><br>The main issue&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; decided is whether or&nbsp; not the deed&nbsp; of mortgage&nbsp; contains a special&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; foreclose extra-judicially. The model printed form, Exhibit E, contains in paragraph 7 of the condition that&nbsp; "this mortgage shall, after&nbsp; notice to the&nbsp; mortgagor, be considered automatically foreclosed, without the necessity&nbsp; of&nbsp; any judicial proceedings upon the failure of the mortgagor (to comply with the conditions therein specified)"; and, in paragraph 8, the condition that "when this&nbsp; mortgage is automatically foreclosed for&nbsp; any of the&nbsp; causes or reasons&nbsp; enumerated in the next preceding paragraph, the mortgagee is hereby authorized by the mortgagor to take possession of the property&nbsp; herein&nbsp; mortgage without the&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; of resorting to&nbsp; any court&nbsp; proceeding's, or&nbsp; any other&nbsp; judicial action."&nbsp;&nbsp; These provisions were omitted in the deed of mortgage, Exhibit D, actually executed by&nbsp; the appellee in favor of the appellant, although&nbsp; this contains the following conditions:<br><blockquote>"3. It is also stipulated tliat the mortgagee,&nbsp; in selling the property at public&nbsp; auction, shall follow the procedure provided for in Act No. 3135, the MORTGAGOR in any case to be notified&nbsp; by the MORTGAGEE in writing&nbsp; by registered mail of the sale.<br><br>"4. It is further&nbsp; agreed and stipulated&nbsp; that the&nbsp; conditions and stipulations set forth in the&nbsp; preceding paragraphs shall not be construed as depriving the mortgagee of his right to institute the corresponding judicial&nbsp; proceedings to foreclose this mortgage if, in the opinion of the mortgagee, Ms interests require such an action."<br></blockquote>It is contended for&nbsp; the appellee that the elimination from Exhibit D of the conditions contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Exhibit E shows a clear intention on his part to disauthorize extra-judicial foreclosure; and&nbsp; that, in any event, the&nbsp; special&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; foreclose&nbsp; extra-judicially referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; in&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 3185&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; specific&nbsp; and unequivocal.<br><br>Upon the other hand, it is the theory of the appellant that while the provisions&nbsp; contained in paragraphs 3 and 4 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; mortgage, Exhibit&nbsp; D,&nbsp; do not&nbsp; contain direct phaseology, they nevertheless amount to an&nbsp; express authority&nbsp; to foreclose extra-judicially.<br><br>We are inclined&nbsp; to rule in favor of appellant's&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; Section 1&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; No. 3135, as amended&nbsp; by Act No. 4118,&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; "when a sale is&nbsp; made under a special power inserted in or attached to&nbsp; any real estate mortgage hereafter made&nbsp; as security&nbsp; for the payment of money or&nbsp; the fulfillment of any other obligations, the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; following sections&nbsp; shall&nbsp; govern as to the manner in which the sale and&nbsp; redemption shall be effected, whether or not provisions for the same is made in the&nbsp; power."&nbsp; The&nbsp; sale&nbsp; spoken of is&nbsp; extra-judicial. Paragraphs 3 and&nbsp; 4 of the deed of mortgage, Exhibit D, taken together,&nbsp; is&nbsp; plainly an express authority&nbsp; for the mortgagee to&nbsp; foreclose extra-judicially. It is&nbsp; noteworthy that paragraph&nbsp; 3 is to the&nbsp; effect that the mortgagee, in selling the property at public&nbsp; auction, shall follow the procedure prescribed in Act No.&nbsp; 3135, the mortgagor to be notified by the mortgagee&nbsp; in&nbsp; writing by&nbsp; registered mail of the date of the sale; and paragraph 4 reserves to the mortgagee&nbsp; the right to foreclose&nbsp; judicially.&nbsp; If these&nbsp; were not intended to allow extra-judicial foreclosure, the procedure prescribed in Act No. 3135 would not have been mentioned&nbsp; and the mortgagee would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have been required to notify the mortgagor in writing by registered mail of the sale;&nbsp; and the right&nbsp; would not be reserved to the mortgagee to institute judicial foreclosure proceedings.&nbsp; This reservation necessarily implies&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of another right, namely,&nbsp; the only remaining remedy of extra-judicial&nbsp; foreclosure.&nbsp; The&nbsp; omission in Exhibit&nbsp; D of paragraphs 7 and 8 contained in the printed form, Exhibit E is of no moment since paragraphs 3 and 4 of the deed of mortgage are already sufficient.<br><blockquote>"While it has been held that&nbsp; a power of sale will not be recognized as contained in a mortgage unless it&nbsp; is given by express grant and in clear and explicit terms, and that there can be no implied power of sale where&nbsp; a mortgage holds by a deed absolute In form,&nbsp; it is generally held that no particular formality is required in the creation, of the power&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale.&nbsp; Any words are sufficient which evince an intention that&nbsp; the sale may bo made upon default or&nbsp; other contingency,"&nbsp; (41&nbsp; Corpus Juris, p. 926.)<br></blockquote>We are&nbsp; not inclined,&nbsp; however, to render&nbsp; judgment in favor of the appellant with reference to his claim for expenses, attorney's fees,, and damages.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed&nbsp; decision is reversed and the petition for prohibition with injunction filed in the court. below dismissed.&nbsp; So ordered, with costs of both instances against, the plaintiff-appellee.<br><br><i>Reyes, A. Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,&nbsp; </i>and <i>Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
