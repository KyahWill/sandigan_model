				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These&nbsp; are two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; unlawful detainer cases&nbsp; originally filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; (Civil&nbsp; Casea Nos.&nbsp; 12687&nbsp; and&nbsp; 12688&nbsp; thereof),&nbsp; on August 8 and&nbsp; 11, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; court having&nbsp; decided both&nbsp; cases in favor&nbsp; of plaintiff&nbsp; Consuelo Legarda&nbsp; Vda.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">de Prieto,</span> the respective defendants, Maria Santos and her husband John Doe, and Alejo&nbsp; Gaddi, appealed to the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; (Cases Nos.&nbsp; 12465&nbsp; and 12466), which,&nbsp; after a joint&nbsp; trial, rendered a decision the dispositive part&nbsp; of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered follows:<br><br>"(<i>a</i>) Defendants Maria&nbsp; Santos and Alejo Gaddi are&nbsp; entitled to the possession&nbsp; of the respective lots described&nbsp; in&nbsp; the amended complaints in these cases within a period of six months from the date this decision becomes final, provided each of them deposits regularly the monthly rentals in&nbsp; court;<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) Within ten days from&nbsp; the date this decision becomes&nbsp; final, plaintiff is hereby directed to inform the court whether&nbsp; or not she shall pay to each of the defendants one-half of the value of the: respective houses&nbsp; of the latter, to wit,&nbsp; Maria Santos,&nbsp; one-half of r7,000; Alejp Gaddi, one-half of P8,000;<br><br>"(<i>c</i>) In the event of the failure of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; to reimburse the defendants the amounts set forth in the preceding1 paragraph&nbsp; (b) of the dispositive part of this decision, the court shall, upon plaintiffs motion,&nbsp; direct defendants&nbsp; to remove&nbsp; their said houses from the premises&nbsp; involved herein; and<br><br>"(<i>d</i>) In the event of&nbsp; defendants' failure to remove their&nbsp; respective houses from the lots&nbsp; in question when directed by the court to do so, as&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; hereof, plaintiff may obtain from the&nbsp; court an order for the&nbsp; demolition of the said&nbsp; houses.&nbsp; No costs&nbsp; allowed."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record&nbsp; on&nbsp; Appeal, pp. 61-63.)</blockquote>From&nbsp; this decision the&nbsp; defendants in both cases have appealed to this Court&nbsp; and now they allege that:<br><blockquote>"The trial court erred in fixing the period of the leases between plaintiff-appellant (?) and defendants-appellants in accordance with Article 1687 of the new Civil Code instead&nbsp; of dismissing both cases for lack&nbsp; of cause of action, there being no controversy as to the non-expiration&nbsp; of the period of the lease."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Defendants-Appellants' Brief, p. 4.)</blockquote>The&nbsp; facts,&nbsp; upon which there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; dispute,&nbsp; are&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; said decision of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Manila, from which we&nbsp; quote:<br><blockquote>"Maria&nbsp; Santos, defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Case No. 12465, admittedly occupied the parcel of land described&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraph 3 of&nbsp; the amended complaint&nbsp; since&nbsp; the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1944 (Japanese occupation) and&nbsp; still continues occupying that said&nbsp; land.&nbsp; The&nbsp; monthly rental is P17.65.&nbsp; Said defendant's house standing on the lot&nbsp; in&nbsp; question was purchased by&nbsp; her during&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P25.000, occupation&nbsp; currency.&nbsp; Sometime after the liberation,&nbsp; she made repairs to the house amounting to P7,000.<br><br>"There&nbsp; is no question but that&nbsp; defendant Maria&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; paid plaintiff&nbsp; the rentals due&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; and&nbsp; including&nbsp; April,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp; Since then and up to the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of the&nbsp; complaint herein, she did not pay the&nbsp; rentals because, as testified to by Clarencio&nbsp; Foronda, plaintiff's collector, he refused to&nbsp; accept&nbsp; any rental upon instructions of plaintiff, for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that in accordance with the letter dated June 1,&nbsp; 1950, Exhibit B, plaintiff terminated&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease as of the 30th of June, 1950, although&nbsp; said defendant was&nbsp; given up to the 31st of July, 1950, within which&nbsp; to vacate the premises and&nbsp; remove her&nbsp; house&nbsp; therefrom.<br><br>"Alejo Gaddi, defendant&nbsp; in Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 12466, occupied the land, the subject&nbsp; of the complaint in same case, since 1947.&nbsp; The monthly&nbsp; rental is&nbsp; P8.43.&nbsp; His house now standing thereon is valued at P8,000, although only assessed at P2.000.<br><br>"As in the case of Maria Santos, on June 1, 1950,&nbsp; plaintiff wrote a letter&nbsp; Exhibit E&nbsp; to defendant Gaddi informing the&nbsp; latter that the lease on the land&nbsp; in question was to terminate on the 30th of June, 1950, and that defendant was&nbsp; given up&nbsp; to the 31st of July, 1950, within which&nbsp; to vacate the premises.<br><br>"Likewise, as&nbsp; in the case of Maria Santos,&nbsp; Gaddi&nbsp; was unable to pay&nbsp; the rentals&nbsp; due&nbsp; from and&nbsp; after May,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; for the reason that plaintiff&nbsp; had&nbsp; instructed her&nbsp; collector&nbsp; to refuse payment&nbsp; of any rentals by reason of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; terminated the lease contract.<br><br>"Upon these facts,&nbsp; the above&nbsp; two eases present but one single legal question, viz.:&nbsp; Has the plaintiff the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain judgment for the immediate possession" of the parcels of land,&nbsp; the subject of these suits, or,&nbsp; are&nbsp; defendants in the&nbsp; above&nbsp; cases&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; ask that the court fix longer terms for their respective leases"?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, pp. 55-57.)<br></blockquote>After considering the provisions of sections 1678t 1687 and 2253 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, said court concluded:<br><blockquote>"Balancing the rights&nbsp; of plaintiff and defendant in one equation, the court feels that these defendants should be given each an additional period of&nbsp; 6 months from the date this decision becomes final to (remain as lessees on the land in question.<br><br>"The&nbsp; court declares&nbsp; that the value&nbsp; of the house of&nbsp; defendant Maria Santos is P7,000, and the value&nbsp; of the "house of defendant Alejo Gaddi is P8,000."&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, p. 61.)<br></blockquote>and disposed&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner above&nbsp; stated. Defendants-appellants argue that,&nbsp; under&nbsp; Article,: 1687 of the Civil Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines, the&nbsp; court may fix a longer&nbsp; term for the contracts of lease, between the&nbsp; parties herein; that, accordingly, they could not have&nbsp; been,&nbsp; and were not,&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of unlawful&nbsp; detainer at the time of the initiation of these proceedings&nbsp; in the Municipal Court of Manila,&nbsp; on August 8 and 11,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1950;&nbsp; that instead of filing these unlawful detainer cases, plaintiff-appellee should have instituted, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court of&nbsp; first instance, the&nbsp; proper action&nbsp; or&nbsp; actions for&nbsp; the&nbsp; fixing&nbsp; of said&nbsp; term. and the determination&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the rights of the parties in&nbsp; relation to the&nbsp; buildings constructed by the defendants on the lots leased to them; and that the filing of the present ejectment .cases should have been deferred until after the expiration of such term&nbsp; as may have been&nbsp; fixed by the&nbsp; court in said&nbsp; action or actions.<br><br>We&nbsp; are&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that this&nbsp; pretense cannot be sustained, for plaintiff's&nbsp; notice of the termination of the respective contracts of lease was given to the defendants on June 1, 1950, when the Civil Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines was not, as yet, effective.&nbsp; There&nbsp; being no stipulation as to the&nbsp; duration of&nbsp; said&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; and the parties&nbsp; thereto having agreed on a monthly&nbsp; rental, the&nbsp; lease under the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1581 of&nbsp; the Spanish Civil Code, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; in force on said dates-is understood to be from month&nbsp; to month, and to have been terminated, therefore, upon the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of each month, "without necessity of a special notice", in the absence of an implied renewal (Article 1566 of the Spanish Civil Code),&nbsp; which&nbsp; did not take&nbsp; place, and&nbsp; could not&nbsp; have&nbsp; taken place, beginning from June, 1950,&nbsp; owing to&nbsp; said&nbsp; notice.&nbsp; Plaintiff's right to discontinue her contracts of lease&nbsp; with the defendants, in order to recover the possession of the leased properties, accrued&nbsp; and&nbsp; became vested&nbsp; before the Civil Code&nbsp; of the Philippines took effect, and should&nbsp; be governed,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; by&nbsp; said Article&nbsp; 1581&nbsp; of the Civil Code of&nbsp; Spain, pursuant to&nbsp; which said&nbsp; lease expired&nbsp; in&nbsp; June,&nbsp; 1950 Hence, there&nbsp; was unlawful detainer on the part of appellants&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; before the commencement of&nbsp; these&nbsp; proceeding in August,&nbsp; 1950.<br><br>Moreover, Article 1687 of the Civil Code&nbsp; of the Philippines is&nbsp; of the following tenor:<br><blockquote>"If the period for&nbsp; the lease (has not been fixed,&nbsp; it is understood to be from year to year,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; rent agreed upon is annual; from month to&nbsp; month, if it is monthly;&nbsp; from&nbsp; week to week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to&nbsp; day, if the rent is to ho paid&nbsp; daily. However,&nbsp; even&nbsp; though a monthly rent is paid,&nbsp; and no period for the&nbsp; lease&nbsp; has been set, the courts may fix a longer term&nbsp; for the lease after the&nbsp; lessee has occupied the premises for over one year. If the rent is weekly, the courts may likewise determine a longer period after the lessee has been in possesion for&nbsp; over six&nbsp; months. In case of daily rent, the&nbsp; courts&nbsp; may also fix a longer period after the&nbsp; lessee has stayed&nbsp; in the place for over one&nbsp; month.<br></blockquote>Under this provision, if&nbsp; the period of&nbsp; a lease&nbsp; contract has not been&nbsp; specified by the parties therein, it is&nbsp; understood to&nbsp; be from month to month, if the rent agreed upon is monthly,&nbsp; as&nbsp; in&nbsp; the cases&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the contract expires at the end of such&nbsp; month, unless, prior thereto,&nbsp; the&nbsp; extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; said term&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; sought by appropriate action&nbsp; and judgment is,&nbsp; eventually, rendered therein granting said relief.<br><br>Defendants herein&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; that their&nbsp; lease contracts did not,&nbsp; and could&nbsp; not,&nbsp; come&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; end&nbsp; until&nbsp; after the court has fixed its lifetime and&nbsp; the&nbsp; term&nbsp; thus fixed has&nbsp; expired.&nbsp; This view, is to our&nbsp; mind, untenable. To&nbsp; begin&nbsp; with,&nbsp; defendants assume that their contracts&nbsp; are without term, prior to the judicial action authorized in said Article 1687, whereas the same&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the duration of lease contracts&nbsp; shall be yearly, monthly, weekly,&nbsp; or daily, depending upon&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the rental&nbsp; agreed upon is annual, monthly, weekly, or daily.&nbsp; In other words, said contracts have&nbsp; a term fixed by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; and are&nbsp; not indefinite in duration, before said&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; intervention. Secondly,&nbsp; said&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1687&nbsp; merely&nbsp; gives&nbsp; the&nbsp; court discretion to extend&nbsp; the period of the lease,&nbsp; The court. is not bound to extend said term.&nbsp; It may legally refuse to do so, if the circumstances surrounding the case warrants&nbsp; such&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly,&nbsp; under appellants'&nbsp; theory. said contracts of lease would&nbsp; be of indefinite duration, subject to the authority of the court to fix its term.&nbsp; By the exercise of such authority the&nbsp; court would determine, therefore, the&nbsp; limits&nbsp; of the lifetime of&nbsp; said contracts, which, otherwise, would be indeterminate, and would subsist indefinitely, pursuant to appellants' contention.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the exercise of said authority would, in effect, shorten&nbsp; the period of the lease, which, in the absence of judicial intervention, would be for a&nbsp; longer period.&nbsp; In other words, the result of appellants' theory would be exactly the opposite of that sought to be&nbsp; achieved by&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1687, which is to permit the court to extend, not to reduce, the term of the lease.<br><br>It is next&nbsp; urged that, an extention of six&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; months, from the time&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from shall become final, having&nbsp; been granted therein to the defendants,, it follows that there was no unlawful detainer when these cases were&nbsp; filed,&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; accordingly, the&nbsp; same should have&nbsp; been&nbsp; dismissed for lack of cause of action. As above stated the contracts of lease in question expired in June, 1950,&nbsp; and defendants' possession&nbsp; thereafter was unlawful.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court merely availed itself of the provisions of Article 1687 of the Civil. Code of&nbsp; the Philippines to justify deferment of the&nbsp; execution of the judgment of ejectment against the defendants herein, who Caking advantage of&nbsp; the technicalities of&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; have already succeeded in&nbsp; holding the&nbsp; leased&nbsp; properties for over five&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp; years&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of their&nbsp; respective contracts of&nbsp; lease.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is obvious, therefore, not only&nbsp; that they cannot complain.of deprivation&nbsp; of&nbsp; due process, but, also, that they have enjoyed more than that which&nbsp; is required by&nbsp; the most liberal demands of justice and equity.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed <i>in toto </i>with cost against said defendants-appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.
