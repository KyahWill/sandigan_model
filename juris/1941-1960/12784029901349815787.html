				<H3>THE SCOTY'S DEPARTMENT STORE, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. MODESTO CASTILLO, ETC., THE NATIONAL LABOR UNION, AND THE INTER-ISLAND DOCKMEN AND LABOR UNION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 27, 1954, Scoty's Department Store filed a petition in the Court 
of Industrial Relations praying that a certification election be ordered held to 
determine which, as between the National Labor Union and the Inter-Island 
Dockmen and Labor Union, was to be the exclusive bargaining representative of 
its employees. For brevity the parties will hereafter be referred to as the 
STORE, NATIONAL LABOR, and INTER-ISLAND UNION, respectively. Twenty-three days 
thereafter, the STORE brought the present action for mandamus alleging that 
"since the filing of the petition x x x no action has been taken thereon by 
Branch II of the Court of Industrial Relations which take cognizance thereof and 
is presided over by the respondent the Hon. Modesto Castillo,"who, it is also 
alleged, "has countenanced the repeated postponement and dilatory tactics 
employed by respondent labor union," and praying that the respondent judge be 
comanded "to forthwith rule upon the petition for certification election." And 
alleging further that the dilatory tactics employed by the respondent labor 
unions have prevented the STORE from negotiating with its employees on terms of 
employment and specially on the separation of those hired for the Christmas 
season only and have caused and continue causing less to the STORE in the sum of 
P300.00 a day, plaintiff also prays that the said labor unions be made to pay 
damages.
<p>From the answer and supporting papers submitted by respondents it appears 
that as soon as the petition was docketed in the court below summons were issued 
to the parties with an early date set for hearing, and hearing was in face held 
on February 4 and 10; that the hearing was interrupted because of a motion to 
dismiss filed by the NATIONAL LABOR on the ground that there was then pending 
against the STORE a case for unfair labor practice whose resolution was 
essential to a free expression of the will of those who were to vote in the 
certification election; that the said motion to dismiss was denied on February 
27, but that on March 8 the NATIONAL LABOR filed a motion for reconsideration, 
followed later by a supporting memorandum, and pending resolution of the motion 
by the court <u>in</u> <u>banc</u> the respondent judge was naturally inhibited 
from acting on the case.</p>
<p>At the hearing in the Court, no one appeared for plaintiff, and its charge of 
inaction on the part of the respondent judge and the alleged dilatory tactics on 
the part of the respondent unions have not been proved. On the other hand, it 
would apppear that the respondent judge has acted with dispatch in having the 
case heard until it was temporarily taken out of his hands by the NATIONAL 
LABOR's motion for reconsideration of his order to dismiss, the resolution of 
which devolved upon the court <u>in banc</u>. The allegationthat since the 
filing of the petition ha had taken no action thereon is clearly unfounded. It 
may be added that, as stated in the memorandum filed by the respondent NATIONAL 
LABOR, the hearing of the STORE's petition for certification election has been 
ordered suspended by the court <u>in banc</u> pending resolution of a complaint 
filed by said respondent charging the STORE with "having assisted and dominated 
in the formation and administration fo the branch of the Inter-Island Dockmen 
and Labor Union among its workers in violation of Section 4(a) of Republic Act 
No. 875."</p>
<p>Clearly the STORE has no case for mandamus. Its petition in the Court is, 
therefore, dismissed, with double costs.</p>
