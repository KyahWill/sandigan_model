				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In May,&nbsp; 1949, the Consolidated Investments, Inc., hereafter referred to as the&nbsp; lessor, leased to&nbsp; Domingo T. Dikit part of the lobby, on the ground floor of the Consolidated Building, at Plaza Goiti, Manila, to be&nbsp; used as offices&nbsp; of a proposed Bank of Manila, then being organized by&nbsp; said Dikit&nbsp; and one Jose Silva.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the&nbsp; lease contract between the parties (Exhibits 2, 2-A and 2-B), the lessee undertook to construct, at the expense thereof, such walls, partitions and other improvements as may be necessary to make the leased premises&nbsp; suitable for banking&nbsp; purposes, and such partitions and improvements "shall become&nbsp; the property" of the lessor "upon the termination and/or rescission" of said contract.&nbsp; It appears that, pursuant&nbsp; to another contract, entered into in June, 1949,&nbsp; between Dikit and Silva on the one&nbsp; hand, and plaintiff Lao Chit, on&nbsp; the other (Exhibits A-1,&nbsp; A-2&nbsp; and A-3), the latter furnished the materials and the work for said walls, partitions and improvements,&nbsp; at&nbsp; a&nbsp; total cost of&nbsp; P59,365, payable&nbsp; "as soon&nbsp; as the Bank of Manila opens&nbsp; for&nbsp; business, and is given a permit&nbsp; by the Central Bank."&nbsp; This permit, however,&nbsp; was never&nbsp; issued.&nbsp; The proposed&nbsp; Bank of Manila did not open for business,&nbsp; and the rentals due under said lease&nbsp; contract, at the rate of P5,000 a month, beginning from&nbsp; October, 1949, were not paid.&nbsp; On December 3, 1949, the lessor&nbsp; instituted Civil Case No. 9708&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, against Dikit, for&nbsp; unlawful&nbsp; detainer. After appropriate proceedings, said court rendered&nbsp; judgment on March 27, 1950, sentencing Dikit.<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; to vacate the premises described in the complaint, and to pay the plaintiff&nbsp; the sum of P10,000.00, under the first cause of action, corresponding rentals due from October to&nbsp; November, 1949, plus the sum of P227.80,&nbsp; under the second cause of&nbsp; action, for electric&nbsp; consumption up to&nbsp; November 30,&nbsp; 1949;&nbsp; plus the&nbsp; rents&nbsp; that will become due from December 1, 1949, at the rate of P5,000.00 per month until the date said defendant&nbsp; finally vacates and&nbsp; surrenders possession to the plaintiff and costs of this suit."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit 3.)<br></blockquote>Dikit appealed&nbsp; from this decision to the Court of First Instance of Manila, where the case&nbsp; was docketed as Civil Case&nbsp; No. 11214 of said court. He, likewise,&nbsp; applied, in the Supreme Court—in Case G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-3621, entitled "Domingo&nbsp; Dikit <i>vs.</i> Hon. Ramon Icasiano"—for a writ of certiorari&nbsp; against the municipal judge&nbsp; who had rendered the aforementioned decision in the ejectment&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Said cases No. 11214 and L-3621 were soon dismissed,&nbsp; however, upon agreement of&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; dated May 22, 1951, whereby&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dikit,&nbsp; among&nbsp; other things, relinquished&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; rights&nbsp;&nbsp; he might&nbsp; have to&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the leased premises&nbsp; and disclaimed all rights to and over any and all improvements&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; therein&nbsp;&nbsp; while he was&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession&nbsp;&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>Prior&nbsp; to said&nbsp; decision, but after&nbsp; the&nbsp; commencement of said Case No. 9708, Lao Chit had filed Civil Case No. 10178 of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, against&nbsp; Dikit and Silva, for the&nbsp; recovery of&nbsp; what&nbsp; was due from&nbsp; them by reason of the&nbsp; aforementioned improvements introduced by Lao Chit.&nbsp; On June 30, 1953, judgment was rendered in said Case No.&nbsp; 10178 the dispositive part of which&nbsp; reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, sentencing the latter to pay the former, jointly and severally, the sum of P59,365.00, which&nbsp; is the total&nbsp; of the claim&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; second, third and fourth&nbsp; causes of action,&nbsp; the same to be paid within 15 days from notice, with legal interest from the date of&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of the complaint until its full payment;&nbsp; and in the&nbsp; event the defendants fail to&nbsp; pay within the period of&nbsp; grace&nbsp; herein fixed, the fixtures&nbsp; herein referred to (which by express agreement of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties shall remain the&nbsp; plaintiff's property&nbsp; until they are fully&nbsp; paid for)&nbsp; shall be returned to the plaintiff.&nbsp; The defendants&nbsp; shall also&nbsp; pay jointly and severally the plaintiff by way of damages an amount&nbsp; equivalent to&nbsp; 12% of the aforementioned sum of P59,365.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendants shall likewise pay the plaintiff, jointly and severally, another sum equivalent to 25 % of the amounts claimed in the first and sixth causes of action, besides an amount equivalent to six (6%) of the sums due and payable under the second and&nbsp; third causes of action as attorney's fees, with costs against them."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit A.)<br></blockquote>In due course,&nbsp; the corresponding writ of execution (Exhibits&nbsp; D-1 and D-3)&nbsp; of this judgment&nbsp; was&nbsp; subsequently issued.&nbsp; Later on it was returned by the sheriff unsatisfied, with the statement that neither Dikit nor Silva had any&nbsp; property&nbsp; registered in their&nbsp; respective names, and that the whereabouts&nbsp; of&nbsp; Silva&nbsp; was&nbsp; unknown (Exhibits D-2 and&nbsp; D-4).&nbsp; Meanwhile, or on September 10,&nbsp; 1953, Lao Chit brought the present action against the Security Bank and&nbsp; Trust Company (Hereafter referred to as the Bank), to&nbsp; which the lessor had, since July 1,&nbsp; 1951, leased the premises in question (after it&nbsp; had been&nbsp; vacated&nbsp; by Silva), together with the fixtures and improvements&nbsp; introduced therein by Lao Chit.&nbsp; In its complaint, Lao Chit demanded&nbsp; payment of Pl,000 a month, by&nbsp; way of rental for the use of said fixtures and improvements by the Bank, in&nbsp; addition to expenses of litigation, attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; its answer, the Bank alleged that it held and used said&nbsp; improvements pursuant to its contract of lease with the lessor and that it had paid the rentals due and complied with its other obligations under&nbsp; said contract, and set up a counterclaim for damages.&nbsp; Soon&nbsp; thereafter, or&nbsp; on&nbsp; November 5, 1953, Lao Chit demanded payment of the aforementioned sum of P59,365, plus P1,000 a month from June, 1951, from the lessor, which did not heed the demand, whereupon the complaint herein was,&nbsp; on December 18, 1953, amended to include said lessor as one of the defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter&nbsp; alleged, in its&nbsp; answer, that the improvements in question were introduced at the initiative and expense of Dikit and Silva, as lessees of the premises above referred to,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that, as permanent fixtures, said improvements form an&nbsp; integral&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; Consolidated Investments Building, and belong to the lessor and owner thereof, not to&nbsp; plaintiff herein, who has no contractual or juridical&nbsp; relation&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessor.&nbsp; The lessor,&nbsp; likewise, sought to recover, by way&nbsp; of&nbsp; counterclaim, the sum of P50,000, as damages for its inclusion as defendant herein, aside&nbsp; from attorney's fees and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In due course,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment on December 28, 1955, the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; rendered,&nbsp; sentencing the&nbsp; defendant, Consolidated Investments, Inc., to pay to the plaintiff the value of the permanent improvements in the sum of P59,365.00, and, together with the defendant, Security Bank and Trust Company, to&nbsp; pay jointly and&nbsp; severally, for the use of the permanent&nbsp; improvements, at the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; P1 ,000.00 monthly from June, 1951 to July 31, 1954, and thereafter, until January, 1955, by the defendant, Consolidated Investments,&nbsp; Inc., alone,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the same&nbsp; rate,&nbsp; and in both instances, plus&nbsp; legal&nbsp; interest until full payment thereof; in addition,&nbsp; the defendant, Consolidated Investments,&nbsp; Inc., is&nbsp; further ordered to pay to the plaintiff the amount equivalent to 80% of whatever&nbsp; amount is&nbsp; due from it,&nbsp; as reimbursement for&nbsp; plaintiff's litigation&nbsp; expenses, including attorney's contingent fees, aside from moral, nominal, moderate and exemplary damages in the&nbsp; amount of P2,000.00, and the costs&nbsp; of suit. <br><br>"Defendants' counterclaims are&nbsp; hereby both&nbsp; dismissed for&nbsp; lack of merits and in view of the above conclusion of the Court."<br></blockquote>Their&nbsp; respective motions for reconsideration&nbsp; and new trial&nbsp; having been&nbsp; denied, the defendants have appealed from this decision.<br><br>It is apparent to us that the lower court erred in rendering&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp; This&nbsp; defendant had occupied and used the premises in question,&nbsp; including the partitions, fixtures&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; improvements made therein by&nbsp; Lao Chit, pursuant to a contract of lease entered into with the lessor, the right of which to enter into said contract is&nbsp; not disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; had paid the rentals&nbsp; and&nbsp; fulfilled its&nbsp; other&nbsp; obligations under said contract.&nbsp; Again, it cannot be denied that the improvements introduced by Lao Chit&nbsp; became property of the lessor, not only because such&nbsp; improvements are permanent in nature and cannot be removed without impairing the building to which the.y were attached, but, also, because the&nbsp; contract of lease between Dikit and Silva on the one hand, and the lessor, on the other hand, provided explicitly that the latter shall own those improvements "upon the expiration and/or rescission" of&nbsp; said contract,&nbsp; and the same has already&nbsp; been&nbsp; resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although&nbsp; Lao&nbsp; Chit&nbsp; was&nbsp; not a party to said contract,&nbsp; this&nbsp; stipulation is binding&nbsp; upon him, he having introduced said improvements pursuant to his contract with Dikit, from whom he derived, therefore, his right to enter the building and make the improvements. In&nbsp; short,&nbsp; insofar&nbsp; as the construction&nbsp; thereof, Lao&nbsp; Chit was, vis-a-vis the&nbsp; lessor, a mere agent&nbsp; or representative of Dikit and, as such, was privy to the undertakings of Dikit under his contract of lease with&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessor.<br><br>The lower court held the latter liable to Lao&nbsp; Chit upon the ground that Lao Chit&nbsp; was&nbsp; a builder in good faith, under the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; Old Civil&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; and&nbsp; under the theory of undue enrichment.<br><br>As regards the&nbsp; first ground,&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 361 of the&nbsp; Civil Code of Spain, on&nbsp; which the lower court relied, provides:<br><blockquote>"The owner of land on which anything has been built, sown, or planted, in good faith, shall be entitled to appropriate the thing so built, sown, or planted, upon paying the compensation mentioned in Articles 453 and 454, or to compel the person who has built or planted to pay him the value of the land, and the person who sowed thereon to pay the proper rent therefor."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is well settled,&nbsp; however, that this provisions refers to one who builds upon a <span style="font-style: italic;">land </span>which he believes to be his property (Alburo <i>vs.</i> Villanueva, 7&nbsp; Phil., 277; Cortes <i>vs.</i> Ramos, 46&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 184; Rivera <i>vs.</i> Trinidad,&nbsp; 48&nbsp; Phil., 396; Fojas <i>vs.</i> Velasco, 51 Phil., 520; Montinola <i>vs.</i> Bantug, 71 Phil., 449-450; Lopez Inc. <i>vs.</i> Philippines &amp; Eastern Trading Co., Inc., 98&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 348; 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 1452).&nbsp; Neither Lao Chit, nor Dikit, claimed the Consolidated Investments Building as his own.&nbsp; Dikit was a mere lessee and Lao Chit was his&nbsp; agent, as such, in the construction of the improvements under consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, the Spanish text of said Article 361, which is the original, reads:<br><blockquote>"El dueño del <span style="font-style: italic;">terreno</span> en que se <span style="font-style: italic;">edificare</span>, sembrare o&nbsp; plantare de buena fe,&nbsp; tendra derecho a hacer suya la obra, siembra o plantacion, previa la&nbsp; indemnizacion establecida en los articulos 453 y 454, o a ofcligar al que <span style="font-style: italic;">edifico </span>o planto a pagar el precio del <span style="font-style: italic;">terreno</span>, y al que sembro, la renta correspondiente."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Clearly this provision&nbsp; is&nbsp; limited&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; application&nbsp; to "buddings" constructed on another's <span style="font-style: italic;">land </span>or "terreno", not to&nbsp; partitions,&nbsp; railings, counters,&nbsp; shelves and&nbsp; other&nbsp; fixtures made <span style="font-style: italic;">in a&nbsp; building&nbsp;</span> belonging to the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; the land.&nbsp; Although the verb&nbsp; "edificar" in Spanish&nbsp; is roughly synonymous with&nbsp; "build"&nbsp; in&nbsp; English, tho latter&nbsp; is broader in its connotation than&nbsp; the former.&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally,&nbsp; "edificar" is to undertake the construction of an&nbsp; edifice, such as a fort, castle, house, church, market, tower,&nbsp; stadium, barrack, stable or other&nbsp; similar structure.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the other hand, one may build a house, as well as&nbsp; a( fence, partition, window, door, or even a desk or a chair, but, it would be improper to use the verb "edificar" to&nbsp; describe the making of such&nbsp; fence, partition, window,&nbsp; door,&nbsp; desk or&nbsp; chair.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; that&nbsp; Lao&nbsp; Chit&nbsp; is not entitled&nbsp; to the&nbsp; benefits of said Article 361.<br><br>The lower court, moreover, said:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; convincing evidence abounds, to wit: that the improvements were made in the&nbsp; presence of, and with the knowledge and consent, and even under&nbsp; the personal&nbsp; supervision, on the part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; duly&nbsp; authorized representative of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, Consolidated Investments, Inc., which owns the building.&nbsp; Thus, it may even be said that it was the defendant, Consolidated&nbsp; Investments Inc., which had&nbsp; acted in bad faith."&nbsp; (Record on&nbsp; Appeal of&nbsp; Consolidated Investments, Inc., p. 56,)<br></blockquote>and quoted, in support&nbsp; thereof, the second paragraph&nbsp; of Article 364 of the Spanish Civil Code,&nbsp; reading:<br><blockquote>"Bad faith on the part of the owner&nbsp; is deemed to exist&nbsp; whenever the&nbsp; act has been done in&nbsp; his presence, with his knowledge&nbsp; and tolerance, and without opposition&nbsp; on his part."<br></blockquote>The foregoing view is,&nbsp; likewise, untenable.&nbsp; To begin with, this&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 364,&nbsp; like&nbsp; Article 361, involves a&nbsp; person who builds, plants or sows upon&nbsp; a&nbsp; land not knowing that it&nbsp; belongs&nbsp; to another.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch as, there&nbsp; is no contractual relation between&nbsp; them, their rights are&nbsp; governed by <span style="font-style: italic;">law</span>, not by contract.<br><br>Secondly, under his contract of&nbsp; lease with the&nbsp; lessor, Dikit had a <span style="font-style: italic;">legal right</span> to make the improvements in question and the l<span style="font-style: italic;">essor was&nbsp; legally bound</span>&nbsp; to permit Dikit and his&nbsp; agent Lao Chit to enter&nbsp; the leased&nbsp; premises and construct said improvements.&nbsp; Surely, compliance&nbsp; with this valid contractual&nbsp; obligation does&nbsp; not, and cannot, constitute bad faith on the part of the lessor.&nbsp; Upon the other hand,&nbsp; the lessor could not&nbsp; legally object to, or&nbsp; obstruct, the work done by Lao Chit, without being chargeable with bad faith in the&nbsp; performance of said contractual obligation with Dikit.<br><br>In order to justify the application of the&nbsp; principle that no&nbsp; one should be permitted to unjustly enrich&nbsp; himself at the expense of another, His Honor the Trial Judge&nbsp; cited Article 356 of the Civil Code of Spain, which provides:<br><blockquote>"He who receives fruits is obliged to pay any expenses which may have been incurred&nbsp; by&nbsp; another in the&nbsp; production, gathering, and preservation thereof."<br></blockquote>We agree with the&nbsp; lessor that this Article is not in point, for:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; Said&nbsp; provision is part of&nbsp; Section I, Chapter&nbsp; II, Title II, Book II,&nbsp; of the/Spanish Civil Code,&nbsp; which section regulates the "right of accession with respect to the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">products </span>of&nbsp; property," and the work done and&nbsp; the&nbsp; improvements introduced by Lao&nbsp; Chit are not "products" of the lessor's&nbsp; property.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Said Article 356 refers to&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">expenses</span>" of production, gathering and preservation" of <span style="font-style: italic;">fruits </span>received by the owner of a property, not to improvements, whereas the claim of Lao Chit is based upon&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">improvements</span>" introduced, not "expenses" incurred&nbsp; by him for the "production, gathering&nbsp; and preservation"&nbsp; of&nbsp; fruits.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; language&nbsp; of Manresa:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; el&nbsp; Codigo&nbsp; exige&nbsp; que el&nbsp; propietario pague al&nbsp; tercer poseedor que fue de la cosa los gastos de produccion,&nbsp; y en su caso los de recoleccion y conservacion.&nbsp; El&nbsp; prcpietario&nbsp; no&nbsp; puede excusarse alegando&nbsp; la mala fe del&nbsp; tercero, porque sea&nbsp; de buena o de mala fe, lo cierto&nbsp; es que este ha hecho un gasto, <span style="font-style: italic;">no solo util</span> para el propietario,&nbsp; sino&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">necesario, y sin&nbsp; el&nbsp; cual&nbsp; el&nbsp; propietario&nbsp; no hubiera obtehido frutos de su fundo,</span> resultando&nbsp; ademas que, de no mediar indemnizacion, se consagraria el injusto principio de que&nbsp; uno puede enriquecerse&nbsp; a costa y con&nbsp; dano de&nbsp; otro.&nbsp; Para afirmarse por completo&nbsp; en esta opinion debe concordarse&nbsp; el articulo que comentamos con los 452&nbsp; a 456, relativos a&nbsp; los efectos de la posesion de buena y mala fe, y que no examinamos ahora porque el asunto se trata luego con mas&nbsp; detalles.<br><br>"Los gastos de produccion&nbsp; y&nbsp; demas, para&nbsp; que&nbsp; puedan conceptuarse reembolsables por el&nbsp; propietario en el caso&nbsp; que&nbsp; suponemos, deben tener dos caracteres:&nbsp; primero, que&nbsp; esten&nbsp; dedicados&nbsp; a&nbsp; la <span style="font-style: italic;">produccion anual; es decir, que no se trata en este&nbsp; supuesto de las bonificaciones&nbsp; generates del fundo. Semejantes&nbsp; bonificaciones&nbsp; en— Iran en la categories de las mejoras, que se regulqn en otro lugar del Codigo</span> (al tratar de la posesion), y segundo, que&nbsp; no sean superfluos, excesivos o de puro lujo, sino que deben ser hechos en aquella medida natural que la condicion del&nbsp; cultivo o trabajo&nbsp; de que se trata exige."&nbsp; (3 Manresa [6th ed.], 196; Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>(c)&nbsp; The right to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; under the principle of undue enrichment is justifiable under Article 1887 of the Spanish Civil Code, reading:<br><blockquote>"Quasi contracts&nbsp; are&nbsp; licit and purely voluntary acts which create an obligation&nbsp; on the part of the&nbsp; actor in favor of a third person, and, at times, a reciprocal obligation between&nbsp; the parties concerned."<br></blockquote>Its counterpart in the&nbsp; Civil Code of the&nbsp; Philippines is Article 2142,&nbsp; which&nbsp; we quote:<br><blockquote>"Certain lawful,&nbsp; voluntary and unilateral acts give&nbsp; rise to&nbsp; the juridical relation of quasi-contract to the end that&nbsp; no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at&nbsp; the expense of&nbsp; another."<br></blockquote>The former is part of Title XVI, Book IV of the Spanish Civil Code, entitled "obligations incurred without&nbsp; contract", whereas&nbsp; the latter is included in&nbsp; Title XVII, Book IV&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code of the Philippines,&nbsp; regulating "extra-contractual obligations" or obligations&nbsp; beyond,&nbsp; outside of,&nbsp; or outside the&nbsp; scope of, a contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; construction of the improvements&nbsp; in question&nbsp; was not a&nbsp; "purely&nbsp; voluntary act" or "unilateral act" of Lao Chit.&nbsp; He introduced them in compliance with&nbsp; a&nbsp; bilateral "<span style="font-style: italic;">obligation</span>"&nbsp; he&nbsp; undertook under his contract with Dikit.&nbsp; The right of&nbsp; Dikit to enter into&nbsp; such contract,&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn, sprang from&nbsp; his&nbsp; lease contract with the lessor.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; privy to Dikit's rights under this contract, insofar as said improvements are concerned, Lao Chit's title thereto, as against the lessor, is governed, therefore, by&nbsp; such contract of&nbsp; lease, not by&nbsp; any quasi-contract, or by the&nbsp; principles of equity, as&nbsp; distinguished from&nbsp; law, contracts or quasi-contracts.<br><br>(d)&nbsp; For the principle of undue&nbsp; enrichment to apply, there must be&nbsp; "enrichment" and the same must be "undue" or "unjust".<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; case at bar,&nbsp; Dikit failed to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreed monthly rental of P5,000 from October, 1949.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to July 1, 1951, when the&nbsp; premises in question were leased to the Bank,&nbsp; the rentals due&nbsp; from Dikit aggregated, therefore, P105,000.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; despite the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the lessor&nbsp; had become&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; the improvements&nbsp; in question, worth P59,365.00, it still suffered a <span style="font-style: italic;">loss </span>of over P45,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such "loss" negates the&nbsp; idea&nbsp; of "enrichment".&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; may the latter be deemed to have taken place in the sense that said improvements had&nbsp; increased&nbsp; the productive capacity of the leased premises,&nbsp; for, despite said improvements, the Bank&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to pay, beginning from&nbsp; July 1,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; only P4,000 a month,&nbsp; or P1,000 a month less than the rental stipulated with Dikit.<br><br>Regardless of the foregoing, Lao Chit had no reason to believe—and he does not&nbsp; claim to have acted under the belief—that Dikit owned the leased premises.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the circumstances surrounding the case&nbsp; are such such&nbsp; as to leave no room for doubt&nbsp; that Lao&nbsp; Chit knew that&nbsp; Dikit was not the owner of said property and that the&nbsp; same belonged&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessor.&nbsp; Besides, Lao&nbsp; Chit&nbsp; should&nbsp; have known that, as Dikit's&nbsp; agent,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the construction of the improvements, he (Lao Chit)&nbsp; was&nbsp; subject to the limitations&nbsp; imposed upon Dikit by his contract with the lessor and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; improvements in question became property of the owner of the building, not only by operation of law, as&nbsp; accessions to said building, but, also, by specific stipulation in&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; of lease between Dikit and the lessor.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the acquisition of said improvements by the owner of&nbsp; the building and&nbsp; lessor is&nbsp; ordained&nbsp; by law and provided for by said contract, which is admittedly valid, the resulting enrichment—if any—by said owner and lessor, is neither "undue"&nbsp; nor "unjustly". <br><br>Upon the other hand, had&nbsp; he been reasonably vigilant, Lao Chit could have demanded from Dikit a mortgage, or&nbsp; a bond, or some other security, for the&nbsp; protection of his&nbsp; rights, yet he (Lao Chit) did&nbsp; not do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the lessor&nbsp; be required to pay&nbsp; Lao Chit what he is entitled to recover&nbsp; from Dikit, but which he (Lao&nbsp; Chit) cannot—due to his&nbsp;&nbsp; oversight, carelessness or negligence—collect&nbsp; from Dikit, the effect would be to&nbsp; relieve Lao Chit of the consequences&nbsp; of his own inadvertence or negligence, and hold the lessor responsible therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be neither fair, nor just, nor equitable. &nbsp;<br>Lastly, the lower court declared that the improvements in question belong to Lao&nbsp; Chit,&nbsp; because it had been so held in Case No. 10718 instituted by him against Dikit and Silva.&nbsp; Obviously, however,&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings in that case and&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision therein rendered are&nbsp; not binding upon the lessor,&nbsp; the same&nbsp; being neither a party in said case, nor a successor to the interest of&nbsp; the defendants therein. Besides,&nbsp; the aforementioned finding&nbsp; is&nbsp; not borne out by Lao&nbsp; Chit's&nbsp; contract with Dikit&nbsp; and Silva (Exhibits A-1, A-2, A-2-a and A-3).&nbsp; Indeed, even&nbsp; if Dikit and Silva had&nbsp; agreed with Lao Chit—and they had no&nbsp; such&nbsp; agreement—that he would own the improvements until payment of the price thereof, the stipulation would be, neither valid, nor binding upon the lessor, for Dikit&nbsp; and Silva had no authority whatsoever to waive the statutory right&nbsp; of&nbsp; accession of the&nbsp; lessor to and over said improvements&nbsp; (Arts. 353 and 358, Civil Code of Spain; Arts. 440 and 445, Civil Code of the Philippines).<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and&nbsp; another&nbsp; one shall&nbsp; be entered dismissing the complaint, with costs against plaintiff-appellee Lao Chit.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
