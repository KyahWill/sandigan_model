				G.R. No. L-2580, December 07, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PABLO RICOHERMOSO, PETITIONER, VS. JUAN P. ENRIQUEZ AND BERNARDINO RICOHERMOSO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an action for forcible entry instituted in the justice of 
the peace court of Santa Cruz, Marinduque by the herein respondent Bernardino 
Ricohermoso against the herein petitioner Pablo Ricohermoso, judgment was 
rendered in favor of the former. The petitioner appealed to the Court of First 
Instance of Marinduque which set the trial of the case for July 15, 1947. This 
trial was postponed upon motion of the petitioner who did not even bother about 
appearing before the court, on the ground of sickness of one of his witnesses. 
Trial was reset for July 16,1948, on which date attorney for the petitioner 
filed a motion praying that the case be transferred to July 20, 1948, for 
failure of the petitioner and his witnesses to show up. In an order dated July 
21, 1948, the respondent judge denied the motion for lack of merit and dismissed 
petitioner's appeal without costs. The petitioner has filed the present special 
civil action for certiorari aimed at setting aside said order.
<p align="justify">The contention that the respondent judge gravely abused his 
discretion is untenable. In the first place, the motion for postponement was not 
accompanied by affidavits of merit as required by section 5 of Rule 31 of the 
Rules of Court. In the second place, the action is one of forcible entry filed 
in and decided by the justice of the peace court in 1946, and set for trial by 
the Court of First Instance first on July 15, 1947, and again on July 16, 1948, 
or one year apart. Considering the summary nature of the action, it cannot be 
said that the petitioner has not been given enough time to be in readiness for 
trial.</p>
<p align="justify">While the respondent judge properly denied the postponement, he 
committed an error in dismissing the appeal. Under section 9, of Rule of Court 
No. 40, "a perfected appeal shall operate to vacate the judgment of the justice 
of the peace or the municipal court, and the action when duly entered in the 
Court of First Instance shall stand for trial <em>de novo</em> upon its merits 
in accordance with the regular procedure in that court, as though the same had 
never been tried before and had been originally there commenced," except of 
course in forcible entry and detainer cases when, upon failure of the defendant 
to comply with the conditions for staying execution, the Court of First Instance 
orders the execution of the appealed judgment which does, not, however, bar the 
appeal from taking its course. The respondent judge was accordingly bound to 
proceed with the trial and decision of the case after he had denied petitioner's 
motion for postponement.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the order of the respondent judge dismissing 
petitioner's appeal is set aside and the case is restored for further 
proceedings. So ordered without costs.</p> <em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</em> and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
