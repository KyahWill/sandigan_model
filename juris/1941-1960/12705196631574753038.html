				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the People's Court sentencing Domingo 
Capacete to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay P10,000 fine and costs for 
treason.
<p>The information contains four counts, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>"That in or about the month of December, 1944, in the municipality of San 
Pedro, Province of Laguna, the accused for the purpose of giving and with intent 
to give aid and comfort to the enemy, did then and there enlist, join and serve 
the "MAKABAYAN KATIPUNAN NG MGA PILIPINO" (MAKAPILI), an organization of 
military character, founded and organized for the purpose of giving material 
support and physical or moral assistance and aid to the Empire of Japan and the 
Imperial Japanese Forces in the Philippines; and as such member thereof, the 
accused, did, moreover, fight side by side with the enemy, participate in the 
procurement and confiscation of foodstuffs and other provisions for the same, 
and finally join and flee with the latter in his retreat to the mountains of 
Luzon.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>"That on or about December 4, 1944, the accused, acting as informer or agent 
of the Imperial Japanese Forces, for the purpose of giving and with intent to 
give aid and comfort to the enemy, led and assisted an armed patrol of Japanese 
soldiers and municipal policemen, all being members of the Makapili 
organization, in a raid to the barrio of San Antonio, municipality of San Pedro, 
Province of Laguna, and then and there caused and participated in the arrest and 
apprehension of one Feliciano Casacup, suspected of being a guerrilla, whom the 
accused thereafter delivered and turned over to the enemy to the latter's 
garrison in the barrio of San Vicente in the same municipality, where the said 
suspect was subjected to maltreatment and torture, and escaped eventual death 
only by escaping from his executioners at the very time they were digging the 
grave to bury him and three other victims.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>"That on or about December 9, 1944, in the barrio of Santo Niño, municipality 
of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, the accused, acting as informer or agent of 
the Imperial Japanese Forces, accompanied by several members of the police force 
who afforded him impunity, caused and participated in the arrest and 
apprehension of Jacinto Polintan, whom the said accused later deHvered and 
turned over to the Japanese soldiers in the barrio of San Vicente in the same 
municipality, where the said victim was killed after undergoing brutal 
maltreatment and torture.</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>"That on or about December 9, 1944, in the barrio of San Antonio, 
municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, the accused, acting as informer 
or agent of the Imperial Japanese Forces, accompanied several municipal 
policemen, all members of the Makapili organization, whose presence and 
assistance afforded him impunity, caused and participated in the arrest of 
Ignacio Gilbuena and thereafter delivered the said victim to the enemy, who 
failed to execute the same because of his being able to escape from them on the 
way to the place designated for execution."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court found the defendant guilty of all the charges. In our opinion 
the prosecution has not made out a case on the first count There is no proof, 
except sweeping assertions of witnesses, that the defendant was a 
<i>makapili</i>. The evidence utterly fails to prove that he was appointed or 
inducted into the <i>makapili</i> organization. Nor is there any indication that 
he "comported himself according to the expected pattern of behaviour" of 
<i>makapilis</i>. He was never seen wearing insignia or uniform, only one 
witness said he had seen him carry a rifle, and none saw him mount guard or 
perform any duty usual in members of a military or semi-military outfit. There 
is not even sufficient showing that a <i>makapili</i> branch was constituted in 
San Pedro Tunasan or that there was an organized Filipino armed force there or a 
barrack or quarter for any military contingent distinct from that of the 
Japanese military garrison. One witness said the <i>makapili</i> came into being 
in 1941. The men whom the prosecution witnesses pointed out as <i>makapilis</i> 
were a handful of former <i>sakdalistas</i> or <i>ganaps</i> who openly 
collaborated with the Japanese. The appellation of <i>makapili</i>, it seems, 
was given these people only because they had been <i>ganaps</i> and 
<i>sakdalistas</i> and had transferred their allegiance to the newcomers. For 
instance, Feliciano Casacup, when asked what was the meaning of <i>makapili</i>, 
said he did not know. Asked again, "When you said that the accused was a 
<i>Makapili</i>, what do you mean?" he answered, "I mean that they were the ones 
that ordered the killing of people." Later he declared, "They said that the 
Ganaps and Makapilis mean the same tiling." He emphasized that this was 
precisely what he understood.</p>
<p>The evidence on the alleged intervention of the accused in the confiscation 
of foodstuffs and firearms suffers from the same defects as the evidence on his 
alleged affiliation with the <i>makapili</i> association. The evidence is vague 
and general. At least it does not pass the test of the two-witness rule in that 
no two eye-witnesses testified to any specific part or bit or date of the 
alleged overt act of seizing arms and supplies for the Japanese.</p>
<p>But the evidence is definitely positive and convincing that the accused was a 
Japanese informer and agent. Together with other former <i>ganaps</i> and 
<i>sakdalistas</i> in San Pedro Tunasan he, from the advent of Japanese 
occupation, consorted with the invaders stationed in that municipality. On at 
least three occasions he accompanied them in their night raids on Filipino homes 
to apprehend guerrilla suspects. Victims of these raids were Feliciano Casacup, 
Jacinto Polintan and Ignacio Gilbuena. The arrests of these men and execution of 
one of them are averred in the information and narrated in the decision under 
review.</p>
<p>Following is a resume of the circumstances relative to those arrests and 
appellant's part therein. It should be made clear that if in the summation of 
the findings we mention the arrests of one Benjamin Manas and one Felino Cruz, 
who were seized by the Japanese also upon the indication or with the aid of the 
appellant, it is only because they are inseparably linked with the arrests of 
Casacup, Gilbuena and Polintan and the eventual disappearance of the last.</p>
<p>On December 9, 1944, about midnight, a squad of Japanese soldiers accompanied 
by armed Filipinos, one of whom was the appellant, came to the house of Ignacio 
Gilbuena and roused him from sleep. Gilbuena's hands were afterward bound, and 
with him in tow, the Japanese and their Filipino companions proceeded to the 
house of Polintan who lived in another barrio of the same town. From his house 
Polintan was also talian with his hands tied. The Japanese and their Filipino 
followers next transferred to the house of Felino Cruz whom they likewise seized 
and whose hands they bound in spite of his protestations of innocence. From 
Felino's house the Japanese moved to the house of Policarpo Manas whom they 
wanted to arrest, and when they did not find Policarpo Manas they got his son 
Benjamin instead. Benjamin's hands were likewise tied and he was herded with 
Gilbuena, Polintan and Cruz. Then the four prisoners were marched off to the 
barrio of San Vicente of the same town where the Japanese garrison was located, 
reaching that place at four o'clock in the morning. Soon after, Feliciano 
Casacup, who on December 4, had been arrested by Japanese troops accompanied by 
the same group of Filipinos, was brought out of the barracks and joined to the 
other four suspected guerrillas. Once the five men were assembled, the Filipino 
members of the group, including the accused, withdrew, and the Japanese alone 
carried the prisoners to a rice-field for execution. On the way, Benjamin Manas 
and Feliciano Casacup were able to escape and Ignacio Gilbuena managed to run 
away, defying a volley of fire, while the Japanese were digging a grave. Jacinto 
Polintan and Felino Cruz were not so fortunate and have never been heard from 
ever since.</p>
<p>The arrests of Gilbuena, Polintan and Casacup have each been established by 
the testimony of two or more witnesses, testimony which, in this respect, leaves 
no room for doubt. We are satisfied that with these arrests Domingo Capacete was 
connected in the manner stated by the said witnesses—that he was with the 
Japanese captors when the arrests were made and carried a pistol. We think it 
far-fetched to suppose that the defendant happened to be in the places above 
mentioned as a mere spectator or by accident. Openly carrying a firearm while 
going with Japanese soldiers can only be reconciled with the idea that the man 
was in league with and had the confidence of the enemy. There is not the 
slightest pretense that the accused was in any way connected with underground 
movements or that he feigned cooperation in order the better to carry out a 
patriotic objective. The defendant's collaboration appeared to be wholehearted, 
absolute and undisguised, neither justified nor mitigated by any ulterior lofty 
motive.</p>
<p>The acts thus proven constitute both adherence to the enemy and overt acts of 
treason.</p>
<p>The defense of alibi cannot be taken seriously. Assuming that the defendant 
had business in Manila which he came daily to attend, this fact did not deprive 
him of time and opportunity to commit the deeds charged in the second, third and 
fourth counts.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court will be affirmed with costs. It is so 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Padilla, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the result. The appellant is 
guilty of murder.</div>
