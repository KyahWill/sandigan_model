				<H3>CEBU TRANSIT COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner, Cebu Transit Company, Inc., operated a taxicab service in the 
City of Cebu and its suburbs under a certificate of public convenience issued in 
its favor by the Public Service Commission in 1931. Due to the destruction and 
loss of the records of the Commission consequent upon the last war, the 
petitioner, under date of December 21, 1945, filed an application (Case No. 
4502), for the reconstitution of its certificate of public convenience. After 
hearing, the Commission rendered a decision dated May 13, 1946, directing the 
issuance to the petitioner of a reconstituted certificate containing, however, 
the new condition that the same "shall be valid and subsisting only for a period 
of fifteen (15) years." The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration in 
which it was contended that the condition "was imposed without any evidence 
before this Honorable Commission to reasonably support such limitation." The 
motion was denied after a hearing at which counsel for the petitioner did not 
present any evidence. Hence this appeal.
<p>It is not pretended that the Commission has no power to impose the condition 
in question upon certificates issued prior to June 8, 1939, the date of the 
approval of Commonwealth Act No. 454, which amended section 15 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 146 in a sense authorizing the Commission to prescribe "as a condition 
for the issuance of the certificate * * * that the certificate shall be valid 
only for a definite period of time." But even if the petitioner does make such 
pretense, we need only refer to the decision in Pangasinan Transportation Co. 
<i>vs</i>. Public Service Commission (70 Phil., 221), upholding the power of the 
Commission on the ground, among others, that "statutes enacted for the 
regulation of public utilities, being a proper exercise by the state of its 
police power, are applicable not only to those public utilities coming into 
existence after their passage, but likewise to those already established and in 
operation."</p>
<p>Petitioner's principal criticism is addressed to the alleged total absence of 
evidence reasonably supporting the appealed decision in so far as it limits the 
duration of its reconstituted certificate to fifteen years. In answer, it may be 
pointed out that the petitioner itself presented in evidence the decisions of 
the Commission dated February 4, 1931, December 19, 1933, and January 31, 1939, 
regarding the issuance of petitioner's original certificate, its authorization 
to increase its equipment and to reduce its rates, and the design and color of 
its taxicabs. The Commission can thus be deemed to have considered the facts 
appearing in said decisions, in connection with the results of its own 
observations and investigations which ripened into the issuance by the 
Commission of its memorandum of July 26, 1939, approved by the Secretary of 
Justice on August 23, 1939, fixing the duration periods for various public 
services, fifteen years being thought proper for taxicab services. As held in 
Manila Yellow Taxicab Co. <i>vs</i>. Araullo (60 Phil., 833). "The Public 
Service Commission in the exercise of its quasi-judicial and administrative 
functions has the power to take into consideration the result of its own 
observation and investigation of the matter submitted to it for consideration 
and decision, in connection with other evidence presented at the hearing of a 
case."</p>
<p>The case before us is not one in which the petitioner did not have an 
opportunity to be heard or to present evidence, because when its motion for 
reconsideration was heard,—and that was the suitable stage wherein it could show 
the impropriety of the period of fifteen years by corresponding evidence—its 
counsel merely manifested that "we submit our case on the basis of our motion 
for reconsideration." We take it that the petitioner never claimed that it can 
hold its certificate in perpetuity or beyond fifty years, the maximum period 
prescribed in Commonwealth Act No. 146 and in the Constitution. Consequently, 
the petitioner could only have contended that its certificate should be made 
valid for a period longer than fifteen, but not exceeding fifty years, and it 
could have presented the necessary evidence at the hearing of its motion for 
reconsideration. Moreover, considering that the period fixed by the Commission 
started only from 1946, the duration of petitioner's certificate, including the 
period subsequent to its issuance in 1931 up to 1945, covers a total of nearly 
thirty years.</p>
<p>The appealed decision is therefore affirmed, and it is so ordered with costs 
against the petitioner.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon,

<p>FERIA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>I concur in the result.</p>
<p>The petition of the appellant in the present case is for reconstitution of 
the certificate of public convenience to operate a taxicab service, and for 
renewal or replacement of its equipment consisting of eleven taxicabs which were 
lost during the war. One of the conditions imposed upon the petitioner by the 
decision which granted the original certificate dated February 4, 1941, Exhibit 
A, is that the appellant can not replace its equipment without the authority of 
the Commissioner; and the second and fourth paragraphs of section 15 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 454, read as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'The Commission may prescribe as a condition for the issuance of the 
certificate provided in the preceding paragraph that the service can be acquired 
by the Commonwealth of the Philippines or by any instrumentality thereof upon 
payment of the cost price of its useful equipment, less reasonable depreciation; 
<i>and likewise, that the certificate shall be valid only for a definite period 
of time</i>; and that the violation of any of these conditions shall produce the 
immediate cancellation of the certificate without the necessity of any express 
action on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p>" 'The foregoing is likewise applicable to any extension or amendment of 
certificates actually in force and to those which may hereafter be issued, to 
permits to modify itineraries and time schedules of public services and to 
authorization to renew and increase equipment and properties.' " (Italics 
ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the above quoted provisions, the Commissioner may impose as a condition 
for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience that the certificate be 
valid for a definite period of time. Periods of validity of each type of 
certificate of public convenience are fixed by the Public Service Commission in 
accordance with a memorandum of July 26, 1939, prepared by the Commission and 
its experts, and approved by the Secretary of Justice on August 23, 1939, which 
fixes the periods of validity as follows:</p>

<p>Though the petitioner was originally granted a certificate of public 
convenience in 1931, the above quoted provisions of law and schedule of periods 
of validity were applicable and applied to the appellant when it applied for 
reconstitution of its original certificate and renewal or replacement of its 
equipment. This Court in the case of Pangasinan Transportation Co. <i>vs</i>. 
Public Service Commission (70 Phil., 221), held among others, that "statutes 
enacted for the regulation of public utilities, being a proper exercise by the 
state of its police power, are applicable not only to those public utilities 
coming into existence after their passage, but likewise to those already 
established and in operation."</p>
<p>Appellant contends that according to law, there must be a hearing before the 
Commissioner may determine and decide whether, according to the evidence, the 
public interest will be promoted by limiting the period of validity imposed upon 
a certificate of public convenience to less than fifty years. And the appellant 
was not given a hearing. This contention is untenable. The limitations or 
periods of validity of certificates of public convenience set forth in the 
memorandum above quoted are based on experience and training of engineers, 
accountants and technical men in the service of Public Commission, and not being 
arbitrary, the decision of the Commission which applies therein provided to the 
present case, should not be disregarded by this Court (Manila Electric Co. 
<i>vs</i>. Reyes, G. R. No. 41988).</p>The decision of this Court in the case 
entitled "the Pangasinan Transportation Co. <i>vs</i>. Public Service 
Commission," G. R. No. 47065 is not applicable to the present case, because the 
question as to power of the Commission to impose the limitation to 25 years of 
the life of the certificate or public convenience in that case, arose and was 
decided before the memorandum which fixes the periods of validity of 
certificates of public convenience, was approved by the Secretary of Justice and 
adopted and applied by the Commission. Before said adoption and application, as 
there was no limitation on the discretion of the power of the Commission as to 
the period of validity, provided it does not exceed the maximum period of 50 
years, it was necessary to have a hearing in order that the Commission might 
determine the period of validity which would promote public interest. After the 
application of said memorandum as a standard to be followed by the Commission, 
such hearing is no longer necessary, because it is to be presumed that the 
periods of limitation set forth therein promote the public interest in a proper 
and suitable manner. The contention of the appellant would be tenable had the 
Commission imposed a period of limitation less than or in excess of 15 years 
without a hearing, for especial circumstances should be shown in a hearing" to 
justify the nonapplication of the already fixed period of validity of 15 years 
applicable to all taxicab service. After all, before the expiration of the 
period of validity of its certificate, the appellant may apply for an amendment 
or extension thereof, and show that public interest would be promoted by 
amending or extending the period of validity of its certificate.</div>
