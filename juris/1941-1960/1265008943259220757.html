				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Charged with and found guilty of&nbsp; arson on an inhabited building, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; circumstances of premeditation and nighttime, without any mitigating circumstance&nbsp; to&nbsp; offset&nbsp; the&nbsp; same,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; were. sentenced by the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; accessory penalties&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law, to&nbsp; pay jointly and&nbsp; severally indemnity&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; as follows: P3,400&nbsp; to the Alto&nbsp; Surety &amp; Insurance Co., P3,475 to New Zealand&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.,. P1,895 to Malayan Insurance Co., P1,600&nbsp; to&nbsp; South&nbsp; British Insurance Co.,&nbsp; P1,500&nbsp; to Pacific National Fire&nbsp; Insurance Co., plus one-half of the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They appealed from this. decision on&nbsp; the ground that the court erred—<br><blockquote><ol><li> In allowing the exclusion of Flocencio Camilo from the complaint in&nbsp; order to make him a state witness despite the opposition. of the herein&nbsp; accuser;<br></li><li> In not stating&nbsp; in its decision that&nbsp; the corpus delicti in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at bar was&nbsp; not&nbsp; proven;<br></li><li> In not finding&nbsp; that since the testimony&nbsp; of the sole "witness for the prosecution as&nbsp; regards&nbsp; the guilt of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; James&nbsp; Uy, alias James Kay and&nbsp; Aw Ming, alias Taba, was not credible, it should likewise be incredible as regards the herein&nbsp; appellants;<br></li><li> In not finding that&nbsp; the testimony or Florencio Camilo comes from an&nbsp; impure&nbsp; source and hence&nbsp; it should not prevail over&nbsp; the testimony of herein appellants; and<br></li><li> In not acquitting the herein appellants."</li></ol></blockquote>Upon careful examination of the record of the case,&nbsp; we find to be completely undisputed and positively shown&nbsp; by the evidence on record the following facts: that in response to an alarm, at about 7: 40 on the evening&nbsp; of October 8, 1950,&nbsp; Capt.&nbsp; Braulio Alonia, Chief of the San Lazaro Fire Station, rushed&nbsp; with his men to the corner of Echague and Rial Avenue, City of Manila.&nbsp; Upon arriving at&nbsp; the place, they found on fire the second floor of the appellant's building&nbsp; located&nbsp; in&nbsp; that&nbsp; corner.&nbsp; His&nbsp; men&nbsp; proceeded to quench the blaze&nbsp; and succeeded in doing so in a few minutes.&nbsp; Soon after the fire had been put out,&nbsp; Capt. Alonia inspected the second floor and found on the Echague&nbsp; wing thereof two&nbsp; broken glass jars,&nbsp; ten&nbsp; unbroken&nbsp; glass jars containing gasoline, lines of toilet paper dipped in&nbsp; the gasoline content of the jar and arranged in such a manner as to connect them to one&nbsp; another, and eleven green&nbsp; tin covers, Exhibits B, B-1 to B-9; C, C-1 to C-10; D and I. Photographs of the&nbsp; fire scene were taken by the photographers of the Police and Fire Department, (Exhibits F, G, H, I, J, U and&nbsp; V), all of which clearly depict the burned area,&nbsp; the&nbsp; broken glass&nbsp; jars and the&nbsp; arrangement on&nbsp; the floor of the unbroken glass jars&nbsp; which contained&nbsp; gasoline as well as the connecting lines of tissue&nbsp; papers.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the course of the investigation&nbsp; of the fire, Capt.&nbsp; Alonia made a sketch from which&nbsp; the data&nbsp; appearing on Exhibit T were taken, and a glance at these photographs and sketch will convince anyone that but for the timely and efficient handling of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fire by the&nbsp; firemen the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; building might have been burned because the ingenuous device of connecting the gasoline-filled glass jars&nbsp; with tissue paper would have rapidly&nbsp; spread the&nbsp; fire all&nbsp; over the Echague wing of the building and had the fire run its natural course traces&nbsp; of its&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; inception and&nbsp; design would&nbsp; have been obliterated&nbsp; or its&nbsp; detection made impossible by&nbsp; the resulting debris.<br><br>The building in question consists of&nbsp; two wings, one of which fronts Rizal Avenue and the other&nbsp; Echague Street (Exhibit D).&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant spouses were keeping a room in the second&nbsp; floor at the corner of Rizal Avenue&nbsp; and Echague Street.&nbsp; The Echague wing was occupied by the Republic Vocational School, owned by Dr. Felix Acevedo, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; Avenue wing was&nbsp; rented out&nbsp; to various tenants.&nbsp; The&nbsp; stairs&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; floor were located on Rizal Avenue and at the top of said stairs there used to be&nbsp; a&nbsp; door, but this was removed on orders of appellants sometime before the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entering the second floor from&nbsp; said stairs, the appellants&nbsp; would turn&nbsp; right to reach their room and at the left side of the door thereof a corridor ran thru&nbsp; the&nbsp; middle&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Echague&nbsp; wing. Along&nbsp; both sides&nbsp; of&nbsp; said corridor were several rooms containing&nbsp; desks, tables, books,&nbsp; typewriters, a steel cabinet and a sewing machine, and&nbsp; at&nbsp; the end of this&nbsp; corridor was&nbsp; a room with windows opening on Estero Cegado&nbsp; and Echague Streets.&nbsp; The fire started in the above-described corridor, about 5 or 6 meters from the door of&nbsp; the said room of the&nbsp; appellants (Exhibits&nbsp; D,&nbsp; M&nbsp; and N).<br><br>The&nbsp; first floor&nbsp; and&nbsp; undivided&nbsp; one-half&nbsp; of&nbsp; the second floor of the building were&nbsp; owned by the&nbsp; appellant spouses who insured the entire building with&nbsp; four insurance companies under their&nbsp; different&nbsp; policies&nbsp; for a total sum of P75,000 as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">People's Surety &amp; Ins.

W-2, W-3, W-4, W-5,&nbsp; Z, and AA) were taken out about a month prior to October 8,&nbsp; 1950, the date&nbsp; when the&nbsp; fire occurred.<br><br>The evidence further shows that the building in question suffered an estimated loss and&nbsp; damage&nbsp; of P5,255, yet the appellants did not file the necessary claim for recovery of said damage under&nbsp; their policies.&nbsp; It likewise appears that the reproduction costs in 1950 of appellants' building was only P89,524.59&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; CC)&nbsp; and, notwithstanding the fact that the appellants do not own the entire building, for they own only the first floor and&nbsp; one-half of the&nbsp; second&nbsp; floor, they secured, as stated above, 8 policies&nbsp; with a total face value of P135,000 and 6 of these 8&nbsp; policies with a total face value of P70,000 were taken out just about a month before&nbsp; the fire.<br><br>Due to&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation conducted by Capt. Alonia immediately after the fire and further investigation done by the Police authorities which strongly indicated&nbsp; that the burning of appellant's building: was&nbsp; intentional, on March 29, 1951 an information was filed against the herein&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; Jose Hidalgo Besurreccion&nbsp; and Maura&nbsp; Gotengco y Soliman&nbsp; and&nbsp; Florencio&nbsp; Camilo, alias Lin&nbsp; Siu, <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Lin Hong,&nbsp; alias Sy Hong, and John Doe, which later on was amended to include therein&nbsp; the accused James&nbsp; Uy, alias James&nbsp; Kay and Aw Ming, alias Taba,&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the trial of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; proper motion by&nbsp; the City Fiscal and despite&nbsp; opposition&nbsp;&nbsp; by the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; appellants,&nbsp;&nbsp; Florencio Camilo was excluded from the information to be&nbsp; utilized as a&nbsp; government witness, and&nbsp; thus Florencio&nbsp; Camilo was allowed to testify in the case.<br><br>The&nbsp; record&nbsp; discloses that there is no direct evidence linking the herein appellants with the crime at bar except the&nbsp; testimony of Florencio&nbsp; Camilo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were his testimony to be held as unworthy of&nbsp; credence, the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; are perfectly&nbsp; entitled&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquittal;&nbsp; otherwise the&nbsp; decision. appealed from should be&nbsp; upheld.<br><br>Camilo's testimony,&nbsp; as&nbsp; correctly&nbsp; .summarized&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General in his brief, is as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Camilo testified that he and James Kay were friends&nbsp; since before the war, and that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; known Aw Bling for about nine months. (pp.&nbsp; 28-29, t.s.n.). On&nbsp; the&nbsp; evening of&nbsp; October 1,&nbsp; 1950, at&nbsp; a massage clinic&nbsp; on&nbsp; Florcntino&nbsp; Torres&nbsp; Street&nbsp; which&nbsp; these friends- used to&nbsp; frequent, they made&nbsp; an appointment to&nbsp; meet&nbsp; each other the afternoon of the next day at the Bataan Cafe for&nbsp; the purpose of seeing&nbsp; Dr. Hidalgo about&nbsp; the burning&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter's&nbsp; building (pp. 30,&nbsp; 258-260, t.s.n.).&nbsp; In that cafe, the&nbsp; three&nbsp; met at about. 2; 00 p.m. and thence proceeded to said building, where in a room on the second floor Camilo met the Hidalgo spouses for&nbsp; the first time (pp, 27, 31-32, t.s.n.).&nbsp; Inside said&nbsp; room Camilo saw two&nbsp; big dogs of foreign breed held in leash, several chairs, and&nbsp; a bed&nbsp; (pp. 85-36, t.s.n.).&nbsp; After some haggling over the price for the&nbsp; job of setting- the building on&nbsp; fire,&nbsp; James Kay&nbsp; and Dr. Hidalgo agreed upon P16,000,&nbsp; of which P15,000 was to&nbsp; be paid by check and the balance of P1,000&nbsp; in cash&nbsp; (pp, 37-39,&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; Protesting;&nbsp; lack of&nbsp; cash on the occasion, Dr, Hidalgo told the three to return on&nbsp; October 4&nbsp; and on that day Maura Gotengco drew two checks against&nbsp; the Philippine Trust Company, both&nbsp;&nbsp; payable to&nbsp; "cash"&nbsp; (pp. 40-43,&nbsp; 54, t.s.n.) One&nbsp; of&nbsp; these&nbsp; P.T.C.&nbsp; No. 837571&nbsp; (Exhibit L),&nbsp; was&nbsp; for P12,000 and was postdated November 3, 1950; the other P.T.C.&nbsp; No, 837570, was for P3,000,&nbsp; but in the space&nbsp; for&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of issuance&nbsp; only the figure "10" and&nbsp; the&nbsp; year "1950" were written (see Exhibit&nbsp; K). Enough&nbsp; space,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; was&nbsp; left&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; printed word "Manila" and the figure "10" for the insertion of the abbreviation of a&nbsp; month so that&nbsp; if&nbsp; for instance the&nbsp; abbreviation "October"' were&nbsp; written&nbsp; after&nbsp; word "Manila"&nbsp; and before&nbsp; the figure "10", the check would appear&nbsp; as&nbsp; if&nbsp; it had been&nbsp; issued on October 10, 1950;&nbsp; or a bar could&nbsp; be placed after&nbsp; the figure "10" and any number from&nbsp; 1 to 31 written after it say "4", and it would&nbsp; appear that it was issued&nbsp; on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp; At first only&nbsp; the&nbsp; face of these checks was&nbsp; signed by&nbsp; Gotengco, but James asked&nbsp; her to&nbsp; sign them also on the&nbsp; back, which she did, and the said checks, having been thus&nbsp; endorsed,&nbsp; were then handed&nbsp;&nbsp; to James&nbsp; (pp. 44, 55-56,&nbsp; 121, t.s.n.).&nbsp; Fifty and one-hundred peso bills totalling P1,000&nbsp; were then counted out to James:&nbsp; and after he had pocketted both the checks and the&nbsp; cash (pp.&nbsp; 45, 242, t.s.n.), the&nbsp; conspirators proceeded to discuss when and how&nbsp; the building&nbsp; was to be burned&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 58, t.s.n.). For the reason&nbsp; that on&nbsp; Sundays the Chinese&nbsp; stores arc closed&nbsp; and there&nbsp; are comparatively less people about, October 8, 1950,. a Sunday, was chosen&nbsp; (pp. 60—61, t.s.n.).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also agreed&nbsp; "Upon that the "building&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; set on&nbsp; fire at&nbsp; 7:30&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; evening and that gasoline&nbsp; in&nbsp; bottles&nbsp; would be&nbsp; used&nbsp;&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 58,&nbsp; 60,&nbsp; 63,&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; This matter having been&nbsp; settled, Dr. Hidalgo,&nbsp; James&nbsp; Uy, Aw Ming,&nbsp; and Camilo inspected the premises to be set on fire,&nbsp; and a place in the Republic&nbsp; Vocational&nbsp; School where there was a bookcase was selected for starting the blaze&nbsp; (p. 67, t.s.n.).<br><br>"While returning&nbsp; from&nbsp; Quiapo church the afternooon. of the next day, October 5, 1950,&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; and&nbsp; his wife, Virginia de la Cruz, met their friend Johnny&nbsp; Uy and walked with him to the massage clinic&nbsp; on&nbsp; Florentine&nbsp; Torres Street&nbsp; where be&nbsp; was&nbsp; working.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the corner of said&nbsp; street&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ronquillo Street,&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp;&nbsp; was seen&nbsp; by James Uy&nbsp; and&nbsp; Aw&nbsp; Ming who were inside&nbsp; a coffee&nbsp; shop.&nbsp; James called&nbsp; Camilo and&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; it&nbsp; turned&nbsp; out that&nbsp; James and&nbsp;&nbsp; Aw Ming- were&nbsp; quarreling about the possession of the checks, James wanting to retain them and Aw Ming insisting on taking them from James, it was agreed that&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; would hold the checks and that&nbsp;&nbsp; about 9:00 o'clock that night botb would&nbsp; come&nbsp; to&nbsp; the massage clinic on Florenthio waited until midnight hut as neither showed up&nbsp; he started to go home.&nbsp; However, at the foot&nbsp; of the stairs&nbsp; leading from the clinic, he was accosted by Det.&nbsp; Lt.&nbsp; Enrique&nbsp; Morales who demanded the production of his alien certificate of registration;&nbsp; and&nbsp; as Camilo was taking&nbsp; this from&nbsp; his&nbsp; wallet,&nbsp; Morales&nbsp; spied&nbsp; the checks&nbsp; and took them from him (pp. 76-78, t.s.n.).<br><br>"The following morning,&nbsp; October&nbsp; 6, 1950, Camilo went to James Tailoring-&nbsp; Shop&nbsp; on Echague&nbsp; St. and reported to him&nbsp; the&nbsp; seizure of the checks,&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 247, t.s.n.).&nbsp; James&nbsp; said&nbsp; he would&nbsp;&nbsp; take&nbsp; up&nbsp; the matter with Morales and then they sought out&nbsp; Dr. Hidalgo&nbsp; and his wife to inform them also of the confiscation of the checks (pp. 80, 82, t.s.n.).&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Hidalgo told them not to worry, saying that he would declare to the bank that the checks had been lost, that another cheeks would be&nbsp; issued, and that they should go ahead with their&nbsp; plans&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 82-85,&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; However,&nbsp; James&nbsp; put off the&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; of the materials&nbsp; to be used for the burning because on that day, October 6, 1950,&nbsp; his son&nbsp; was to be baptized&nbsp; and he even&nbsp; borrowed. Camilo's&nbsp; share&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cash&nbsp; (p. 158, t.s.n.).<br><br>"On October 7, 1950, Camilo and&nbsp; Jesus went&nbsp; to&nbsp; Lt.&nbsp; Morales to ask for the return of&nbsp; the checks and Morales returned to Camilo the check for P3.000 which Camilo forthwith handed to James (p. 80, t.s.n.).&nbsp;&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; then accompanied James to&nbsp; a store&nbsp; on Eehague St.&nbsp; and there the latter bought twelve (12)&nbsp; glass jars&nbsp; with&nbsp; green. tin&nbsp; stoppers which&nbsp; they brought to Aw Ming's house on&nbsp; Mayhaligue Street (pp. 85-86, t.s.n.)&nbsp; After&nbsp; lunch, Camilo&nbsp; rode in a jeep driven by James&nbsp; and in four (4) trips, they bought gasoline from four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; different&nbsp; stations along&nbsp; Taft&nbsp; Avenue in&nbsp; Pasay&nbsp; City..&nbsp; After each purchase, they returned to Aw Ming's&nbsp; house&nbsp; on&nbsp; Mayhaligue where James siphoned the gasoline with a rubber tube from the&nbsp; tank into a&nbsp; tin can&nbsp; and Aw&nbsp; Ming helped transfer the&nbsp; gasoline&nbsp; from said&nbsp; can into the twelve&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; glass jars&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 88-97,. t.s.n.).<br><br>"About&nbsp; 7:00&nbsp; in the&nbsp; evening&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 8, 1950,&nbsp; James and&nbsp; Aw Ming picked up&nbsp; Camilo at the Bataan Cafe and the&nbsp; three&nbsp; drove in a jeep to the house of the Hidalgo spouses&nbsp; on the&nbsp; corner of Rizal&nbsp; Avenue&nbsp; and&nbsp; Echague&nbsp; Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside&nbsp; the&nbsp; jeep&nbsp; were&nbsp; the twelve (12)&nbsp; glass jars&nbsp; filled&nbsp; with&nbsp; gasoline contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; two cartons and&nbsp; some rolls of toilet&nbsp; tissue paper wrapped&nbsp; in&nbsp; Manila paper (pp.&nbsp; 09-100,&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; James parked&nbsp; the&nbsp; jeep&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; front&nbsp; of&nbsp; the appellants' building and after calling&nbsp; Dr. Hidalgo, he (James)&nbsp; and Aw Ming carried the&nbsp; gasoline-filled jars&nbsp; to the second&nbsp; floor&nbsp; while Hidalgo carried&nbsp; the bundle&nbsp; of toilet paper (pp. 102-103, t.s.n.). Soon&nbsp; afterwards,&nbsp; James&nbsp; came&nbsp; down&nbsp; told&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp; building, and&nbsp; parked&nbsp; the jeep&nbsp; elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp;&nbsp; obeyed&nbsp; and in a few minutes&nbsp; James returned to join his&nbsp; companions upstairs&nbsp; (p. 104,&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; James and&nbsp;&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; unscrewed the jar&nbsp; covers&nbsp;&nbsp; and placed&nbsp; the jars about&nbsp; the Echague wing,&nbsp; some&nbsp; under&nbsp; chairs&nbsp; and others&nbsp; near&nbsp; bookcases.&nbsp; The&nbsp; tissue&nbsp; paper&nbsp; was&nbsp; "unrolled&nbsp; and&nbsp; the end of lines thereof inserted in&nbsp; the&nbsp; jars&nbsp; to&nbsp; connect them to each other&nbsp; (pp. 105-108, t.s.n.).&nbsp; One&nbsp; end of&nbsp; a&nbsp; length of tissue paper about IS meters&nbsp; long&nbsp; was inserted in one of the jars&nbsp; and on&nbsp; the other&nbsp; end thereof James&nbsp; stuck&nbsp; a candle&nbsp; about one&nbsp; inch long&nbsp; and: lighted it.&nbsp; Hidalgo then led out&nbsp; his&nbsp; two dogs, and Camilo,&nbsp; Aw&nbsp; Ming&nbsp; and James followed him&nbsp; (pp. 112-113, 116, t.s.n.).&nbsp; Hidalgo placed the dogs in his yellow Cadillac convertible and parked&nbsp; it in front&nbsp; of the then Bataan Theater at&nbsp; the foot of Sta. Cruz Bridge (now&nbsp; McArthur Bridge).&nbsp; Aw Ming&nbsp; left, but&nbsp; Camilo and James, who was to relight the&nbsp; candle if the building did not burn,&nbsp; stayed watching the building on the south sidewalk of Echague Street.&nbsp; In about ten&nbsp; minutes,&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; heard an&nbsp; explosion and the building started to&nbsp; bum&nbsp; (pp. 113-115, t.s.n.)."</blockquote>The foregoing testimony is assailed on the ground that it is&nbsp; incredible and&nbsp; contrary to&nbsp; the ordinary course&nbsp; of event's; that being the testimony of an accomplice, it comes from a polluted source and therefore it should be received with&nbsp; caution; that it was not given credence by the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to appellants'&nbsp; co-accused James&nbsp; Uy and&nbsp; Aw&nbsp; Ming&nbsp; who&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; acquitted&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; it should not also be given weight with regard to the herein appellants,&nbsp; for if Camilo's testimony as regards the guilt of James Uy&nbsp; and Aw Ming was&nbsp; not credible,&nbsp; it should likewise be unworthy&nbsp; of credence as regards the appellants'&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; complicity in the crime&nbsp; at bar.<br><br>We&nbsp; find,&nbsp; however, that the lower court gave credence to the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Florencio&nbsp; Camilo&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to the participation&nbsp; of the herein appellants in the burning of their building, because it is corroborated by the fact that Maura Gotengeo issued the&nbsp; checks testified to by the witness,&nbsp; to&nbsp; wit:&nbsp; P3,000&nbsp; (Exhibit K)&nbsp; and P12,000&nbsp; (Exhibit L)&nbsp; and by the other&nbsp; fact, that&nbsp; the spouses&nbsp; had&nbsp; heavily insured the building&nbsp; in question for P175,000 prior to the fire&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; insurable&nbsp; value&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; was&nbsp; only about P78,000 or&nbsp; P79,000.&nbsp; And&nbsp; upon&nbsp; careful&nbsp; scrutiny&nbsp; of the evidence on record, we find&nbsp; these facts&nbsp; to be&nbsp; unrefuted for the spouses did really insure the building in question for the amount mentioned above, and that Maura Gotengeo, on October&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; did&nbsp; really draw the aforesaid checks.<br><br>As to the over insurance of the building, it appears that the herein&nbsp; appellants never&nbsp; denied having secured&nbsp; eight policies, on the building, with a total face value of P135,000 and that 6&nbsp; of these policies,&nbsp; for a&nbsp; total value of P70,000, were taken&nbsp; out just about a&nbsp; month before the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the lower court,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; found the herein&nbsp; appellants guilty of the crime of arson charged against them, it acted with sufficient evidence supporting its finding.<br><br>Appellants&nbsp; vigorously contend that the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of the checks&nbsp; by Maura Gotengco&nbsp; should not be taken against them, for&nbsp; said checks were&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; Maura to help one Victor&nbsp; Vickman&nbsp; who was allegedly a Philippine&nbsp; Army undercoverman trying to locate a hidden cache of firearms and ammunition worth P1,660,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants' claim that this Vickman told them that a certain Bill Dean, representing the so-called&nbsp; sellers&nbsp; group,&nbsp; asked him to&nbsp; put up&nbsp; a "goodwill money" in&nbsp; the sum of P15,000; that unless said sum of money could&nbsp; be produced by Vickman,&nbsp; the latter would not be allowed&nbsp; to inspect the&nbsp; firearms; that Vickman tried to get&nbsp; said amount from his superiors&nbsp; but in vain, and when Vickman happened to talk to them&nbsp; (appellants), Maura&nbsp; issued&nbsp; a&nbsp; check&nbsp; to help&nbsp; said&nbsp; Vickman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefully considered,&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; explanation as&nbsp; to how the&nbsp;&nbsp; checks in&nbsp; question were issued clearly appears unbelievable, firstly, because if Vickman really needed P15,000 to&nbsp; discover the cache&nbsp; of firearms and&nbsp; ammunitions above-mentioned&nbsp; and he approached the army authorities to secure&nbsp; said amount, it&nbsp; is difficult to&nbsp; believe that said&nbsp; amount, in cash or in check, would not be given by his superiors to a subordinate like Vickman and thereby imperil the success&nbsp; of an under&nbsp; taking&nbsp; which&nbsp; demanded&nbsp; utmost secrecy;&nbsp; secondly, it is highly unbelievable that for the purpose of discovering the cache of firearms and ammunitions which required&nbsp; utmost secrecy, Vickman&nbsp; would ask help from the herein&nbsp; appellants whose intimacy with him has not been&nbsp; proved.<br><br>Appellants&nbsp; strongly urge that since&nbsp; Camilo's testimony as regards&nbsp; the guilt&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accused James Kay and&nbsp; Aw Ming was not given&nbsp; credence, it&nbsp; should&nbsp; likewise be held unworthy&nbsp; of&nbsp; credence&nbsp; as regards the appellants.&nbsp; It is however a&nbsp; settled rule that&nbsp; the courts may believe&nbsp; one part of the testimony of&nbsp; a witness and disbelieve another part.&nbsp; Courts are not required to accept or reject the whole of the testimony of a particular witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case at bar, the lower&nbsp; court found that&nbsp; Camilo's testimony concerning the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; James Uy&nbsp; and Aw Ming&nbsp; was not corroborated and, except said testimony, there was nothing in the&nbsp; evidence presented&nbsp; by the prosecution which would connect them with the perpetration of the crime charged against them, this being the main reason for their&nbsp; acquittal. In other words, James Uy&nbsp; and Aw Ming were acquitted on the&nbsp; insufficiency of&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and&nbsp; not&nbsp; on a finding that Camilo's' testimony was&nbsp; not worthy of credence.<br><br>Appellants also claim that it. is&nbsp; hard to believe Camilo's testimony to the effect that, after Hidalgo had. committed himself to pay P16,000&nbsp; to his&nbsp; coconspirators to set fire on&nbsp; his&nbsp; building, he would&nbsp; still help his accomplices in&nbsp; the preparation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; incendiary paraphernalia,&nbsp; and even more incredible that&nbsp; after the seizure by&nbsp; Detective&nbsp; Lt. Morales&nbsp; of the checks issued to&nbsp; his accomplices in payment for&nbsp; their&nbsp; help, he&nbsp; would still&nbsp; insist in carrying&nbsp; out the&nbsp; plan&nbsp; to burn&nbsp; said building.&nbsp;&nbsp; But,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor General pointed out—<br><blockquote>"All these alleged incredibilities are susceptible of rational 'explanation.&nbsp; Appellants were not buying gasoline&nbsp; in 12&nbsp; glass jars, rolls. of tissue&nbsp; paper,&nbsp; and&nbsp; an&nbsp; inch-long candle, but the know-how&nbsp; for the&nbsp; attainment of their objective, viz.,&nbsp; the burning' of the building so that&nbsp; they might collect on their P135,000&nbsp; policies.&nbsp; For such&nbsp; a stake, P16,000&nbsp; certainly cannot be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; an excessive price to pay. And&nbsp; after&nbsp; all,&nbsp; what&nbsp; appellants actually&nbsp; parted&nbsp; with&nbsp; was only P1,000 before the fire, and&nbsp; it is&nbsp; not most&nbsp; unreasonable to. suppose&nbsp; that the agreement&nbsp; between James Kay and the appellants was&nbsp; to make encashment of the checks contingent&nbsp; on a successful burning&nbsp; and recovery on the&nbsp; insurance&nbsp; policies, since&nbsp; the twelve-thousand-peso check,&nbsp; Exhibit L, was postdated more than&nbsp; a month. from the actual&nbsp; date of its issuance,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; three-thousand-peso check, Exhibit K,&nbsp; was not&nbsp; completely dated,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Maura&nbsp; did&nbsp; not have any deposit to&nbsp; back&nbsp; them up.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; strange in the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; Hidalgo helped&nbsp; his&nbsp; accomplices&nbsp; arrange&nbsp; the: tissue paper and&nbsp; jars.&nbsp; It was necessary that he be in the building when the&nbsp; trio&nbsp; arrived&nbsp; to prevent their being&nbsp; stopped or questioned by the&nbsp; other tenants of the&nbsp; second floor,&nbsp; and being there,&nbsp; it was all too&nbsp; natural for him to give a hand.&nbsp; As to tho confiscation of the checks, the appellants could not have&nbsp; been deterred thereby from. going ahead with the planned&nbsp; burning,&nbsp; because they could not have then&nbsp; known&nbsp; that, Camilo would turn&nbsp; state witness.&nbsp; It cannot be gainsaid that without Camilo's&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; it would&nbsp; have been impossible&nbsp; to connect the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; notwithstanding that&nbsp; the cheeks were in the hands of the police authorities.&nbsp; This explain also&nbsp; why the appellants did not mind using checks."</blockquote>Consequently, we hold the view that Camilo's testimony deserves credence, for&nbsp; it&nbsp; is not only corroborated by the issuance of Maura Gotengco of the aforementioned&nbsp; checks (Exhibits K and&nbsp; L), but also by the facts correctly&nbsp; indicated by the Solicitor&nbsp; General in his brief, to&nbsp; wit:<br><blockquote>(1) The admitted&nbsp; fact that the appellants did declare&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 1,&nbsp; 1950, to&nbsp; a bank, the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Trust Company, the&nbsp; loss of certain checks whose serial numbers included those of Exhibits K. and L.&nbsp; (Sec Exhibit 11.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot&nbsp; just be pure&nbsp; coincidence that the&nbsp; Hidalgo&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; were, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; Camilo,&nbsp; informed&nbsp; of the confiscation of the cheeks by&nbsp; Morales&nbsp; on October 6,&nbsp; 1950, and that Dr.&nbsp; Hidalgo&nbsp; then told him and&nbsp; James Kay&nbsp; that he&nbsp; would&nbsp; declare to&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank that the checks&nbsp; had&nbsp; been lost.<br>"(2)&nbsp; The uncontradicted number and manner of arrangement of the&nbsp; glass jars which were found&nbsp; in the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; of the Republic Vocational School immediately after&nbsp; the fire.<br>"(3)&nbsp; The uncontradicted fact that the contents of said jars were indeed gasoline as found&nbsp; by the MPD Chemist Ungson upon analysis thereof.<br>"(4)&nbsp; The uncontradicted presence and arrangement of tissue paper in&nbsp; relation to the glass&nbsp; jars in&nbsp; exactly the same manner described by Camilo.<br>" (5)&nbsp; The&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; occupancy by&nbsp; Hidalgo&nbsp; spou ses&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; room on the second floor of the building&nbsp; where&nbsp; the fire occurred, and the presence therein&nbsp; of dogs of foreign breed, some chairs,&nbsp; and a bed.<br>"(6)&nbsp; The undenied ownership by&nbsp; Dr. Hidalgo of a yellow Cadillac convertible.<br>"(7)&nbsp; The admitted tenancy of the Rizal&nbsp; Avenue wing&nbsp; by&nbsp; various tenants.<br>"(8)&nbsp; The&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; occupancy&nbsp; by&nbsp; Republic Vocational&nbsp;&nbsp; School of&nbsp; the Echague wing of the&nbsp; building&nbsp; and the presence therein at the&nbsp; time of&nbsp; the fire oi tables&nbsp; and bookcases among the&nbsp; articles Camilo said&nbsp; he&nbsp; saw there."</blockquote>Another&nbsp; contention of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; is that the court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; not&nbsp; requiring the prosecution&nbsp; to present proof in support&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; the discharge&nbsp; of&nbsp; Florencio Camilo before&nbsp; allowing him to be a witness for the state.<br><br>This&nbsp; contention is obviously&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; Section 9, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, does not require presentation of proof before a motion for exclusion of an accused to be witness&nbsp; for&nbsp; the state is&nbsp; granted.&nbsp; The law&nbsp; only requires that hearing thereof&nbsp; be had and, in the case at bar, there has been auch hearing, for as&nbsp; we held in the case of U. S. vs.&nbsp; Abanzado et al., 87 Phil.,&nbsp; 659.<br><blockquote>"It was not the intention&nbsp; of the legislator, by the&nbsp; enactment of Act No. 2709,&nbsp; to deprive the&nbsp; prosecution and the&nbsp; state of the right to make&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>participes eruminis as witnesses,&nbsp; but merely to regulate&nbsp; the exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; that right by&nbsp; establishing&nbsp; the conditions tinder which, it may properly&nbsp; be exercised.</i><br><br>"The Act&nbsp; leaves the manner of&nbsp; the enforcement&nbsp; of these conditions in the sound judicial discretion&nbsp; oi' the&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; If the court errs in the exercise of this discretion and discharges&nbsp; a&nbsp; guilty person who should&nbsp; not have&nbsp; been set at&nbsp; liberty,&nbsp; the error,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; general rule, cannot be cured&nbsp; any more than any other error&nbsp; can be cured which&nbsp; results&nbsp; in. an acquittal&nbsp; at a guilty&nbsp; defendant in&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal action (U. S. vs. De Guzman, 30 Phil. 416). But&nbsp; the commission of such&nbsp; error does&nbsp; not&nbsp; have&nbsp; the effect of&nbsp; discharging from&nbsp; criminal liability the accused&nbsp; persons&nbsp; who&nbsp; were not discharged that&nbsp; they might&nbsp; be&nbsp; used as witnesses."</blockquote>Lastly, appellants urge&nbsp; that&nbsp; in the case at bar, no <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> was proven.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention merits no consideration whatsoever, for in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case there&nbsp; was a building burned' and&nbsp; its burning&nbsp; was&nbsp; the result of the&nbsp; wrongful and criminal act of some persons,&nbsp; among them, the witness Camilo and&nbsp; the herein&nbsp; appellants.&nbsp; In&nbsp; prosecutions&nbsp; for arson, proof&nbsp; of the crime charged&nbsp; is complete where the evidence&nbsp; establishes (1) the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span>, that is, a fire because of&nbsp; criminal agency; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the indemnity&nbsp; of the defendant as the one&nbsp; responsible for&nbsp; the fire&nbsp; (Curtis, The Law of Arson p. 526, section&nbsp; 486).<br><br>Wherefore, finding no&nbsp; errors in the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from, the same is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
