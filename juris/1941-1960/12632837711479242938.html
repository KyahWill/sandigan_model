				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners filed with the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental a 
protest contesting the result of the elections for vice-mayor and councilor held 
in Ayuquitan on November 11, 1947.
<p>The protest is dated on November 25, 1947. In answer dated December 13,1947, 
protestees denied the facts alleged as grounds of protest. </p>
<p>On February 5, 1948, protestants moved through a written petition that the 
ballot boxes of the eleven precincts of Ayuquitan be ordered opened and the 
ballots thereof counted, as evidence in support of the following allegations 
made in the protest:</p>
<p align="center">"V</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. Terrorism, threats, intimidation and coercion were used, before and 
during the election, as follows:</p>
<p>"(a) A day before the election a leader of protestants was kidnapped with 
intention of scaring away from the electoral polls on election day followers of 
protestants as in fact many did not vote on this account.</p>
<p>"(b) Some leaders of protestants were attacked and bodily harmed by leaders 
of protestees with evident intention of preventing them and protestants' 
followers from coming to the electoral polls to vote for protestants, and this 
in fact scared them from voting on election day. </p>
<p>"(c) A well-plumed public disturbance by firing guns in strategic places on 
the eve of election dry accompanied by malicious propagation of information that 
shooting would occur on election day, succeeded in planting fear in the hearts 
and minds of the protestants' electors, causing many of protestants' electors 
not to came to vote as was the evident intention of protestees' leaders in 
making the public disturbance. </p>
<p>"(d) Protestees armed with gun a freely went in and out of the polling places 
for precinct 1 to 8 located in tho poblacion of the town, threatening the 
leaders and followers of the protestants and forcing and coercing them to vote 
for protestees and their candidates. </p>
<p>"(e) Leaders of protestoes, Many of whom claim si to be special agents of 
Governor Praxedes Villanueva with authority to make arrests and all armed with 
guns, freely entered the polling places for precincta Nos. 1 to 8 and their 
immediate vicinities, threatening and intimidating the electors, and forcing and 
coercing them to vote for protestees and their ticket, because of this and the 
irregularity specified in (d) at least fifty 50 electors in each of precincts 
Nos. 1 to 8, were forced to vote for protestess and their candidates. </p>
<p>"(f) That protestants and their watchers, and the watchers of proteatants' 
provincial and national candidates were threatened and forced out of the polling 
places for precincts Nos. 1 to 8 by protestees and their leaders, so that 
protestees and their leaders could commit any or all irregularities they wished 
and desired in fact they succeeded in doing so without any to prevent them from 
committing the irregularities. </p>
<p>"(g) Protestees and their leaders, in open violation, of law, prepared the 
ballots of at least sixty 60 electors in every precinct of precinct No. 1 to 8, 
inclusive. </p>
<p>"(h) That during the counting and canvass of the votes for precincts Nos. 1 
to 8, at least twenty 20 ballots in each of those precincts in which protestants 
appeared voted for the office of Municipal Vice-Mayor and Municipal Councilors 
were maliciously and illegally read and tallied as votes cast in favor of 
protestees. </p>
<p>"(i) That at least ten 10 ballots in each of the eleven 11 precincts of the 
municipality of Ayuquitan in which protestants were voted for the office of the 
Municipal Vice-Mayor and Municipal Councilors were illegally not counted in 
protestants' favor on the pretext that they were marked ballots, when a a a 
matter of fact they were not. </p>
<p>"(j) That at least fifteen 15 ballots in each of the 11 precincts of the 
municipality of Ayuquitan in which protestees were voted for Municipal 
vice-Mayor were marked ballots but were nevertheless counted in favor of the 
protestees. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">"VI </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That as alleged in the next preceding paragraph, at least 1,395 votes should 
be deducted from tha votes credited in favor of protestees, and 200 votes should 
be added to the votes credited to the protestants." </p></blockquote>
<p>On the same date, February 5, 1948,. respondent judge issued an order defying 
the petition. quoting the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in Cecilio v. 
Belmonte (48 Phil., 243) and Mandac vs. Samonte (49 Phil., 284), to the effect 
that to order the opening of ballot boxes is a ministerial duty of the court, 
the respondent qualified the doctrine to the effect that the allegations of the 
protest must be "clear, rational and convincing," adding that the allegations in 
petitioner's protest "are, on the face thereof, inaccurate and lacking in 
definiteness and sincerity." </p>
<p>Motion for reconsideration was filed on February 9, 1948, but was denied on 
February 11. </p>
<p>Petitioners pray for us to order respondent judge to order the opening of the 
ballot boxes in question and the counting of the ballots deposited therein, as a 
ministerial duty. </p>
<p>Time and again, this Supreme Court has declared in numerous cases that, when 
there is an allegation in an election protest that would require the perusal, 
examination, or counting of ballots as evidence, it is the ministerial duty of 
the trial court to order the opening of the ballot boxes and the examination and 
counting of the ballots deposited therein. </p>
<p>The doctrine has been laid down under legal provisions existing before the 
enactment of the Election Code. The latter embodied expressly the mandatory 
provision which was only implicit in former election laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 175 of the Election Code reads as follows: </p>
<p>"SEC. 175.<em> Judicial counting of votes in contested elections.</em> — Upon 
the petition of any interested party, or <i>motu proprio</i>, if the interests of 
justice so require, the court shall immediately order that the copies of the 
registry lists, the ballot boxes, the election statements, the voters' 
affidavits, and the other documents used in the election be produced before it 
and that the ballots be examined and the votes recounted, and for such purpose 
it may appoint such officers as it may deem necessary and shall fix the 
compensation of each at not less than five pesos but not more than fifteen pesos 
for every election precinct which they may completely revise and report upon." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The above-quoted provision contemplates two cases in which "the court shall 
immediately order * * * that the ballot boxes * * * be produced before it and 
that the ballots be examined and the votes recounted"; first, "upon the petition 
of any interested party," and Second, "or <em>motu proprio</em> if the interests 
of justice so requires". </p>
<p>Under the first case, the more "petition of any interested of party" of 
course, in accordance with the pleadings, is by itself enough. The limitations 
implicit in the pronouncements made by the Supreme Court as to the effect that 
the allegations of the protest must show the need of counting and examining the 
ballots have been eliminated by the drafters of the Election Code. Their evident 
purpose was to cut short all technicalities and controversies on legal niceties 
standing in the way of a prompt examination and counting of the ballots and 
early disposal of protests, and to avoid the recurring petitions filed with the 
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The opportunity for the opening of ballot boxes and the counting of ballots 
has been broadened by the Election Code to such an extent that the right to ask 
for it is not reserved exclusively to protestants, as had happened formerly, but 
has been extended to "any interested party", including protestees and third 
party litigants. </p>
<p>The qualification of "if the interests of justice so requires" is attached to 
the "<em>motu proprio</em>" case, as grammatically is indicated by the first 
separating comma in the provision. </p>
<p>As prayed for, respondent judge is ordered to immediately order the opening 
of the ballot boxes of the eleven precincts of Ayuquitan and the counting and 
examination of all tho ballots deposited therein, and follow the procedure 
outlined by section 175 of the Election Code, with costs in favor of 
petitioners. </p>
<p><em>Parás, Actg. C.J., Feria, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br>Padilla, <i>J.</i>, I concur in the result. <br></p><p>Paras, <i>Actg. C.J.</i>, I certify that Mr. Justice Pablo voted with the majority. 
<br></p><br><br>

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.: </strong></p>
<p>I am constrained to dissent from the determination made by the majority of 
the instant case. Section 175 of the Revised Election Code provides as follows: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 175. <em>Judicial counting of votes in contested elections.</em>—Upon 
the petition of any Interested party, or <em>motu proprio</em>, <em>if the 
interests of justice so require</em>, the court shall immediately order that the 
copies of the registry lists, the ballot boxes, the election statements, the 
voter's affidavits, and the other documents used in the election be produced 
before it and that the ballots be examined and the votes recounted, and for such 
purpose it may appoint such officers as it may deem necessary and shall fix the 
compensation of each at not less than five pesos but not more than fifteen pesos 
for every election precinct which they may completely revise and report upon. 
(C. A., 357-169)" (Italics supplied.) </p></blockquote>
<p>The source of this provision was Commonwealth Act No. 357, Section 169, which 
also contained the all-important modifying phrase "if the interests of justice 
so require". This phrase, coming as it does after two previous phrases separated 
from each other with a "comma" and the second of which is also separated with a 
"comma" from the modifying phrase, must be interpreted to modify both phrases. 
The result is, that what the law here ordains is that whether the opening of the 
ballot boxes and the examination of the ballots and recounting of the votes is 
sought "upon the petition of any interested party", or is contemplated to be 
ordered by the court <em>motu proprio</em>. such opening and such examination 
and such recounting can only be ordered <em>if the interests of justice so 
require</em>. Now it is plain that this legal provision confers discretion upon 
the court before which the contest is pending to determine whether the interests 
of justice require them. If the lawmaker intended that it shall be the court's 
mandatory duty to so order upon the mere petition of any interested party 
regardless of whether or not the interests of justice require it, he would not 
have placed a "comma" after the word "party" in the first phrase. Neither can I 
agree with the construction which would say that this modifying phrase applies 
only to a <em>motu proprio</em> order of the court, for if the interests of 
justice are to control the <em>motu proprio</em> action of the court, it would 
be absurd to hold that they shall not control the action of the court if such 
action is requested by an interested party. It seems to me to be self-evident 
that the interests of justice are supreme in the two cases, and must control the 
action of the court in one or the other. The legality of the election being 
presumed, I am of the considered opinion that where a <em>prima facie</em> case 
is not made that it was tainted with illegality sufficient to alter the result 
of the election, and that the opening of the ballot boxes and examination or 
recounting of the ballots, are material to establish such <em>prima facie</em> 
case, the interests of justice do not require such opening, examination and 
recounting. Paragraph V, 3 (e)-(j) of the motion of protest 
dated November 25, 1947, is pointed to as justifying such reopening, examination 
and recounting. But said motion is not so much as verified, and no evidence is 
of record to support it. </p>
<p>It will be noted that the cases cited by petitioners were decided under the 
election law in force prior to the present Revised Election Code, and even prior 
to the election code immediately preceding, namely, Commonwealth Act No. 357. 
For instance, in Cecilio <em>vs</em>. Belmonte, 48 Phil., 243, 249-250, this 
Court quoted the pertinent provision of section 479 of the then existing 
Election Law, as then drafted, and as it was successively amended by section 44 
of Act No. 3030, and by Section 25 of Act No. 3210. As originally drafted and as 
thus amended by Act No. 3030, said Election Law imposed upon the Court of First 
Instance with which the election protest was filed this mandatory duty: "and 
shall forthwith cause the registration lists and all ballots used at such 
election to be brought before it and examined." And, as amended by section 25 of 
Act No. 3210, the provision was changed to read: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"* * * Upon petition of an interested party, or of its own accord 
if the interests of justice require it * * *". </p></blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that in the last quoted amended provision of that former 
Election Law the qualifying phrase "if the interests of justice require it" was 
for the first time employed. It will likewise be observed that in that provision 
said phrase followed the phrase "of its own accord" <em>without</em> any 
punctuation between them, while the preceding phrase "upon petition of an 
interested party" was separated by a "comma" from the phrase "of its own 
accord". As the provision was thus drafted, it is clear that the phrase "if the 
interests of justice require it" modified only the phrase "of its own 
accord".</p>
<p>Undoubtedly realizing that there was no sound reason for requiring the action 
of the court to be controlled by the demands of the interests of justice if it 
acted "of its own accord", and not when it acted "upon petition of an interested 
party", the legislature saw fit to apply the requirement to both cases, drafting 
the corresponding provision, both in section 169 of Commonwealth Act No. 357, 
the Election Code, and in section 175 of Republic Act No. 180, the Revised 
Election Code, in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon the petition of any interested party, or <em>motu proprio</em>. if the 
interests of justioe so require, * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p align="left">In the first part of this dissent I have already tried to analyze 
the effect of the above-quoted phraseology with particular reference to its 
punctuation, and the consequent interpretation thereof that I believe should be 
given.</p></div>
