				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal  from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing the complaint filed by plaintiff against  defendant. <br><br>Plaintiff was employed by defendant as  a waiter-pinboy and  had  been working as  such from  October,  1951 to February 15,  1955 with a monthly salary  of P127.00.  On the latter date, plaintiff was  dismissed  on the  strength of a written statement made by one Alejandro Olido,  his co-worker, to the effect that he saw two teaspoons, one knife and a towel in the house of plaintiff  which  were obviously taken by him from the defendant.  Feeling that he was a victim  of  injustice,  he filed a  claim with the Bureau of Labor praying that  he be paid his back wages and  a separation pay.  After proper investigation, said Office rendered decision dismissing the complaint  for  it was  found that plaintiff was dismissed for cause.   However,  on a rehearing at the instance of  plaintiff on the ground that Olido rectified  his previous statement saying that what he  saw in the house of plaintiff were articles similar  to those  belonging  to  defendant,  the Bureau  of Labor ruled that  plaintiff be paid a sum equivalent to one month salary in lieu of one month notice in  advance.  Complying with  this  ruling, defendant  deposited  with said Bureau the sum of P110.00.   Plaintiff  did not  appeal from this  decision.   However, on December 27, 1955, or four months thereafter, he commenced the present  action praying for  his reinstatement with back wages. <br><br>At the hearing, the parties agreed to re-submit in this case all the pleadings, evidence and record of  the proceedings had in the office of the Bureau  of  Labor with this reservation: that  defendant  shall have the right to present the testimony, of Jose Luis Carceller to explain and clarify certain points, while plaintiff the right to present a rebuttal witness.  After these  witnesses  had testified  and the parties had submitted their memoranda, the court rendered decision dismissing the complaint.  Plaintiff took the case directly to this Court on the plea that he would raise only questions of law. <br><br>Appellant claims that the trial court ignored the evidence submitted with  regard to the promise of  reinstatement made by witness Jose Luis Carceller  who  was  then the manager of defendant  if he proves to be innocent of the charge imputed to him, and this claim is predicated upon the fact that  the main witness  of defendant regarding this  charge has  rectified  his  statement and cleared him of  any responsibility. <br><br>There is no  merit in this claim.  In the first place, the trial court  did not make any  finding on this matter,  for it merely decided the  case in the light of  Republic Act No. 1052.   The court considered  this Act applicable and having found  that defendant  has  already  complied with its terms, found no merit in the complaint.   In the second place, appellant has misinterpreted the promise  made by Carceller to reinstate him  if he proves his  innocence of the  charge  because  in  making his claim, he only quotes from a portion of Carceller's  testimony and ignores  the rest.  In other words,  what Carceller  stated was not an  outright reinstatement  if  appellant would  prove  his  innocence  but simply  a promise that he would recommend his reinstatement to the secretary of the board of directors of  defendant  who is the one empowered to  act on  the matter. <br><br>Thus, this is what Carceller  testified: "I most certainly would take him back again if it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that he is innocent  and I  would also take step to punish the  witness  who misled  me  if that were the case."  And when he was asked to" explain the import of such statement, Carceller made this clarification: "What I meant was I  am going to recommend  it to  the Secretary and  Board  of  Directors to take him back  if it was so proven."  And when he was  asked whether he recommended him for reinstatement, Carceller said that he did not because  "I had my doubts as to his honesty."  (t. s. n.  pp. 3-5, August 14, 1956).  Indeed, there is something to this  statement when we consider the rectification  of witness Olido to the  effect that articles he  saw  in  the house of appellant were only<span style="font-style: italic;"> similar</span> to those belonging to the defendant.  This rectification is not satisfactory.  It does not  clear  appellant  completely from  any  taint  of guilt. <br><br>But  we agree with the trial court that,  even if there were no cause for separation, defendant  can still separate appellant from the service under the provisions of Republic Act No. 1052.   Section 1 of this Act provides  that "In case of employment, without a definite period, in a commercial, industrial or agricultural establishment or enterprise, neither the employer nor  the employee shall terminate the employment without serving notice on the other at least one month in advance."   In other words, as long as that notice  is given, the relation may be terminated. In  the  present case  defendant  has complied with this requirement when, in lieu of that notice, it paid an amount equivalent to one month salary to appellant.  This is the basis  of the decision  of the trial court and  in this we find no  error. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
