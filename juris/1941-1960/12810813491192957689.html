				<BR><STRONG>PABLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Esta causa esta <em>ante</em> Nos en grado de apelacion. El acusado admits 
que did muerte a Alejandro Piso en el pueblo de Manapla, Negros Occidental en la 
tarde de agosto 2, 1945; pero lo hizo en defensa de su vida.
<p>Declarando como testigo a su favor, el acusado dijo que en aquella tarde 
Alejandro Piso le encontro a el en un campo sacando unas mazorcas de maiz, y Ie 
increpo "Quo estas hacicndo, Kokoy? Tu mismo estas hurtando mi maiz." Ofendido, 
Alejandro Ie dirigio una palabra <br>insultante, abalanzandose hacia el. El 
acusado corrio hacia su casa y Alejandro le persiguio, Ie tiro piedra, y despues 
]e dijo: "Esperame, te voy a matar." El acusado consiguio refugiarse en su casa. 
Alejandro apedreo dzcha casa, y al ver a un gallo del acusado salir de un 
palayal, Ie tiro una piedra matandole en el acto. Alejandro Piso reto otra vez 
al acusado diciendole "Vente abajo, loco, te matare como mate a tu gallo." Como 
el acusado no contestaba, Alejandro Piso fue a su casa para recoger un bolo y, a 
su vuelta, corto dos platanos del acusado y despues invito al acusado que 
bajase. Cuando Alejandro estaba cerca de la puerta de la casa con intencion de 
subir, el acusado salio pasando por la puerta de la cocina llevando consigo una 
tranca (una madera de un metro de largo, dos dedos de grueso y tres dedos de 
ancho) y con ella pego a Alejandro acertandole en la mano derecha y en la 
cadei'a derecha, y el bolo de que estaba armado Alejandro cayo al suelo. El 
acusado se apodero del bolo y Alejandro aiTebatd de el la tranca. Con ella, 
Alejandro ataco al acusado varias veces en rapida sucesion mienti'as el acusado, 
retrocediendo, se defendfa con el bolo. Asi fue como el acusado consiguio herir 
varias veces a Alejandro hasta dejarle tendido y muerto en el suelo. 
Inmediatamente, fue a buscar a su es-posa y la encontro en la casa de su 
hermano. Por la noche, despues de despedirse de ella, de su hercnano e hijos, se 
dirigio al cuartel de policia en la poblacion, diciendo al policia Vicente 
Rosales "guardia, arrestame porque mate a un hombre." "Este es el bolo que use 
al matar."<br>Merece credito esta defensa? Opinamos que no, por varias razones. 
Primera: si es verdad que Alejandro inten-taba subir, el acusado Ie luibiera 
esperado que subiera y <em>contra</em> tranca derribarle en vez de dejar la casa 
pasando por la cocina. Uno que sube no puede ofrecer resistencia efectiva 
<em>contra</em> el que esta en un piso seguro y mas alto. Su casa era su mejor 
fortaleza. Cualquiera, en su lugar, no la hublera abandonado para exponerse a 
los azares de una lucha en terreno igual. Segunda: esfee intento de Alejandro de 
subir por la escalera de la casa es un. hecho nuevo que no revelo el acusado 
cuando presto su affidavit en agosto 14, 1945 ni lo dijo al policia cuando se 
presento. Peguntado por el motivo, contesto: "que el mato a Alejandro Piso 
porque Alejandro mato a su gallo." Esta declaracion hecha mmediatamente despues 
del suceso debe ser la verdad liana y sencilla y no el cuento de la legitima 
defensa. "La declaracion de un acusado no merece credito ni inspira confianza si 
es inconsistente e incompatible con sus otras declaraciones heclias en otras 
ocasiones." '(Pueblo <em>contra</em> Ramos, pag. 4, .) Tercera: el acusado es 
zurdo, y si es verdad que daba los bolazos frente a frente <em>contra</em> 
Alejandro mientras iba retrocediendo y defendiendose de los garrotazos, las 
heridas se hubieran infligido en el lado dereclio de Alejandro. Las siete 
heridas encontradas en el cadaver de este estaban todas en el lado izquierdo. 
Estos datos son elocuentes: denuncian que el acusado estaba detras de Alejandro 
cuando daba los tajos. Caido el bolo, Alejandro no tenia otro remedio mas que la 
fuga. Le perseguia indudablemente el acusado cuando Ie daba los bolazos. Cuarta: 
es raro que el acusado no haya recibido ninguna contusion si es verdad que 
Alejandro Je atacaba con la tzanca (de un metro de largo) mientras el se 
defendia solamente con el bob que es mucho mas corto, Esta circunstancia hace 
insostenible la teoria del acusado: de legitima defensa.</p>
<p>La exculpacion, en caso de homicidio, como defensa pro-pia, es una alegacion 
afirmativa que debe ser demostrada con pruebas convincentes y no de dudosa 
veracidad; en caso contrario, la condena del acusado es forzosa. (Estados Unidos 
<em>contra</em> Coronel, 30 Jur. Fil., 119; Pueblo <em>contra</em> Ba-guio, 43 
Jur. Fil., 715; Pueblo <em>contra</em> Gutierrez, 53 Jur. Fil., 648; Pueblo 
<em>contra</em>, Ramos, pag. 4, <em>ante</em>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Incumbe al acusado establecer clara y bastantemente haberlo hecho en 
legitima defensa propia." {Pueblo <em>contra</em> Silang Cruz, 53 Jur. Fil., 
677.)</p>
<p>"Para que la defensa propia como tal defensa pueda prosperar es preciso que 
las pruebas la demuestren de una ma-nera clara y convincente." (Pueblo 
<em>contra</em> Berio, 59 Jur. Fil., 562.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Por otra parte, el acusado respondio al reto de Alejandro bajando de su casa 
armado con una tranca: no puede invo-car con exito el derecho de legitima 
defensa porque voluntariamente se expuso a las contingencias de una lucha con su 
contrario, y porque no puede ser otra la intention de los contendientes mas que 
el de danarse reciprocamente, el primer ataque que puede venir de cualquiera no 
es mas que un incidente de la misma pelea, y de ninguna manera debe considerarse 
como agresion injustificada e inesperada. (Sentencia del Tribunal Supremo de 
Espaiia de 6 de fe-brero de 1899, citada en Pueblo contra Cortes, 36 Jur. Fil., 
892.) "Es ya jurisprudencia"—dijo el Presidente Arellano en la misma causa—"bien 
sentada en reiteradas decisiones interpretativas del articulo 8 del Codigo 
Penal, que acep-tado un desafio y colocandose por ello el agente en un estado i 
legal y de fuerza, la agresion previa de su contrario, que por no ser inesperada 
no puede hallarse desapercibido, excluye la situacion de defensa legitima, pues 
el reto o desafio excluye por si mismo el concepto de defensa personal 
exi-mente, total o parcialmente, de responsabilidad." (Sentencia del Tribunal 
Supremo de Espana de 8 de marzo de 1897.)</p>
<p>Opinamos que el acusado no ha probado su alegada defensa legitima. Ha 
infringido el articulo 249 del Codigo Penal Revisado, con dos circunstancias 
atenuantes, la de provocacidn inmediata de parte del ofendido y presentacion 
voluntaria del acusado los agentes de autoridad. (Articulo 13, pars. 4.a y 7.a 
del Codigo Penal Revisado.)</p>
<p>Confirmamos la sentencia del juzgado inferior que impone al acusado la pena 
indeterminada que no baje de dos (2) años, cuatro (4) meses y un (1) dfa de 
<em>prision correccional</em> y que no exceda de ocho (8) años y un (1) dia de 
prision mayor, indemnizacion a los herederos del occiso en la cantidad de 
P2,000, sin prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia, con las costas del 
juicio.</p><em>Paras, Hilado, y Padilla, MM.,</em> estan conformes. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Restituto Bauden was found guilty of homicide, committed on the person of 
Alejandro 'Piso on August 2, 1945, and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 
from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <em>prision 
correccional</em> to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, 
and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P2,000. He appealed 
from the decision.</p>
<p>At the trial three witnesses testified for the prosecution.</p>
<p>Salomon Losande, a sanitary inspector, identified Exhibit A as the 
certificate he issued on August 4, 1945, on the result of the <em>post 
mortem</em> examination he made of the cadaver of Alejandro Piso.</p>
<p>Adoracion Piso, 11 years old child of Alejandro, testified that "I was 
watching the chickens in the field. My father scolded me because the chickens 
were picking up the seeds of our field, but my uncle, Tatay Totong, intervened. 
They made an altercation. They were arguing with each other. Tatay Totong picked 
up a stone and threw it at my father who was riding on a carabao. My father was 
not hit. So, he jump from the carabao and ran away. Tatay Totong went up to his 
house and got a bolo and went after my father. He immediately boloed my father. 
That is all. He (my father) fell on the ground." Her father was hit by the bolo 
on the left side in front of the ear. Tatay Totong is Restituto Bauden.</p>
<p>Concerning this witness, the lower court said: "The court had examined the 
witness for the purpose of finding out whether she had the necessary power of 
observing and transmitting what she observed. She has some but not fully. So, if 
it is only the testimony of this girl, I don't think the court would make any 
finding."</p>
<p>Vicente Rosales, the last witness for the prosecution, is a policeman of 
Manapla, Negros Occidental, and testified that in the evening of August 3, while 
he was on duty in the municipal building, the accused approached him and cried, 
"Guard, catch me because I killed a man. This is the bolo that I used in 
killing." The witness surrendered the bolo to the sergeant. He investigated the 
accused, who said that he killed Piso because the latter killed his chicken. No 
attempt was made to put any" statement of the accused into writing.</p>
<p>Evaristo Padilla, 63 years old, uncle of Piso's wife, testified that in the 
afternoon of August 2, "I heard Alejandro Piso saying, 'wait for me because I 
will kill you,' anc I turned back my face and saw Alejandro Piso following 
Restituto Bauden having a stone in his hand after he had thrown a stone once at 
Restitute" Restituto went to his house. And then Alejandro arrived and he stoned 
the house of Restituto Bauden. Alejandro Piso saw some chickens in the field and 
he picked up some stones and stoned the chickens and one was hit and was killed. 
The chicken came from the rice field. The field is near the house of Alejandro 
Piso. Alejandro said to Restitute, "Come down, you fool, because I am going to 
let you die with your chickens." Restituto just kept silent. Alejandro returned 
to his house hurriedly. He came back with a bolo in his hand. "That Exhibit 1 is 
the very bolo. When he arrived at the house of Restituto, he immediately boloed 
a piece of banana tree and another tree was cut. So I shouted to Alejandro, you 
are still challenging Restituto when in fact he does not accept your challenge 
and he would not fight with you.' Then after that Alejandro turned at me and he 
said, 'You do not have anything to do with us. You are going to intervene in 
this matter? You, too?' After I heard him saying that way, I immediately pulled 
out the rope of my carabao with the belief that the deviJ entered on him. After 
that, I went home." About the character of Piso, the witness saict: "He was a 
troublesome fellow. Ho even gave blows to some small children, who were 
troubling him. His fatheVin-law, my second-grade cousin was driven by him 
sometimes. His two brothers-in-law were even chased by him with bolo. He chased 
his father-in-law for whatever cause and anything he might have." Alejandro Piso 
"was about 40 years old more or less. He was physically well-built."</p>
<p>Restituto Bauden testified that in the afternoon of August 2, after buying 
viands froni the town, he went home. Not finding there his wife, "I went down 
immediately and went to my camote plantation. I tried to look for my Mrs. who, I 
believe, was there, digging some camotes, but I did not see her there. I stood 
up and look somewhere and I saw a person in the middle of my corn field. I saw 
him gathering my ears of corn, so I approached near him, and at a distance of 
about 10 brazas, I recognized him to be 'Kokoy'," my uncle Alejandro Piso. "I 
told him, 'what are you doing Kokoy? You yourself are stealing my corn/ When he 
heard me, he immediately addressed to me: 'Fool'. At the same time, he rushed 
toward me, ran after me and at the same time, stoning me. He said, 'Wait for me. 
I will finish you.' Just after I arrived at home, he also came. He threw stone 
at my house. I was inside my house. He saw my chickens, which were in his rice 
field so he stoned the chickens. My chicken was hit and killed. After killing 
the chicken he went back to my house and said: 'You come down, fool, I will also 
let you die with your chicken.' As he did not hear anything, he went home to his 
house. A few minutes after, he came back with a bolo. When he arrived at the 
stairs of my house, he bo-loed the two banana trees. After he had cut two banana 
trees, he shouted, 'Come down, fool.' Because my house was very low that if one 
would stand up, his breast would be seen inside my house, when I saw him with 
the intention of getting inside my house, I was frightened, so I pulled out a 
bar of wood by the window of my house to be free from danger. I went down around 
the house, so when I was already down, he met me and said: 'You are here now' in 
the attitude of stabbing me with his bolo. So, I immediately hit him in his 
right hand. After he had dropped his bolo, I immediately picked it up. When he 
saw that I was picking up his bolo, he immediately grabbed the piece of wood, 
which I was holding. So, when I saw him, I immediately stopped him with his 
bolo. I retreated back. As I retreated, he followed me with the intention to hit 
me with the piece of wood he took from me. He struck me, but every time I 
parried with the bolo that I have. While he was chasing me we were able to reach 
the rice paddies. Because he was trying to strike me with the cane, I boloed him 
several times. He staggered and fell down. Upon seeing him fall down, I went to 
the house of my brother, who is sick. I found my Mrs. and the children. I kissed 
my wife and children and told them: 'You have got to live alone because I have 
killed Kokoy.' Then I told my brother, who is sick,'"'You have to take care of 
my children because I am going to town.' I surrendered to the policeman." 
Exhibit 1 is the bolo of deceased Piso. Piso is bigger than the accused, 
although the accused is taller.</p>
<p>The facts proved show that accused, in killing Piso, acted in legitimate 
self-defense. The act of the deceased who intended to attack the accused with a 
deadly weapon, a bolo, followed by threatening words, constitute an unlawful 
aggression and it is lawful for the one assaulted to repel such act of force. 
"During an unlawful attack by another, and while a struggle is going on, and the 
danger to his person or to his life continues, the party assaulted has a right 
to repel the dangfir by wounding his adversary and if necessary to disable him. 
This is justifiable homicide." (United States vs. Molina, 19 Phil., 227.)</p>
<p>The accused in this case cannot be found guilty by this Supreme Court without 
revez'sing itself when in 1917 it ruled as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'The defendant was where he had the right to be, when the deceased advanced 
upon him in a threatening manner, and with a deadly weapon; and if the accused 
did not provoke the assault and had at the time reasonable grounds to believe 
and in good faith believed, that the deceased intended to take his life or do 
him great bodily harm, he was not obliged to retreat, nor consider whether he 
could safely retreat, but was entitled to stand his ground and meet any attack 
made upon him with a deadly weapon, in such a way and with such force as, under 
all the circumstances, he, at the moment, honestly believed, and had reasonable 
grounds to believe, was necessary to save his own life or to protect himself 
from great bodily injury.'" (United States us. Domen [1917], 37 Phi)., 57; Beard 
vs. United States [1894], 158 U. S., 550; Erwin vs. State [1876], 29 Ohio St., 
186.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We believe that the foregoing words of the Supreme Court embody the correct 
legal philosophy on the question of self-defense and justifiable homicide. A 
person who is assaulted, who is the object of unlawful aggression, is not 
obliged to retreat, nor consider whether he could safely retreat, but is 
entitled "to stand his ground and meet any attack made upon him with a deadly 
weapon, in such a way and with such force as, under all the circumstances, he, 
at the moment, honestly believed, and had reasonable grounds to believe, was 
necessary to save his own life or to protect himself from great bodily 
injury."</p>
<p>This is what accused Bauden did. Upon surprising Piso stealing his corn, 
Bauden merely called the attention of the thief to his act. The transgressor of 
the law, instead of humbly accepting his guilt, with shocking: insolence, 
assumed the role of the offended party, as if he was the one being robbed of his 
property, and insulted, pursued and stoned Bauden, the real victim. Since then, 
Bauden had a perfect right to stand his ground to face his assailant, and with 
manly courage repel as effectively as he could the illegal aggression of the 
deceased. But becaus-e of excessive prudence or, perhaps, due to his 
pusillanimous reluctance to meet the challenge of the aggressor, he fled to his 
house. Emboldened by the retreat of Bauden, Piso killed the former's chicken, 
went home to fetch his bolo, cut with it two banana trees of Bauden, stoned the 
house of Bauden, insulted again Bauden, menaced him with death, and for said 
purpose intended to get inside Bauden's house. Under this situation, Bauden 
says: "I was frightened, so I pulled out a bar of wood by the window of my house 
to be free from danger. I went down around the house, so when I was already 
down, he met me and said: 'You are here n6w' in the attitude of stabbing me with 
his bolo. So, I immediately hit him in his right hand." It appears from the 
circumstances that the situation had placed Bauden in such a position that, even 
if he wanted to, he could not retreat without exposing himself to the imminent 
danger of being stabbed at his back, in the same way as Piso cut the banana 
trees with his bolo, and killed without any opportunity of resisting or 
defending himself, as his chicken was killed by Piso. Like grabbing a red-hot 
nail, Bauden pulled out a piece of wood by the window of his house, the best 
defensive weapon which accused could lay hands on under the circumstances, and 
went down the house to defend himself the best he could, instead of remaining in 
his house, where he had no freedom of movements to elude the impending attack, 
and apathetically wait for his sure death at the hands of his aggressor.</p>
<p>The majority opine that Bauden should have remained in his house and waited 
for Piso to come in and then hit him with the piece of wood on the theory that, 
in a personal encounter, the one who is in a lower position is at a 
disadvantage. We disagree, Piso had the following advantages: (1) of being armed 
with a bolo, the deadliest weapon in the hands of-barrio folks; (2) of coming 
from outside the house, Piso had the necessary space for freedom of movements 
and, therefore, to brandish effectively his bolo; (3) located in a lower 
position, it was easy for Piso to immediately disable Bauden by stabbing either 
of his legs which were within easy reach; (4) Bauden could not, inside the 
house, make effective use of the piece of wood, because in wielding it, it was 
liable' to be hampered by the sidings of his small house; and (5) if the floor 
of the house is made of strips of bamboo, as usually is the case in small houses 
in our country, it would not give sure footing for one who is struggling for his 
life, because it is slippery and springy.</p>
<p>But, even in the false hypothesis that the majority's theory is correct, it 
is too much to expect that Bauden should have adopted it necessarily. Because 
his judgment of what was best for his defense and self-protection did not 
coincide with what the majority was expecting of him, it is not right to find 
him guilty of so serious a crime as homicide. Let us remember that Bauden is not 
endowed with the same mental perspicuity by which the members of the Supreme 
Court were able to be placed in the highest tribunal of the land; that Bauden 
had not the benefit of the weeks and months we employed in studying what he 
should have done under the circumstances; that he had not the benefit of 
enlightenment from briefs of competent lawyers; that he had not the advantage of 
a thorough deliberation with jurists and men of ability as Justices of the 
Supreme Court; and that even we, with all the benefits and advantages that were 
denied Bauden, are not unanimous in the opinion that Bauden erred in his 
judgment as to the best means to save his life.</p>
<p>Because Bauden went down the house armed with a piece of wood, the majority 
maintain that he accepted Piso's challenge and, by exposing himself to the 
contingencies of a struggle, he can not invoke with success the legal protection 
for having acted in legitimate self-defense. Why? Does self-defense preclude the 
contingencies of a struggle? Had these contingencies anything to do to change 
the nature of self-defense and to make what is legitimate illegitimate?</p>
<p>The acceptance of a challenge, with or without contingencies, can not make 
illegal a legitimate self-defense. In. fact no self-defense can be offered 
without accepting the challenge of an aggressor. The acceptance of a challenge 
from an aggressor is an essential and indispensable element of self-defense.</p>
<p>Evidently, the prosecution, the lower court, and the majority of the Justices 
taking part in this case would have it that Bauden, on going down the house 
armed with a piece of wood, should have avoided meeting Piso by fleeing in a 
shameful and cowardly mariner. Brushing aside the question of moral and legal 
philosophy involved, which we shall presently discuss, no one can deny that an 
honest difference of opinion may arise as to the effectiveness of the escape as 
a means, not only to end trouble, but to save Bauden's or even Piso's life. The 
record is completely silent as to who, between the two actors in the bloody 
drama, was the better runner; and there is no assurance that if Bauden should 
flee for his life, Piso would ^ot overtake him. Placed at a distance remote from 
the scene of the happenings, lacking sufficient information or. evidence as to 
the physical and athletic abilities of Piso and Bauden, we should be acting 
against the most elemental People vs. Bauderules of judicial wisdom, if we 
should rashly pronounce and conclude that, if Bauden had fled, all would have 
the happy ending of children's tales.</p>
<p>Logic and reason advise us that the course taken by Bauden was, he honestly 
believed, the best to save his life; and if he did not flee when he went down 
armed with a piece of wood, it was because he was convinced that in the supreme 
crisis of his life no other alternative was open to him. If, by fleeing, he 
believed he could save his life, there is ground and reason to assume that he 
would run again, considering that -when, for the first time, he was pursued and 
stoned by Piso, he ran for cover to his small house where Piso continued stoning 
him, instead of meeting his assailant.</p>
<p>In the serene atmosphere of our individual offices in the Supreme Court, by 
giving free reign to our imagination, we may coolly reflect upon physical 
probabilities and possibilities in order that we may determine what would have 
been wiser for Bauden to do to save his life from Piso's criminal aggression. 
Let us nqt.be unjust by condemning Bauden because he followed a course which we 
do not believe to be the best. In the fleeting moments at his disposal, he had 
to make his decision with the speed of a flash and take action without an" 
instant's delay.</p>
<p>The next question appears to us to be even more serious and transcendental. 
In the face of the illegal attack, the brutal onslaught, the criminal 
aggression, what would the victim do? To give ground, to retreat, to flee, or to 
accept destruction with fatalistic attitude? Or, instead, should he stand his 
ground, valiantly face the aggressor, and meet and crush the challenge? There 
are opposing points of view, irreconcilable philosophies; but we must not 
hesitate in choosing the point of view and philosophy which, to our mind, is in 
conformity with the highest standards of moral law and justice.</p>
<p>Arguments may be advanced in favor of the attitude expressed in the Christian 
injunction that if one is slapped in the face, one should also offer the other, 
and that of the Gandhian political philosophy of non-resistance and civil 
disobedience. But, however, laudable the attitude may be when viewed from the 
purely moral light, it appears to us to be futile in the face of realities. The 
philosophy of appeasement is irretrievably bankrupt. It is a philosophy that 
serves only to encourage more lawlessness and to embolden criminals. Chamberlain 
and Daladier practised appeasement at Munich in the mistaken belief that they 
were saving peace. They sacrificed Czechoslovakia and threw chunks of that 
nation to the voracity of the Hitler-ian tiger, the Nazi Moloch. Peace was not 
saved. The criminal aggressors became stronger and the defenders of democracy 
weaker. As a result, many millions of human beings all over the world were 
sacrificed in the greatest hecatomb known in history.</p>
<p>It is already a well-known maxim that the best defense is offense. The most 
effective way of protecting the victim of an illegal aggression is to liquidate 
or annihilate the aggressor. The aggressor, no matter whether he is an 
individual or a nation, acts at his risk. The victim of an aggression is 
entitled to use, in the protection of his rights, the most effective means to 
repel the aggression. We are unwilling to advocate a legal philosophy that would 
compel the victim of an aggression to retreat when, on being attacked by an 
aggressor, he can in his own judgment defend himself better by 
counter-attacking. We can not see any social usefulness in a philosophy of 
cowardice for peaceful and law-abiding citizens. We can not find any moral 
justification in allowing offendei's and criminals to having their own way 
freely, by admonishing the victims to submit or retreat, under penalty of not 
being entitled to invoke the benefits of legitimate self-defense in case they 
happen to be more fortunate in the struggle.</p>
<p>Democracy must be assertive and dynamic. The rights and liberties of the 
people require the positive qualities of vigilance, courage, manliness and 
fighting spirit to assert and exercise them. The struggle of law began more than 
fifty thousand years ago, when human beings began to appear on earth, and must 
go on perpetually if humanity is to survive. The fight for human rights is 
essential for the survival of man. The negative qualities of pusillanimity, of 
defeatism, of relinquishment, of resignation, of slavish surrender, of servile 
submission, of giving the back to aggressors, of avoiding to meet criminals, are 
incompatible with law and justice. They serve only as a stimulus to encourage 
and embolden aggressors and criminals. Law and order may not be kept by 
fatalistic passivity, nor by the habit of fear in the face of blustering bullies 
or by panic at any menace or danger coming from would-be assassins. Criminals 
can not be stopped by unconditional surrender or timorous evasion of the 
victims. The most peaceful democracy in the world had to invent and develop the 
most powerful weapons, including the atomic bomb, to crush and defeat the 
aggressor nation. We hate to imagine what would have happened to the democratic 
countries, including our own, ifr the democracies had followed the policy of 
retreat ancf "evasion, in pursuance of which victim Bauden has been prosecuted 
and is to be condemned to long years of imprisonment as a criminal, only because 
he was fortunate enough, in trying to save his life, in killing his would-be 
killer.</p>
<p>We refuse to give our approval to any judicial doctrine that, in the final 
result, will make of our law-abiding citizens effeminate weaklings who would, at 
the mere sight of an insolent aggressor, run for safety, although armed, 
prepared, and ready to effectively defend themselves and to crush the 
aggression. That doctrine will make of the swaggering aggressors, under a regime 
of terror, flaunting a new version of the Nazi gammadion, the masters of the 
situation, and the rest of the population will be constituted by cowering 
slaves.</p>
<p>Legitimate self-defense can not mean retreat, renunciation, or submission. 
Legitimate self-defense means the assertion of one's own rights by effective 
measures against all illegal onslaughts. It implies not giving ground, but 
resistance against invasion. It requires counter-attack to nullify and defeat a 
criminal attack. It does not admit surrender to criminal offenders; it indicates 
physical repulsion, by destruction if need be, of the illegal attackers. The 
aggressors act at the risk of their lives. By their criminal aggression, they 
forfeit for themselves the protection of the law. That is what makes legal," 
justifiable, and just the reasonable physical means employed by the victim in 
his defense.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we vote for the reversal of the lower court's decision 
and for the complete acquittal of Restituto Bauden of the crime of homicide 
imputed to him, he having acted only in legitimate self-defense.</p>
<p>Se confirma la sentenda.</p>
