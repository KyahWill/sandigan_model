				<H3>MANILA HOTEL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER, VS. MANILA  HOTEL COMPANY AND THE COURT  OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The  principal  question  to  determine  in  this case  is whether or not the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over controversies or disputes affecting the employees  and laborers  of a government-controlled  corporation.  The industrial dispute involved herein arose in the 'Manila Hotel, a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company.<br><br>The  petitioner  is  a labor organization authorized and permitted to operate as  such under the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 213.  Sometime before the  year 1940 it presented a petition requesting the Manila Hotel  Company to adopt certain rates of minimum compensation for the employees and laborers of the company and a scale  of automatic increases  in  salaries and wages  in accordance with the  length of service.  On September  9,  1940, the Secretary to the President wrote to Mr. Francisco David, president  of the Manila  Hotel Employees  Association, advising him that after a careful  consideration of the comment of the managing director, concurred in by the board of directors of the company, "this office does not deem it advisable  to press upon the  company to  take  further action," it appearing "that because of unsettled world conditions, the hotel business has  fallen off to where the company now estimates a loss of not less than  P100,000 during 1940,  and that its financial condition precludes favorable consideration of further wage increases until world  conditions improve and a profit may be realized."<br><br>On  December  14, 1940,  the petitioner  filed an urgent petition in the Court of Industrial Relations, alleging:<br><br>That the  management of the  hotel dismissed Francisco Solivar on August 2, 1940, without justifiable cause and in order to discourage membership in the  Manila Hotel Employees  Association; that in order  to  curtail the union activities of  the  president of  the  association, Francisco David, the management ordered his transfer from his position  in  the  Manila Hotel to the Mayon Hotel, Legaspi, Albay, without any increase in salary;  that on refusal of the management to reconsider that transfer, the petitioner proposed to  stage  a manifestation on the morning of November 4, 1940, to Malacaiian in order to present the employees' grievances to those  called upon to decide  their pending petition, on the ground that their side had been misrepresented by the management; that  only  the employees off duty were to join that manifestation; that while the members of the association who were off duty  were awaiting instruction as  to whether or not the  proposed manifestation to Malacanan would be staged on the morning of November 4, 1940, Messrs. H. M. Cavender and F. Mendoza, managing director and assistant managing  director, respectively, took advantage of  the  ignorance of  those members who were on duty  by driving them away  from their  work with the help of  the special policemen of the hotel  in order to make it appear that the members of the association had staged a strike, and that those who were reporting  for duty were refused entrance into the  hotel in order to  make  it appear that they voluntarily refused to go  to their work; that after the manifestation had been postponed because the President could  not receive  them, those  employees who were living in the dormitory building of the hotel were refused entrance; that at about nine o'clock a.  m.  (on November 4, 1940),  after  all the employees  had  been driven from  the premises of the  hotel, the management informed them that they could no longer be admitted  to their work, more especially those appearing in the list annexed to  the petition,  numbering 157 in all; that the officers of the association requested a conference with  the management but the request was  denied; that thereupon the officers of the association sent a petition to His Excellency, the President of  the Philippines,  copy of which was sent to General  Manager Paez of the Manila Railroad Company, requesting that said employees be re-admitted and that their case be ordered investigated; that no answer had been  received by the association to their petition either from  the  Office  of the President of the Philippines or from the general  manager of the Manila Railroad Company, and that the management of the hotel continued to refuse to admit  the said employees.  The petition concluded by submitting  for tne consideration by the court of the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>"1. The readmission of all those employees whose names appear in Annex 'A'  hereof, who were  dismissed for discrimination and union activities, and the payment of their back wages from the time they were dismissed up to the time they were readmitted;<br><br>"2. The readmission of Francisco Solivar who was dismissed without justifiable cause and  the  payment  of his bark wages  from  the  time he was discharged up  to the time he is readmitted, and<br><br>"3. To prevent  the  transfer of Francisco David  from Manila Hotel to Mayon Hotel, Legaspi, Albay." To  that petition the Manila Hotel Company, thru the Corporate Counsel, filed an answer  containing a general denial and several special defenses, which may be briefly summarized  as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That the petition did not state  sufficient  cause of action against  the respondent company  upon which relief  could be granted; that the Manila Hotel Company is a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company, which is a government-owned-and-controlled corporation  and hence its employees are in fact,  if not in law, employees  of the  Government; that in  spite of  a previous warning,  the employees  listed in the annex  to the petition walked  out  and voluntarily left  their respective duties and refused to  work  on the morning of  November 4,  1940, leaving  the service  of the hotel  practically  crippled; that  said employees,  having walked out on November 4, 1940, lost their status as employees of the respondent hotel company in accordance with the policy enunciated by the  President  of  the Philippines in annex 2 of the answer; that Francisco Solivar was dismissed from the service on August 10, 1940, for inefficiency, insubordination, and disrespect to his immediate superior; that the order transferring Francisco David, a  waiter, to the Mayon Hotel  was issued solely  for the good of the service, but that he refused to report for  duty and that he forfeited  his  status as an employee of the company for disobedience, and  was considered dismissed from the service.<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Subsequent to the filing of said petition in the Court of Industrial Relations, with the  intervention  of said  court, a partial amicable settlement was arrived at by the parties, consisting in the readmission of all,  except seven, of the dismissed  employees; so that the only matters left for adjudication by the court were the back wages of those readmitted  and  the  readmission of the  seven  employees, including  Francisco David and  Francisco Solivar. As to Francisco David, it appears that on November 4, 1940, Secretary Vargas wrote to the  vice-president of the Manila  Hotel Employees Association as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"In reply to your letter dated October 30, 1940, appealing from a decision made  by the Board of Directors of the Manila  Hotel Company to effect the transfer  of Waiter Francisco David  to Mayon Hotel,  Legaspi,  please be informed  that  this Office is satisfied with the explanation given by the Management of said Hotel.  In this connection, your attention is invited  to the  fact that Executive Order  No. 276 providing  for a hearing  in the event of administrative charges, does not apply in  this  case."<br></blockquote><br>As to Francisco  Solivar,  Assistant Secretary  Benitez wrote to him  on December 12, 1941 (1940), as follows: <blockquote>"In connection  with  your request for the intervention of this  Office to secure your reinstatement in your former position as an employee of the Manila Hotel, I beg to quote hereunder 2nd Indorsement of the President of  that Company, dated November  18, 1940, which is self-explanatory:<br><br>"'Respectfully  returned to the Asst.  Secretary to the President, Office of the  President of the Philippines, Manila, with the information that on September 17,  1940, Mr. Cavender, Managing Director of the Manila  Hotel Company, wrote  to Mr.  Francisco  Solivar in answer to his  letter  of September 2nd to the effect that he had reviewed  Solivar's case and had again arrived at the conclusion, as expressed in his  former letter of August 10th,  i. e.,  that in the best interest of harmony and cooperation,within the  organization, Solivar should be dismissed  from  the service  of the Hotel  Company.   It may be  added  that  this action was taken  for various specific reasons:   Certain  of the  Hotel Guests objected to his caring for the  rooms they  occupied; he himself admitted that on one  occasion he prevented Mrs. Wahlgren, the Hotel Housekeeper, from entering a room temporarily vacated by guests and in general his attitude was disrespectful toward his superiors.  He  was  not dis- missed merely because he failed to report his absence on account of sickness, but because  of his previous record which  was not altogether satisfactory and on account  of his defiant attitude toward his superior.'<br></blockquote><blockquote>"Desirous as this Office is in  helping you in the matter, 1 regret to inform  you that, in  view  of the reasons  stated in the  aforequoted  indorsement  and the need of maintaining proper discipline among the employees of the  hostelry. it does not deem its intervention  in  your  case advisable."<br></blockquote><br>On January 27,  1941,  the attorney for the respondent Manila Hotel  Company filed a motion in the  Court  of Industrial Relations  to dismiss the urgent  petition herein before mentioned, in which motion he alleged among other things the following:<br><br><blockquote>"8.  It is respectfully  submitted that in  the  cases  of Francisco David and  Francisco  Solivar their  respective cases having been decided by the Office of the President  of the Philippines, this Court has no jurisdiction to revise the decision rendered thereon.  In  the matter of the  5 employees who  can not be readmitted on account  of  their unsatisfactory records, this Court  neither has jurisdiction following the  policy of  the administration enunciated  in Annexes '1' and '2' to the answer  of  the respondent Company dated December 26, 1940."<br></blockquote><br>That motion to dismiss was strenuously opposed  by the petitioner.  After considering  the  written and oral arguments adduced by both  parties, the court,  thru Associate Judge Jose  G.  Generoso, dismissed the case upon the  following considerations:<br><br><blockquote>"Si los  siete  obreros hasta ahora privados de su trabajo en el Manila Hotel, lo estan sin o con causa justificada, es punto que no necesita ser resuelto por este Tribunal porque. a juicio del mismo, no constituye 'cuestion, asunto, conflicto o disputa' que deba ser arbitrado, decidido o ajustado mediante la autoridad que al Tribunal connere la Ley No.  103 del Commonwealth, tal como habla de jurisdiccion  en  sus articulos 1 y 4.  No constituye, porque:<br><br>"Los meritos del caso  son tales, que bien  pueden quedar sometidos a la autoridad de decidirlos,  que reside  en lo organismos  que manejan el negocio del Manila Hotel.<br><br>"De acuerdo con la finalidad de la ley que creo este Tribunal, no puede  equipararse una  empresa privada  a otra cuyo  capital esta controlado  por el gobierno.  Esta, como patrono, tiene que ser considerada en un nivel distinto de aquella, en sus relaciones con los obreros.<br><br>"Manila Hotel Company esta funcionando con capital, en su mayoria  perteneciente a fondos  del Estado.  El  interes publico necesariamente  tiene  que estar vinculado  en  esa empresa,  porque  el exito de  sus negocios o  la  perdida en dlos, seria  perdida o exito del gobierno.<br><br>"Los funcionarios y empleados que tienen a su cargo la direccion  en el funcionamiento de la empresa, realizan su cometido como hombres  que representan en  ella el  interes del gobierno.<br><br>"Se presume que los responsables en la direccidn  del negocio o la empresa  cumplen  con la disposicion constitucional y las leyes vigentes que hacen obligatorio el velar por el interes y el bienestar de la clase proletaria de Filipinas.  Si ellos  no  cumplen  con  tales  preceptos,  la  ley senala el castigo  correspondiente.<br><br>"Este Tribunal no  debe arbitrar en los conflictos o  dis- putas entre obreros y patrono, cuando no  consta  que el mandato constitucional contenido en el articulo 6 del Titulo XIII de nuestra Constituci6n, asi lo requiere."<br></blockquote><br>A motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner was denied in a resolution promulgated  by the court in bane on June  30, 1941.  Hence the present petition for mandamus to compel the respondent Court of Industrial  Relations to hear and decide the case on the merit.<br><br>In contending that the Court of  Industrial Relations  has no  jurisdiction over the  controversies involved herein, counsel for the respondent  Manila Hotel Company  relies upon the letters written by  the President to the general manager of the Manila Railroad Company  and to the Secretary of Labor on April 18, 1938,  with reference to  the then impending strike by the employees of the Manila Rail- road  Company  under the leadership of an ex-employee named Felix Cortes.  In his letter to General Manager Paez the President directed him "to issue a circular to all the employees of the Manila Railroad Company to the effect that as <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> government employees  they should only belong to such labor  organizations or associations as they themselves may form for  purposes of mutual aid and benefit; that if they have any complaint to make either because of their  salaries  or conditions  under  which they work, they have to make  their complaint directly to you; that if they are not satisfied with your decision they may appeal to the Board of Directors, and that in case they are not satisfied with the decision of the Board of  Directors  they may  appeal to me;  *  *  *  that any strike on  the part of  the employees of the Manila Railroad Company  will  be taken by the government as a voluntary separation on their part from the service of the company,  and they  will  never  be admitted again in  the service of  the company." In  his letter to  Secretary of  Labor Torres, the President referred to the case brought before  the Department of  Labor  by Felix Cortes in behalf of the employees of the Manila Railroad Company. He called attention to the  fact that  the Manila Railroad Company is owned by the Government and is operated thru an agency of the  Government; that since the employees of  the  Manila Railroad Company are de facto  employees  of the Government and furthermore are in the employ of a public service enterprise, any attempt at a strike on their part would be met with effective measures by the Government to maintain discipline and to protect the public from being deprived of the essential service of transportation which the Manila Railroad Company  is rendering to the public.  He  requested the Secretary of Labor, first, to inform Felix Cortes that the Secretary  was directed by the President not to recognize  Cortes as lawfully  representing  the  employees of the Manila Railroad Comany and, second, "to inform the employees of the  Manila Railroad Company who would avow being represented by Felix Cortes  that if they have any complaint to make regarding the salaries  that they are receiving, or for  any other  cause,  they  should  present their complaint to  the management of  the Manila Railroad Company, and if in their opinion the management of the Manila Railroad Company  fails to do them  justice they  can appeal to me for redress."  (The  two letters of the President are set forth in full in the margin.)<br><br><blockquote>"My Dear Mr. Paez:<br><br>"In reference to the  alleged complaint presented by one Felix  Cortes on  behalf of some employees of the Manila Railroad Company, you are hereby directed to issue a circular  to all the employees of the Manila Railroad Company to the effect that as de facto government employees, they should only  belong  to such labor organizations or associations  as they themselves may  form for purposes of mutual aid and benefit;  that if they have any complaint to make either because of their salaries or conditions under which they work, they  have to make their complaint directly to you; that if they are not satisfied with your decision they may appeal to the Board of Directors, and that in case they are not satisfied with the decision of  the Board of Directors they may appeal to me; that I shall  not tolerate any strike on the part of the  employees of the  Manila Railroad Company for the reasons stated in the letter which I am writing on this date to the Secretary of Labor, copy of which I am sending to you; that any strike on the part of the employees of the Manila Railroad Company will be taken by the government as voluntary separation  on their part from the service of the  company, and  they will never be admitted again in the service of the company; that the government is ready now and will be ready at any time to replace any employee or group of employees  of the  Manila Railroad Company just as it is ready to replace all the  employees of the Manila Railroad Company if they should all decide to strike; that in case of a strike of great proportions among the Ma- nila Railroad employees, I will use  the Army  to run the Manila Railroad Company and to protect the Company from any violence on the part of the strikers.  It is my desire that the employees of the Manila Railroad be duly informed of my stand on this matter in order that they may not allege lack of knowledge of the consequences of their action if they should violate any of the rules herein laid down.<br><br>"The management of the  Manila Railroad Company is informed of the policies of my administration regarding the treatment of labor, and your company is  expected to give an outstanding example of how a corporation should deal with its employees and laborers.  In case,  by this time, you have not been  able to put into practice the  policies of the government in this respect, please take immediate steps to carry them out.  And if any complaint that is presented to you by the employees of the Manila Railroad Company is well founded, it is my hope and expectation that you will grant them the proper remedy.<br><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 400px;">"Very sincerely,<br></div><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 440px;"><br>"(Sgd.)   Manuel L. Quezon <br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">President of the Philippines</span>"<br></div><br>"MY DEAR SECRETARY TORRES:<br><br>"My attention  has been called to the case brought before your department by one Felix Cortes on behalf of the employees of  the Manila Railroad Company,  and of which your department has taken cognizance. I am informed by the manager of the Manila Railroad Company that Felix Cortes is a former employee of that company who had been twice separated from its service; that after his separation from the service, following: which he had been out of work for some time, the manager of the company yielded to his request to be taken back, but had subsequently to expel him for cause  in the month of November last year.<br><br>"As you know,  the Manila  Railroad Company  is owned by the Government and is operated through an agency of the Government.  The  employees  of  the Manila  Railroad Company therefore are, in fact, if not in law, employees of the government, so much so that the Board of Directors of the Manila Railroad Company generally follows the policies of the Legislature in reference to salaries of the employees of said company.  In fact the minimum wage for government laborers which I  have fixed by executive order has been complied with by the management of the Manila Rail- road Company.<br><br>"As the employees of the Manila Railroad Company are de facto employees of the government, and furthermore, as they are in the employ of a public service  enterprise, any attempt at a strike on their part will be met with effective measures by the government to  maintain discipline, and to protect the public from being deprived of the essential service  of transportation which the Manila Railroad Company is rendering to the public.  Moreover, the people of the Philippines have  an investment in the Manila  Railroad Company worth nearly one hundred million pesos, and it is equally my duty to protect it from undue or preventable loss.<br><br>"In view of the foregoing considerations, I request you to inform Felix Cortes; first, that you are directed by me not to recognize Cortes as lawfully representing the employees of the Manila Railroad Company; second, to inform the employees of the Manila Railroad Company who would avow being represented by Felix Cortes, that if they have any complaint  to make regarding the salaries that they are receiving, or for any other cause, they should present their complaint  to the management  of the Manila Railroad Company, and if in their opinion the management of the Manila Railroad Company fails to do them justice they can appeal to me for redress.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 280px;">"Very sincerely,<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 400px;">"(Sgd.)  Manuel L. Quezon <br><span style="font-style: italic;">"President of the Philippines</span>"<br></div></blockquote><br>Counsel's theory as amplified by him during the oral argument before this court is briefly as follows: The two letters of the President above mentioned laid down the policy of the Administration with regard to labor disputes arising in government-owned corporations.   Under that policy the ultimate decision in such disputes  rests in the President. The Court of Industrial  Relations is  an  administrative branch or agency of the Government and, as such, it cannot review and reverse a decision of the President.<br><br>The Court of  Industrial Relations did not sustain coun- sel's contention  that it had  no jurisdiction to decide the case.   It held that the two letters of the President applied only to the Manila  Railroad Company  and not to other government-controlled corporations whose activities are not immediately affected with public interest.  However, the court adopted the view that whether the seven employees in question were dismissed with or  without cause need not be resolved by said court; that  the merits of the case were such that it could well be submitted to the management of the Manila Hotel for decision.  It ruled that a private enterprise cannot be treated on the same  level as one whose capital is controlled by the Government; that a government-controlled enterprise has  to  be treated  in a level distinct from  a private  enterprise.  And on  the assumption that those responsible for the  management of  a government- owned enterprise comply with the constitutional and statutory provisions which impose the obligation of looking after the interest and  welfare of the  laboring class, the court refused to take cognizance of the case. We think the respondent court  was right in holding that it had jurisdiction, but wrong in refusing to exercise that jurisdiction in the case at bar.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First </span>Counsel for the Manila Hotel  Company would attribute to the President's letters the force and effect of a statute governing all controversies and industrial  disputes arising in government-owned corporations and excluding the latter from the operation of Commonwealth Act No. 103, as  amended by Commonwealth  Acts  Nos. 254 and 559, creating the Court  of Industrial Relations.  Those letters were not intended to, nor could they, have such implication. They were  only a  measure taken by  the Government as owner of the Manila Railroad Company to prevent an impending strike instigated by an interloper.   Their main purpose, and the salutary effect  they produced, was to dis- authorize a meddling, disgruntled ex-employee of the Manila Railroad Company,  and to prevent him from  agitating and stirring up trouble  and discontent within the organization. That measure will  no doubt apply to similar future situations arising in the Manila Railroad Company.  As a matter of  fact, section  19 of Commonwealth Act No. 103 has since been amended by section 5  of Commonwealth Act No. 559 by exempting  employers engaged  in the  operation of public  services from the prohibition against  engaging the services of strikebreakers within  fifteen days after the declaration of the strike.  Altho  the Manila Hotel Company is a subsidiary of the Manila Railroad Company because the latter owns practically all the shares of stock of the former, it is doubtful that the President's letters in question were intended to apply also to the employees  of the Manila Hotel, the latter not being  a public service corporation  like the Manila Railroad Company.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, Commonwealth Act No. 103  was enacted, as its title indicates, "to afford protection of labor by creating a Court  of Industrial Relations empowered to  fix minimum wages  for laborers and maximum  rentals to be  paid  by tenants, and to enforce compulsory arbitration between employers or landlords, and employees or tenants, respectively; and by prescribing penalties for the violation of its orders." Section 1 of said Act, as amended, invests the Court of Industrial Relations with jurisdiction  over the entire Philippines to consider, investigate, decide, and settle all questions, matters, controversies, or disputes arising between, and/or affecting, employers and employees or laborers and regulate the relations between them, subject to the provisions of said Act.  Section 4 provides that the court shall take cognizance for purposes of prevention, arbitration, decision, and settle- ment, of any industrial dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout, arising from differences as regards wages or compensation, dismissals, layoffs, or suspensions of employees or laborers, provided that the number of employees or laborers involved exceeds thirty and such industrial dispute is submitted to the court  by the Secretary of Labor or by  any or by both parties to  the controversy. Section 19 of the same Act, as amended, makes it an implied condition, among others,  of every contract of employment,  whether verbal or written, that when any dispute between the employer and the  employees has  been  submitted to the Court of Industrial Relations for settlement or arbitration, and pending award  or decision by the court of such dispute, the employer shall refrain from accepting other employees unless with the express authority of the court, and shall permit the continuation in the service of his employees under the last terms and conditions existing before the  dispute arose. A violation by the employer of such an order or the implied contractual condition shall constitute contempt of the Court of Industrial Relations and shall be punished by the court itself in the same manner and with the same penalties as in the case of a contempt of a Court of First Instance.  In the case of corporations, the person or persons responsible shall be the manager or the person who has  charge of the management of the  business  of the corporation  and the directors thereof who  have ordered and/or authorized the act of  contempt.  It is further provided that no employer shall suspend, lay off,  or dismiss any employee or laborer without just cause, from the  time a labor association or organization or group  of laborers has presented to an employer a petition or complaint regarding any matter likely to cause a strike or lockout and a copy thereof has been furnished  the Department of Labor, or while an industrial dispute is pending before the court.  And if it is proved that during the said period an employee or laborer has been suspended or dismissed without just cause, the court may direct his reinstatement and the payment of his salary or back wage during th$ time of his suspension or dismissal, or of any sum which he should have received had he not been suspended or dismissed, without prejudice to any criminal liability of the employer as prescribed by section 24 of the Act.  Section 24 provides that any violation of the provisions of said Act or of any order, award, or decision of the Court of Industrial Relations shall be punished with a fine not exceeding Pl,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one month, or  both, in the discretion of the court.<br><br>The case of the employees of the Manila Hotel Company comes within the purview of said Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended.  Differences arose between said employees and the hotel management as regards wages and suspensions of employees.  More than 157 of said employees were dismissed or suspended during the pendency of their petition before  the management.  The  case was subsequently submitted by the parties to the Court of Industrial Relations.  It was obligatory upon the court to take cognizance of and decide that case.  (Section 4.)  It was incumbent upon the court (a) to determine whether the suspension of the employees who were later readmitted was with or with- out just cause and whether or not said employees were  entitled to back wages, and (b) to determine whether the dismissal of the seven employees, including Francisco Solivar and Francisco David, was with or without just cause and whether or  not they are entitled to reinstatement and  the payment of  back wages.  (Section 19.)<br><br>There is nothing in  the law that could be construed to exclude the  employees  and laborers  of  government-owned corporations from the  benefit and protection  thereof or to exempt  such corporations from the operation  of that law. On the other hand, it is well settled that when the government enters into commercial business, it abandons its sovereign capacity and is to be treated like any other corporation. (Bank of the United States v. Planters' Bank, 9 Wheat. 904, 6 L. ed. 244.)  By  engaging  in a particular business thru the instrumentality of a corporation, the government divests itself <span style="font-style: italic;">pro hoc vice</span> of its sovereign character, so as to render the corporation subject to the rules of law governing private corporations.   (Arkansas State Highway  Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. Dodge, 55 S. W. [2d] 71, 72.)   When the state acts in its proprietary capacity, it is amenable to  all the rules of law which bind private individuals.  (South Carolina <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 55 L. ed. 261, 4 Ann. Cas. 737; Vicksburg <span style="font-style: italic;">v. </span>Vicksburg Water Works Co., 206 U. S. 496, 51 L. ed. 1155; Los Angeles<span style="font-style: italic;"> v.</span>  Gas &amp; Electric Corporation,  251, U. S. 32, 64  L. ed. 121; Maumee Valley Electric Co. v. Schlesinger 33 Fed.  [2d] 318.)  "There is not one law for the sovereign and another for the subject, but  when  the sovereign engages in business and  the conduct of business enterprises, and contracts with individuals, whenever  the contract in any form conies before the courts, the rights and obligation of the contracting parties must be adjusted upon the same principles as if both contracting parties were private  persons.  Both stand upon equality before the law, and the sovereign is merged in the dealer,  contractor and suitor."  (People<span style="font-style: italic;"> v</span>.  Stephens, 71 N. Y.  549.) Furthermore, the  ruling of the Court of Industrial Relations would permit  the Board of  Directors of the Manila Hotel Company to assume the double role of litigant and judge—which is intolerable.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>. It was also contended by counsel during the oral argument that the Court of Industrial  Relations had lost jurisdiction over the case by reason of  the  fact that after the partial  amicable settlement only seven employees  remained  involved herein.   Such argument is  also untenable. Once the Court of Industrial Relations acquires jurisdiction over a case under the law of its  creation,  it retains that jurisdiction until the case is completely decided.   The dispute originally involved more than thirty  employees of the Manila Hotel Company.  The fact that all but seven of said employees have since the filing of the case been readmitted, cannot divest the court of jurisdiction to decide not only the question as to the reinstatement of said seven employees but also that as to the payment of the back wages of those who have been readmitted.   Similar cases involving private companies have been decided by that court, and there is no reason at all to treat the instant case differently.<br><br>Let the writ of mandate issue commanding the Court of Industrial Relations forthwith  to reinstate and to try  and decide on the merit case No. 476 of the said court, entitled "Manila Hotel Employees Association, petitioner, vs. Manila Hotel Company, respondent."  The respondent Manila  Ho- tel  Company shall pay the  costs  of this proceeding.   So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz, Laurel, Moran,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ.</span>, concur. </div>
