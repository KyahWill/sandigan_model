				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On October  5, 1954,  Ang Koo Liong filed  in the  Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction claiming that the Board of  Commissioners  of  the  Bureau  of  Immigration  acted  with grave  abuse of discretion and contrary to law  in ordering him to leave the Philippines within a specified period of time, or else be subject to deportation  proceedings. Two days  later, on October 7, 1954, the trial court issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the respondent from causing  the  arrest and deportation of  petitioner. Instead  of going  to trial, the  parties  entered into  the following stimulation of facts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. That on July 18, 1949, acting on  the petition filed by the Chinese  Chamber of  Commerce  Elementary   School,  otherwise known  as  the Chun Hua  School in Daet,  Camarines Norte,  in behalf  of  the petitioner who,  as pre-arranged, was to teach  in said  school,  and pursuant to the provisions  of section 20 (<em>a</em>)  of the Philippine Immigration Act  of 1940, the respondent authorized the issuance to the petitioner of a visa  as a  <em>non-quota immigrant</em> under section 13 (<em>a</em>) of the same Act,  subject' to  the following conditions  among others contained in its Order:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"(1)  He  shall remain in  the  Philippines only  during the period of his  employment,  which period  shall,  however, not be  beyond two (2)  years  after arrival;</p>
    <p>(2)  He shall  notify  this  office of  any  change  of address within twenty-four  (24)  hours before suÂ«h  change  of address; and</p>
    <p>(3)  Failure  to comply with conditions (1) and (2)  will subject him  to deportation  in accordance  with  law." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. That  the Philippine Consulate at  Hongkong  was duly informed  of  said  Order  in a radiogram  sent  to it on  September 17,  1949 by the  Department of Foreign  Affairs;</p>
  <p>3. That  the petitioner Ang Koo Liong arrived  in  the  Philippines on  September 6,  1950,  from  Hongkong and Immediately thereafter  he was investigated  by a  Board  of Special Inquiry;</p>
  <p>4. That on September 12,  1950, said  Board  of  Special Inquiry promulgated  its  decision admitting the  petitioner into  the  Philippines a nonquota immigrant  under section 9(<em>g</em>) of the Philippine Immigration  Act of 1940, as amended;</p>
  <p>5. That on June 16,  1952, petitioner  thru  counsel, sought permission to leave his place of employment, the Daet Chung Hua School,  and to transfer to the  Dumaguete-Chinese School,  which request  was  granted by the Commissioner  of Immigration.   Copy of  said  letter was attached as  Annex  "B"  of the respondent's Answer;</p>
  <p>6. That on  June 18,  1954, petitioner through counsel filed with the respondent  Board  of Commissioners  a  petition  for an, extension  of  stay in  this country for another two years;</p>
  <p>7. That said petition  was  denied  by  the respondent Board of Commissioners in its Order  dated July  31, 1954, and therein the respondent served  notice  to  the petitioner that he leave voluntarily the  country  within fifteen  (15)  days  from receipt  of the Order, otherwise Ms removal will be Effected in accordance with law.  A  copy of said Order was attached  to the  Answer  of the respondent as Annex "C";</p>
  <p>8. That a  copy of said Order  of the  respondent was furnished the petitioner on  August  4, 1954,  and a  follow-up  letter was sent to the petitioner on August 31,  1954; </p>
  <p>9. That  on September  27,  1954, the petitioner  thru  counsel requested the Commissioner of  Immigration for the revocation of said Order of the respondent Board of  Commissioners  and the correction of the status of the petitioner;</p>
  <p>10. That on  September  30, 1954,  the  First  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Immigration  informed petitioner of the denial of his petition; and</p>
  <p>11. That the instant proceedings  for certiorari  with preliminary injunction  was filed  with  this Court  on October 5, 1954."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and submitted the  case  for  decision.   The  trial  court held that petitioner having been admitted into this country as a "<em>non-quota immigrant</em>", he is entitled to  permanent residence  here; and  rendered  judgment   setting  aside respondent's  order for petitioner to leave the country and making permanent its writ of preliminary injunction of October  7,  1954.  From this decision, the  respondent Board of Commissioners  of  the Bureau of Immigration appealed  to this Court.</p>
<p>We  find  the  appeal  meritorious.  The characterization of petitioner as a "<em>non-quota  immigrant</em>"  by  the  Board of Inquiry  does not necessarily imply  that he was  admitted for permanent residence, for the  authority granted to our Hongkong Consulate for issuance of his visa specified that he was to be admitted under section 13 (<em>a</em>)  of  the 1940  Immigration  Act, and  stipulated  expressly that he was not  to remain  in the Philippines beyond two  (2) years  after arrival (Stipulation of Facts,  paragraph  1). Having taken advantage of  a visa issued  to  him under such authorization, petitioner  is deemed to have agreed and  accepted its conditions,  and is therefore  in estoppel to claim that he is entitled to permanent stay.</p>
<p>A case on all fours  with the one before us is that of Chang  Yung Fa <em>vs.</em> Gianzon and De la Cruz, (97  Phil., 914),  decided  on  November 25,  1955, where we  ruled that the power granted to  the  Commissioner of Immigration under  section  20  of  the 1940   Immigration  Act (Commonwealth Act No. 613) was broad enough to validly authorize him  to  impose  a limitation to the duration of the  stay  of  an immigrant admitted on pre-arranged employment, like the  petitioner now before  us.  That ruling is  therefore conclusive on the present case.</p>
<p>The court below  seems to have confused petitioner's status with that of "<em>non-quota immigrant</em>"under Article VI  of the 1946 Treaty  between the Philippines and  the United  States,  but that  class  is  lknited to  returning American citizens only.  Besides, it should have been  apparent  that  if petitioner's admission was based on  his pre-arranged employment contract to teach at the Chung Hua  School  of  Daet, Camarines Norte,  his  stay  must necessarily  be temporary and   not  permanent, since  a hiring for life is void under our  law (Civil Code of 1889, Article  1583).</p>
<p>The mere  fact  that the respondent  Commissioners  of Immigration did not  choose. to  enforce the limitation  on petitioner's  stay  immediately  upon the expiration of  the period given, did not confer upon petitioner a right to stay longer  in  these  Islands.  The  petitioner  so understood his  situation to be, as shown by the  circumstance that in 1954,  he  applied to  the  Immigration  officers for   an extension  of his stay  (Stipulation  of  Facts,  paragraph 6),  but his petition was denied.</p>
<p>The judgment  appealed  from is reversed, the proceedings dismissed,  and the  writ of preliminary injunction annulled and set aside.   Costs against the petitioner.   So ordered.</p>
