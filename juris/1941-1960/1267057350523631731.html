Japanese Forces in the Philippines with the end in view of collaborating 
unreservedly and unstintedly with the said enemy, and to fight side by side with 
the same against the Armed Forces of the United States of America and the 
guerrilla forces then operating in the Philippines, and as such member thereof, 
the said accused did further voluntarily join and evacuate with the said enemy 
in his retreat to the mountains of Luzon, and did stay and remain with the same 
until his apprehension and capture by the American and guerrilla 
forces."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The trial court found appellant guilty on all counts except on 
counts two and eight, and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay 
a fine of P10,000 and the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence shows that appellant took part in the arrest of 
Roman Malapitan at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon of August 2, 1943, in Santa 
Rosa, Laguna, the fact having been testified to by Maxima Dedicatorio, widow of 
Malapitan, and Concha Pascual, a neighbor. It has been proved that the arrest 
was undertaken by the accused and several persons, including a Japanese civilian 
named Mikawa.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence also shows that appellant participated in the 
arrest of Isidoro de los Angeles on the afternoon of November 3, 1944, in the 
rice mill of Andres Villanueva in barrio Balibago, Santa Rosa. Isidoro was 
brought, as a guerrilla suspect, to the house of Mikawa, where lie was 
investigated and beaten. Afterwards, he was taken to the Japanese garrison by 
the accused and the Japanese. These facts were testified to by Gorgonio Cantos, 
Pantaleon Lara and Amanda Lasaga.</p>
<p align="justify">It was also proved that Major Leopoldo F. Santos, an ex-USAFFE 
officer, another guerrilla suspect, was arrested by a raiding party composed of 
Japanese and Filipinos, one of whom was appellant, who chose not to deny this 
charge in his testimony.</p>
<p align="justify">Regarding the arrest of Roque Lazaga, because of the 
contradictions between the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution 
Julia Alinsod and Teofila Lazaga, wife and daughter, respectively, of Roque 
Lazaga, appellant is entitled to the benefits of the doubt and, therefore, he 
cannot be found guilty on count five of the information.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant cannot also be found guilty on count six because only 
one witness, Sancha Sayao, testified to the arrest of Antonio and Jurado 
Alumno.</p>
<p align="justify">Under count seven, upon the testimonies of Rosa Alinsod and 
Federico Aguilar, wife and son, respectively, of Lucio Aguilar, it appears that 
the accused, armed with revolver and accompanied by several persons three of 
whom were in Japanese uniforms, arrested Lueio Aguilar as a guerrilla suspect, 
who was taken away in a truck.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts proved, we are convinced beyond doubt that 
appellant, a Filipino citizen, is guilty of treason and the trial court 
sentenced him correctly under article 114 of the Revised Penal Code to 
<i>reclusion perpetua</i> and a fine of P10,000 and to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed judgment is affirmed with costs against 
appellant.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
