				G.R. No. L-2709, June 30, 1950</h4>
				<H3>UY CHIN HUA, PETITIONER VS. RAFAEL DINGLASAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question raised in this case is, which court has original jurisdiction to 
try an offense penalized with <em>destierro</em> or banishment—the municipal 
court or the court of first instance?
<p>The petitioner was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with 
attempted bribery by offering the sum of P6 to patrolmen A. Caudal and L. de los 
Santos in consideration of their refraining from arresting him for a violation 
of the Price Tag Law (Republic Act No. 71). which offer the said police officers 
rejected, and placed the offeror under arrest.</p>
<p>Upon denial of his motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction, the petitioner 
filed the present petition for certiorari (which we interpret to mean 
prohibition), praying that the respondent judge be ordered to refrain from 
further proceeding on the ground that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance 
of the case.</p>
<p>The consummated crime of bribery or corruption of public officials is 
penalized by article 212, in relation to the third paragraph of article 210 of 
the Revised Penal Code, with <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and maximum 
periods. The penalty for the attempted crime is two degrees lower, which is 
<em>destierro</em> in its minimum and medium periods. That means that the 
culprit shall be banished from his present residence (not imprisoned) for a 
period of not less than 6 months and 1 day and not more than 4 years and 2 
months.</p>
<p>We are unanimous in the conclusion that the court of first instance has no 
jurisdiction over the offense charged and that therefore the writ of prohibition 
lies. But we are not unanimous as the reasons. A minority hold that if the scale 
provided by article 71 of the Revised Penal Code is to be followed, the penalty 
of <i>destierro</i> would have to be imposed which, they claim, would produce an 
absurdity because the duration of said penalty is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 
years—"co-extensive with <em>prision correccional,</em> a penalty higher than <i>
arresto mayor</i> in the scale provided by article 71." Therefore, the minority hold 
that the penalty of <em>destierro</em> should be applied only when it is 
specifically imposed and should be disregard in the scale provided in article 
71. In other words, the minority think that the penalty imposable for the 
offense charged is <em>arresto menor</em>.</p>
<p>A majority of the court, including the writer of this opinion, find no 
justification for disregarding the scale of penalties provided in article 71 and 
for not applying the penalty of <em>destierro</em> to the offense charged, in 
accordance with article 51 in relation to the scale of penalties provided in 
said article 71 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>To disregard the scale of penalties provided in article 71 and to apply 
<em>destierro</em> only to crimes specifically punished with that penalty, such 
as those mentioned in articles 247 and 334, would be to amend or change the law, 
and the court is not empowered to do so. Our sworn duty is to apply the law and 
not to tamper with it.</p>
<p><em>Destierro</em> is not higher penalty than <em>arresto mayor. Arresto 
mayor</em> means imprisonment or complete deprivation of liberty, whereas 
<em>destierro</em> means banishment or only a prohibition from residing within 
the radius of 25 kilometers from the actual residence of the accused for a 
specified length of time. The respective severities of <em>arresto mayor</em> 
and <em>destierro</em> must not be judged by the duration of each of these 
penalties, but by the degree of deprivation of liberty involved. Penologists 
have always considered d<em>estierro</em> lighter than <em>arresto mayor.</em> 
Such criterion is reflected both in the old Spanish Penal Code and in our 
Revised Penal Code. In the graduated scale of article 71 the lawmaker has placed 
<em>destierro</em> below <em>arresto mayor</em>. There is, therefore, no basis 
in fact or in law for holding that <em>destierro</em> is a higher penalty that 
<em>arresto mayor</em> and that an offense penalized with <em>destierro</em> 
falls under the jurisdiction of the court of first instance.</p>
<p>The judiciary Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296) does not expressly confer 
original jurisdiction on the court of first instance over offenses penalized 
with <em>destierro</em>. Section 44 of said Act provides that Courts of First 
Instance shall have original jurisdiction "(<em>f</em>) in all criminal cases in 
which the penalty provided by law is <em>imprisonment</em> for more than six 
months, or a fine of more than two hundred pesos." And.section 87 of the same 
Act provides that justices of the peace and judges of municipal courts of 
chartered cities shall have original jurisdiction over "(<em>b</em>) all 
offenses in which the penalty provided by law is <em>imprisonment</em> for not 
more than six months 3 or a fine of not more than two hundred pesos, or both 
such fine and imprisonment ."</p>
<p>Thus there exists a gap in the law as to which court shall have original 
jurisdiction over offenses penalized with <i>destierro</i> or banishment. Until the 
lawmaking body should fill that gap by expressly providing otherwise, the Court 
must do so by reasonable interpretation of the existing law. The reasonable and 
logical interpretation, in our opinion, is this: Since the legislature has 
placed offenses penalized with <em>arresto mayor</em> under the jurisdiction of 
justice of the peace and municipal courts, and since by article 71 of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended by section 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 217, it has 
placed <em>destierro</em> below <em>arresto mayor</em> as a lower penalty than 
the latter, in the absence of any express provision of law to the contrary it is 
logical and reasonable to infer from said provisions that its intention was to 
place offenses penalized with <em>destierro</em> also under the jurisdiction of 
justice of the peace and municipal courts and not under that of Courts of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>The writ of prohibition will be issued, without any finding as to costs.</p>

<p>PARAS, <i>J.</i>, concurring: </p>
<p>The herein petitioner was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila 
with having committed on August 10, 1948, the attempted offense of corruption of 
public officials in that he offered to patrolmen A. Cudal and L. de los Santos 
the sum of six pesos in order that the latter might refrain from arresting the 
petitioner for a violation of the Price Tag Law (Republic Act No. 71), but that 
said police officers refused to be thus corrupted. The petitioner filed a motion 
to quash on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, it being contended that, as the 
penalty for the consummated offense of corruption of public officials provided 
by article 212, in relation to the third, paragraph of article 210, of the 
Revised Penal Code, is <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and maximum periods 
and a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not more than three times 
such value, the penalty for the attempted offense charged in the information is 
only <em>arresto menor</em> in its minimum and medium periods, and a fine of not 
more than eighteen pesos. This motion to quash having been denied, the 
petitioner instituted the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>In the scale of penalties provided in article 71 of the Revised Penal Code, 
as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 217, the two penalties successively lower 
than <em>arresto mayor</em> are <em>destierro</em> and <em>arresto menor</em>. 
Under article 25, <em>destierro</em> is classified as a correctional penalty 
and, under article 27, its duration is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years. Upon 
the other hand, the duration of <em>arresto mayor</em>, classified also as a 
correctional penalty (article 25), is from 1 month and 1 day to 6 months 
(article 27). There can be no question that, pursuant to the Judiciary Act of 
1948 (Republic Act No. 296), the consummated offense of corruption of public 
officials, penalized with <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and maximum 
periods, or from 2 months and 1 day to 6 months, comes within the original 
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace or municipal court. Under article 51, 
the penalty for an attempt to commit the offense of corruption of public 
officials is two degrees lower than <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and 
maximum periods. Said penalty—if the scale in article 71 of the Revised Penal 
Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 217, is to be followed to the letter—is 
<em>destierro</em> in its minimum and medium periods, or from 6 months and 1 day 
to 4 years and 2 months, with the result that an attempt would fall, pursuant 
also to the Judiciary Act of 1948, under the original jurisdiction of the court 
of first instance. This is the theory of counsel for respondent judge.</p>
<p>According to this theory, an attempted offense is penalized with a greater 
penalty than the consummated offense, and is to be tried by a higher court than 
that which will try the consummated offense. This absurd result could not have 
been contemplated by the lawmakers in amending article 71 of the Revised Penal 
Code and should accordingly be avoided.</p>
<p>An attempt to commit a felony is certainly lower than the consummated felony, 
and this is the reason why article 51 of the Revised Penal Code specifically 
provides that a penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the 
consummated felony shall be imposed upon the principals in an attempt to commit 
said felony. If this fundamental provision is, as it should be, given effect, 
the penalty for the attempted offense of corruption of public officials, which 
is a penalty lower by two degrees than <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and 
maximum periods (from 2 months and 1 day to 6 months), is <em>arresto menor</em> 
in its minimum and medium periods (from 1 day to 20 days). The penalty for said 
attempted offense should not be taken from <em>destierro</em>, because the 
duration of this penalty is from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years, and is therefore 
equal to and co-extensive in duration with <em>prision correccional</em>, a 
penalty higher than <em>arresto mayor</em> in the scale provided by article 71 
of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 217. Although 
<em>destierro</em> may not be an "imprisonment", it is nonetheless a 
"deprivation of liberty" (People <em>vs</em>. Abilong, G. R. No. L-1960, 
November 26, 1948<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that before article 71 was amended by Commonwealth Act No. 
217, the scale of penalties from which a lower or higher penalty was taken, was 
that provided by article 70, under which the penalty lower than <em>arresto 
mayor</em> was <em>arresto menor</em>. <em>Destierro</em> was not included. The 
obvious reason is that <em>destierro</em> is an exceptional penalty, prescribed 
as a principal penalty only in two cases (article 247 and 334) and as an 
additional penalty only in one case (article 284). The exceptional character of 
<em>destierro</em> is recognized in the fact that although it is classified as a 
correctional penalty having a duration of from 6 months and 1 day to 6 years, in 
parity with <em>prision correccional</em>, it is placed in the scale fixed in 
article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 217, 
below <em>arresto menor</em>, as regards severity and for purposes of successive 
service of sentences; and in the scale provided in article 71, as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 217, it is placed below <em>arresto mayor.</em> But, as 
heretofore stated, if the scale in article 71 is followed literally, we shall 
have the unthinkable and absurd situation that the consummated offense of 
corruption of public officials is penalized with <em>arresto mayor</em> in its 
medium and maximum periods (from 2 months and 1 day to 6 months) originally 
triable in the justice of the peace or municipal court, whereas the lower 
offense of attempted corruption of public officials is penalized with 
<em>destierro</em> in its minimum and medium periods (from 6 months and 1 day to 
4 years and 2 months) and originally triable in the court of first instance. To 
avoid this absurdity, I am constrained to hold that the penalty of 
<em>destierro</em> is to be considered only when it is specifically imposed and 
is to be disregarded in the scale provided in article 71.</p>
<p>It is true that in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Ng Pek (G. R. No. L-1895, 
decided on October 2, 1948<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>), we held 
that the penalty lower by two degrees than <em>arresto mayor </em>in its medium 
and maximum periods is <em>destierro</em> in its minimum and medium and maximum 
periods; but in said case the point decided in the case at bar was not actually 
raised and passed upon. Upon the other hand, in the case of Rivera vs. Geronimo 
(43 Off. Gaz., 841<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>), decided on July 22, 
1946, we ruled that the penalty lower by two degrees than <em>prision 
correccional</em> in its minimum and medium periods is <em>arresto menor</em> in 
its maximum period to <em>arresto mayor</em> in its minimum period, the penalty 
of <em>destierro</em> having been disregarded.</p>Wherefore, I concur in the 
result of the majority decision. <br><br><br>
