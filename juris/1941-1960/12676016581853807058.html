				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
dismissing plaintiffs' complaint, upon motion of the defendant, on the ground 
that the facts therein alleged did not constitute a cause of action.
<p>The material allegations of the complaint may be briefly stated as follows: 
The plaintiff Lu Chu Sing is the father of his coplaintiff, Lu Tian Chiong. In 
April 1945 Lu Tian Chiong entered the service of the defendant as a cook. On May 
29, 1945, the defendant's home at 1160-F Magdalena street, Trozo, Manila, was 
robbed. The defendant imputed to the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong complicity in that 
robbery "and for that reason Lu Tian Chiong was charged with said offense and 
the corresponding complaint was filed in the City Fiscals Office by the 
defendant against said plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong, for which the latter was 
arrested and detained in the police station of Meisic for five days and was only 
released after posting a cash bond in the amount of P2,000. After the city 
fiscal had conducted the corresponding investigation the criminal charge was 
dropped for lack of evidence. The imputation that the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong 
had some connection with the robbery above mentioned "affected the integrity and 
honesty of the plaintiff and caused damages to him, for whenever he applies for 
any position in any Chinese establishment here in Manila, he is always rejected, 
inasmuch as he is considered as undesirable element or a person of bad character 
because of the complaint above referred to, notwithstanding the fact that the 
Chinese community in the Philippines knows that Lu Tian Chiongs father, the 
other plaintiff, Lu Chu Sing, was, before the war, a businessman of good 
reputation," owning several 'industrial and mercantile establishments in Manila. 
The defendant, knowing that the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong had nothing to do with 
the robbery above mentioned, maliciously filed the criminal charge against the 
said plaintiff in the City Fiscals Office, for the sole purpose of soiling the 
good names of the plaintiffs, and particularly ruining and destroying completely 
the good reputation and credit of the plaintiff Lu Chu Sing as a businessman 
and, consequently, the latter has suffered damages in the amount of not less 
than P20,000; and besides, the plaintiffs were forced to hire the services of an 
attorney who defended the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong in the City Fiscal Office, 
for which services the plaintiffs had paid the sum of P1,000." The prayer was 
that the court declare the criminal charge filed by the defendant in the City 
Fiscalfs Office against the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong to be malicious, "and 
consequently it ruined and destroyed the good reputation and credit of the 
plaintiff Lu Chu Slug, for which he suffered damages," and that the defendant be 
adjudged "to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P21,000 as such damages, or any 
amount that this Honorable Court may determine, and to pay the costs of this 
suit."</p>
<p>Defendant's contention, which the lower court declared to be well founded, is 
that plaintiffs' action is predicated upon an allegation of defamation or libel, 
but that since the repeal of Act No. 277 by article 367 of the Revised Penal 
Code no more civil aotion for defamation or libel lies; and that even supposing 
for a moment that civil responsibility still exists in cases of defamation and 
libel, this action could not prosper because the complaint filed by the 
defendant against the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong in the City Fiscal's Office 
partook of the nature of a privileged communication.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs on the other hand maintain that their action is not based on 
libel or defamation but on malicious prosecution.</p>
<p>The questions to determine are (1) the nature of the obligation which the 
plaintiffs seek to enforce against the defendant and (2) whether the plaintiffs 
may recover upon such obligation under the allegations of the complaint.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Obligations are created by law, by contract, by quasi-contract, and by 
unlawful acts or omissions or by those in which any kind of fault or negligence 
occurs. (Article 1089, Civil Code.) The obligation which the plaintiffs herein 
seek to enforce is apparently one created by or arising from an unlawful act—an 
obligation <em>ex delicto</em>.</p>
<p>Civil obligations arising from crimes are governed by the provisions of the 
Penal Code. (Article 1092, Civil Code.) Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code 
provides that every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly 
liable. Civil and criminal actions arising from the same offense may be 
instituted separately. (Section 1 [<em>b</em>], Rule 107.) The civil action for 
damages arising from a felony may be brought before the criminal action for said 
felony, but in case the latter is instituted the former shall be stayed, pending 
final judgment in the criminal action. (Alba <em>vs.</em> Acuña and Frial, 53 
Phil. 380.)</p>
<p>What is the felony alleged to have been committed by the defendant against 
the plaintiffs by reason of which the latter seek to enforce civil liability 
against the former? According to the plaintiffs it is malicious prosecution or 
false accusation; according to the defendant and the lower court It is 
defamation or libel.</p>
<p>Let us first consider plaintiffs' contention. Articles 326 and 327 of the old 
Penal Code, which respectively defined and penalized the crime of false 
accusation, were not re-enacted in the Revised Penal Code but, since the old 
Penal Code has been repealed, they must be deemed to have been abrogated.</p>
<p>Article 363 of the Revised Penal Code, which penalizes any person who by any 
act not constituting perjury shall directly incriminate or impute to an innocent 
person the commission of a crime, does not apply to false accusations but to 
acts tending directly to cause false accusations, such as "planting" evidence 
and the like. (People <em>vs.</em> Rivera, 59 Phil. 236.) In the case last cited 
(page 242) this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be noted that article 326 of the old Penal Code contains the 
provision that the accuser could be prosecuted only on the order of the court, 
when the court was convinced upon the trial of the principal cause that there 
was sufficient basis for a charge of false accusation. Article 363 of the 
Revised Penal Code contains no such safeguard. If we extended said article by 
interpretation to administrative and judicial proceedings, it is apparent that 
we would open the door to a flood of prosecutions in cases where the defendants 
were acquitted. There is no reason to believe that the legisla- ture intended 
such a result."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the Revised Penal Code one who falsely accuses another of a crime may 
be held liable either for libel or for perjury, depending upon the manner or 
form in which the act is committed. (See concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Diaz 
in People vs. Rivera, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' legal theory of their case is therefore untenable.</p>
<p>The facts alleged by the plaintiffs against the defendant fall within the 
purview of article 353 of the Revised Penal Code, which defines difamaoi6n 
(incorrectly translated as libel) to be "a public and malicious imputation of a 
crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, 
condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the. dishonor, discredit, or 
contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory of one who 
is dead." Article 355 punishes libel with imprisonment or a fine, or both, "in 
addition to the civil action which may be brought by the Offended party." 
Article 358 penalizes oral defamation or slander.</p>
<p>It is not clear from the complaint in this case whether the alleged false 
imputation or charge of robbery made by the defendant against the plaintiff Lu 
Tian Chiong was written or oral. The allegation in paragraph 8 of thecomplaint 
to the effect that the defendant, knowing that the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong had 
nothing to do with the robbery, "maliciously filed the criminal charge against 
the said plaintiff in the City Fiscal's Office, for the sole purpose of soiling 
the good names of the plaintiffs," is not sufficiently specific to enlighten us 
on that point, for a complaint may be presented to the City Fiscal's Office 
either verbally or in writing. Usually the complainant simply gives to the 
employee in the City Fiscals Office in charge of preparing the charge slips the 
data required for an investigation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Assuming, as counsel for the defendant and the trial court did, that the 
allegedly false imputation or charge against the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong was 
written and therefore constituted a libel, the question is then presented as to 
whether the plaintiffs may recover damages from the defendant upon the facts 
alleged in the complaint. Before scrutinizing the facts let us examine the 
law.</p></li></ol>
<p>The defendant's contention, which the lower court simply declared well 
founded, is that the civil action for libel or defamation has been completely 
abrogated. ha authority for such contention counsel cites the decision of the 
Court of Appeals in Topacio vs. The Tribune Publishing Co., 40 O.G., 12th supp., 
21, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Ruiz <em>vs.</em> Topacio, 40 0.0., 
8th supp., 201. To avoid an erroneous impression we declare that defendant's 
contention is not entirely correct. The repeal of the old Libel Law (Act No. 
277) did not abolish the civil action for libel. In the first place, there is 
the general provision of article 100 of the Revised Penal code that every person 
criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable, and article 104 of the 
same Code further provides that the civil liability includes (1) restitution, 
(2) reparation of the damage caused, and (3) indemnification for consequential 
damages. In the second place, article 355 of the same Code provides that besides 
the criminal action for libel the offended party may bring a civil action. 
Article 360 further provides that "the criminal action and the civil action for 
damages in cases of written defamations, as provided in this chapter, may be 
filed simultaneously or separately with the Court of First Instance of the 
province wherein the libel was published, displayed or exhibited, regardless of 
the place where the same was written, printed or composed."</p>
<p>Defendant's contention that the charge filed by him in the City Fiscal's 
Office was a privileged communication, is not a proper ground for the dismissal 
of the complaint. In the first place, it is a matter of defense. In the second 
place, the fact that a communication is privileged does not mean that it is not 
actionable; the privileged character simply does away with the presumption of 
malice, which the plaintiff has to prove in such a case. (See article 354, 
Revised Penal Code.)</p>
<p>Under the provisions of section 11 of the old Libel Law (Act No. 277) the 
offended party was entitled to recover in a civil action "not only the actual 
pecuniary damages sustained by him but also damages for injury to his feelings 
and reputation, and in addition such punitive damages as the court may think 
will be a just punishment to the libeler and an example to others." The Revised 
Penal Code, however, is silent in regard to the kind and nature of the damage 
recoverable in a civil action for libel. That being the case, may a libeled 
person recover from the libeler damages for injury to his feelings and 
reputation and punitive or exemplary damages, in addition to "the actual 
pecuniary damages sustained by him? Two commentators on the Revised Penal Code. 
Justice Albert and Judge Guevara, differ on that question. Justice Albert in his 
commentary (pages 845-846) apparently assumes that the law in this respect has 
not been changed, for he says under the heading "Civil Liability" that "the 
person so libeled is entitled to recover in such civil action not only the 
actual pecuniary damages, but also damages for injury to his feelings and 
reputation, and in addition such punitive damages as the court may think will be 
a just punishment to the libeler and an example to others. Judge Guevara, 
however, notes that the Revised Penal Code is silent in regard to the kind and 
nature of the damages recoverable in a civil action for libel, and says: "This 
being the case, the inference is that only actual or pecuniary damage may be 
recovered in a civil action on a written defamation." (Guevara on the Revised 
Penal Code, 3d ed., 780.) A division of the former Court of Appeals composed of 
Presiding Justice Paras and Justices Hontiveros, imperial, and Albert rendered 
the opinion in the ease of Topacio <em>vs.</em> The Tribune Publishing Co., 40 
O.G., 12th supp., 21, that with the repeal of the old Libel Law and particularly 
of section 11 thereof only the actual pecuniary damages may now be recovered in 
a civil action for libel.</p>
<p>This Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to pass upon that question. 
Contrary to the assertion of counsel for the present appellee this Court did not 
decide that question, as it was not involved, in the case of Ruiz vs. Topacio, 
(70 Phil., 368).</p>
<p>The liability for punitive or exemplary damages recoverable in a civil action 
for libel under section 11 of Act No. 277 was purely statutory; it was an 
obligation created by law. Hence after the repeal of that law such damages can 
no longer be recovered.</p>
<p>But the liability for damages on account of injury to feelings and reputation 
in a civil action for libel is an Obligation ex delicto. such damages being 
compensatory of the injury inflicted by the wrongful act of defamation. They are 
recoverable under article 104 of the Revised Penal Code, which provides that the 
civil liability arising from the commission of a felony includes reparation of 
the damage caused and indemnification for consequential damages.</p>
<p>It has been held that the right to recover damages of all persons who have 
suffered injury by reason of the wrongful and unprivileged publication of a 
libel or slander can neither be abridged by statute nor lost by reason of 
difficulty in determining the amount that should be awarded. (33 Am. Jur., Libel 
and Slander, sec. 199, p; 188, citing: Hanson <em>vs.</em> Krehbiel, 68 Kan. 
670, 64 L.R.A. 790; Park <em>vs.</em> Detroit Free Press Co., 72 Mich. 560, 1 
L.R.A. 599; Osborn vs. Leach, 135 ET.C. 628, 66 L.R.A. 648; Byers vs. Meridian 
Printing Co., 84 Ohio St. 408, 38 L.R.A. [N.S] 913; Kimball vs. Post Pub. Co., 
199 Mass., 248, 19 L.R.A. [N.S.] 862; and Paxton <em>vs.</em> Woodward, 31 Mont. 
195, 78 Pac. 215.) "There are two general classes of compensatory damages 
allowable for defamation: (1) general damages, or those which the law presumes 
to be the natural, proximate, and necessary result of the publication, and (2) 
special damages, or those which, although a natural and probable consequence 
thereof, are not assumed to be necessary or inevitable, and must be shown by 
allegation and proof. It has been said that the general damages presumed from 
the publication of libelous matter, while not susceptible of being accurately 
measured, are generally more substantial and real than those designated as 
actual, and measured accurately by the dollar standard." (<em>Id., section</em> 
200, p. 189.)</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to examine the facts alleged concerning the damages 
claimed by the plaintiffs:</p>
<ol type="A"><li>
<p>As to the plaintiff Lu Chu Sing. He claims to have suffered damages in the 
amount of not less than P20,000 because the defendant had knowingly, falsely, 
and Maliciously filed a charge for robbery in the City Fiscal's Office against 
his son, the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong, "for the sole purpose of soiling the good 
names of the plaintiffs, and particularly ruining and destroying completely the 
good reputation and credit of the plaintiff Lu Chu Sing as a businessman. Even 
assuming that the defendant had libeled the son, it could not be held that the 
father may recover damages on that account. In the eyes of the law the sin of 
the son is not imputable to the father. The son, who is of legal age, is <em>sui 
juris</em> with a personality separate and distinct from that of the father. 
Their rights and obligations are not merged. The name and reputation of one are 
not those of the other. An invasion of the right of the son is not an invasion 
of the right of the father.</p>
<p>Insofar, therefore, as the plaintiff Lu Chu Sing, the father, and his claim 
of P20,000 damages are concerned, we are clearly of the opinion that the 
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>
</li><li>
<p><em>As to the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong.</em> The allegations of the complaint 
as to him show that he was defamed by the defendant, who, it is alleged, 
knowingly, falsely, find maliciously charged him with complicity or 
participation in the crime of robbery; that because of such false and malicious 
imputation, whenever he applies for any position in any Chinese establishment in 
Manila he is always rejected as an undesirable element or a person of bad 
character. The complaint, however, does not allege any specific amount of 
damages for such injury to his own reputation. His counsel were apparently 
laboring under the erroneous assumption that the reputation of the son was 
inseparable from that of the father and that the damages suffered by the latter 
were necessarily suffered also by the former. Hence their joint 
action.</p></li></ol>
<p>It results from all the foregoing that the complaint may and should be 
amended (<em>a</em>) by excluding therefrom Lu Chu Sing as party plaintiff, 
(<em>b</em>) by alleging specifically whether the defamation complained of by 
the plaintiff Lu Tian Chiong was libel or slander, i.e., whether it was written 
or oral, and (c) by alleging a specific amount of damages claimed by him for 
injury to his reputation. The lower court should have allowed the plaintiff Lu 
Tian Chiong to amend his complaint under section 3 of Rule 8, instead of 
dismissing it.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of dismissal is reversed and the case is ordered 
remanded to the court of origin for further prooeedings in conformity with, this 
opinion, without any finding as to costs in this instance.</p><em>De Joya, 
Hilado,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>We concur in the decision penned by Mr. Justice Ozaeta, although we except 
from the pronouncements contained in the following paragraphs of said 
decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under the Revised Penal Code one who falsely aoouses another of a crime may 
be held liable either for libel or for perjury, depending upon the manner or 
form in which the act is committed. (See concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Diaz 
in People <em>vs.</em> Rivera, <em>supra</em>.)" (P. 5, decision.)</p>
<p>"Defendant's contention that the charge filed by him in the City Piscal's 
Office was a privileged communication, is not a proper ground for the dismissal 
of the complaint. In the first place, it is a matter of defense. In the second 
place, the fact that a communication is privileged does not mean that it is not 
actionable; the privileged character simply does away with the presumption of 
malice, which the plaintiff has to prove in such a case. (<em>See</em> article 
354, Revised Penal Code.) (P. 8, decision.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is our opinion that a charge or an accusation filed in a fiscal's office, 
for prosecution purposes, no matter bow groundless it may be, whether made 
verbally or in writing, cannot be taken as a basis for an action for libel 
against the accuser, and that if a communication is privileged, it cannot be 
criminally actionable. The protection afforded by the privilege expressly 
sanctioned by law cannot be turned down by evidence.<br></p>
