				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Leopoldo&nbsp; Prasnik&nbsp; filed&nbsp; before the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Rizal a petition seeking to adopt Pablo Vasquez, Ernesto Vasquez,&nbsp; Maria&nbsp; Lourdes&nbsp; Vasquez and Elizabeth Prasnik who are the minor&nbsp; children of&nbsp; Paz Vasquez;&nbsp; He claims&nbsp; that they&nbsp; are also&nbsp; his&nbsp; children but without&nbsp; the benefit&nbsp; of marriage and&nbsp; he&nbsp; desires to&nbsp; adopt&nbsp; them&nbsp; to promote their best interest&nbsp; and well-being.&nbsp; Since&nbsp; at the hearing of the petition petitioner, acknowledged that they are&nbsp; his natural children,&nbsp; the'&nbsp; Solicitor General opposed the petition on&nbsp; the plea that&nbsp; he could&nbsp; not legally&nbsp; adopt them for the reason that Article 338&nbsp; of the new Civil Code which allows a natural child to be adopted by his natural father refers only&nbsp; to&nbsp; a child who has not been acknowledged as natural child.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first the ,court upheld the opposition,but, on&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; the court reconsidered its decision&nbsp; and&nbsp; granted the petition. Hence this appeal. <br><br>Leopoldo Prasnik ;was formerly married to one Catherine Prasnik but their&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; was dissolved&nbsp; by virtue of a decree&nbsp; of divorce&nbsp; issued on December&nbsp; 12, 1947 by the Circuit&nbsp; Court of Miami,&nbsp; Dade&nbsp; Country,&nbsp; Florida, U.S.A. Thereafter,&nbsp; he and Paz Vasquez&nbsp; lived&nbsp; together as husband&nbsp; and wife without the&nbsp; benefit of marriage and out of this&nbsp; relation four children&nbsp;&nbsp; were born who are the minors -he is now&nbsp; seeking to adopt.&nbsp; He claims that it is his intention&nbsp; to marry&nbsp; Paz Vasquez as&nbsp; soon as&nbsp; he&nbsp; is granted&nbsp; Philippine' citizenship for which he has already. applied&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the meantime&nbsp; he&nbsp; wants&nbsp; to&nbsp; adopt&nbsp; them in order that&nbsp; no one of his&nbsp; relatives abroad could share in his inheritance.&nbsp; He averred&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had no child with his former&nbsp; wife and acknowledged'&nbsp; said&nbsp; minors as Ms natural&nbsp; children. <br><br>Article 338 of the new Civil Code provides that a natural child&nbsp; may&nbsp; be adopted by&nbsp; his natural&nbsp; father&nbsp; or&nbsp; mother. The Solicitor General&nbsp; interprets&nbsp; this provision in&nbsp; the sense that&nbsp; in&nbsp; order that a natural child may&nbsp; be&nbsp; adopted by his natural father or mother there should not mediate between them an&nbsp; acknowledgment of the status of natural child&nbsp; by the father or mother as otherwise the adoption would be&nbsp; repugnant&nbsp; to Article&nbsp; 335&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Code which denies&nbsp; adoption to one who has an acknowledged natural child.&nbsp; And since petitioner has expressly admitted in open&nbsp; court that&nbsp; the&nbsp; minors subject of this proceeding are his natural children, he is therefore disqualified to adopt under the law.<br><br>We&nbsp; do not agree&nbsp; to&nbsp; this interpretation Apparently, Article 838 above adverted to merely&nbsp; refers to the adoption of a natural child and&nbsp; not&nbsp; to one who has already been recognized, but there is nothing therein which&nbsp; would prohibit&nbsp; the&nbsp; adoption of an acknowledged&nbsp; natural child even&nbsp; if the law&nbsp; does not&nbsp; expressly say so.&nbsp; The reason for the silence of the law is&nbsp; obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; law evidently intends to&nbsp; allow adoption whether the child be recognized or not.&nbsp; If the intention were to allow adoption only to unrecognized&nbsp; children,&nbsp; as&nbsp; contended,&nbsp; then the provision of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 338 would be&nbsp; of no&nbsp; useful purpose&nbsp; because such children&nbsp; could have been validly&nbsp; adopted even without it.&nbsp; And we&nbsp; say&nbsp; so because a natural child&nbsp; not&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; has no&nbsp; right&nbsp; whatever<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and being considered legally a total stranger to his parents, he may be adopted under Article 337.&nbsp; The same cannot be said with regard to&nbsp; an acknowledged&nbsp; natural child because,&nbsp; his&nbsp; filiation having already been&nbsp; established,&nbsp; his&nbsp; adoption cannot be made under the general&nbsp; principles governing adoption (2 Manresa 5th&nbsp; ed., 80).&nbsp; There&nbsp; is therefore need&nbsp; of&nbsp; an express provision allowing the&nbsp; adoption of an&nbsp; acknowledged natural child as an exception to the rule and that is what is contemplated in the article we are considering.<br><br>The Solicitor General, in his opposition to&nbsp; the petition, invokes&nbsp; Article 335, of the new Civil Code which provides that a&nbsp; person who has&nbsp; an acknowledged natural&nbsp; child cannot adopt and considering that petitioner has acknowledged the minors&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; as his children, he contends that he&nbsp; is disqualified from adopting&nbsp; them under that article. We&nbsp; believe that the Solicitor&nbsp; General has not made a correct interpretation of that article for he is&nbsp; confusing the children&nbsp; of&nbsp; the person&nbsp; adopting',, with the minors to be&nbsp; adopted.&nbsp; A&nbsp; cursory&nbsp; reading of said article would reveal that the prohibition merely&nbsp; refers to the&nbsp; adoption of&nbsp; a minor by a person&nbsp; who has already an&nbsp; acknowledged natural child and it does not refer to the adoption of his own children even&nbsp; if he has&nbsp; acknowledged them as his&nbsp; natural children.<br><br>It may be contended that the adoption of&nbsp; an&nbsp; acknowledged natural&nbsp; child is unnecessary because there already exists between the father&nbsp; and the child the relation of paternity and filiation which is precisely the purpose which adoption&nbsp; seeks to accomplish&nbsp; through legal&nbsp; fiction.&nbsp; But it should&nbsp; be borne in mind that the rights of an acknowledged natural child are much&nbsp; less than those of a <span style="font-style: italic;">legitimate</span> child and it is&nbsp; indeed to&nbsp; the great advantage of the latter if&nbsp; he be given, even through legal&nbsp; fiction,&nbsp; a legitimate status.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; this view is in keeping with the modern trend of adoption statutes which have&nbsp; been adopted precisely&nbsp; to encourage adoption (In re Havagord's Estate, 34&nbsp; S. D. 181, 147 N. W. 378).&nbsp; Under this modern trend, adoption&nbsp; is&nbsp; deemed not merely an act&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish the relation of paternity and filiation but one which may give the child a legitimate&nbsp; status.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; in this&nbsp; sense&nbsp; that adoption&nbsp; is now defined as "a juridical act which creates between two persons a relationship similar to that which results&nbsp; from&nbsp; legitimate&nbsp; paternity and filiation"&nbsp;&nbsp; (4&nbsp; Valverde, 473).<br><br>The cases&nbsp; cited by, the&nbsp; Solicitor General are not&nbsp; in point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]&nbsp;</sup> In said cases the petitioners had legitimate children&nbsp; of their&nbsp; own and bo&nbsp; their petitions&nbsp; were&nbsp; denied. They&nbsp; are indeed&nbsp; disqualified&nbsp; from adopting under the law.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the present case&nbsp; however, petitioner&nbsp; does not have any legitimate&nbsp; children and his main&nbsp; desire&nbsp; is&nbsp; to give a legitimate status to his four natural children. This attitude,&nbsp; far&nbsp; from being opposed, should&nbsp; be encouraged. This is&nbsp; in keeping with , the&nbsp; modern trend of&nbsp; the law concerning adoption&nbsp;&nbsp; (In re Havagord's Estate,<i> supra</i>).<br><br>The decision appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; without pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Par√°s,&nbsp; C.
