				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 25, 1952,&nbsp; a shipment of 220 packets of marcassite stones from Switzerland arrived&nbsp; at the Manila International Airport.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shipment was consigned in the bill of lading to the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank for the account of&nbsp; C. C. Abella of 1312 V.&nbsp; Benavidez,&nbsp; San&nbsp; Juan, Rizal. The consular as well as the commercial invoice, however, showed&nbsp; that&nbsp; C.&nbsp; C. Abella of the same address was the "purchaser and consignee".<br><br>For lack of an import control license in violation&nbsp; of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 650&nbsp; (Import&nbsp; Control Law), the&nbsp; shipment was&nbsp; seized by the&nbsp; customs&nbsp; authorities.&nbsp; Forfeiture proceedings&nbsp; were subsequently&nbsp; instituted and&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of the hearing&nbsp; was served upon Abella.&nbsp; Another copy&nbsp; of the notice was posted on the&nbsp; bulletin board of the customhouse.<br><br>At the&nbsp; hearing—originally&nbsp; set&nbsp; for October&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1952 but postponed to October 25 upon Abella's request—Abella denied that he was the same person mentioned in the bill of lading&nbsp; or that named as the purchaser and consignee in the consular&nbsp; and commercial&nbsp; invoices.&nbsp; He claimed that he&nbsp; had nothing&nbsp; to&nbsp; do with the shipment&nbsp; and&nbsp; even declared that he had not&nbsp; corresponded&nbsp; previously&nbsp; with Gola Buchel &amp;&nbsp; Cie., a&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; doing&nbsp; business&nbsp; at Lausanne,&nbsp; Switzerland, and consignor of the&nbsp; shipment in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Construing Abella's denial&nbsp; as&nbsp; an abandonment of the importation, the Collector of Customs of Manila on November 22, 1952&nbsp; rendered decision&nbsp; ordering its forfeiture.&nbsp; Copy of the decision was furnished Abella and another&nbsp; copy, posted on&nbsp; the bulletin board of the customhouse.&nbsp; The&nbsp; decision was not&nbsp; appealed.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Commissioner of Customs, in conformity with the practice followed, reviewed the case <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio,</span> and, on January 12, 1953, affirmed the decision of the Collector.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, or on January 19, the Commissioner,&nbsp; pursuant to section 8 of Executive Order No. 401-A, forwarded the record of the case to the Board&nbsp; of Tax&nbsp; Appeals for review.<br><br>More than two months later, or on April 1, 1953, GolayBuchel &amp; Cie., the consignor of the shipment in question, filed a "petition for review" with the Board of&nbsp; Tax Appeals stating,&nbsp; among&nbsp; other&nbsp; things,&nbsp; that&nbsp; some&nbsp; time during the month of&nbsp; December,&nbsp; 1951, it&nbsp; received an&nbsp; order from one C. C. Abella of&nbsp; 1312&nbsp; V. Benavidez, San Juan, Rizal for the purchase of a&nbsp; quantity&nbsp; of marcassites; that upon receipt of&nbsp; a cablegram to the&nbsp; effect that an import license had been&nbsp; obtained,&nbsp; it shipped the merchandise by airplane on or about January 16, 1952; that it had not been notified&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings subsequently conducted by the Bureau of Customs after the shipment was seized for lack of ail import license; that it learned of the seizure of the shipment only on or about March 14,&nbsp; 1953; that since the consignee,&nbsp; C. C. Abella, disclaimed knowledge of the importation&nbsp; and&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that he was the consignee&nbsp; at the seizure&nbsp; proceedings, notice&nbsp; to him of the&nbsp; decision of the Collector of Customs, as&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the Commissioner of Customs, decreeing the&nbsp; forfeiture of the merchandise in question in favor of the Republic of the Philippines was not notice to petitioner; and that as petitioner was not a party to the seizure&nbsp; proceedings, it&nbsp; is not bound by the decision&nbsp; rendered therein and being the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; thereof, was entitled to the&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; merchandise.&nbsp; For relief the petitioner&nbsp; asked that&nbsp; judgment be rendered reversing the decision of the&nbsp; Commissioner and ordering the reshipment of the merchandise to the port of origin, or&nbsp; that the seizure&nbsp; proceedings be reopened&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner may have the opportunity to submit its evidence&nbsp; and explain its side of the case.<br><br>Required to answer by the Board of Tax Appeals, the Commissioner of Customs on May 2,&nbsp; 1953, through the Solicitor General,&nbsp; filed an answer,&nbsp; alleging by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of affirmative defenses that&nbsp; the seizure of the merchandise in question was in&nbsp; accordance with law and that the decision&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be&nbsp; reviewed had already become&nbsp; final and could no longer be reviewed nor reopened by appeal.<br><br>On May 22,&nbsp; 1953, petitioner amended its "petition for review" by&nbsp; stating that during&nbsp; the&nbsp; month of December, 1951, it received merely a notice&nbsp; from C. C. Abella to the effect that he had applied for a license for certain articles including marcassites; that owing to an erroneous interpretation&nbsp; of Abella's notice, petitioner shipped the marcassites to the&nbsp; Philippines;&nbsp; and that upon&nbsp; being apprised by&nbsp; Abella&nbsp; of&nbsp; the mistake,&nbsp; it instructed its&nbsp; banker,&nbsp; the Philippine National Bank, to have the goods reshipped to Switzerland.<br><br>Acting&nbsp; upon the "petition&nbsp; for review,"&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of Tax Appeals on&nbsp; June 5,&nbsp; 1953 denied the&nbsp; same and sustained&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs,&nbsp; But on June 25, the Board,&nbsp; upon petitioner's motion&nbsp; for reconsideration, suspended the effect of its decision and&nbsp; directed the Commissioner of Customs "to&nbsp; order&nbsp; the Collector of Customs for the port of Manila to reopen this case for the purpose of hearing the evidence and arguments that may be offered or presented by the petitioner or the Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; who should also be&nbsp; notified of the date of the&nbsp; new hearing."<br><br>At&nbsp;&nbsp; the rehearing before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Colleetor,&nbsp; after proper notices had been&nbsp; served,&nbsp; the petitioner corporation&nbsp; presented evidence consisting of a one-page letter alleged&nbsp; to be that of C.&nbsp; C. Abella dated December 13, 1951 and addressed to Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie. of Lausanne, Switzerland, stating that a license had been applied for certain precious stones, among them the 220 packets of marcassites; another letter&nbsp; of Abella dated February&nbsp; 1, 1952 stating in&nbsp; substance that&nbsp; he had neither ordered from Golay-Buchel&nbsp; &amp; Cie. nor instructed&nbsp; the latter to make any shipment; and a telegram&nbsp; addressed to Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie. which reads "Please stop shipment Abella."&nbsp; Abella, who&nbsp; was presented by petitioner as a witness, also identified four other documents (exhs. D, E, F, and G), the originals of which were already part of the record of the case.&nbsp; On February&nbsp; 4, 1954 the Collector of Customs, considering that no important evidence had been presented as to materially alter the result&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; reiterated his previous decree&nbsp; of&nbsp; forfeiture.&nbsp; That decree, on appeal, having been affirmed by the Commissioner, the petitioner filed a petition for review with the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case, however,&nbsp; was&nbsp; forwarded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals pursuant to Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1125 which created it&nbsp; and abolished the former Board of Tax Appeals.<br><br>On June 3,&nbsp; 1956, the Court of Tax Appeals, after hearing, rendered&nbsp; its decision, reversing that of the Commis sioner of Customs and decreeing the release of the marcassite stones to&nbsp; petitioner subject to the condition that they be reshipped by the latter to the port of origin under the statutory and administrative&nbsp; regulations existing at the time of their shipment at the port of Manila.&nbsp; The decision was&nbsp; predicated on the theory that the review by the Commissioner of the decision of the Collector of Customs dated November 22, 1952 did not, under section 1381 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code&nbsp; (which&nbsp; refers&nbsp; to proceedings in case of property&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to unknown parties), necessitate&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal since&nbsp; no claimant appeared&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Collector within&nbsp; 10 days after the seizure of the shipment in question.&nbsp; The decision of the Commissioner was in turn reviewed by the Board of Tax&nbsp; Appeals so that, according to the Court of Tax Appeals, the&nbsp; decision of the Collector of Customs had not become final&nbsp; and&nbsp; executory on June&nbsp; 30, 1953, when&nbsp; the Import Control Law (Republic Act No. 650) expired.&nbsp; And following the&nbsp; opinion of the Undersecretary of Justice (Op. No. 138, s. 1953), which held that all forfeiture proceedings involving property&nbsp; imported in violation of&nbsp; the Import Control Law&nbsp; abated&nbsp; with the expiration of that&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the court ruled that the customs&nbsp; authorities had lost&nbsp; jurisdiction to proceed with the forfeiture proceedings. Not satisfied with&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs filed&nbsp; with this Court a petition for review&nbsp; (G.&nbsp; R. No. L-10994), contending&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Customs&nbsp; dated&nbsp; November 22, 1952, which was not appealed,&nbsp; had&nbsp; already become final&nbsp; even&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to the expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Import Control Law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; corporation Golay-Buchel&nbsp; &amp; Cie. also&nbsp; filed its own petition for review (G. R. No. L-11012) alleging as its sole assignment of error that the court erred in&nbsp; hot considering the evidence adduced to&nbsp; the effect that the marcassite stones were shipped to the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; by mistake.&nbsp; Upon joint&nbsp; motion by the parties, the cases&nbsp; were consolidated and are here decided together.<br><br>This Court in the case of&nbsp; Roxas&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sayoc (100 Phil., 448, 53&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz. [17],&nbsp; 5642) has' already held that the expiration of the&nbsp; Import Control Law did not produce the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; of declaring&nbsp; legal the importation&nbsp; of&nbsp; goods which were&nbsp; illegally&nbsp; imported&nbsp; and&nbsp; the seizure and forfeiture thereof&nbsp; as&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Collector of Customs illegal or null and void.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said this Court in that case:<br><blockquote>"* * *Petitioner contends that upon the&nbsp; expiration of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 650 the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs lost jurisdiction over the case and therefore his decision was null and void.&nbsp; This contention is untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a settled&nbsp; rule&nbsp; that a&nbsp; court, be it judicial or&nbsp; administrative, that has acquired jurisdiction&nbsp; over a case, retains it even after the expiration of&nbsp; the law governing the case.&nbsp; Herein, we are concerned with the effect of the expiration of a law,&nbsp; not with the abrogation of a law, and we hold the view that once the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs has acquired jurisdiction over the case, the mere expiration of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 650&nbsp; will not divest him of his jurisdiction thereon duly acquired while said law was&nbsp; still in force.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (See also&nbsp; Ang&nbsp; Beng&nbsp; et&nbsp; all <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Comm.&nbsp; of Immigration, 100 Phil.,&nbsp; 801, 53 Off. Gaz. (13),&nbsp; 4448.)<br></blockquote>The question, therefore, that arises&nbsp; is whether&nbsp; or not the&nbsp; seizure and forfeiture proceedings conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the customs&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; were valid,&nbsp; it being argued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie. that no notice of the proceedings was&nbsp; sent to the "owner"&nbsp; of the merchandise as reqiured in sec.&nbsp; 1375 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code, the 2nd paragraph of which provides that for the purposes of giving&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; the seizure of&nbsp; imported property and for the purposes of&nbsp; all other&nbsp; proceedings in the matter of such seizure,&nbsp; "the importer, consignee, or&nbsp; person&nbsp; holding the bill of lading shall be deemed to&nbsp; be the 'owner' of the merchandise included in&nbsp; the bill."<br><br>In the present case, there is. reason to believe that Abella, who was&nbsp; duly notified of the seizure&nbsp; and forfeiture proceedings, was actually&nbsp; the importer&nbsp; and consequently the "owner"&nbsp; of&nbsp; the merchandise in&nbsp; question&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; section 1375 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The consular invoice,&nbsp; which was&nbsp; duly authenticated by the American Consul&nbsp; at Geneva, Switzerland, who also&nbsp; acts there as Consul&nbsp; for the Philippines, shows that the 220&nbsp; packets of marcassite stones were purchased from Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie. by C. C. Abella.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that Abella denied having ordered the merchandise and that Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie., the consignor or exporter, now contends that there was mistake in shipping the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abella's denial, however, and petitioner's contention cannot be given credence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both are belied by&nbsp; the facts on record.&nbsp; Abella declared at the first hearing before the Collector of Customs that he had nothing to do with the importation and that he had not previously corresponded with the petitioner Golay-Buchel &amp; Cie.&nbsp; At the hearing, however,&nbsp; before the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals— that is, after the expiration&nbsp; of the Import Control Law— he testified that he had in fact been dealing with petitioner on jewelry and precious stones since 1932 and that he had already bought similar&nbsp; goods from it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record in fact shows that on&nbsp; December 13, 1951 he had&nbsp; written a letter to petitioner stating&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; license has been&nbsp; applied for certain&nbsp; precious stones&nbsp; including 220 packages of marcassites "based on your quotation CIF," and that&nbsp; "as&nbsp; soon as the license shall come out for the above order I shall cable you to ship the above as soon as possible."&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, as observed&nbsp; by the Solicitor General, Abella, in denying any interest in the shipment hoped at the time to avoid criminal prosecution under Republic Act No.&nbsp; 650, which was then still in force.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be remembered that the importation without an import license issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with Republic Act No. 650 was punishable with a fine of not less than P2,000.00 nor more than P20,000.00, or&nbsp; imprisonment of not less than two years nor more than five years, or both, at the discretion of the court, besides the forfeiture of the goods imported.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 18, Rep. Act No. 650.)<br><br>Counsel for the petitioner corporation in contending that the&nbsp; marcassite&nbsp; stones&nbsp; were shipped to the&nbsp; Philippines through inadvertence or mistake, cites&nbsp; Abella's letter of December 13, 1951 already&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to.&nbsp; In that letter, according to petitioner, Abella merely sent&nbsp; a notice&nbsp; that "a&nbsp; license has been&nbsp; applied&nbsp; (for the marcassite&nbsp; stones indicated therein)&nbsp; based on your quotation&nbsp; CIF."&nbsp; It is claimed&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; employee "who&nbsp; used to handle the orders of Mr. Abella" was led to believe&nbsp; by the letter that the import license applied for as stated therein was already issued or about to&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued by the Philippine authorities.&nbsp; And for&nbsp; that reason—as stated by petitioner's manager, Mr.&nbsp; Guignard, in his deposition—said employee "packed the&nbsp; marcassite stones * *&nbsp; * and, in&nbsp; accordance with our practice&nbsp; hereinafter&nbsp; described, turned them&nbsp; over to our forwarder, Messrs.&nbsp; Jacky, Maeder,&nbsp; Geneva, a company distinct and separate from our firm, with the instructions to ship the same as soon as we advised him of the receipt&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cable of instruction of Mr.&nbsp; Abella."<br><br>The&nbsp; letter in question&nbsp; consists&nbsp; of two pages.&nbsp; The first page—which only shows the statement that a license&nbsp; has been applied&nbsp; for&nbsp; certain&nbsp; precious&nbsp; stones including&nbsp; 220 packets&nbsp; of marcassites "based on your quotation CIF"— was introduced as evidence at the rehearing of the seizure proceedings before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector of&nbsp; Customs while&nbsp; the second&nbsp; page—containing the&nbsp; statement that&nbsp; "as soon as the license shall come out&nbsp; for the order I shall cable&nbsp; you to ship&nbsp; the above as soon as possible"—was presented only during the hearing before the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; For ready reference, the letter&nbsp; is hereunder quoted as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">"Dec. 13, 1951 <br></div><br>GOLAY BUCHEL &amp; ClE <br>Lausanne, Suisse <br><br><center>ATTENTION:&nbsp; STONES&nbsp; DEPARTMENT<br></center><br>Gentlemen : <br><br>A license has been applied&nbsp; for the following&nbsp; based on&nbsp; your quotation CIF: <br><br>(Five&nbsp; kinds of precious stones as enumerated including 220 packages of "Real Marcassite Extra Quality" omitted.)<br><br>These prices of the white sapphires are based on your quotation you&nbsp; established in your letter to me&nbsp; dated August&nbsp; 23, 1950.&nbsp; I hope that in the absence of your&nbsp; present quotation of these items, you&nbsp; will&nbsp; be square&nbsp; with&nbsp; this&nbsp; firm&nbsp; in&nbsp; charging&nbsp; your&nbsp; present prices on these white sapphires which I am looking forward to have been further reduced.<br><br>As soon as the license shall come out for the&nbsp; above order I shall cable you&nbsp; to ship&nbsp; the above as soon as possible.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Yours truly, <br>(Sgd.)&nbsp; C. C. Abella<br></div><br>(Footnote)<br><br>Please take&nbsp; notice that the above prices&nbsp; as&nbsp; per your letter of Nov. 19th includes freight insurance and other expenses and&nbsp; to be shipped&nbsp; by air express.&nbsp; Please declare the white sapphires in your invoice as "Real White Sapphires".&nbsp; Omit any classification in your invoice as Imitation, Precious or Semi Precious."<br></blockquote>We really do not see how the above letter could have been construed to&nbsp; mean&nbsp; that the&nbsp; application&nbsp; for license had been favorably acted upon or&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; license for the importation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; in question had already been issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; The letter is simply worded and we find it hard to believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; after dealing&nbsp; with Abella since&nbsp; 1932, petitioner's employee "who used&nbsp; to handle&nbsp; the orders&nbsp; of Mr. Abella" would make an erroneous&nbsp; interpretation of it. Besides, if&nbsp; such letter were the basis of the&nbsp; mistake made by&nbsp; petitioner's employee, it has not been explained&nbsp; why he&nbsp; packed&nbsp; only the marcassite stones when there&nbsp; were many items listed in the said&nbsp; letter.&nbsp; Neither has&nbsp; it&nbsp; been explained why&nbsp; petitioner's forwarder, which was given explicit instructions to ship the goods only when advised by petitioner upon the latter's receipt of&nbsp; the cable&nbsp; of instruction from&nbsp; Abella,&nbsp; "inadvertently&nbsp; or erroneously shipped the marcassite by&nbsp; plane without waiting for&nbsp; petitioner's instructions."<br><br>On the other hand, it&nbsp; is to be observed that Abella gave instructions in his letter not&nbsp; to ship until&nbsp; further&nbsp; notice as may readily be inferred from&nbsp; his&nbsp; assurance that "as soon as the license shall come out for the above order I shall cable you to ship the above as soon as possible."&nbsp; And petitioner itself in its petition filed with the Board, of Tax Appeals on April 1, 1953 stated that "sometime during the month of December 1951, petitioner received an order from one C. C. Abella, 1312 V. Benavidez, San Juan, Rizal, for the purchase of marcassites; that upon receipt of a cablegram informing petitioner that an import license had been obtained the said firm shipped the merchandise by airplane on&nbsp; or&nbsp; about January&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1952."&nbsp; Apparently, Abella, as promised&nbsp; in his&nbsp; letter,&nbsp; subsequently sent instructions by cablegram for the shipment of the marcassites.<br><br>Finally, according to Abella, he sent a cable to petitioner on February 2, 1952, to stop the shipment&nbsp; and also wrote to it a letter dated February 9, 1952 asking that the marcassites which were shipped&nbsp; "inadvertently&nbsp; or&nbsp; through mistake" be shipped back.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also note that the Philippine National Bank, which intervened in the transactions, knew about Abella's&nbsp; denial as evidenced by&nbsp; its letter to petitioner dated February 11, 1952.&nbsp; But oddly enough it took petitioner more than a year before it intervened in the seizure proceedings.&nbsp; In the circumstances, we are not inclined to&nbsp; believe that the marcassites were shipped to the Philippines by mistake&nbsp; or&nbsp; through inadvertence.<br><br>In conclusion, we hold that the forfeiture proceedings conducted in this case&nbsp; were valid and not null and void for lack of&nbsp; notice to the "owner" of the merchandise because Abella,&nbsp; who appears to be the importer and&nbsp; consequently the "owner" of the merchandise under section 1375 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code, was duly notified of the seizure and forfeiture proceedings.&nbsp; And as he did not appeal from the decision of the Collector of Customs dated November&nbsp; 22, 1952,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; has—following&nbsp; the rule enunciated in the case of Sy Man <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jacinto,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; (93 Phil.,&nbsp; 1093)—already become final and executory.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the decision of the Commissioner of Customs declaring the forfeiture of the importation in question&nbsp; in favor of the Government is affirmed.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
