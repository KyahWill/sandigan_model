				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is before Us by appeal from the judgment rendered by the Court of 
First Instance of Sorsogon which found Juanito Napili guilty of robbery with 
rape and Crisostomo Napili of rape. Upon an information which charged them with 
robbery in band with rape, said court sentenced Juanito Napili to an 
indeterminate penalty ranging from a minimum of 8 years and 1 day of <em>prision 
mayor</em> to a maximum of 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>, with the accessories of the law, to indemnify Salud Levantino in 
the sum of P500.00, to acknowledge and maintain the offspring, should there be 
any, and to pay his share of the costs; and likewise sentenced Crisostomo Napili 
to an indeterminate penalty of from 4 months of <em>arresto mayor</em> to 3 
years, 8 months and 1 day of <em>prision correccional</em>, with the accessories 
of the law. Both defendants were likewise sentenced to indemnify, jointly and 
severally, the offended parties Pedro Levantino and the members of his family in 
the sum of P653.85 and in case of insolvency on the part of Crisostomo Napili to 
undergo the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment, and also to pay his share of 
the costs.<br><p>The information accused Raymundo Trifolca, Silvino Peñarubia, 
Juanito Napili, Crisostomo Napili, Gabino Napili, Basilio Napili and Dioscoro 
Llanillo of the crime charged, in that on the 24th day of May, 1946 in the 
municipality of Magallanes, province of Sorsogon, said accused armed with 
rifles, revolvers and bolos, entered the house of Pedro Levantino and with 
intent to gain through violence and intimidation, by binding the hands of Pedro 
Levantino and the other occupants of the house, namely, Salud Levantino, Emilia 
Levantino, Flora Levantino, Roger Levantino, Jaime Grutas, boxing and kicking 
them, took and carried away personal property consisting of wearing apparel, 
pieces of jewelry, a flashlight and a bolo and cash, all totalling P653.85, 
belonging to Pedro Levantino and his family, and that by using force and threat 
to kill, some of the accused had sexual intercourse with Salud Levantino, Flora 
Levantino and Lory Levantino against their will.<br><br>At the hearing and on 
motion of the prosecution, the court dismissed the case against Raymundo 
Trifolca, because the latter escaped from his guards when he was being conducted 
from the insular penitentiary in Muntinglupa, Rizal, to Sorsogon for trial, and 
has not been recaptured. Two other accused, Silvino Penarubia and Dioscoro 
Llanillo, have never been arrested and are still at large, and finally, after 
the submission of the evidence for the prosecution, the fiscal moved that the 
charge against Gabino Napili and Basilio Napili be dismissed on account of the 
insufficiency of the evidence. The court granted said petition. There were, 
therefore, only two accused, Juanito Napili and Crisostomo Napili, who have been 
found guilty of the charge and sentenced as already stated. Of these two, only 
Juanito Napili has appealed.<br><br>From our survey of the evidence We find that 
after dusk, or around seven o'clock in the evening of May 24, 1946, several 
armed persons called at the house of Pedro Levantino in the barrio of Pawik, 
municipality of Magallanes, Sorsogon and from a distance one of them shouted 
that they wanted to buy cigarettes. Pedro Levantino, without suspecting that 
those persons were up to some mischief, opened the kitchen of his house and met 
his callers to deliver the cigarettes. One member of the group, on the pretext 
that he -wanted some water to drink, went up the house followed by his 
companions. Once inside, the intruders ordered Levantino to raise his hands and 
then brought him to the parlor, blindfolded him and bound his hands behind his 
back. The accused proceeded immediately to ransack the place by opening trunks 
and other furniture from which they got the personal properties described and 
enumerated in the information, the value of which has been estimated, without 
objection from the defense, at P653.85.<br><br>While members of the gang were 
ransacking the house, Salud Levantino, Flora Levantino, Roger Levantino and 
Emilia Levantino, children of Pedro Levantino, and one Jaime Grutas who was a 
helper of Pedro Levantino in his copra business, arrived from a neighboring 
barrio where they attended a <em>Santa Cruz de Mayo</em> celebration. Entirely 
unaware of what was going on in their home, they entered the house to be met by 
the robbers who ordered them to raise their hands. The hands of Salud, Flora and 
Emilia were immediately bound and, together with another sister, Lory Levantino, 
who did not attend the celebration of the <em>Santa Cruz de Mayo</em>, they were 
herded into a room and with a rope were bound to a bed. In the meantime, Pedro 
Levantino was brought down from the house and taken to a shack in the yard where 
he was kept under guard. Jaime Grutas was also directed to come down, to the 
ground floor and there kept isolated from the rest. The girls, Salud, Flora and 
Lory, were then ordered to the ground floor and by means of force and 
intimidation individually ravished, with this appellant, Juanito Napill, taking 
charge and raping Salud Levantino. Flora Levantino, as the result of the brutal 
outrage committed on her by one of the robbers, became pregnant and subsequently 
gave birth to a child.<br><br>After satisfying their lewd desires, the accused, 
including this appellant, left the scene of their crime carrying away with them 
their loot in a sack. While the robbery and ravaging of the girls were being 
perpetrated, the victims were able to recognize only Juanito Napili, this 
appellant, and Crisostomo Napili. Juanito Napili was identified not only by 
Salud Levantino but also by Lory Levantino; and Crisostomo, by virtue of the 
fact that he was previously known to the Levantino family and was identified as 
one of the robbers by Jaime Grutas, Salud Levantino and Pedro 
Levantino.<br><br>The defense did not deny that in the evening of May 24, 1946 
the house of Pedro Levantino in the barrio of Pawik, Magallanes, Sorsogon, was 
visited by a gang of men who took away by force and intimidation cash and 
personal belongings of Levantino and his family. It also admitted that some 
members of the gang raped Salud, Lory and Flora Levantino. Counsel for appellant 
in this instance questions, however, the finding of the lower court regarding 
the identification of Juanito Napili as one of the robbers who raped Salud 
Levantino, by contending that it has not been sufficiently established by the 
prosecution. Counsel likewise insists that the lower court should have favorably 
considered the alibi alleged by his client.<br><br>On the witness stand, Salud 
Levantino, one of the victims of the outrage, without hesitation identified 
Juanito Napili as the robber who raped her that night. She said that appellant brought her down to the ground floor and by threatening her with a dagger was 
able to have carnal knowledge of her. She stated that she did not forget his 
features and his face on the night in question. That he is thin, with curly hair 
and of small structure. Upon the arrest of Crisostomo, Basilio and Juanito 
Napili, the chief of police of Magallanes, requeued her to point out among the 
three persons lined up before her, the one who had raped her, and she pointed 
out the appellant. According to the offended party there was moonlight on the 
evening in question which helped her to identify the appellant. Moreover, 
according to the evidence, although the leader of the gang had ordered Pedro 
Levantino to put out the light in the house, one of the malefactors was using 
quite frequently a flashlight, the glare of which helped Salud Levantino in the 
identification of this appellant.<br><br>The other victim, Lory Levantino, 
corroborating her sister, testified that Salud Levantino was brought down to the 
ground floor by appellant and there she was ravished by Juanito Napili. Salud 
and Lory frankly stated that they were not able to identify the other accused, 
but they were positive as to their identification of this appellant.<br><br>So 
much for this point. As regards the alleged alibi of appellant, the latter would 
make the court believe that, at the time of the commission of the crime, he was 
in the municipality of Castilla, of the province of Sorsogon, saving logs in the 
homestead of Melecio Llanillo and. that, therefore, it was physically impossible 
for him to have been in the scene of the crime, in the municipality of 
Magallanes, at the time of its commission.<br><br>As properly remarked by the 
lower court, the municipality of Castilla is separated from that of Magallanes 
by the Sorsogon Bay, which is a rather small body of water which can be crossed 
in a few hours ride by boat from Castilla to Magallanes and vice-versa. Granting 
that Juanito Napili was employed in the homestead of Melecio Llanillo in the 
municipality of Castilla, the trial judge said that it was not physically 
impossible for him to have crossed the bay of Sorsogon, joined his confederates 
in the commission of the complex crime charged and of which he was convicted, 
and afterwards returned to Castilla by crossing the bay of Sorsogon. Paulino 
Dondonilla, who was put on the witness stand by the defense to prove the alleged 
alibi of Juanito Napili, testified that he was present when this appellant was 
arrested by the military police, and yet he kept silent and withheld from the 
officers of the law the supposed presence in Castilla of Juanito Napili 
precisely at the time when the house of Pedro Levantino was being robbed by a 
gang of malefactors of which Napili was identified as one of its active members. 
We are, therefore, satisfied that the evidence presented by appellant to prove 
his alibi is incredible (People vs. Badilla, 48 Phil., 718) and his 
identification "by the offended parties being so clear and positive his alibi is 
rejected. (People <em>vs</em>. Palamos, 49 Phil., 601; People <em>vs</em>. 
Medina, 49 Phil., 313.)<br><br>Finally, counsel for appellant contends that the 
latter was wrongly convicted of the complex crime of robbery with rape because 
there is no specific allegation contained in the information, regarding the 
commission of the crime of rape, but the wording of the last paragraph of the 
information is so manifestly clear that We are convinced that the lower court 
did not err in convicting this appellant of said complex crime. The information 
says in parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * and then two of the said accused did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously by use of force and threat to kill, have sexual 
intercourse with said Salud Levantino, Flor Levantino and Lory Levantino 
against their will."</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall now turn our attention to the circumstances which accompanied the 
commission of the offense. Those are (1) the aggravating circumstance of 
nighttime (Art. 14, par. 6, Rev. Penal Code), for the record shows that it was 
already dark when the robbers intruded in the house of Pedro Levantino, so much 
so that one of the members of the gang was using a flashlight frequently during 
the ransacking of the house (People <em>vs</em>. Aquino, 39 Off.Gaz., No. 74, 
page 1799); (2) the aggravating circumstance of craft as provided in paragraph 
14 of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code, as it has been shown that in order 
to enter the house of Pedro Levantino, one of the malefactors shouted from the 
outside that they wanted to buy cigarettes, which induced Pedro Levantino to 
open the kitchen for them, and that one of them said that they wanted to drink 
some water which also paved the way for their intrusion in the house of the 
offended parties (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Gampoña, 30 Phil., 817; People <em>vs</em>. 
Daos, 60 Phil., 143); and (3) the commission of the offense in the dwelling of 
the offended parties (People <em>vs</em>. Collado, 60 Phil., 
610).<br><br>Pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code 
which punishes robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons, "the 
penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <em>recluslon 
perpetua"</em> shall be inflicted upon the culprit, "when the robbery shall have 
been accompanied by rape, * * *." Said penalty is <em>reclusion temporal</em> in 
its medium period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and consists of three periods 
the maximum of which is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. and in view of the presence 
of three aggravating circumstances in the commission by this appellant of the 
offense of which he is hereby found guilty, without any mitigating circumstance 
to offset the same, the penalty which is hereby imposed upon him is that of 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em> with the corresponding accessories.<br><br>With the 
above stated modification, and it being understood that appellant shall return 
to the offended parties the property stolen and in case of failure to do so 
shall reimburse the value thereof, the judgment appealed from is otherwise 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
