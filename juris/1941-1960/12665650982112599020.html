				<H3>LEONIDES S. ASUNCION AND AMADO CASTRO, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. CELESTINO DE LA CRUZ, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The above-entitled proceedings originated with a petition presented in the 
Court of First Instance of Tarlac for the summary settlement of the estate of 
the deceased Benedicta de la Cruz. The petition alleges that said deceased left 
at the time of her death five parcels of land all with original certificates of 
title in the name of the said deceased. When the petition was called for 
hearing, Celestino de la Cruz moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground 
that the said oppositor had filed claims in the cadastral proceedings for three 
of the parcels of land mentioned in the petition. Subsequently the same 
oppositor filed another opposition on the ground that the said properties did 
not belong to the deceased Benedicta de la Cruz but to oppositor's father; that 
if the deceased had any rights over the three parcels of land the same had 
already been transferred by her to the oppositor; that an undivided two-thirds 
of the other two lots had also been ceded to the oppositor for a valuable 
consideration and the said decedent had not repurchased the same; etc. After 
hearing the said opposition the court found that two of the lots mentioned in 
the petition had been mortgaged to one Juan Cojuangco and another mortgaged also 
to one Santiago Nicolas, and for this reason the court denied the petition for 
summary settlement. But a motion for reconsideration was presented, and in 
accordance therewith the court reconsidered its order of dismissal and granted 
the summary distribution prayed for, declaring the children of the decedent as 
her heirs and assigning to all of them in equal shares, a one-half undivided 
interest in each of the parcels mentioned in the petition. A motion to 
reconsider the above order having been denied, an appeal from the order of 
summary distribution was taken to this Court. It is claimed that the lower court 
erred in finding that the three lots were owned by the deceased and ordering 
their distribution to her heirs, in the face of the claim of ownership asserted 
by the oppositor-appellant; that it erred in giving course to the settlement in 
spite of the fact that the petition in cadastral proceedings had been presented 
wherein the oppositor-appellant had claimed the three parcels of land in 
question; and that it erred in not denying the summary settlement in so far as 
the three lots claimed by the oppositor-appellant are concerned.
<p>It is claimed in support of the first alleged error that the trial judge had 
no power to declare that the properties mentioned in the petition are properties 
of the deceased. A study of the order, however, shows that it did not make a 
definite finding or conclusion to that effect as against the 
oppositor-appellant. The court only went to say that there was a presumption 
that said properties wore still owned by the deceased at the time of her death 
and are free from all incumbrances; but it makes the reservation in favor of the 
oppositor's claim of the right to a separate action if he claims proprietary 
rights over said properties. The court states thus in its order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If Celestino de la Cruz claims some proprietary rights over these 
properties, he can pursue his remedy in a separate and ordinary action which he 
should bring against the proper parties." </p></blockquote>
<p>The next contention of the oppositor-appellant is that as the lower court had 
no jurisdiction to declare the decedent as the owner of the properties in 
question, it can not legally distribute and deliver them to her heirs in the 
exercise of its probate jurisdiction; that such distribution and delivery of the 
properties is an unjust deprivation of the appellant's rights and interests over 
the same. The above argument is based on the mistaken concept of the proceedings 
for the distribution and settlement of the estate of a deceased person.</p>
<p>The purpose of a summary settlement is to proceed summarily with the 
"allowance of a will, if any there be, to determine who are the persons legally 
entitled to participate in the estate, and to apportion and divide it among them 
after the payment of such debts of the estate as the court shall then find to be 
due; and such persons * * * shall thereupon be entitled to receive and enter 
into the possession of the portions of the estate so awarded to them 
respectively. * * *." (Section 2, Rule 72, Rules of Court.) As held in the cases 
of Intestate of the late Januaria Gonzales, Abarro <em>vs</em>. De Guia, 72 
Phil., 245 and Intestate of Jimenez, Jimenez <em>vs</em>. Jimenez, 67 Phil., 
263, in a summary distribution the estate of the deceased is valued; his debts, 
if any, are paid; his will, if any, is allowed; the heirs and legatees are 
declared, and distribution is made, * * *. (II Moran, Comments on the Rules of 
Court, 1952 ed., p. 345. In distribution proceedings, the court has no 
jurisdiction to adjudicate or determine title to properties claimed to be a part 
of the estate by the heirs and distributees and also claimed by third parties. 
(Mallari, et al. <em>vs</em>. Mallari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
40 Off. Gaz., No. 2, p. 503). In the same manner that the court in an 
administration proceeding determines only in a <em>prima facie</em> manner if a 
property alleged to belong to the state really belongs to the decedent (Cordova 
Vda. de Ma√±alac <em>vs</em>. Ocampo, 73 Phil., 661; Baquial <em>vs</em>. 
Amihan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 49 Off. Gaz., No. 2, p. 511), 
so also the court in a summary settlement proceeding only determines <em>prima 
facie</em> the ownership and possession of the properties; but such 
determination does not prevent the heirs or third parties from claiming title 
adverse to the decedent's, which title or claims must be decided in a separate 
suit. (Intestate estate of Miguel Guzman. Guzman <em>vs</em>. Anog and Anog, 37 
Phil., 61.) In consonance with these principles the orders appealed from found 
<em>prima facie</em> that the lots sought to be distributed among the heirs of 
the decedent belong to and were in the possession of the said decedent at the 
time of her death. The orders do not deprive the oppositor-appellant of his 
right to claim said properties as his own and to institute a separate action to 
assert his title thereto as against the decedent or her heirs. The claim of the 
appellant that the trial court had no power to enter the decree of distribution 
is, therefore, without merit. </p>
<p>The appeal is hereby dismissed and the order appealed from affirmed, with 
costs against oppositor-appellant. </p>
