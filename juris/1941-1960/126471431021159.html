				<H3>JUANA  BAYAUA  DE VISAYA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT,  VS. ANTONIO SUGUITAN  AND CATALINA  BLAZ, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On 23  April 1941  the spouses Antonio Suguitan and Catalina  Blaz sold their  homestead land (known as Lot No. 6728 of the  Santiago Cadastre), containing an  area of 21.7501 hectares, situated in  San Mateo, Isabela, to the spouses Modesto Visaya and Juana Bayaua.  The sale was duly approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources in  accordance with the  Public Land Act (Com. Act  No.  141).  The  sale was registered on  30  March 1951.  The original certificate of  title was cancelled and in lieu thereof  transfer certificate of  title  No.  T-2655 was  issued  in favor  of the vendees.   On 24  March 1952, the spouses Suguitan commenced suit  in the  Court  of First Instance of Isabela against Juana Bayaua de Visaya, widow of Modesto Visaya, who died during the war, seeking to repurchase the homestead land (civil case No. 420). On 20 August 1952 the parties  entered into the following stipulation  of facts;</p>
<ol>
  <li>That the defendant hereby agrees to reconvey unto the plaintiff the land in  question for and  in  consideration of the sum  of two thousand  four hundred pesos (P2,400)  Philippine currency as the repurchase price of the  same;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That  the plaintiff  hereby  asks for a period  of  sixty days (60)  from the notice of  decision in  accordance with the foregoing stipulation of facts to pay the said amount to defendant;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That at the time of the signing of this  stipulation of facts, the parties hereby renounce any claim for damages and/or counter claim as alleged  in  their pleading;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That (at) anytime that the  said amount of two thousand four hundred pesos  (P2,400), will be  (is) raised by the plaintiff within the said  period  stipulated above, plaintiff can just deposit it  with  the clerk  of  court, Court of First Instance, Ilagan,  Isabela, for the  plaintiff  may not contact the defendant  (at)  any time; and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>That if defendant refuses  to  appear  and receive the  amount as deposited after ten (10) days' notice duly given to her, parties hereby  agree to  have the DEED OF reconveyance in  favor  of the herein plaintiff be executed for and on her by the Clerk of Court, Court of First Instance, in accordance with the provisions of section 10, Rule  39, Rules  of  Court, which will  be  sufficient  conveyance in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 496 to cancel the title of defendant in favor of plaintiff over the land  in question.<br>
    <br>
  The  plaintiff  further  renounces  any right, interest, or  claim over the  harvest  of  any crop  or  plant thereon  planted over the land in question  at the time of the signing of this agreed  stipulation of  facts.<br>  
  <br>Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, it is hereby respectfully  prayed   of  this  Honorable Court that  judgment  be rendered  in  accordance  with the  foregoing  agreed  stipulation of facts.</li>
</ol>
<p>which  was submitted to the  Court  for  approval.   Upon the foregoing stipulation  of facts,  on 25 August 1952 the Court  rendered judgmentâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * * ordering  the plaintiff  Antonio Suguitan to  pay  to the defendant Juana  Bayaua de Visaya, the  sum  of  two thousand four hundred  (P2,400)  pesos, Philippine currency, within a period of sixty  (60)  days  from the  notice of this decision,  as  the repurchase price  of  the  land  covered  by Transfer  Certificate of Title No. T-2655  who, upon receipt thereof, shall execute immediately the deed  of reconveyance of the said land in  favor of the plaintiff. Without  pronouncement as to  costs.</p>
  <p>Upon the registration of the aforesaid deed of reconveyance and payment of the  legal  fees  therefor, the Register  of Deeds of Isabela  is hereby ordered  to cancel Transfer  Certificate of  Title No. T-2655 and  to issue in lieu thereof another  transfer certificate of title in favor  of the plaintiff Antonio Suguitan.  (Appendix A.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of  the refusal  of the  defendant  Bayaua  to accept payment of the repurchase price of P2,400 tendered by Agripina Siruno Vda. de Coma, to  whom the plaintiffs (Suguitans) sold 13 out of the original 21.7501 hectares (Annex A), on  14 September 1953 Agripina Siruno Vda. de Coma deposited in  Court the sum of P2,400, of which deposit the defendant Bayaua was notified (Appendix C). Thereupon, upon motion of the plaintiffs  (Suguitans), the Court ordered the clerk to execute the deed of reconveyance in their favor.</p>
<p>On 12 April 1954 Juana Bayaua  brought an action  in the same Court against the spouses Antonio Suguitan and Catalina Blaz to recover ownership of  the homestead land (civil case No. 690), the same land involved in civil case No. 420.   On 31 July 1954, upon motion of the defendants, the Court dismissed the complaint on the ground of <em>res judicata</em>.  The  plaintiff has  appealed.</p>
<p>In another  action brought in the same  court by the heirs of the late Modesto Visaya against the spouses Suguitan to recover their share in the homestead land purchased or acquired by  their  late father  Modesto Visaya from the spouses Suguitan  (civil case No.  664), the plaintiffs therein, the heirs of the late Modesto  Visaya, appealed from the  order of dismissal  of their complaint on the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata,</span> based upon the judgment in civil case No. 420 rendered  as a result  of a compromise agreement.  This Court  reversed  the order  of  dismissal and remanded the case to  the court of origin with directions to require the  defendants-appellees  (the Suguitans)   to answer the complaint and to proceed and decide the case on its  merits, for the reason that the plaintiffs  therein, the heirs  of the late  Modesto Visaya,  could not  legally be bound  by the agreement entered into by and between the Suguitans, the plaintiffs in the aforesaid civil case No. 420, and defendants in  civil case  No. 664, and their mother Juana  Bayaua, the defendant in civil case No. 420 (G.  R. No.  L-8300, promulgated on  18 November 1955).</p>
<p>In the stipulation  of facts approved by the Court and upon which judgment was rendered  in civil case No. 420, the Suguitans, the plaintiffs in  that  case, were  granted a period of 60  days from receipt of notice of  decision within which to repurchase the homestead land by depositing the  repurchase price of P2,400  with the  clerk  of the Court of First Instance of Isabela.  This  they failed to do.   Instead they sold  13 out of the original 21.7501 hectares of the hamestead land to Agripina Siruno Vda. de  Coma,  who  attempted to  repurchase  the  whole lot or parcel of land by depositing in court  the amount of P2,400 on 14 September 1953, one year and 24 days after the execution of the agreement.   As the plaintiffs therein, the Suguitans, failed to comply  with the terms of the agreement, the defendant  therein (Juana  Bayaua) could at her  option rescind the agreement and refuse to reconvey the homestead land.  The plaintiffs  therein,  defendants herein, cannot rightfully set up the defense of res judicata in  this  action (civil case No.  690)  brought by  Juana Bayaua against them, because the agreement entered into by  and  between  them  and Juana Bayaua in civil case No. 420 was  not complied with by  them.  The defendants in  this case (civil case No.  690) and  plaintiffs in civil case  No. 420 can no longer compel the defendant in civil case No.  420 and plaintiff in this  case  (civil case No. 690) to reconvey  the said  homestead land  to them because  from 23 April 1941,  the date of the execution of the deed of sale, to 24 March 1952,  the date of the filing of their complaint in civil case No. 420 by which they sought to repurchase the homestead land, more than five years  already had  elapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>The order appealed from is reversed and  the  case  remanded to the trial court  with instructions to require the appellees, defendants in the court below, to  answer the complaint, to  proceed  with the  trial  of the  case and to render judgment therein, with eosts against the appellees.</p>
