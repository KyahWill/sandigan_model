				<H3>LEONCIA VELASCO, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS  AND  VALENTIN  DOMINGO  AND  MANUEL DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from a supplemental decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations,  Hon. Guillermo  S.  Santos, presiding, ordering  petitioner  herein Leoncia Velasco to deliver to respondents Valentin and  Manuel, both sumamed Domingo, 179.25 cavans of palay at  44  kilos per cavan of the "pimirsigue" variety, or its value at P9.00 per cavan, or a total of Fl,613.25, with interest at 6% per annum from May 3, 1957 until fully  paid.</p>
<p>On  May 23,  1952, petitioner  herein Leoncia  Velasco leased a  parcel  of  land  containing 89,666 square  meters to Valentin Domingo and  Manuel Domingo for three agricultural years from  May  23, 1952  to  April 17,  1955.   On April  28, 1965, petitioner herein Velasco  sold the land to  Marcelino Maclang for JP7,000.00  (Annex  "A").   On May 3,1955, Marcelino Maclang brought an action against Valentin  Domingo  and Manuel Domingo for  ejectment. Petitioner  Velasco filed  a petition  to intervene in  the proceedings,  which  petition  was  granted.   The  action instituted by Maclang against the Domingos was decided in favor of Maclang, for the ejectment of the Domingos.</p>
<p>A trial was had upon the claim of petitioner Velasco against the Domingos,  and after trial  the court,  after overruling a motion for reconsideration, rendered the decision indicated above and now subject of appeal.  The law invoked in the decision  is Section 7 of  Act 4054, which limits the amount of rental for an agricultural land to  not more than 25%  of the estimated normal harvest for  the last three  years.</p>
<p>Third-party respondent in the ejectment  suit  Leoncia Velasco, petitioner herein, introduced one witness Arsenio Cruz who testified to having cultivated the land  and harvested as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * September, 1949-140 cavans; April, 1950-220; September, 1950-145;  April 1951-225;  September, 1951-143; April, 1952-about 230  cavans.  (p. 5 Resolution, Annex "C").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trial court, however, refused to believe this testimony as  exaggerated.   One other reason is that salty water enters the land from  Manila Bay and it is only during  the months of June,  July or August that salt water  gets out. Manuel Domingo and Arsenio Robles testified that they never harvest a  second  crop except in 1956, and that a cavan of seedling normally produces 30  cavans of palay. So  the judge below refused to  believe the testimony of the witness for petitioner  Velasco on  the ground that  the quantity of harvests  testified to by him is excessive.  He also decided that if the Domingos have  not been able to plant the  first harvest  in September, such failure was not due to any negligence on their  part, but to the salty condition  of the  land.</p>
<p>The errors assigned on this appeal are the trial court's failure to consider the harvest for the  three years preceding the contract of lease, its act in declaring that the rental is excessive and its declaration that the petitioner Velasco is  liable  to  return 179.25  cavans  of palay  instead  of merely dismissing the third-party  complaint The  court below decided  the  case  on  its  findings  on three issues namely:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. Did  third-party respondent  sufficiently establish the  average yield of the landholding in question for the crop years  1949-1950, 1950-1951,1951-1952?</p>
  <p>"2. Did  the landholding normally produce two harvests a year during the three years preceding the parties' lease contract?</p>
  <p>"3. Were third-party petitioners negligent in  failing to  produce the  alleged two harvests? If not, what were the  real causes of such  failure? (pp. 4-5, Annex "C")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was error for the court below to hold that petitioner-lessor has the  burden of proving the legality of the rentals of 90 cavans  fixed for the lease.  The contract was the product of a  voluntary (agreement of  the lessor and the lessees.   Under the law a person is presumed to take ordinary care of his concerns (Sec. 69 [d] Rule 123, Rules  of Court) and private transactions, presume^ fair and regular (Sec. 69  [p],  Id.). Hence respondents-appellees must  be presumed to have conformed to the above rentals because the same  are reasonable and just.  As they agreed to the rentals it must  have  been because  they  conform to the limits imposed by law (Sec. 69  [y], Id.).  With  these presumptions in  mind  it is evident that the jiarty which had  the obligation to prove that the  rentals are excessive and  are not conformable to law are  the respondents, not the petitioner  as the court below assumed and made the basis of  its findings and conclusions.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted by  both parties are conflicting. We have  on the one hand the testimony of  a former tenant that the land produced  the following harvestsâ€”Sept. 1949-140  cavans; April, 1950-220; Sept. 1950-145; April, 1951-225; Sept 1951-143; April, 1952-about 230.  Against the aboVe  positive evidence respondents presented merely circumstantial facts, i, e., that salty water affects the lands and supposed harvest during the actual term of the lease. These  circumstantial evidence can not be considered more convincing than that presented by petitioner which was to the very fact  in  issue, namely harvests  in  three years preceding the execution of  the contract.</p>
<p>It is also to be noted that this is not a case  in which a reasonable rental  is to be fixed in the discretion of the court.   It is a case of reformation of a contract voluntarily agreed  into on the  ground that the rental agreed upon exceeds that fixed by law.  Here again it was the respondents who had the  burden  of  proof that the  law was violated, as they hold, the  affirmative of  a  proposition, i.  e.,  that the rentals are  excessive.  They must prove said affirmation.   In this respect  also we  believe  that respondents have not  adduced the evidence necessary to overcome the evidence submitted by the petitioner.</p>
<p>In view of the  conflicting  evidence  the  court below should have  resolved  the question  as to  the legality of the contract  by the rules of  presumption and burden of proof.   The contract must  be presumed legal, as it was entered  into voluntarily  and  no  fraud was alleged  or proved in relation to its execution.   And it is incumbent upon respondents also to prove  that the rentals  fixed are in excess of  that  fixed by law, not  only because  of that presumption  but  because the law places the burden  of proof on the respondents who claim the rentals  as excessive.  We  find that respondents  failed,  in view  of  the conflict in  the  evidence.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, constrained to hold,  as we  hereby hold, that the court below erred in declaring the  rentals excessive.</p>
<p>However, we can  not enter a judgment granting relief to the petitioner, as the record does  not disclose what amount or portion of the  rentals  have  not been paid. She herself  has  stated  that  respondents  are at most entitled to a dismissal of her  claim.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the judgment or resolution appealed from is hereby  reversed and both the claim  of petitioner and the counterclaim  of the respondents  are hereby dismissed. Without costs.  So ordered.</p>
