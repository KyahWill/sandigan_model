				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner  Domingo Almonte Uy appeals from the decision of the  Court of  First  Instance of Camarines Sur, denying his  petition  for  naturalization  as  a  Philippine citizen.</p>
<p>The records disclose that petitioner was born  on February 24, 1928  (Exh. C) in Tabaco, Albay, the son  of Uy Toco and Sy Chia,  both Chinese citizens.  He resided in said municipality since his birth  until 1954.   Thereafter, he moved  to Naga  City, where he has  been residing up to  the  present.  He has resided  in the  Philippines continuously for more  than 30 years, and  has not left it at any time.  He married Belen Jardinel, a Filipina, on June 23, 1956  (Exh.  J),  with  whom  he has  now  2 children, namely, Marilyn and Aster, born on April 19,  1956  (Exh. H)  and August 10, 1958  (Exh.  I),  respectively.   He is of  good moral  character, and has conducted himself in a  proper and irreproachable  manner during the  entire period of his residence in this  country in his  relation with the constituted government, as well as with the community in which he  is living.  He is  owner and manager of the "Saxon Tailoring Shop,"  which he  established  in  June, 1958 with a capital of more than P3,000.00.  Prior thereto, he  was  salesman of  the   "Golden  Star  Trading,"  with a monthly salary of P120.00.  He had not filed any income tax return.   He speaks  and writes English and  the Bicol dialect (Exhs. K and K-1).  He  finished  his  elementary education  at  Tabaco  Chinese  School,  in  Tabaco,  Albay, and  his  secondary  education  at  St.  Johns Institute  of Tabaco, in the same municipality.  He also took up commerce at the University of the  East, but  was unable to finish the course.  He possesses none of the disqualifications for naturalization provided in  Section  4  of the Revised Naturalization Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>    (See clearances, Exhs. L-1 to L-5).</p>
<p>In  support of his petition, petitioner presented as  character  witnesses, Mayor Monico  Imperial  of  Naga City, and  Dr. Francisco  Gomez  of  the  same municipality.</p>
<p>In  denying his petition for  naturalization, the court, in its  decision  of  November  22,  1958, stated' as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "It  is  clear  from the foregoing1 that the petitioner possesses the  first, second,  fifth,  and sixth  qualifications  required by  Sec, 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law and none of the disqualifications mentioned in Sec. 4 thereof.</p>
  <p>"Regarding the third qualification, the evidence  failed to  show that the petitioner believed  in the  principles underlying  the Philippine  Constitution.  On  the  said subject he only testified that he believed in  a democratic  government, but the Philippine Constitution  embraces  other  underlying  principles  besides  belief in  a democracy.  And even  his knowledge of a democratic government, is faulty.  He said defining a  democratic government, that it  is a government where  the  people can vote, where there is freedom of speech, press,  and 'transportation from one place  to  another,' and 'where people can file complaints.'  Certainly, his lack  of knowledge of all the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution  and his insufficient  understanding of  a democratic government  make  him unfit to become a  citizen of this country.  Knowledge of the fundamental  law,  at least  of its  principal underlying principles,  is indispensable  to a  good citizenship.</p>
  <p>"As to the fourth qualification, the evidence failed  to show  that he lias a lucrative  trade or occupation.  It  is true that he  owns and manages  a tailoring business with  an operating  capital of about P3,000.00, but there is no proof that  he earns  enough  from this  business  to  provide sufficient  support  for  himself and his family.  He confessed  that  he did  not know as yet whether or not  his business  would be  profitable.  As  a matter  of fact, his earnings could not be much above the minimum wage level because he had not filed any income tax return. It is  thus  reasonably doubtful if he can provide his family with  sufficient support and his children with at least  a  primary  and  secondary  education.  If admitted a  citizen of this country, he may  only be an addition to the  many problems that  now confront the  nation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His  motion  for  reconsideration of said decision having been  denied,  petitioner appealed to  us.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from must  be  affirmed.  We  are in accord with the lower court that petitioner failed to show that he has a  lucrative lawful occupation.   True it is that he  testified that he owns and  manages a  tailoring shop capitalized at  more than  P3,000.00.   He did  not say how he raised this  capital, considering that prior to the openings of  this  shop,  he  was merely earning  P120.00  a month. There is no evidence that petitioner's earnings  would  be sufficient to support  himself and the members of his family of 3  (his wife and 2 children). In fact, at the date of the hearing (September 18, 1958), said tailoring shop was in existence barely 4 months.  At  said  hearing,  petitioner, in effect, declared  that  he did not  know  as  yet whether  his  business would be  profitable  or not, as  he had just  begun  it.  In  the circumstances,  it  is  highly doubtful  if petitioner can  provide  his family  with  adequate  support, and his children  with at least a primary and secondary education.  In this  connection,  the  lower court  aptly observed that "if admitted a  citizen of this country,  he (petitioner)  may only be an  addition  to  the many  problems  that now confront the nation."  In  the very recent case  of  Swee Din Tan  <em>vs</em>. Republic (<em>supra</em>, p. 287), we reversed  the decision of  the lower court granting the application for  citizenship  of Swee  Din Tan,  on the ground that he had no lucrative employment, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We find a sounder reason to refuse  citizenship: no lucrative employment. It is admitted  that Swee Din Tan,  with  a wife and three  children,  is a mere  employee receiving  P200.00 a  month only.   We think that at the present  valuation of  the peso, petitioner  may  have  an employment;  but  he has  not a 'lucrative' employment.  It is true, we have held in some cases that  an alien receiving P80.00, P140.00 or P250.00  a month had a lucrative employment;  but  the  applicants  therein  received free  board  and lodging.   (Lim  <em>vs</em>. Republic, 92 Phil., 522; 49 Off. Gaz., 122; Tiong <em>vs</em>.  Republic, 94  Phil., 473; 50  Off. Gaz.,  1025;  Uy  Tiao  Hong <em>vs</em>.  Republic,   101  Phil.,  77;  54  Off.   Gaz., 629; Republic <em>vs</em>. Yap, L-11187,  April 28, 1958).  It is also true that we  admitted to citizenship  persons whose  income did  not  exceed F250.00 or P200.00 a month, with no  lodging1; however, the applicants therein had no children.   (Republic <em>vs</em>. Lim, L-3030, Jan.  31, 1951;  Pang Kok Hua <em>vs</em>.  Republic, 91  Phil.,  254.)  At any  rate,  with the low purchasing power  of our  currency,  a married  man  with three children  to support  can hardly make  both ends  meet,  if he makes P200.00  a month only.  Therefore, he may  not be  held to have a lucrative employment." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above ruling applies  with  even greater force to the instant case,  it appearing that petitioner  at the time of the hearing had yet no determinate or fixed income from his said  tailoring  shop business  or  occupation.</p>
<p>We  find, as  did the  lower court,  that  petitioner failed to satisfy the requirement of lucrative lawful  occupation provided in  Section 2(4)  of the  Revised Naturalization Law.  Having arrived  at this conclusion,  we  need  not discuss whether or not petitioner-appellant has  sufficiently proven his knowledge of and belief in the principles under-lying our Constitution  and  form  of  government.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the  decision  appealed  from  is  hereby affirmed,  with costs against  the petitioner-appellant.  So ordered.</p>
