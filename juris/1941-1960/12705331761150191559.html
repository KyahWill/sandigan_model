				G.R. Nos. L-1458 and L-1469, November 28, 1947</h4>
				<H3>ADELA VELASQUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. BONIFACIO YSIP, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, AND ELENA GONZALES, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>A petition for mandamus is filed in these two cases to compel the respondent 
Court of First Instance of Bulacan to give due course to petitioner's 
appeal.
<p>The records of the two cases Nos. 118 and 177 of the Court of First Instance 
of Bulacan were destroyed in the war of liberation of the Philippines and later 
reconstituted. Notice of the order declaring the cases duly reconstituted was 
served upon petitioner on January 17, 1947, and notice of the reconstituted 
decisions was served upon her on January 31, 1947. A motion to set aside the 
reconstituted decisions was filed by petitioner on February 22, 1947, upon the 
ground that the trial in the two cases had been held without previous notice 
upon her. The motion was denied and the notice of denial was served upon 
petitioner on April 7, 1947. Whereupon, petitioner filed her notice of appeal on 
April 9, 1947, and her record on appeal and appeal bond on April 12, 1947. On 
May 13, 1947, the respondent court dismissed the appeal upon the ground that it 
had been filed out of time since the period for appeal should be computed from 
the date petitioner was notified of the order declaring the cases duly 
reconstituted. This theory is made to rest on section 41, Act 3110 which is as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 41. All terms fixed by law or regulation shall cease to run from the 
date of the destruction of the records and shall only begin to run again on the 
date when the parties or their counsels shall receive from the clerk of the 
court notice to the effect that the records have been 
reconstituted."</p></blockquote>
<p>This provision has reference to those terms fixed by law which were already 
running when the destruction occurred. But the time to take an appeal in these 
two cases does not appear to have already started to run before the records were 
destroyed. No notice of the decisions upon petitioner prior to the destruction 
appears to have been reconstituted. It is, therefore, essential that such notice 
should be served anew (San Jose <i>vs</i>. De Venecia and Romero, p. 636, 
<i>ante</i>), and as a matter of fact, it was actually served on January 31, 
1947. From that date up to April 12, 1947, when appeal was perfected, deducting 
the time during which the motion to set aside was pending which was from 
February 22 to April 7, 1947, the thirty-day period for appeal has not 
expired.</p>
<p>Petition is granted and respondent Court of First Instance of Bulacan is 
ordered to give due course to the appeal taken by petitioner in these two cases. 
Without costs.</p><i>Feria, Pablo,</i> and <i>Bengzon, JJ.,</i> concur.
