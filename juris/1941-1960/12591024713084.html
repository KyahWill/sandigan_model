				<H3>HEIRS OF JUSTO MALFORE, APPLICANTS AND APPELLEES, VS. DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY,  OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  an appeal  taken by  the Director of Forestry from an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo (in Cadastral  Case No. 86)  denying his motion to  reserve a strip of land in Lot  No.  5316 claimed by the heirs of Justo  Malfore,  as  a permanent timberland,  pursuant to Section 90 of Commonwealth Act No.  141,  as amended by Republic Act No. 1273.</p>
<p>On January 20,  1947, Placida Malfore, acting in behalf of the heirs of Justo Malfore, filed  an answer in the above-mentioned  court and cadastral case, claiming ownership of a parcel of land (lot No.  5316)  located in Barrio Quipot, Janiuay, Iloilo.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1952,  the Director of Forestry, represented by the  Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo, filed an opposition to the said claim,  alleging that  a  portion of said land is within a timberland reserved by the Director of Forestry on September 17, 1932 and belongs to the public domain. On March 5, 1953, the court rendered a decision denying the claim of Malfore on the ground that they failed to prove their right of ownership to said land.</p>
<p>On August 23, 1953,  the claimants filed a  motion for reconsideration of said decision setting the same for hearing on August 29, 1953.   For reasons which do not appear in the records, said motion remained unacted upon  until on  November 18, 1955, or after  more than  2 years, the Director of Forestry, represented  by the  Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo, withdrew his  opposition to Malfore's claim and, instead, filed a motion asking the court to reserve a strip of  land, 40 meters  wide, along the  east  bank  of the Mapatag Creek in said Lot 5316,  for the protection of its banks, or  as  a  permanent timberland,  pursuant  to the provision of Section 90 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by Republic Act No. 1273,  which went into effect on June 14, 1955.</p>
<p>On November 23,  1955,  the Malfores filed an opposition to the said motion, claiming that  the aforecited provision of the statute is not applicable to  the land  in question, as the same is not public land but the private property of the claimants. On  the  same date,  the court rendered a decision, setting  aside  its  former  decision  of March 5, 1953, and adjudicating said Lot No. 5316 and ordering its registration in favor of the Malfores.</p>
<p>On December 3, 1955, the court issued an order denying the aforementioned motion dated November 18, 1955 of the Director of Forestry.  From this order, the  Director of Forestry appealed to the Court of Appeals, but said court, in its resolution of January 27,  1958, elevated the  case to this Court as  the only  question involved  in the appeal is one of law.</p>
<p>The only issue presented  in this appeal  is whether Section 90  of  Commonwealth Act  No. 141, as amended by Republic Act  No. 1273, is applicable only to  lands of the public domain  subsequently acquired  by a private person or entity through sales patent, lease,  or homestead under the said Act, or also  to those sought to  be registered as lands of private ownership under the provisions of the Cadastral Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> or  the Land Registration  Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Section 1 of Republic Act No. 1273, purports to amend Section  90 of Commonwealth  Act No. 141,  known as the Public Land Law.   As thus amended, said section reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 90. Every application <em>under the provisions of this Act</em> shall be made  under oath and shall  set  forth:</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(i)  That the applicant agrees that a strip forty  meters wide starting from the  bank an each side of any river or stream that may be found on  the land  applied  for,  shall  be  demarcated and preserved as permanent timberland to be planted exclusively to trees of known economic value, and that he shall not make  any  clearing thereon or  utilize  the same for ordinary farming purposes <em>even after the patent shall have  been issued  to him or a contract of lease shall have been  executed in his favor."</em>  (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the above-quoted provisions,  it is clear that Republic Act 1273 refers to lands covered  by "applications under the provisions of this Act" (Public Land Law); that the applicant shall <em>agree</em> to such reservation,  as a condition to the granting  of  his application; and that the condition is enforceable "even after the patent (sales,  homestead  or free)  shall have been issued to him  or a <em>contract of lease</em> shall have been executed  in  his favor."  All of these conditions can refer only to applicants for portion of a public domain.  Whatever right or title  the applicant acquires, he  obtains it from the government which  is entitled  to impose any condition.  In  the case at  bar, there is no application under  the Public Land  Law, but  a claim  of private  ownership  under the  Cadastral Act.   The court merely confirms  appellee's title to  the  land as against the whole world including the government.</p>
<p>Furthermore,  Section 2 of Commonwealth Act  141,  of which Republic Act 1273 became part, explicitly provides that its provisions "shall  apply to  the  lands  of  the public domain."  (See Garcia <em>vs</em>. Dinero, 45 Off. Gaz. [9th Supp.] 101, citing Lecaste <em>vs</em>. Director of Lands, 63 Phil., 654, and Lesada <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Omanan, 59 Phil., 547.) Since the land in question is, admittedly, private land  (and was so  claimed by appellee and adjudicated by the Court), and not land of the public domain,  it is quite obvious that the above-quoted provision  of Republic Act No.  1273  is inapplicable to it. (See Central Capiz <em>vs</em>. Ramirez, 40 Phil.,  883.)</p>
<p>In support of his argument that  the  provision of the statute quoted  above is  applicable  to private  lands, the oppositor-appellant, represented  by the  Solicitor General, cites Section 39 of the Land Registration Act as imposing a  similar  incumbrance  on  lands  of private  ownership registered  under the  Torrens  System.   The  cited  section provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  39. Every person receiving a  certificate of title  in  pursuance  of a  decree of registration, and  every subsequent purchaser of registered land who takes a certificate of title for value in  good faith shall  hold  the  same  free  of all  incumbrances  except  those noted  on said certificate,  and any of  the following incumbrances which may  be subsisting, namely:</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Third.  Any  public highway, way, private way established by law, or any  Government  irrigation canal or lateral thereof, where the certificate of title  does not state that  the boundaries  of  such highway,  way, or irrigation  canal  or  lateral thereof, have  been determined.</p>
  <p>"But if there were easements or  ether rights appurtenant  to a parcel of registered  land which for any reason  have failed to be registered, such easements  or  rights shall  remain so appurtenant notwithstanding such failure, and shall be held to pass with the land until cut off or extinguished by  the registration of the  servient estate, or in any other manner."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examination  of the  above-quoted  provision,  discloses nothing  which  can be constructed as divesting  a private property owner of a  portion of his land  located along a creek, for the purpose of reserving the same as a permanent timberland of the Government.   It has  been held that the title intended to be created by the Land Registration Act, is one which is not subject to any sort of restriction, limitation, or reduction, except those named in the certificate of registration and in the law itself, as having been preserved against the land.  (De Jesus <em>vs</em>. City of Manila, 29 Phil., 73, citing City of  Manila <em>vs</em>. Lack, 19 Phil., 324.)</p>
<p>It  is to be  observed that  the  only  servitude which a private property owner  is required to  recognize in favor of  the Government under  the aforequoted provision,  is the  easement  of  a  "public highway,  way, private way established  by law,  or any government canal or lateral thereof," where the certificate of title does not state that the boundaries thereof have been  determined.  But, even . in  these cases, it is necessary that the easement should have been previously "established  by law," which  implies that  the same should have been  pre-existing  at the time of the registration of the land in order that the registered owner may be compelled to respect it.  Where the easement is  not per-existing  and  is  sought to  be imposed  after the land has been registered under the  Land Registration Act,  proper  expropriation proceedings should be had, and just  compensation paid to the registered  owner thereof. For,  it is elementary that public  use may not be imposed on private property without proper expropriation proceedings  and payment of just compensation made to the owner. (Sec. 1  [2],  Art III, Constitution;  Rule  69,  Rules  of Court.)</p>
<p>It  is our conclusion, therefore,  that Section 90 of Commonwealth Act No.  141, as amended by  Republic Act 1273, is  applicable only to lands of the public domain subsequently acquired by a private person or  entity through any of the modes  provided under said Act, and not to those sought to be registered as lands of private ownership under the provisions of the Cadastral Law or the Land Registration  Act.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  finding no  error in the decision  appealed from, the same is  hereby  affirmed. So ordered,  without costs.</p>
