</style><div align="justify">In December 1948 the Siari Valley Estate Inc., a duly organized agricultural 
corporation, filed an action to recover about 200 head of cattle that were 
driven, or wandered, from its pasture lands into the adjoining ranch of 
defendant Filemon Lucasan, Sindangan, Zamboanga, Plaintiff asked for the return 
of its animals with their offspring, or for payment of those disposed of by 
defendant, plus damages.
<p>In his answer, the defendant denied having appropriated or retained any 
cattle belonging to the corporation. On the contrary, alleging that plaintiff 
had taken away from his pasture 105 head of cattle thru force and intimidation, 
he demanded suitable compensation.</p>
<p>The complaint was afterwards amended and re-amended -after several months' 
interval, and after investigations by plaintiff- so as to allege that defendant 
took or retained about 740 head of plaintiff's animals- Accordingly the 
defendant reformed his answers to the amended complaints. Several motions and 
petitions were submitted, trial was held, and on June 30, 1952 the Hon. Patricio 
Ceniza, Judge, rendered judgment the dispositive part of which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, adjudicating to the Siari 
"Valley Estate all the cattle that may be found in the cattle ranch of Filemon 
Lucasan, specially the 321 heads that had been entrusted to his care as receiver 
or trustee of this Court and ordering the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff 
all said cattle or their value mounting, to P40,000.00, to pay damages to the 
Siari Valley Estate for the 400 heads of cattle that he sold since 1946 up to 
the date of the trial at the rate of P100.00 per head or P40,000.00 plus 
interest at the rate of 6% from the date of the trial of this case in January, 
1951 and to pay the costs of the proceeding. x x x</p>
<p>With regard to the contempt proceedings, Filemon Lucasan is hereby found 
guilty of the charges and he is hereby sentenced to pay a fine of P500.00 
pursuant to Section 6, Rule 64, of the Rules of Court or suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency at the rate of one day for every 2.50 that he 
fails to pay."</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain the last paragraph it should be stated that after the defendant 
had answered the complaint, the court on motion of plaintiff, ordered on 
December 13, 1950 an inspection of Lucasan's ranch and the rounding up of 
plaintiff's livestock allegedly roaming there. The order said that such 
livestock shall be kept in an enclosure in defendant's ranch. The order was 
later supplemented by a directive turning over to defendant Lucasan, as trustee 
of the court, all the impounded cattle (about 321), which, plaintiff claimed, 
were its own.</p>
<p>However the court afterwards found that Lucasan, violating his duties as 
trustee, disposed of several head of such cattle; and fined him for contempt, as 
above related.</p>
<p>From the decision the defendant appealed in due time. His brief assigns 
several errors raising issues which may be boiled down to whether plaintiff's 
cattle were commingled with defendant's and whether the commixtion was made in 
bad faith. A third issue is whether he disposed of cattle in his custody as 
trustee.</p>
<p>The evidence of record sufficiently shows the following relevant facts:</p>
<p>The Siari Valley Estate Inc. started raising livestock on its 950-hectare 
ranch, in 1921, with 7 native cattle. In 1923 it acquired 30 native cattle and 
two Indian bulls. It also introduced native stock into its herd thru a native 
black bull. Male offspring of this bull were castrated.</p>
<p>Prior to the Japanese occupation, the fence enclosing plaintiff's pasture was 
well kept. However in 1943 a portion thereof was destroyed, with the result that 
some cattle strayed into the adjoining unfenced range of defendant Lucasan. And 
taking advantage of the situation several men in the employ of defendant 
willfully and deliverately rounded up and drove many animals from the Siari 
pasture towards Lucasan's grazing land. This was. testified to by Jesus Pandi, 
farmer, who declared that during the war he saw the men of defendant, namely, 
Angel Galimon,- Francisco Ramos and Bilingan Subane driving cattle (30 head) 
from the Siari Valley Estate to his ranch. The testimony of this witness remains 
uncontradicted. During the trial Galimon, Ramos and Bilingan were available; but 
they were not placed on the witness stand by defendant to contradict Pandi's 
assertions.</p>
<p>Eriberto Garrovillo, foreman of the company, swore that in 1944, defendant 
informed plaintiff that some of the latter's cattle were mixed with his cows. 
With due permission they (he and plaintiff's men) were allowed to catch eight 
(8) head of the Siari Valley Estate cattle in the toril of defendant. Lucasan 
also informed this witness that there were still about <u>200 head</u> of the 
company's cattle, in his ranch mixed with his herd.</p>
<p>John H. Roemer, president of the Siari Valley Estate, Inc., testified that 
sometime in October, 1946, in one of his afternoon visits to Roemerâ€™s family 
-Lucasan and Roemer being good friends- Lucasan informed Roemer that the company 
had at least 250 head of cattle in his pasture land; that he and Lucasan came to 
an agreement permitting the former to round up and drive plaintiff's cattle. 
However, on the date set for the drive Lucasan's wife protested, and thereafter 
defendant refused to admit that there were 250 head of Siari Valley Estate 
cattle in his ranch. H. C. Smith, director of the company, corroborated Roemer's 
testimony. It may be added that Roemer saw two sons of defendant (Rafael and 
Vicente) driving some of plaintiff's cattle into defendant's ranch.</p>
<p>Francisco Martinez testified that in 1946, a Red Cross Committee, of' which 
he was a member, requested John H. Roemer to contribute to the fund, Roemer 
offered to give at least 30 head of cattle provided the committee would make 
arrangements with Filemon Lucasan to permit him to get plaintiff's cattle inside 
defendant's <u>toril</u>. The help of Fiscal Ubay was sought by the Red Cross; 
he negotiated with Lucasan, the latter agreed; Roemer and his men were able to 
round up 78 head of cattle during the first day of the drive, but said cattle 
were turned loose the next morning by defendant and his wife.</p>
<p>At this juncture it must be related that during the Japanese occupation, the 
company's officers being American had to flee to the interior for personal 
safety. As a result the management and supervision of the ranch was practically 
abandoned.</p>
<p>The defendant, admitted that some cattle of the Siari Valley Estate did enter 
his ranch. He says however that thru the good offices of Fiscal Ubay the company 
rounded up and drove away from his ranch 98 head of cattle in November 1946; and 
that in May 1947 plaintiff's herdsmen took away 5 more head of cattle. He 
affirmed that as of December 1951 he had 400 head on his ranch all belonging to 
him, after deducting 200 head which he had disposed of.</p>
<p>After going thru the record, we have no doubt that hundreds of cattle 
belonging to plaintiff have been driven, into or wandered into defendant's land. 
Defendant himself admitted such commixtion although, he says, plaintiff had 
already retrieved its animals.</p>
<p>However, the following computation is quite conclusive against him:</p>
<p>Lucasan started raising his own cattle in 1939 with 53 head of cattle he 
received as his share from his partners R. Macias and Teck Lee. (432-433 s. n.)) 
A 30% increase per year (that is what Dr. Geronimo said) should give him around 
417 head of cattle in 1951. Yet in 1951 he had 400 head, after disposing of 230 
head according to <u>his</u> evidence, or "less than 800" (which means 700 at 
least) according to his answer (at p. 115 Record on Appeal.) Where did he get 
<u>the excess</u> of 200 or 700? According to Dr. Pacifico Geronimo, defendant 
sold 200 head in Ozamis City; and there is evidence that he marketed cattle in 
Sindangan, Dipolog and other parts of Zamboanga.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Report of the Siari Valley for September 1941 to 
September 1945 showed that the company had or should have 1768 head of cattle, 
249 of which was slaughtered or died, leaving a total of 1513 head. Thereafter 
it sold 593 head; therefore it should have 925 head. Actually it could count 
only 102 head. Therefore <u>it lost</u> 823 head. Now then, is it far-fetched to 
conclude -as the lower court concluded- that these were part of the 700 which 
was disposed of by Lucasan, and a part is the remaining flock in his 
possession<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>?</p>
<p>No actual evidence exists that <u>all these</u> missing animals (323) were 
taken by defendant or his men; but in view of the proof that his men on two 
occasions drove away more than 30 head of cattle, it is not erroneous to believe 
that the others must have also been driven away on subsequent or prior 
occasions, applying, by analogy, the principle that one who stole a part of the 
stolen money must have taken <u>also the larger sum</u> lost by the offended 
party. (P. v. Fernandez, 58 Phil. 674; P. v. Buada, 60 Phil. 363.)</p>
<p>In fact George Puth, Plantation Manager, testified that before July 27, 1951, 
he saw from his plane 700 head of plaintiff's cattle on the ranch of the 
defendant-appellant. Now, as there are only 321 cattle impounded, the conclusion 
flows that defendant disposed of about 400 head of plaintiff's cattle. And this 
testimony was obviously the main basis of the trial court's adjudication.</p>
<p>Another thing, Of the heard now kept by defendant, 322 head were impounded 
for purposes of inspection and identification. Two out of three, experts found 
the great majority to be mestizos, (Indian or Nellore) an average of about 29 
<u>only</u> being natives. This is significant, because defendant's flock could 
have mestizos, all his original stock <u>being entirely native</u>. It is true 
that he declared his partners "Macias and Te Teck Lee furnished him with 41 head 
of cattle - one of which was an Indian bull, and another Australian. But he was 
contradicted by Tee Teck Lee who asserted that the cattle delivered to Lucasan 
were all of native stock.</p>
<p>On course it is quite possible that some of these mestizos are the result of 
the intermingling which began in 1943 and continued up to 1951. Although 
generally, offspring or the increase of domestic animals belongs to the owner of 
the dam by accretion, (U.S. v. Caballero, 25 Phil. 356) In re Ebdon 98 N.Y.S. 
2d. 697, it is impossible to trace such ownership of these mestizos under the 
circumstances. Yet as the trial judge said "Filemon had been actuated by bad 
faith in retaining in his ranch, to multiply and increased there for his own 
benefit, the cattle belonging to the Siari Valley Estate" and under the Civil 
Code "if the commingling of two things is made in bad faith, the one responsible 
for it will lose his share x x x". (Art. 382; See Art. 473 New Civil Code.)</p>
<p>The same principle obtains in the United States where parallel situations 
have arisen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where the goods are so mingled that they cannot thereafter properly be 
identified or divided, all the inconvenience or loss resulting from the 
confusion is thrown on the party who occasioned it; and, generally, it is for 
him to distinguish his own property or lose it, it being held, in this 
connection, that the rule of confusion of goods is merely a rule of evidence." 
(15 C.J.S. 963-964.)</p>
<p>"Where one fraudulently, willfully, or wrongly intermingles his goods with 
those of another, so that there is no evidence to distinguish the goods of the 
one from those of the other, the wrongdoer forfeits all his interest in the 
mixture to the other part. In other words, he cannot recover for his own 
proportion, or for any part of the intermixture, but the entire property vests 
in him whose right is invaded." (15 C.J.S, 961.)</p>
<p>"Thus where one wilfully places his brand on another's cattle, intermingling 
them with his own and on account of the change or destruction of the identity of 
the goods he is unable to distinguish and separate his own goods from the 
others, he will be held to forteit his own." (Johnson vs. Rocker et al., Tex 
City A 39 S. W. 406.) (See also Hagan et al. v. Casper, 292 Pac. Rep. 
1020.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Did defendant act in bad faith? The circumstances disclosed in this record 
answer the question in the affirmative: his cowboys -and even his sons Rafael 
and Vicente- rounded up and drove plaintiff's cattle into his pasture; he knew 
he had plaintiff's cattle, but refused to return them despite demands by 
plaintiff; he even threatened plaintiff's men when the latter tried to retrieve 
its animals; he harassed them with false prosecutions for their attempts to get 
back the company's animals; he wouldn't allow plaintiff' s cowboys to get into 
his pasture to identify its flock; he rebranded several Siari Valley cattle with 
his own brand; he sold cattle without registering the sales; after some cattle 
impounded were entrusted to his custody as trustee, he disposed of not less than 
5 head of cattle among those he received as such trustee; lastly, he disposed of 
much more cattle than he had a right to.</p>
<p>There are several incidents which we do not think it necessary to describe in 
detail. Some are irrelevant; others are of minor importance. On the whole, we 
are satisfied that the appealed decision substantially accords with the facts 
and the law.</p>
<p>Therefore it is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant, So 
ordered,,</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<hr align="left" width="70%">

<p><span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> The case by its very nature does not 
admit of exact mathematical figures. Calculations have to be mere approximation. 
Fortunately, as the issues have developed, it is unnecessary to consider 
differences of five or ten head of cattle.</p></div>
