				<H3>ALFREDO MIRANDA, THROUGH PATRICIO D. SENADOR, AS GUARDIAN AD LITEM, PETITIONER, VS. DAVID GUANZON ET AL., AND COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by way of certiorari from an order of the 
Court of Appeals dated June 11, 1951, denying the motion filed by appellee in 
CA-G. R. No. 7813-R wherein it is prayed that the appeal interposed by appellant 
in :said case be dismissed on the ground that the same was not perfected within 
the reglementary period.
<p align="justify">On March 8, 1951, the Court of First Instance of Manila 
rendered judgment in favor of Alfredo Miranda, now petitioner, against David 
Guanzon, now respondent, In civil case No. 8465, copy of which judgment was 
received by respondent on March 17, 1951;</p>
<p align="justify">On April 5, 1951, nineteen days from receipt of copy of said 
judgment, respondent filed a notice of appeal and a cash appeal bond as well as 
a record on appeal; </p>
<p align="justify">On April 7, 1951, the court entered an order approving the 
record on appeal and directed the clerk of court to forward it to the Court of 
Appeals together with all, the corresponding evidence;</p>
<p align="justify">On June 9, 1951, petitioner filed in the Court of Appeals a 
motion to dismiss the appeal alleging among other grounds that respondent failed 
to perfect his appeal within the period prescribed by section 17, Rule 41 of the 
Rules of Court; </p>
<p align="justify">On June 12, 1951, respondent filed an opposition claiming that 
the appeal has been perfected in due time because the case does not come within 
the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act. He also claims that petitioner 
has already waived his right to object to the appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">On June 11, 1951, the Court of Appeals entered a resolution of 
the following tenor: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"28. Acting on the motion filed by counsel for 
plaintiff-appellee in case CA G.R. No. 7813R, Alfredo Miranda etc. vs. David 
Guanzon et al., praying on the grounds therein stated for the dismissal of 
appellant's appeal and the opposition thereto of the appellant; and it appearing 
that plaintiff-appellee failed to object to the approval of appellant's record 
on appeal in the lower court and that appellee's motion was filed after 
appellant's record on appeal had been already printed for which reason dismissal 
of the case at this stage of the proceedings is prejudicial to appellant; and 
considering that the failure of the appellee to raise in the lower court the 
question as to whether appellant perfected his own appeal within the 
reglementary period is a waiver of his right to invoke the same question in this 
court for the first time; motion denied."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On July 12, 1951, petitioner filed a motion for 
reconsideration, which was denied. Hence this petition for certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify">As may be gleaned from the disputed resolution, the Court of 
Appeals denied the motion to dismiss for the reason that appellee failed to 
object to the approval of appellant's record on appeal in the lower court for he 
sought of doing so only after said record on appeal had been printed and 
certified, which dismissal, it is claimed, is prejudicial to appellant, and for 
the further reason that the failure of appellee to object to the appeal in the 
lower court is a waiver of his right to invoke the same question in the Court of 
Appeals for the first time. Petitioner now contends that the Court of Appeals 
erred in not granting his motion to dismiss the appeal because the failure of 
respondent to file his record on appeal within the reglementary period is 
mandatory and cannot be waived as it affects the jurisdiction of the lower 
court. </p>
<p align="justify">It appears that the case filed by petitioner against respondent 
in the Court of First Instance of Manila, docketed as civil case No. 8465, is 
one which conies within the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as may be 
gleaned from the averments of the complaint and the findings made by the lower 
court. Section 17, Rule 41 of the Rules provides that the appeal in a workmen's 
compensation case shall be perfected in the manner provided by the rules in 
ordinary cases, but within fifteen days, and that, instead of the record on 
appeal, the original record of the case shall be transmitted to the appellate 
court. In this case what respondent did was to perfect his appeal like in an 
ordinary case, namely, he submitted a record on appeal, instead of merely 
requesting the court to elevate the original record, but instead of filing his 
notice of appeal within fifteen days, as required by section 17, Rule 41, he did 
so after 19 days from the receipt of the decision. Undoubtedly the filing of a 
record on appeal in this case is not necessary inasmuch as the original record 
of the case is the one to be transmitted to the appellate court. Be it as it 
may, the fact remains that the appeal was perfected out of time and such failure 
takes the case out of the jurisdiction of the court. This can clearly be 
inferred from section 13, Rule 41, which provides that when the appeal is not 
perfected within the reglementary period the appeal shall be dismissed. </p>
<p align="justify">The claim that the motion to dismiss the appeal filed by 
petitioner in the Court of Appeals comes too late while his failure to file it 
in the court of origin before the transmittal of the record to the appellate 
court constitutes a waiver on his part to interpose such objection, is in our 
opinion untenable. The requirement regarding the perfection of an appeal within 
the reglementary period is not only mandatory but jurisdictional. Such failure 
has the effect of rendering final the judgment of the court, and the 
certification of the record on appeal thereafter cannot restore the 
jurisdiction which has been lost. This dismissal can be effected even after the 
case has been elevated to the Court of Appeals (section 1 [<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>], Rule 52). </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Failure to perfect the appeal, within the time prescribed by 
the rules of court, will cause the judgment to become final, and the 
certification of the record on appeal thereafter, cannot restore the 
jurisdiction which has been lost. (Roman Catholic Bishop of Tuguegarao vs. 
Director of Lands, 34 Phil., 623; Estate of Cordoba and Zarate vs. Alabado, 34 
Phil., 920; and Bermudez vs. Director of Lands, 3G Phil., 774.) </p>
<p align="justify">"The period within which the record on appeal and appeal bond 
should be perfected and filed may, however, be extended by order of the court, 
upon application made, prior to the expiration of the original period. (Layda 
vs. Legaspi, 39 Phil., 83.) </p>
<p align="justify">"Rules of courts, promulgated by authority of law, have the 
force and effect of law; and rules of court prescribing the time within which 
certain acts must be done, or certain proceedings taken, are considered 
absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless delays and to the orderly 
and speedy discharge of judicial business. (Shioji vs. Harvey, 43 Phil., 
333.)</p>
<p align="justify">"Strict compliance with the rules of court has been held 
mandatory and imperative, so that failure to pay the docket fee in the Supreme 
Court, within the period fixed for that purpose, will cause the dismissal of the 
appeal. (Salaveria vs. Aibindo, 39 Phil., 922.) In the same manner, on failure 
of the appellant in a civil case to serve his brief, within the time prescribed 
by said rules, on motion of the appellee and notice to the appellant, or on its 
own motion, the court may dismiss the appeal (Shioji vs. Harvey, 43 Phil., 333). 
(Alvero vs. De la Rosa, 42 Off. Gaz., No. 12, pp. 3161, 3165-3166). </p>
<p align="justify">"The judgments entered in the land registration cases having 
become final, the court below did not commit a grave abuse of discretion in 
ordering the issuance of the decrees based upon such final judgments. The 
failure of the petitioner to file the appeal bond within the reglementary 
period was fatal. Even if the court below should have allowed him to amend his 
record on appeal to include certain matters omitted or left out, the period for 
the filing of the appeal bond would not have been extended because the extension 
granted to amend a record on appeal did not carry with it the extension of the 
reglementary period for the filing of the appeal bond." (Salva, vs. Palacio, 90 
Phil., 731.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The cases of Slade Perkins vs. Perkins, 57 Phil. 223, and 
Luengo and Martinez vs. Herrero, 17 Phil., 29, invoked by respondent, are not in 
point. The objections which were deemed waived in those cases refer to questions 
which do not affect the jurisdiction of the court and as such they cannot be 
invoked as a precedent in the determination of this case. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the resolution of the Court of Appeals entered on 
June 11, 1951, is set aside. The appeal interposed by respondent is dismissed, 
without pronouncement as to costs. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and
