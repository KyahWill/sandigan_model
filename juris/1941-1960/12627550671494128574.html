				<H3>JOSEFA AGUSTINES, ENCARNACION AGUSTINES, JOSE AGUSTINES, LOURDES, ESTELA AGUSTINES, AND ABELARDO AGUSTINES, PETITIONER, VS. THE JUDGE OF COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, SEVERO VALENZUELA, AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF MANILA, REPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A nine-hectare land in Marilao, Bulacan, is the subject of a three-cornered 
dispute between Severo Valenzuela on one side and the relatives of his deceased 
wife Generosa Agustines on the other, with the Archbishop of Manila as 
intervenor. 
<p>The main facts are unquestioned: </p>
<p>In August, 1934, Generosa Agustines died leaving a will which was 
subsequently submitted for probate in the court of first instance of Bulacan in 
special proceedings No. 4944. Having no children, she named her surviving 
husband Severo Valenzuela the universal heir, but she specified some bequests. 
There was opposition to the approval of the will; however, after some 
negotiations, the sister (Josefa) and the nephews and nieces of the decedent 
(the other petitioners in this special civil action) executed on February 8, 
1935, an extrajudicial partition with the respondent Severo Valenzuela, 
expressing conformity with the probate of the testament and dividing the 
properties of the deceased. They promised specifically to respect the wishes of 
the testatrix, one of which was this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sexto - Encargo a mi marido que, después de que haya percibido todos los 
bienes recayentes en mi herencia done * * * a la </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iglesia Católica de Polo otra porcion que no exceda de nueve hectareas, a 
discrecion también de mi marido, del mismo terreno palayero e inculto, en el 
sitio de Quiririt, para que su producto se invierta en misas en sufragio de mi 
alma." </p></blockquote>
<p>Giving effect to the above direction, the extrajudicial partition stipulated 
that, "Quinta base. Que el solicitante de este expediente Sr. Severo Valenzuela, 
instituido heredero universal en el testamento obrante en autos y marcado como 
Exhibit "A," por su parte renuncia a favor de los opositores, todo derecho que 
tenga o pudiera tener en la parcela de terreno, descrito y deslindado en el 
inventario de los bienes propios de la finada y designado con el numero cuatro 
(4) de dicho inventario, con excepción de, y después de descontar aquella 
porción de nueve (9) hectáreas, cuyo producto, la finada ha destinado, para 
misas en sufragio de su alma, a discreción de su esposo, Sr. Severo Valenzuela, 
por disposición testamentaria y otros tres hectareas más, de esta misma parcela 
de terreno que se adjudican y serán para el Sr. Severo Valenzuela. 
Entendiéndose, que en la segregación de estos 12 hectáreas, 9 de los cuales cuyo 
producto se destina en sufragio del alma de la finada y los otros tres hectáreas 
que perteneceran al Sr. Severo Valenzuela deben colindarse con, estar muy 
contiguos, a la pesquera designada y descrita en el inventario de los bienes 
propios de la finada, e indicadas con el número tres (3)."</p>
<p>Other items of the estate were apportioned among the signers of the deed of 
partition, which, submitted for approval, was confirmed by the probate court on 
October 31, 1936, in an order directing the administrator to deliver the 
respective shares to the heirs or legatees after paying the corresponding 
inheritance taxes. No appeal was ever taken from such order. </p>
<p>Years passed. Severo Valenzuela failed to transmit the lot or part thereof to 
the parish church of Polo or to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila. 
Wherefore, in May, 1944, the Agustines connections, petitioners herein, filed a 
complaint against Severo Valenzuela (civil case No. 153) seeking the return to 
them of that nine-hectare lot in Quiririt, alleging his breach of trust, plus 
renunciation on the part of the church of Polo that had reportedly neglected to 
demand compliance with the beneficial legacy. </p>
<p>Advised of this move, the surviving husband Severo Valenzuela hastened to 
submit in September, 1944, in the testamentary proceeding No. 4944, a motion in 
which he represented that under the will he had discretion to determine the area 
of land to be conveyed to the Polo church and that, exercising such discretion, 
he elected to assign that tract actually cultivated by the tenant named Benito 
Salazar in Quiririt (admittedly one hectare more or less). He asked that this 
assignment be declared full compliance with the testamentary directions. The 
other parties to the testamentary proceeding were not given notice of this 
petition. It was approved on December 2, 1944. </p>
<p>After the liberation and after they had become aware of Valenzuela's act that 
tended to frustrate their civil action No. 158, the petitioners herein submitted 
motions for reconsideration, the main theme of which was that the said last 
order amended the decree of distribution of October 31, 1936, which had become 
final long ago. All was to no avail. Hence they started this special civil 
action to annul the order of December 2, 1944, on the concrete proposition that 
the court had no jurisdiction to issue it, the order of October 31, 1936, having 
become final and executory eight years before. They contend, first, that under 
the will, and in accordance with the partition approved by the court in 1936, 
the Polo church was entitled to nine hectares in the Quiririt farm of Generosa. 
They argue next that when that Church repudiated the nine-hectare lot, it again 
became a part of the whole Quiririt property which, under the partition, had 
been adjudicated to them. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Severo Valenzuela's position is that the whole 
nine-hectare realty was awarded to him, subject to his obligation to donate to 
the Polo church such portion thereof as he may designate in <em>his 
discretion</em>. </p>
<p>The intervenor, the Archbishop of Manila, representing the Polo church, 
shares the petitioner's opinion that a nine-hectare lot had been granted to said 
church. He maintains, however, that no voluntary renunciation of the legacy ever 
took place. </p>
<p>The questions at issue are these: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a) What was the share of the church of Polo under the will and the 
extrajudicial partition? </p>
<p>"(b) If it was a nine-hectare piece, is the order of December 2, 1944 in 
Special Proceeding No. 4944 valid? </p>
<p>"(c) If invalid, is certiorari the proper remedy? </p></blockquote>
<ol type="I"><li>It will be recalled that the will of Generosa Agustines contained a 
provision directing her husband to donate a portion of her Quiririt farm not 
exceeding nine hectares to the Polo church. 
<p></p>
<p>It will also be recalled that the extrajudicial partition, containing the 
promise of all parties to respect all her testamentary directions, provided that 
all the land in Quiririt belonging to Generosa would be adjudicated to the 
herein petitioners excepting "con excepción de, y después de descontar aquella 
porción de nueve (9) hectáres, cuyo producto, la finada ha destinado, para misas 
en sufragio de su alma, a discreción de su esposo, Sr. Severo Valenzuela, por 
disposición testamentaria y otros tres hectareas mas, de esta misma parcela de 
terreno que se adjudican y serán para el Sr. Severo Valenzuela. Entendiéndose, 
que en la segregación de estos 12 hectáreas, 9 de los cuales cuyo producto se 
destina en sufragio del alma de la finada y los otros tres hectáreas que 
pertenecerán al Sr. Severo Valenzuela deben colindarse con, estar muy contiguos, 
a la pesquera designada y descrita en el inventario de los bienes propios de la 
finada, e indicadas con el número tres (3)" </p>
<p>After examining and analyzing the circumstances of this litigation, we reach 
the conclusion that, as contended by petitioners and the intervenor, the 
extrajudicial partition definitely allotted a nine-hectare parcel to the Polo 
church. Supposing, that under the will Valenzuela's discretion included the 
determination of the area to be transferred — and not merely the selection of 
the site where the nine-hectare portion is to be segregated — still it seems 
clear that in the partition he elected or agreed that a nine-hectare portion 
shall be conveyed to the Polo church for masses. </p>
<p>While it is true, as pointed out by Valenzuela's counsel, that in the 
paragraph here inabove quoted from the extra-judicial partition the phrase "a 
discreción de su esposo" appears, still it must be admitted that it could not 
have implied a future choice by such husband, because immediately thereafter the 
document speaks of nine hectares, "cuyo producto <em>se destina</em> en sufragio 
del alma de la finada" without any discretionary reservations. It is obvious 
that "a discreción de su esposo" meant "segun discreción que hoy ejercita su 
esposo". It might also have referred to the particular location of the parcel to 
be separated. </p>
<p>It is markworthy that, <em>in addition</em> to the nine-hectare portion, the 
deed mentions another parcel of three hectares exclusively given to Valenzuela. 
If the parties had not contemplated a nine-hectare donation to the Polo church, 
but empowered Valenzuela to fix the area subsequently, they would have assigned 
to him 12 hectares, with the provision that he will separate therefrom such 
portion as he may desire to convey to the parish of Polo. They did not say so. 
Instead they clearly stipulated that nine hectares were destined for "misas" (to 
the Church), and that three hectares would be reserved for him. </p>
<p>It is quite probable that if Generosa's kin had known, in the course of 
bargaining, that Valenzuela would not deliver all the nine hectares to the Polo 
church but would retain eight hectares thereof, they would not have ceded to him 
an additional lot of three hectares. </p>
<p>Proof positive that he had no choice as to the number of hectares is the fact 
that for eight years he never exercised it, keeping for himself in breach of 
trust the fruits of <em>all the land</em>. He might have ideas repugnant to the 
religious beliefs of his wife in regard to the celebration of masses for the 
dead. But as a man of honor, as the surviving partner, he had no excuse to set 
his own notions against those of his departed spouse, especially on a subject 
that concerned the disposition of her own properties. The will of the testatrix 
is law<span class="style1"><sup>1</sup></span>. And his action in fixing 
<em>one</em> hectare, when his wife bequeathed a portion <em>not exceeding nine 
hectares</em> is surely such abuse of discretion (if he had any) that will not 
easily commend itself to judicial approbation. </p>
<p>To make ourselves clear, we must state at the risk of repetition that 
although under the provisions of the will Severo Valenzuela might have elected 
to transfer to the Polo church a portion less than nine hectares, however, in 
the deed of partition he agreed — exercising his discretion — to assign nine 
hectares for masses (to the Polo church). It must be emphasized that in the 
distribution of the decedent's assets, we must face the deed of partition which 
bears the courtfs fiat. The last will becomes secondary in value. Important to 
bear this distinction in mind, because both in Valenzuela's motion and in the 
courtfs order approving the assignment of one hectare, only the will was quoted, 
and not the extrajudicial partition. Valenzuela's motion invoking the will 
exclusively induced the court into error. </p>
<p>A third reason to hold that the document of partition deeded nine hectares to 
the Polo church is the fact that the court and the parties considered it a final 
settlement of all the rights of all concerned, the court approving it in toto 
and ordering the administrator to deliver to the beneficiaries their respective 
portions or legacies. The court's order even wrote finis to the 
<em>expediente</em>. And the parties, including Severo Valenzuela regarded it as 
final for eight years, until he found it necessary, for his own interests, to 
make another move indirectly amending the final settlement of October, 1936. Now 
then, if that partition avowedly settled the estate and accomplished its 
distribution, the implication is unavoidable that it left nothing to future 
judicial action or determination. Consequently it did not contemplate any 
subsequent fixing by Valenzuela, and approval by the court, of the portion to be 
transmitted to the Church of Polo. The parties deemed it final — because the 
rights of all beneficiaries were therein defined with certainty. Therefore, the 
attempt by the surviving husband to modify it eight years thereafter was 
completely beyond the pale of the law. </p>
<p>This should be the logical place to discuss the effects of the nondelivery of 
the landed legacy for so many years. But in the interest of orderly procedure 
that matter should be left open to debate and decision in Civil Case No. 158 of 
the court of first instance of Bulacan. </p>
</li><li>Having found in the preceding exposition that under the partition the Polo 
church (or the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila) was entitled to a 
nine-hectare lot, the conclusion becomes inevitable that the order of December 
2, 1944, attempted to modify the final order of October, 1936. Which of course 
may not be done in this jurisdiction. 
<p></p><br>
</li><li>And certiorari may be interposed and granted under the circumstances, the 
order of December 2, 1944, being an absolute nullity.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> </li></ol>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the Bulacan court of December 2, 1944 is declared 
null and void and of no effect whatsoever. <br></p><p>Petition granted with

<p><strong>PERPECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Petitioners pray for the annulment of the order of respondent court issued on 
December 2, 1944, in special proceedings No. 4944, concerning the estate of the 
deceased Generosa Agustines. </p>
<p>On February 8, 1935, an extra-judicial agreement of distribution of the 
estate was executed and the same was duly approved on October 31, 1936. The 
order of approval adjudicates to the heirs their respective shares and directs 
the administrator to make delivery of said shares within ten days. </p>
<p>On November 1, 1943, petitioners commenced civil case No. 158, seeking to 
recover from the executor Severo Valenzuela, husband of the testatrix, 9 
hectares of land. </p>
<p>On September 7, 1944, Severo Valenzuela filed a motion in the testate 
proceedings, asking authority to assign and deliver to the Roman Catholic 
Archbishop of Manila, in full payment of its rights under the will of Genoresa 
Agustines, a definite parcel of land of one hectare. On December 2, 1944, the 
lower court Issued an order granting the authority prayed for. </p>
<p>Petitioners gained knowledge of the order on December 6, 1944, and they filed 
a motion to vacate the order. The motion was denied on October 5, 1945. </p>
<p>Motion for reconsideration was filed on October 10, 1945. It was denied by 
resolution dated May 20, 1946. </p>
<p>Petitioners impugn the jurisdiction of the lower court to issue the order of 
December 2, 1944, alleging that the agreement of distribution approved on 
October 31, 1936, has become final and that it fixed at 9 hectares the land 
adjudicated to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila. </p>
<p>Respondent Valenzuela alleges that he had discretion to fix the area of the 
land bequeathed under paragraph (6):. of the will which reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEXTO.- Encargo a mi marido que, después de que haya percibido todos los 
bienes recayentes en mi herencia, done....a la Iglesia Católica de Polo otra 
porción que no exceda de nueve hectáreas, a discreción tambien de mi marido, del 
mismo terreno palayero inculto, en el sitio de Quiririt, para que su producto se 
invierta en misas en sufragio de mi alma * * *" </p></blockquote>
<p>The pertinent portion of the extra-judicial agreement is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"QUINTA BASE. Que el solicitante de este expediente Sr. Severo Valenzuela, 
instituido heredero universal en el testamento obrante en autos y marcado como 
Exhibit "A", por su parte renuncia a favor de los opositores, todo derecho que 
tenga o pudiera tener en la parcela de terreno, descrito y deslindado en el 
inventario de los bienes proprlos de la finada y designado con el número cuatro 
(4) de dicho inventario, con excepcion de, y despues de descontar aquella 
porción de nueve (9) hectareas, cuyo producto, la finada has destinado, para 
misas en sufragio de su alma, a discreción de su esposo, Sr. Severo Valenzuela, 
por disposicion testamentaria y otros tres hectáreas más, de esta misma parcela 
de terreno que se adjudican y seran para el Sr. Severo Valenzuela. 
Entendiéndose, que en la segregacion de estos 12 hectáreas, 9 de los cuales cuyo 
producto se destina en sufragio del alma de la finada y los otros tres hectáreas 
que perteneceran al Sr. Severo Valenzuela deban colindarse con, o, estar muy 
contiguos, a la pesquera designada y descrita en el inventario de los bienes 
propios de la finada, e indicadas con el numero tres (3); y el resto pasara a 
ser de la exclusiva propiedad, la primera mitad sera de la Sra. Josefa Agustines 
y la otra mitad, hacia al Norte, será de los hermanos Encarnación Agustines, Dr. 
José Agustines, Lourdes Agustines, Estela Agustines y Abelardo Agustines; y para 
la Sra. Asuncion Agustines se entiende adjudicada a su favor la cuarta parte del 
solar y casa descrita y deslindada en el inventario de los bienes propios de la 
finada, e indicada como el numero dos (2), en el mencionado inventario y aquella 
otra cuarta parte del solar y el camarín ruínoso, también descrito y deslindado 
en el referido inventario, como bienes propios, de la finada y marcado como el 
número uno (1), en el mencionado inventario." </p></blockquote>
<p>Under the terms of the will and of the extrajudicial agreement of 
distribution, there should not be any doubt that, until Severo Valenzuela had 
decided to fix the area of the land in question at one hectare in his motion 
dated September 7, 1944, he had discretion to determine said area. </p>
<p>The will instructs him to donate a parcel of land to the Catholic Church of 
Polo. </p>
<p>According to Article 618 of the Civil Code, "a donation Is an act of 
liberality by which a person disposes gratuitously of a thing in favor of 
another who accepts it." As no one can be compelled to perform an act of 
liberality, it is evident that, under the wordings of the will, Valenzuela was 
free to donate the land or not. If he elected to make a donation, he was subject 
to only one limitation, that is, that the maximum area that he could donate 
would not exceed 9 hectares. Within said limitation, he had full discretion. 
</p>
<p>The extra-judicial agreement of distribution has not in any way modified the 
terms of the will. Therein the parties made the following commitment: 
"Respetaran todas y cada una de las disposiciones del testamento." And it 
repeated that Valenzuela had discretion regarding the land to be donated so that 
its products may be used for masses. </p>
<p>Valenzuela exercised his discretion on September 7, 1944, and he fixed the 
area of the land he decided to donate at one hectare. No one has the power or 
right to compel him to donate more than said area. </p>
<p>Having exercised his right to make the donation only on September 7, 1944, 
after the Constitution of the Philippines had already taken effect, a 
constitutional question arises. Is the Catholic Church of Polo or the Roman 
Catholic Archbishop of Manila, designated interchangeably by the parties as 
meaning the same personality, entitled to acquire the land in question? </p>
<p>The provisions of Article XIII of the Constitution, especially Section 5 
thereof, have been definitely interpreted by the Supreme Court in the well-known 
Krivenko case in the sense that the right to acquire any kind of land In the 
Philippines is reserved exclusively to Filipino citizens or to corporations or 
associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such 
citizens "save in cases of hereditary succession." Here there is no hereditary 
succession for two reasons: 1. The Catholic Church of Polo is not an heir of the 
deceased Generosa Valenzuela, and 2. The acquisition of the property here in 
question is by donation. </p>
<p>Was the Catholic Church of Polo or the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila a 
Filipino citizen at the time the donation was made by Valenzuela on September 7, 
1944? Article. IV of the Constitution deals with Filipino citizenship and in all 
its provisions only individual persons are contemplated, never an abstract 
entity such as the Catholic Church of Polo or the Roman Catholic Archbishop of 
Manila, which is a unipersonal corporation or, as alleged in the petition, "a 
corporation sole." </p>
<p>There is absolutely no showing that the Catholic Church of Polo is a 
corporation or association at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is 
owned by Filipino citizens. There is no showing that the Roman Catholic 
Archbishop of Manila is such a corporation or association. Upon the statements 
made at the hearing of this case, it appears that the Roman Catholic Archbishop 
of Manila is only a branch of a universal church ruled by the Pope, with 
permanent residence in Rome, Italy. Neither the Catholic Church of Polo nor the 
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila appears to possess the conditions which, 
according to express provisions of the Constitution, will entitle to acquire the 
one hectare of land donated by Severo Valenzuela. </p>For all the foregoing, the 
donation made by Severo Valenzuela in favor of the Catholic Church of Polo and 
the order of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan dated December 2, 1944, 
approving said donation, are declared null and void on constitutional grounds.

<p align="center">DISIDENTE</p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>Hay en este asuntó una cuestion procesal importante. En la misma decisión de 
la mayoría se admite que se halla pendiente ante el Juzgado de Primera Instancia 
de Bulacán el asunto civil No. 158, entre las mismas partes, en que precisamente 
se plantea de modo directo y categórico el punto principal discutido, a saber: 
si la extensión de terreno a que tiene derecho la iglesia católica de Polo es 9 
hectáreas, o puede ser menos, a discreción del viudo de la donante, Severo 
Valenzuela. Con esta admisión no alcanzo a comprender por qué la mayoría estima 
el presente recurso de <em>certiorari</em>. anticipándose a enjuiciar y decidir 
prácticamente la cuestión que se litiga en el referido asunto civil No. 158. No 
cabe duda de que esto es impropio y antijurídico. En el recurso especial que nos 
ocupa no tenemos elementos de juicio. suficientes para resolver la controversia. 
En el mencionado asunto civil es donde los derechos de las partes debieran 
determinarse y resolverse, sobre todo los derechos de la iglesia. Es elemental 
que el <em>certiorari</em> sólo procede cuando no nay otro remedio expedito y 
adecuado. Aquí hay otro remedio no sólo más expedito, sino más adecuado, y es la 
tramitación del referido asunto civil No. 158. </p>La decisión de la mayoría es 
puramente académica, no resuelve nada como no sea anticipando el juicio sobre un 
asunto que todavía no ha llegado a esta Corte Suprema. Así que estimo 
innecesario expresar mi opinión sobre el fondo de la cuestión, esto es, si el 
viudo tiene o no derecho a donar a la iglesia menos de 9 hectáreas, de acuerdo 
con la discreción que en el testamento le concede su difunta esposa. Expresaré 
mi opinión cuando llegue el momento oportuno.
