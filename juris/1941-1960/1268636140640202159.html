				G.R. No. L-3063, August 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>MACARIO QUINTERO AND RAMON GUZMAN, PETITIONERS, VS. FELIX MARTINEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, THE SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA, AND PIO D. LIWANAG, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a special action of mandamus to compel the respondent 
judge to issue in the civil case No. 7359, instituted by the petitioner against 
the respondent Pio D. Liwanag and the Sheriff of the City of Manila a 
preliminary prohibitory injunction restraining the respondent sheriff from 
executing the final judgment of the Municipal Court of Manila in the civil case 
No. 4217 on the ground that the said judgment was obtained through fraud, 
falsification and collusion.
<p align="justify">There can not be any question that it is a discretionary, and 
not a ministerial duty of the respondent judge, to issue or not a preliminary 
injunction in a case pending before its court, for section 3, Rule 60, provides 
that a preliminary injunction may be granted when it appears <i>prime facie</i> 
"that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded and the whole or part of 
such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the acts 
complained of; that the commission or continuance of the acts complained of 
during the litigation would probably work injustice to the plaintiff; and that 
the defendant is doing, threatens or is about to do, or is procuring or 
suffering to be done some act probably in violation of the plaintiff's rights 
respecting the subject of the action."</p>
<p align="justify">It is obvious that mandamus lies against a tribunal or judge 
who unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically 
enjoins as a duty resulting from his office, that is to perform a <i>ministerial 
duty</i> specially enjoined by law. It is not the function of mandamus to compel 
a judge exercising a judicial function such as the issuance of preliminary 
injunction, to grant or deny it, however clearly erroneous its action in 
granting or denying the injunction may be; and therefore the respondent judge 
can not be compelled to issue the injunction sought by the petitioned just 
because he acted contrary to law or with grave abuse of discretion in denying 
the injunction. The ruling of this Court in the case of Ba√±ares vs. Flordeliza 
and Gavito, 51 Phil., 786, was a very special one laid down under the special 
circumstance of particular case not applicable to the case at bar.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides the respondent judge acted in the present case in 
conformity with law. The first and principal cause of action in civil case No. 
7359 is to annul the final judgment of the municipal court in the case No. 4217 
on the ground of fraud. And in the third cause of action, the plaintiffs seek to 
restrain the sheriff of the City of Manila from carrying out the order of 
execution of said judgment, on the ground that the judgment is null and void; 
that the commission or continuance of the execution complained of during the 
litigation would work injustice to the plaintiffs, and that the defendant 
sheriff is ejecting or threatens to eject the plaintiffs in violation of their 
rights. It is evident that the third cause of action does not state facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and therefore the plaintiffs are not 
entitled <i>prima facie</i> to the relief demanded therein, which consists in 
restraining the defendant sheriff from executing the judgment; and that the 
sheriff in executing the final judgment of the Municipal Court of Manila by 
order of the said court is only complying with his official duty, and does not 
violate the plaintiffs' right. Therefore none of the requisites required by 
section 3, Rule 60, for granting a preliminary injunction exists.</p>
<p align="justify">Unless and until the court sets aside as null and void the 
final judgment of the Municipal Court of Manila in the civil case No. 4217 on 
the ground of fraud, the execution thereof can not be enjoined in an action of 
in junction against the sheriff of Manila, because the presumption is that the 
judgment was legally rendered. If the first cause of action seeking to annul 
said final judgment is decided in favor of the petitioners and the judgment is 
set aside, which will carry with it the nullity of the writ of execution, the 
sheriff could no longer enforce it without necessity of being enjoined not to do 
so. The third cause of action can have no independent existence, for it is a 
mere sequence of the first. To issue a preliminary injunction as ancillary to 
the third cause of action alleged in the plaintiffs' complaint in civil case No. 
7359, would be to allow judgment debtors to delay the execution of it final 
judgment against them by filing a complaint like the one filed by the 
petitioners in the said case, irrespective of the final outcome of the 
action.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the petition mandamus is dismissed, 
and the preliminary injunction issued by this Court in the present case is 
consequently set aside, with costs against the petitioner. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Mogran, C.J., Ozaeta, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">PARAS, J.:</p> I dissent for the same reason stated in the Lopez vs. 
Gutierrez.</div>
