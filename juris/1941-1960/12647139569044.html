				<H3>MANILA PRESS, INCORPORATED, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. MARCELINO SARMIENTO, AS CITY TREASURER OF THE CITY OF MANILA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was  instituted in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the sum of P4,983, which is  claimed to have been, illegally collected by  defendant-appellee City Treasurer of Manila from the plaintiff-appellant.   It appears  (from the stipulation of facts submitted before the trial court) that prior to 1951, plaintiff-appellant had city licenses for three forms of business, namely, retail, wholesale and printing.   In 1951, plaintiff-appellant transferred its printing press  from  Manila to Grace Park,  Caloocan, Rizal,  but it continued  accepting  printing  jobs from its customers at its place of business, 436-440  Nueva street, Manila.   In 1951  and  1952 he  paid  the license fee corresponding to retail dealers under Group  2  of Ordinance No.  1925, as amended by Ordinances  Nos, 3028 and 3364, of the City of Manila.   The quarterly license fee for retail dealers is made to depend  upon the  volume  of  quarterly gross sales.</p>
<p>During the  same period  of tyne,  1951  and  1952,  it received orders for the printing of stationeries and office supplies  from its customers and  caused the printing work to be done at its plant in Caloocan, Rizal.   It paid for this business the.quarterly license fee provided for in Group 5 of said Ordinance  No. 1925, as  amended,  of the City of Manila.  The defendant-appellee taxed plaintiff-appellant as a  retail dealer of papers, books and stationeries, insofar as these  printing contracts it performed for its customers is concerned, and assessed the license fee for the plaintiff-appellant on the basis of his gross  receipts under Group 2 of the ordinance.  Plaintiff-appellant  objected  to this assessment, and brought this action  to recover the taxes it paid, claiming that in performing the printing job contracts for its various customers it was merely  performing the business  of printing and is subject to  tax under Group 5. The court below sustained the assessment made by defendant-appellee City Treasurer of Manila,  overruling  plaintiff- appellant's contention.  Hence,  this appeal.</p>
<p>Ordinance .No.  1925, as amended, of the City of Manila, fixes  a quarterly license fee for retail dealers  of papers, books and stationery at the following  amounts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Group 2</em>.—Retail dealers in new  (not yet used) merchandise, which dealers are not yet subject to the  payment of any  municipal tax, such  as:  (1)  Retail  dealers  in General  Merchandise  and (2) retail dealers exclusively engaged in  the sale of  electrical supplies:  sporting  goods;  office  equipment and materials;  rice; textile including knitted wares; hardwares, including glasswares; cooking utensils and construction  materials;  papers;  books,  including  stationery :</p>

<p>In the years  1951  and  1952  plaintiff-appellant realized the following gross receipts for the printing jobs performed by it  for its customers:. 1951,  1st  quarter, P68,820;  2nd quarter,  P50,024;   3rd quarter,  f»48,923;  4th  quarter, P110,116.  1952,  1st  quarter,  P66,495;   2nd  quarter, P40,373.31; 3rd quarter, P43,518.53; 4th quarter, F89,763.32. The issue presented is whether plaintiff-appellant should be considered as a retail  dealer in paper,  stationeries and office supplies for the printing and  sale of the paper,  stationeries and office supplies of its customers, under Group 2, or merely acted in the printing of said  stationeries  and office supplies, as a printer  under  Group  5.   There is no question  that as to  books, papers,  stationeries  and office supplies on  which no printing work was performed, plaintiff-appellant  merely  acted as a retail dealer, subject  to tax under Group 2.  But when it printed on such papers, stationeries and office supplies  the names of its customers,, it acted merely as a  printer and the receipts from them for the stationeries and office supplies on which customer's names were printed were not  receipts for the sales of a retail dealer, but receipts of a printer.   In doing the work plaintiff-appellant's principal service was that of a printer and not that of a retail dealer.  The value of the printing work done is considerably more than that of the material used for printing, and although there is  also a sale of the paper and material on which the printing  job  is  done,. this is a mere incident of the service,  the nature of the transaction  being determined  by the  principal  purpose^ which is that of printing, and not by the  incidental sale. This is the consensus  of authority.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A printer  furnishing  special printed matter upon order from customers, such as  letterheads, circulars, mail-order catalogs and printed brief for attorneys, is not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, but in the business  of printing— one of the graphic arts.  Such persons, in carrying out their contracts of  service actually destroy the commercial value of the personal property they furnished their  customers, that is, plain paper, since thereafter such paper is of no use or value  to any person. other than the one for whom the printing is done.  (47 Am. Jur.f p. 237.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We hold, therefore, that in doing printing jobs on papers, stationeries  and office  supplies for  its  customers during the  years  1951  and  1952,  as  above set forth,  plaintiff-appellant was performing the business of a printer under Group 5 of the Manila City ordinance, and not that of a retail dealer under Group 2 thereof.</p>
<p>The mere fact that  plaintiff-appellant's printing plant is not situated in the  City of Manila but in the province of Rizal does not convert the plaintiff-appellant into a retail dealer as to printing jobs performed by it for its customers. It is to be noted that plaintiff-appellant  does  not question its liability to the ordinance under Group 5  as the office where it conducts its business with its customers is withii. the  City of Manila,  and, therefore,  the  question as to whether or not it should not be subject to this license fee under the city ordinance because its printing plant is not located in the  city, is not in issue before  Us.</p>
<p>The judgment  appealed from is hereby  reversed  and the  defendant-appellee  is  hereby  ordered to refund or return to plaintiff-appellant the amount of P4,983 demanded in the action.  Without costs.</p>
