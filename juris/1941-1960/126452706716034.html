				<H3>SOCORRO R. TIANGCO, PETITIONER,  VS. AGUSTIN LIBORO  AND JUDGE OF  COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH  II, RESPONDENTS. 
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Second Branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila,  presided over  by Judge  Gutierrez David, in  its order of November 16, 1945, denied the herein petitioner's motion to suspend the execution of a final judgment in an ejectment suit commenced in the municipal  court by the herein respondent Agustin Liboro against the said  petitioner, "it appearing in the decision that the major portion of the building  in question is occupied by a store  and is not solely used  for residence and that the defendant has sublet  the premises to another person."</p>
<p>In her petition for  certiorari  the petitioner  seeks to annul  that order, contending that  the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion  (1) "because the premises are solely  for residential  purposes and the defendant has not subleased the premises to another person" and  (2) because "the respondent judge failed to comply with the provisions of  Act  No. 689  by not hearing the parties before  denying the  petition  for  suspension  of execution."</p>
<p>We find the petition for certiorari  to be totally  devoid of merit.  It appears from the answer of  the respondent Agustin  Liboro that the decision rendered by Judge Dizon in the  ejectment suit on June 29,  1945, which has become final, recites among  other things as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On the question of whether or not the defendant has sublet or assigned the premises in question or any part thereof to anybody without the express consent of the plaintiff, the Court finds likewise in favor  of the plaintiff.  In fact, <em>the defendant admits  that at present the major portion of ihs premises is occupied by &amp;  store</em> belonging to a certain Mr.  Pua, although the defendant  claims to be the latter's partner in the business.  This constitutes a violation of the contract of lease Exhibit A."  (Italics ours,)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also  appears from the  answer:  "That  the said motion to suspend the execution of the said judgment was  heard and argued before the Second Branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila on November 3, 1945,  Moreover, before it was submitted for the resolution of the Court, upon petition of the defendant herself the parties presented their respective memorandums in writing."  What counsel for the petitioner  undoubtedly means when  he complains of lack of hearing is that the respondent judge did  not hold a trial to hear witnesses upon the motion for suspension of the execution in order to determine whether  or not the building in question was destined or used  solely for  dwelling and whether  or not the defendant had  subleased  it without the lessor's consent.  But those questions  are now <em>res  adjudicata</em>; they have  been determined by the court adversely to the defendant in its decision, which is now final and  unreviewable.</p>
<p>One of the conditions prescribed in section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 689 for the suspension of  the execution of a judgment in  a <em>desahucio</em> case is that it  be found hy the court "that the building  or buildings  mentioned in  the petition are destined <em>solely</em> for dwelling."  Section  11 of the  same  Act also  provides that "the lessee shall not sublease the building or part thereof used as dwelling, without the  written consent of the proprietor."</p>
<p>In his oral argument before this Court, counsel for the petitioner contended  that the building in  question is destined  solely for dwelling,  as shown by the fact that  the plaintiff himself  (respondent herein) alleged  in his complaint for <em>desahucio</em> that he needed the said building as residence for his family.   But the  use which the proprietor intends to make of the building in the future is evidently not the thing which the legislator had in mind in enacting section 5 of Commonwealth  Act No.  689; it  is  the  use which the lessee is actually making of itâ€”whether solely for dwelling, or also  for business or other purposes.   If it is  the former,  suspension  of  the ouster is authorized; if  the latter, no.  The  manifest intent  is exclusively to afford shelter to persons, and not to  afford protection to their business  also, as  against  the adjudicated  right of the owner of the building immediately to occupy or dispose of  it.  The trial court found that the building in question, which is  located  on  Rizal  Avenue, was not destined by the lessee solely for dwelling  but that on the contrary  the major portion of it was occupied by the store of a person in whose business the defendant claimed to be a partner.</p>
<p>Moreover,  the purpose of  the law in authorizing  the suspension of the execution for not more than three months is to  give the petitioner time to "secure another  dwelling house for himself and his  family."  In  the  instant case the judgment for ejectment was rendered on June 29, 1945; so,  the petitioner has had nearly six months within which to look for another dwelling  house.  On the other  hand, the trial court in its  decision expressly  found that "the plaintiff is one of the many who lost his residence  *  *  * during  military  operations   *   *  *   in the  month  of February, 1945";  and "that the plaintiff is in dire need of the premises."  Thus even  the equity aspect of the case is against the petitioner and in favor  of the respondent.</p>
<p>We find that, far from committing  an abuse of discretion, the respondent judge acted conformably to the law in denying the petitioner's  motion to suspend the  execution.</p>
<p>The petition  is  denied with costs.</p>
