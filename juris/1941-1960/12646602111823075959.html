				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 7,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; a&nbsp; collision&nbsp; took&nbsp; place between a bus belonging to the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines&nbsp; and a&nbsp; car&nbsp; driven&nbsp; by&nbsp; Manuel Aricheta&nbsp; causing injuries to some passengers and damage to&nbsp; both cars and two electric posts.&nbsp; As a result two separate&nbsp; charges for damage to property through&nbsp; reckless&nbsp; imprudence&nbsp; and&nbsp; another for "multiple&nbsp; serious&nbsp; and&nbsp; slight injuries&nbsp; through&nbsp; reckless imprudence" were filed against Aricheta before the Justice of the Peace Court of Mabalacat, Pampanga.<p></p><p>On September 13, 1954, Aricheta was served with an order of the justice&nbsp; of the peace court directing&nbsp; him to appear before it on October 2, 1954 for trial of the three cases&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits.,&nbsp; Aricheta&nbsp; filed&nbsp; separately&nbsp; three motions to quash on the ground that said justice of the peace court&nbsp; does&nbsp; not have jurisdiction to try the cases on the merits because, considering their nature, they come within&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the court of&nbsp; first instance.&nbsp; On November 3, 1954, the court overruled the&nbsp; motions&nbsp; and instead enjoined Aricheta to appear for the required&nbsp; preliminary investigation on&nbsp; November 18, 1954.&nbsp; Aricheta gave notice of his&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; waive&nbsp; said&nbsp; investigation, whereupon the court set&nbsp; anew&nbsp; the three cases&nbsp; for trial on&nbsp; the merits.&nbsp; And considering that&nbsp; said court,&nbsp; on one hand, has no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to try&nbsp; said&nbsp; cases&nbsp; and,&nbsp; on the other, acted merely&nbsp; upon order of the court of first instance, Aricheta has come before this Court by&nbsp; way of certiorari contending that both the court of first instance as well&nbsp; as the Justice of the Peace Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mabalacat, Pampanga, have acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.</p><p>It appears that Aricheta was charged before&nbsp; the Justice of the Peace Court&nbsp; of Mabalacat, Pampanga,&nbsp; with&nbsp; three crimes: two with damage to&nbsp; property through reckless imprudence and one with multiple serious and slight physical injuries through reckless&nbsp; imprudence.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first charge for damage&nbsp; to property,&nbsp; the damage involved is Pl,484,40 while in the second, P250; whereas in the charge for physical injuries, several&nbsp; persons are involved: Rufina Mangilit who,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; alleged, suffered&nbsp; injuries which required medical attendance for more&nbsp; than 120 days, and which might cause on her permanent incapacity&nbsp; and deformity; Potenciana&nbsp; Duque&nbsp; who suffered&nbsp; injuries which required medical attendance for a period of 7 days; Purificacion Duque who&nbsp; suffered contusions which&nbsp; required medical&nbsp; attendance&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; 3&nbsp; days; Apolonio Gacusan who&nbsp; suffered contusion which required&nbsp; medical attendance for a&nbsp; period of 3 days; Severino Capuno who suffered abrasion which required&nbsp; medical attendance for a period of 3 days;&nbsp; and Feliciano de los Reyes who suffered injuries&nbsp; which required&nbsp; medical&nbsp; attendance for a period of&nbsp; 3 days.</p><p>With regard' to the charges&nbsp; of damage to property through reckless imprudence, considering the value of the damage involved, our opinion&nbsp; is that they do not come with in the jurisdiction of a justice of the&nbsp; peace court for the reason that said court acquires jurisdiction to try criminal cases only when the penalty involved&nbsp; is imprisonment of not more than six months or a fine of&nbsp; not more than P200 (section 87&nbsp; [6].&nbsp; The Judiciary Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 296), and because of our ruling that&nbsp; such&nbsp; crime is not deemed included in the crime of malicious mischief over which a justice of the peace court has&nbsp; original jurisdiction.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; in Francisco Quizon&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; The Honorable Justice of the Peace&nbsp; of Bacolor, Pampanga,&nbsp; et al., 97 Phil. 342, this Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The question, therefore,&nbsp; is whether the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace court has concurrent jurisdiction&nbsp; with the Court of First Instance when the crime charged is&nbsp; damage to property through&nbsp; reckless negligence or. imprudence if the&nbsp; amount of the&nbsp; damage is P125. "We believe that the&nbsp; answer should be in the&nbsp; negative.&nbsp; To hold that&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace Court has jurisdiction to try cases of damage&nbsp; to property through reckless&nbsp; negligence, because&nbsp; it has jurisdiction&nbsp; over cases&nbsp; of malicious mischief,&nbsp; is to assume that&nbsp; the&nbsp; former&nbsp; offense&nbsp; is&nbsp; but&nbsp; a variant&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp; This assumption&nbsp; is not&nbsp; legally&nbsp; warranted."</p></blockquote><p>A different situation&nbsp; obtains with regard to the crime of multiple serious&nbsp; and slight physical&nbsp; injuries.&nbsp; This crime comes under Article 365 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code which provides in part that "Any person who, by reckless imprudence, shall commit any act which, had it been intentional, *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; would have constituted a less grave felony, the penalty of arresto mayor in its minimum&nbsp; and medium periods shall be&nbsp; imposed."&nbsp; Article 9 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Code provides that&nbsp; "less&nbsp; grave felonies are&nbsp; those which the law&nbsp; punishes&nbsp; with&nbsp; penalties&nbsp; which&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; maximum period&nbsp; are&nbsp; correctional&nbsp; * * *", and&nbsp; under Article&nbsp; 263, paragraphs 3 and 4, the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional</span> is provided&nbsp; for when&nbsp; the physical&nbsp; injuries&nbsp; inflicted&nbsp; have produced deformity&nbsp; or incapacity for the performance of the&nbsp; work&nbsp; in which the&nbsp; victim was&nbsp; habitually engaged, or when they&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have caused the&nbsp; illness or incapacity for&nbsp; labor for more than 30&nbsp; days.</p><p>It&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; charged,&nbsp; had&nbsp; it been intentional,&nbsp; would only&nbsp; constitute a less grave felony, for&nbsp; which the law imposes the penalty of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its minimum and medium periods (Article 365), which shows that the same comes within the jurisdiction of&nbsp; a justice of the peace court.&nbsp; The contention therefore of Aricheta with regard to&nbsp; this particular crime is untenable.</p><p>With regard&nbsp; to the&nbsp; question&nbsp; whether these&nbsp; charges, having arisen from a&nbsp; single&nbsp; act, should be&nbsp; included in only one information, the same cannot now be considered, petitioner not having raised the&nbsp; issue in the court below.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the petition is&nbsp; granted with regard&nbsp; to the two charges of&nbsp; damage to property&nbsp; through reckless imprudence, which should be forwarded to the court of first instance&nbsp; for trial on the merits.&nbsp; The petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; denied with regard to&nbsp; the charge&nbsp; of multiple serious and slight physical&nbsp; injuries&nbsp; through reckless imprudence.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
