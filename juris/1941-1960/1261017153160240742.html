				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action of replevin instituted by plaintiff in the. Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the possession of an&nbsp; automobile and certain amount as&nbsp; damages and attorney's fees resulting from his illegal deprivation thereof.<br><br>The original defendants were Reynaldo Pahati and Felixberto Bulahan but,&nbsp; upon amendment of the complaint, Jesusito&nbsp; Belizo was included as party defendant who was summoned by publication because Ms whereabouts were not known,&nbsp;&nbsp; Belizo failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear or answer the complaint and&nbsp; so he was declared default.<br><br>Pahati admitted having bought the automobile from Bulahan, for the sum of P4,900 which he paid in check.&nbsp; When the Manila Police Department impounded&nbsp; the automobile, he cancelled the sale and stopped the payment of the check and&nbsp; as a result he returned the automobile to Bulahan who in&nbsp; turn surrendered the check for cancellation.&nbsp; He set up a counterclaim for the sum of P2,000 as&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees.<br><br>Bulahan on his part claims that he acquired the automobile from&nbsp; Jesusito Belizo for value and without having any&nbsp; knowledge of any defect in the title of the latter; that plaintiff had previously acquired title to said automobile by purchase from Belizo as evidenced by a deed of sale executed to that effect;&nbsp; that&nbsp; later plaintiff delivered the possession&nbsp; of the automobile to Belizo&nbsp; for&nbsp; resale&nbsp; and to. facilitate it he gave the latter a letter of authority to secure a new certificate&nbsp; of registration&nbsp; in his name&nbsp; (plaintiff's) and that by having clothed Belizo with an apparent ownership or authority to&nbsp; sell the&nbsp; automobile, plaintiff, is&nbsp; now estopped to deny such&nbsp; ownership or authority.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulahan claims that between&nbsp; two innocent parties, he who gave occasion, through his conduct, to the falsification committed by Belizo, should&nbsp; be the one to suffer the loss and this one is&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bulahan also set&nbsp; up&nbsp; a&nbsp; counterclaim for P17,000 as damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>After the presentation o£ the evidence, the court rendered judgment&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; defendant Bulahan entitled&nbsp; to the automobile in question and consequently ordered the plaintiff to return it to said&nbsp; defendant and,&nbsp; upon his failure to do so, to pay him the sum of P4,900, with legal interest from the date of the decision.&nbsp; The claim for damages&nbsp; and attorney's fees of Bulahan was denied.&nbsp; Defendant Belizo was however ordered&nbsp; to indemnify the plaintiff in the&nbsp; amount of P4,900&nbsp; and pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P5,000&nbsp; as moral damages. The counterclaim of defendant Pahati was denied for lack of evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was taken directly to this Court by the&nbsp; plaintiff.<br><br>The lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; found that the automobile in&nbsp; question was originally owned by the Northern&nbsp; Motors, Inc. which later sold&nbsp; it to Chinaman Lu Dag.&nbsp; This Chinaman sold it afterwards to Jesusito Belizo and the latter in turn sold it to&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Belizo was then a dealer in second hand cars. One year thereafter, Belizo offered the&nbsp; plaintiff to sell the automobile for him&nbsp; claiming to have a buyer for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, plaintiff's certificate of registration&nbsp; was missing&nbsp; and, upon the suggestion of Belizo, plaintiff wrote a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; addressed to the Motor Section of the Bureau of Public Works for the issuance of a new registration certificate alleging as reason the loss of the one previously issued to him and stating that he was intending to sell his car.&nbsp; This letter was delivered to Belizo on March 3, 1952.. He also turned over ,to Belizo the automobile on the latter's pretext that he was going to show it to a prospective buyer.&nbsp; On March 7,1952, the letter was falsified and converted into&nbsp; an authorized deed of sale in favor of Belizo by erasing a portion thereof and adding1 in its place the words "sold the above car to Mr. Josusito Belizo of 25 Valencia, San Francisco del Monte, for Five Thousand Pesos&nbsp; (P5,000)."&nbsp; Armed/With this deed, of sale, Belizo succeeded in obtaining" a certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; registration in his name on the same date, March 7, 1952, and also on&nbsp; the same date, Belizo sold&nbsp; the car to&nbsp; Felixberto Bulahan who in turn sold it to Reynaldo Pahati, a second hand car dealer. These facts show that&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter was&nbsp; falsified by Belizo to enable him to sell the car to&nbsp; Bulahan&nbsp; for a&nbsp; valuable consideration.<br><br>This is a&nbsp; case which involves a&nbsp; conflict of rights of two persons who claim to be the owners of the same property; plaintiff and defendant Bulahan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both were&nbsp; found by the lower court to be innocent and to have acted in good faith. They were found to be the victims of Belizo&nbsp; who falsified the letter, given him by plaintiff&nbsp; to&nbsp; enable him to sell the car of Bulahan for profit.&nbsp; Who&nbsp; has, therefore,&nbsp; a better right of the two over&nbsp; the&nbsp; car?<br><br>The law applicable to the&nbsp; ease is Article 559 of the new<br><br>Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>"ART. 550. The possession of movable property acquired in good faith is equivalent&nbsp; to a title. Nevertheless, one who has lost any movable or has been unlawfully deprived thereof, may&nbsp; recover&nbsp; it from the person in possession of the same.<br><br>"If the possessor of a movable&nbsp; lost or of which the&nbsp; owner has been unlawfully deprived, has acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the&nbsp; owner cannot&nbsp; obtain its return without reimbursing the price paid therefor."<br></blockquote>It appears that "one who has lost any movable&nbsp; or has been unlawfully deprived thereof,&nbsp; may recover it from the person in possession of the same"&nbsp; and the only defense the latter may nave&nbsp; is if he "has acquired it in good faith at a public sale" in which case "the owner cannot obtain its return without reimbursing the price paid therefor."&nbsp;&nbsp; And supplementing this provision, Article 1505 of the same Code provides that "where&nbsp; goods are sold by a person who is not the owner thereof, and who does not sell them under authority or with the&nbsp; consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better title to the&nbsp; goods&nbsp; than the seller&nbsp; had, unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller's&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; sell."<br><br>Applying&nbsp; the above&nbsp; legal provisions to the facts of this case, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that plaintiff has a better right to the car in question than defendant Bulahan for it cannot be disputed that plaintiff&nbsp; had been illegally deprived thereof because&nbsp; of the ingenious scheme utilized by Belizo to enable him to dispose of it as if he were the owner thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff therefore can&nbsp; still&nbsp; recover the possession of the car even if defendant Bulahan&nbsp; had acted in good faith in purchasing it from Belizo.&nbsp; Nor can it, be pretended that the&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; of plaintiff in giving Belizo a letter to secure the issuance&nbsp; of a new certificate of&nbsp; registration constitutes a sufficient defense that would preclude recovery because of the undisputed fact that that&nbsp; letter was falsified and this fact can be clearly seen by&nbsp; a&nbsp; cursory examination of the document.&nbsp; If Bulahan had been more diligent he could have seen that the pertinent portion of the letter had been erased which&nbsp; would have&nbsp; placed&nbsp; him on guard&nbsp; to&nbsp; make an&nbsp; inquiry&nbsp; as regards the&nbsp; authority of Belizo to sell the car.&nbsp; This he failed to do.<br><br>The right of the plaintiff to the car in question can also be justified under the doctrine laid down in U. S.,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sotelo, 28 Phil., 147.&nbsp; This is a case of estafa wherein one Sotelo misappropriated a ring belonging to Alexandra Dormir.&nbsp; In the course of the decision, the Court said that&nbsp; "Whoever may have been deprived of his property in consequence of a crime is&nbsp; entitled to the recovery thereof, even if such' property is in the possession of a third party who acquired it by legal means other than those expressly stated in Article 464&nbsp; of the Civil Code"&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 147), which&nbsp; .refers to property pledged in the."Monte&nbsp; de&nbsp; Piedad", an establishment organized under the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the Government. The Court further said: It is a fundamental principle of our law of personal property, that no man can be divested of it without his own consent; consequently, even an&nbsp; honest purchaser, under a defective title, cannot&nbsp; resist the claim of the true owner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxim that 'No man can transfer to another a better title than he has himself "obtain in the civil as well as in the common law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 158)<br><br>Counsel for appellee places much reliance on the common law principle that "Where one of two innocent parties must" suffer by a&nbsp; fraud perpetrated by another, the law imposes the&nbsp; loss upon the party&nbsp; who, by his misplaced confidence, has enabled the fraud to be committed" (Sager <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> W. T. Rawleight Co. 153 Va. 514, 150 S. E.&nbsp; 244,&nbsp; 66 A.L.R. 305), and contends that, as between plaintiff and Bulahan, the former should bear the&nbsp; loss because of the confidence he (reposed in Belizo which&nbsp; enabled the latter to commit the falsification.&nbsp; But this principle&nbsp; cannot be applied to this ease which&nbsp; is covered by an express provision of our new Civil Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between a&nbsp; common law&nbsp; principle and a statutory&nbsp; provision,&nbsp; the latter must undoubtedly prevail in this jurisdiction.&nbsp; Moreover, we&nbsp; entertain serious doubt if, under the circumstances obtaining, Bulahan may be considered more innocent than the plaintiff in dealing&nbsp; with the car in question.&nbsp; We prefer not to elaborate on this&nbsp; matter it being unnecessary considering the conclusion&nbsp; we&nbsp; have reached.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed.&nbsp; The Court declares plaintiff to be entitled&nbsp; to recover the car in question, and orders defendant Jesusito Belizo to pay him the&nbsp; sum of P5,000 as moral&nbsp; damages, plus P2.000 as attorney's fees.&nbsp; The Court absolves defendants Bulahan and Pahati from the complaint&nbsp; a regards the claim for damages, reserving to Bulahan whatever&nbsp; action he may deem proper to take against Jesusito&nbsp; Belizo. No costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,, Montemayor, Jugo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
