				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Lots Nos. 818-C-3, 818-C-4 and 818-C-5.of the Piedad Estate, subdivision  plan  Psd-16489,  containing  29,995, 29,995 and 50,005 square meters, respectively, formerly parts of Lot  No.  818-C  of plan  Psd-2507, GLRO Record No.  6975, located  in barrio Bayanbayanan, Caloocan, Rizal (now Diliman, Quezon City)  were  formerly owned and registered  in the name  of Juan  Porciuncula, married to Regina Nicolas,  and covered  by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 419  (Exh. A).  Ten thousand  (10,000) square meters  of  Lot  No.  818-C-5,  however,  appears  to  have been sold to Antonio Isidro on September 26, 1940. <br><br>On November  22,  1940, Juan Porciuncula executed  a deed conferring  on Nicolas  E.  Adamos, a  lawyer,  the authority  to  look  for  buyers of the abovementioned lots as well  as of Lot No.  824-B of the Piedad Estate,  subdivision Plan Psd-824,  the area of which was not stated, also owned by  the former and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 20898 (Exh. G).  This instrument was superseded by another document  dated January 13, 1941,  authorizing  said  Nicolas Adamos to  subdivide  the same into  small lots to be sold either in cash or on installments (Exh. H), and pursuant thereto,  Lots Nos. 818-C-3, 818-C-4, and 818-C-5 were consolidated and divided into 3: Lot No. 1 containing an  area of  40,000 sq. m.  was sold in cash to the Real Monasterio de la Purisima Concepcion de Nuestra Madre Santa  Clara de Manila  which was duly  registered and for  which  Transfer  Certificate of Title No.  69059 in  the name  of said corporation was correspondingly issued (Exh. C).  Transfer Certificate of Title No.  69060 covering Lots 2 and 3 of the  said  consolidation  and subdivision plan Psd-1078 with  3,600  and 56,395 square meters, respectively, was issued on <span style="font-style: italic;">December 11, 1943,</span>  in  the  name of Juan  Porciuncula married to <span style="font-style: italic;">Regina Nicolas</span>  (Exh. D), although the latter had already been dead for several years or since August 29, 1931  (Exh. B). These remaining properties of Porciuncula were consequently transformed  into subdivision  (University  Orchard  Subdivision)  and  among  those who  were  able to purchase lots in cash or on installment basis  were the following: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="9%"> <br></td><td width="40%">Gavino

Adamos  claimed  that  the records  of  other purchases were even lost  during  the last world war.<br><br>On <span style="font-style: italic;">December 13, 1943</span>,  Juan Porciuncula, then about 88 years  of  age, executed  a  deed revoking  the power of attorney conferred on Atty, Nicolas Adamos and relieving the latter of his  responsibility under said  agency on the ground  that the  trust had been performed to his  satisfaction.  In  virtue of the  same instrument,  Porciuncula further ratified all acts performed by his attorney-in-fact in accordance with the special power of attorney  granted him  and same  were  made <span style="font-style: italic;">binding  upon the heirs  of said principal</span>  (Exh.  34).   On  the same  day, however, (December 13, 1943),  Porciuncula conveyed ownership of Lots Nos. 2 and 3 unto Nicolas Adamos and Vicente Feria by means of an absolute  deed of sale in consideration of P21,703.80, except a portion with an area of 1,692 square meters  already sold to Patrocinio  Valenzuela and Angel Giron, although the payment for the said area was included in the aforementioned  purchase price  (Exh. 35).   Consequently, T.C.T. No.  69475 covering said properties was issued  on <span style="font-style: italic;">December  14, 1943</span>  in the names  of Nicolas Adamos and Vicente Feria  (Exh. E). <br><br>It appears that even subsequent to the said  transfer of ownership, lots in the University Orchard Subdivision were sold by Adamos and Feria, now in their capacity as owners of the same,  to third parties some of whom were: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="9%"> <br></td><td width="40%">Matilde  de  Veyra..........................</td><td width="15%"> Lot   2,</td><td width="9%"><div align="center">Block 2 — </div></td><td width="7%"><div align="center">400</div></td><td width="20%"> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Matildo  de  Veyra.........................</td><td>Lot   1 &amp; Lot  114, </td><td><div align="center">Block 3 — </div></td><td><div align="center">409</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Ramon Obaña...............................</td><td> Lot   4,</td><td><div align="center">Block 3 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Espiridion Bacsa...........................</td><td> Lot   3,</td><td><div align="center">Block 2 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Narciso Fontecha..........................</td><td> Lot   7,</td><td><div align="center">Block 7 — </div></td><td><div align="center">409</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Romeo Vergara...........................</td><td> Lot   3,</td><td><div align="center">Block 2 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Josefa Asuncion...........................</td><td> Lot   3,</td><td><div align="center">Block 3 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m.</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Josefa Asuncion...........................</td><td> Lot    4,</td><td><div align="center">Block 3 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m.</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Viola Adamos............................</td><td> Lot   1,</td><td><div align="center">Block 6 — </div></td><td><div align="center">409</div></td><td> sq.m.</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Viola Adamos...........................</td><td> Lot   2,</td><td><div align="center">Block 6 — </div></td><td><div align="center">400</div></td><td> sq.m. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>Jose S.

F). On March 31,  1947,  his  surviving daughter, Ines  Porciuncula,  together  with his granddaughters Calixta Porciuncula, Adelaida  Porciuncula  and  Pelagia de los  Santos filed  a complaint against  Nicolas  Adamos, Vicente Feria  and the Register of Deeds  of Quezon City, with the  Court of First Instance  of Rizal  (Civil Case No. 174) seeking the  annulment of the deed of sale executed by the  deceased Juan  Porciuncula  in  favor of said defendants (Exh. 35)  allegedly  because  same  had  no valuable consideration; that it was obtained through fraud; that said sale was prohibited by law because when it was executed, Adamos was the attorney-in-fact of the vendor whereas  Feria  was the deceased's notary and lawyer.   The complaint thus prayed  that the sale be declared a nullity; that Transfer Certificate of  Title No. 69475  in  the names of defendants  be  cancelled and a new one issued  in  favor of plaintiffs; or in case this would not be possible, defendants be ordered to pay the current value of the properties at  P2  per square meter; that  defendants  be ordered to pay them P11,000 out of the P13,294.45—the uncollected payments of  the lots  sold on  installments,  payment of which  was assumed  by the  said  defendants;  plus the costs of the suit.  A  notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis  pendens</span> was likewise registered  with the Register of  Deeds  of Quezon  City. Defendants filed a motion  to dismiss  said complaint on the grounds that plaintiffs had no legal capacity to sue and that they were already estopped from presenting their claim.  But in  view of  the  answer  filed by the Register of Deeds  of  Quezon City  to the effect  that the deeds and titles involved in the action were in the  file of the Register of Deeds of Manila, the  Court ordered the corresponding amendment of the complaint so as to  make the latter official a party defendant therein in lieu of the former.  A motion to dismiss was  again filed by defendants,  but  was  denied by  the  Court.  Defendants thus filed their answer alleging that the transactions between Juan Porciuncula and  defendants  Adamos and Feria were in accordance  with law;  that  the deceased  voluntarily offered  the  remaining  unsold portion of the properties in question to  defendants; that the  husbands of  plaintiffs Ines Porciuncula and Pelagia  de los  Santos  were  even witnesses to the due  execution  of  the deed  of  sale and consideration  therefor was paid  in their presence; that the said deed of sale was executed after the special power of attorney  granted  to defendant Adamos by the deceased was cancelled;  that  plaintiffs  received  their  respective shares  of the  proceeds of the sale for  which they signed certain receipt and waiver; that as  in  the final settlement of the  trust  defendants assumed  the  responsibility  of collecting and  turning over to Pelagia  de los Santos and her husband the uncollected installments on  the lots already purchased amounting to P13,294.45, the  late  Juan Porciuncula gave them 5 years from  the termination of the then period of emergency within which  to  settle the same;  that immediately  after the consummation  of the sale, the spouses Ines Porciuncula and Leon Cruz entered as tenants of defendants on  the  cultivable portion of the property  and such  relationship  of landlord and  tenant continued until  the filing of the  instant action.  By way of counterclaim, defendants  demanded the  amounts  of P2,500 for  transportation  expenses and  loss  of earning and  P50.000 for damages.   Plaintiffs, however, presented a  second  amended complaint  on April 24,  1948 which was  practically  the same as the first amended complaint with the addition that the properties were acquired during the  existence of the conjugal partnership and were conjugal properties of said spouses.  Said pleading was admitted by the trial court on May  21 of the same year.  To this  order  of admission,  defendants filed  a  motion for reconsideration  which was set for hearing  on  July 14, 1948, together with the trial of the case on the  merits. <br><br>Meanwhile  or on  <span style="font-style: italic;">August 27, 1947,</span> the same  plaintiffs filed another complaint with the  Court of  First Instance of Rizal  (Civil Case No. 295)  against Nicolas Adamos and Vicente  Feria,  demanding  for  the  adjudication  in their favor of  54,997 1/2 sq. m.  of  the parcels  of  land, now  covered by Transfer  Certificate of Title No. 68475 in the names  of said  defendants,  which  was  allegedly the  share  of  Regina Nicolas in  the conjugal properties acquired by her and Juan Porciuncula during their  marriage;  or in case that  would  be impossible to do, then defendants  be ordered  to  pay the  value  thereof  at the rate  of P1.00 per square meter and for such other remedies as may be just in the premises. A motion to dismiss was timely filed by defendants, but  as  the determination  of the grounds adduced therein was deferred until the trial of the  case on the merits, defendants correspondingly filed  their answer.  It  was  averred that  granting  that the heirs  of Regina Nicolas had any right at  all,  such right had  been  lost when it was not exercised against Porciuncula during the  latter's  lifetime;  that  plaintiffs could not have done so because they had  already received their shares from the estate of Regina Nicolas; that the right of partition cannot  be invoked against  innocent purchasers for value; that having received part  of the purchase price, plaintiffs were now estopped from claiming  said properties  any further; that the sale between Juan Porciuncula and defendants was  legal  and valid; that the lots  mentioned in  the  complaint was also the subject matter of another action between  the same parties before the  same court.  Defendants therefore  prayed for the  recovery  of P2,000  by way  of  attorney's fees  and transportation expenses. <br><br>The records show that on July 14, 1948,  Civil Cases Nos. 174 and 295 were called for  hearing but the defendants in  said  cases  failed  to appear, thus their  motion for  reconsideration  of the  order admitting the second amended complaint was  denied and the lower court proceeded with the reception of plaintiffs' evidence for both cases.  On  November 12, 1948, the lower court rendered judgment declaring  the  sale  of  the  properties  in favor of defendants as null and void for lack  of consideration and  dismissed Civil Case No. 295. Hence, it was ordered that Transfer Certificate of Title No. 69475 be cancelled and  a new one be issued in  favor of plaintiffs as heirs of the  deceased  spouses Juan Porciuncula and  Regina Nicolas. Defendant  Nicolas Adamos was also required to pay the sum of P13,294.45 to  plaintiffs with legal interest from the date of the filing of the action in  Civil Case No. 174 to the date of actual payment,  with costs. <br><br>On being notified  of the decision on January 13, 1949, defendants filed separate motions for new trial asserting that their failure to appear at the trial was based on their belief  that  the hearing  would  be postponed; that  even granting that  the motion  for postponement  would  be denied,  the matter  to be considered should  have  been only the admission of the second  amended complaint, the result  of which  defendants should  have been  properly  notified  in  order  to give them  opportunity  to  file  their answer thereto.  They contend,  therefore, that the  promulgation of the  decision was premature  as it deprived defendants of the right to present their evidence. On February 28, 1949, plaintiffs  opposed the motion for  new trial  and prayed in turn that in accordance  with  Article 1, Rule 39  of the Rules  of Court, an order  of  execution of the decision already rendered in Civil  Case No.  174 be issued.  On March 19, 1949, the lower court, presided over by another Judge, set aside the decision  of November 12, 1948,  and ordered a new trial, thus denying  plaintiffs' prayer for  the  issuance  of an order of execution.   Due hearing was conducted thereon  until August 21 of  that year.  On January 23, 1950, however, the spouses Quirino and Pacita Carpio filed  a petition  to  allow  them  to intervene in  the proceedings, claiming that they  were the purchasers  of Lots  Nos.  4, 5, 10 and 11  of  Block  No. 5 of  the  consolidation  and subdivision  plan  No.  1078 (University  Orchard Subdivision) on December 1,  1943; that due  to the loss of the vendors' duplicate certificate, they were not able to register their aforementioned lots; that they were not advised by vendors Adamos and Peria of any claim on said properties and obtained knowledge of the  controversy  only  when   they  presented to  the Register   of  Deeds  for registration the deed of sale in their favor and same was refused in virtue of  the existence of the notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span>.   They prayed the Court  that said  intervenors be  adjudged owners  of Lots Nos. 4, 5, 10 and 11 of Block No. 5 of the  University Orchard Subdivision  (It is to be  noted, however, that lot  No.  5 of Block No. 5 was sold  by Adamos as attorney-in-fact of Juan Porciuncula to Guadalupe Cabrera—Exhibit 11);  and that  the   Register of  Deeds of Quezon  City be ordered to issue  the corresponding title  in their names.   After plaintiffs and defendants had filed their respective answers to said. complaint  in intervention, the  Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered decision dated November 24, 1950, dismissing plaintiffs'  complaint in Case No. 174  on the ground that the contract of absolute sale sought to be nullified was valid, the relationship between Porciuncula on  one  hand  and Adamos and Feria on  the  other  having been terminated before said sale was consummated; that there could not have been  any fraud or deceit in said sale because  plaintiffs were  present when the transaction took place  and furthermore  said  heirs  received  their respective  shares in the proceeds thereof.   The  court also denied plaintiffs' prayer for the immediate delivery to them of the amount  of P13,294.45  for the reason  that because of the  existence of the notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span>, defendants  were not  able  to collect the same  and  should  not  therefore  be held  accountable therefor.  Intervenors Quirino and Pacita Carpio were likewise declared owners of the lots purchased by them from defendants.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of said decision and new trial, which was denied on  February  22,  1951.  Thus  the  matter  was brought on appeal to  the  Court of  Appeals, but as the amount involved therein exceeds P50,000, the latter Tribunal elevated the same to Us for proper consideration in accordance with Section 17 (5)  of the Judiciary Act of  1948. Abandoning their claim for partition and  concentrating  on the questions presented by Civil  Case No. 174,  appellants in this  appeal claim that the lower  court erred:                                   <br><ol><li>In granting a new trial and in denying plaintiffs'  motion for execution.<br><br> </li><li>In holding that the contract of  sale, entered into between Juan Porciuncula,  vendor,  and Nicolas E. Adamos and Vicente O.  Feria, vendees, on December 13, 1943, was valid.<br><br> </li><li>In not  ordering the  cancellation of  Transfer Certificate  of Title  No. 69475 in  the names of Nicolas E. Adamos and Vicente C. Feria and the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in the names of Ines Porciunculan Calixta Porciuncula.<br><br> </li><li>In holding  that the intervenors have  acquired  the ownership of the four small lots sold to them by defendant Feria alone  on September 25, 1944.<br><br> </li><li>In holding that the obligation  of defendant Adamos  to pay the amount of P13,294,45 was not due and demandable. </li></ol><ol type="I"><li>As a general rule, the granting of denial of a motion for new trial rests upon the  sound discretion of the court and in the interest of justice, a motion for new trial based on a  ground which may be considered as falling  under fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence may be allowed by the  courts.  And where a  court's ruling  on a question calls  for the exercise  of this prerogative, such ruling certainly deserves the respect of the appellate  courts in the absence  of  manifest abuse of discretion.  Thus, taking into account the  reasons on  which the motions filed by defendants were  founded, we  find no reason to disturb the lower  court's action in setting aside the decision of  November  12,  1948,  and  ordering  for a new trial of the case.<br><br></li><li>The  records contain no specific  data or  list of the properties acquired  by the spouses Juan Porciuncula and Regina Nicolas  during their  married  life nor  of  their separate properties,  if  there  were  any,  other than  the affidavit executed by Pelagia  de los  Santos  (Exh. 2-Adamos),  one of  the original plaintiffs in Civil Case  No. 174 but who did not join with the others in this appeal; and as  the facts stated (therein  were  not controverted by appellants, we have no alternative but to rely on the  same. </li></ol>It appears from  said Exhibit 2 that the spouses  Juan Porciuncula and  Regina Nicolas were  the  owners of Lot No. 818 of the Piedad  Estate located in Diliman, Quezon City; of a homestead in Diliquias, Montalban, Rizal, with an area of 16 hectares; of an urban lot in Lopez Jaena street, also in Montalban; and of Lot No. 824-B, with an area of 8.7060  hectares, in  Diliman,  Quezon  City.  Although in  the power of attorney  conferred on Adamos by the deceased  Juan  Porciuncula (Exh.  G he was  instructed that  the lot covered by T.C.T.  No. 20898  (Lot No. 824-B) should be  disposed  of as  a whole, it seems that this  piece of property was actually divided and distributed among the heirs as  follows: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="6%"><div align="center">824</div></td><td width="6%"><div align="center">B-1</div></td><td width="38%">...........................................................................................</td><td width="16%">3.0005 hectares </td><td width="6%"><div align="center">— </div></td><td width="28%">Pelagia de los Santos</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">824</div></td><td><div align="center">B-2</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>2.7066 hectares </td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>Oliva Porciuncula</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">824</div></td><td><div align="center">B-3</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>1.0002 hectares </td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>Adelaida Porciuncula </td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">824</div></td><td><div align="center">B-4</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>1.0001 hectares</td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>Adelaida Porcuincula</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">824</div></td><td><div align="center">B-5</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>.9986 hectares </td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>Adelaida Porcuincula </td></tr></tbody></table><br>The homestead in sitio Diliquias, Montalban, went  to Ines  Porciuncula and  Adelaida  Porciuncula,  while the urban property in Lopez Jaena, Montalban, was in turn given  to  Calixta Porciuncula. Lot  No.  818   was  first divided as follows: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="6%"><div align="center">818</div></td><td width="6%"><div align="center">A</div></td><td width="38%">...........................................................................................</td><td width="16%">5.000 hectares</td><td width="6%"><div align="center">— </div></td><td width="28%"> Simeon  de los Santos </td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">818</div></td><td><div align="center">B</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>4.998 hectares</td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>Ine's Porciuncula</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">818</div></td><td><div align="center">C</div></td><td>...........................................................................................</td><td>14.995 hectares</td><td><div align="center">— </div></td><td>remained undisposed of</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The records does not  give any enlightenment as to when said properties  were distributed  nor in what  capacities the  aforementioned  persons  received the same.  It  does appear, however,  that  Lot  No. 818-C which was left  to the spouses was  further divided into the following: Lots 818-C-l and 818-C-2, with a total area of  4.000 hectares were sold to Dr.  Gumersindo Garcia and others  (Dr. Garcia actually purchased only 20,000  sq. m. of the same on  November  5,  1938-Exh. 49);  and Lots  818-C-3, 818-C-4,  and 818-C-5, with  an aggregate area of  10.995 hectares were  registered on <span style="font-style: italic;"> July  17,  1940,</span> in  the  name of Juan Porciuncula, <span style="font-style: italic;">married to Regina Nicolas</span>, for which T.C.T.  No. 419  was  correspondingly  issued  (Exh. A). These lots were  later consolidated and then divided into 3 lots (Pcs-1078) after deducting 10,000  square meters which were purchased by Dr. Antonio Isidro on September 26, 1940  (Exh. 48), thus  leaving 9.995 hectares  in the name of Juan Porciuncula, married to Regina Nicolas.   Of this remaining portion  Lot No.  1,  containing, an area  of 4.0000  hectares,  was sold  to the  Real Monasterio  de  la Purisima  Concepcion de Nuestra  Madre Santa Clara  de Manila (Exh. 33), and Lots 2 and 3,  with 3,600  square meters  and 5.6395 hectares,  respectively, were later divided into small lots and transformed into  a subdivision (University Orchard Subdivision)  under the supervision of Nicolas Adamos.  Said Lots 2 and 3 of the consolidation and subdivision  plan  (Pcs-1078)  with a  total  area of 5.9995 hectares were  registered on  <span style="font-style: italic;">December 11, 1943</span>, still in the name of Juan Porciuncula,  married to Regina Nicolas  and was covered by T.C.T.  No.  69060.  Three days thereafter,  however, or  on <span style="font-style: italic;">December  14,  1943,</span> said title was cancelled and  T.C.T. No. 69475  was issued in the  names of Nicolas  Adamos and Vicente  Feria on the strength of an absolute deed  of sale dated  December  13, 1943, executed by Juan Porciuncula in their favor (which appellants claimed to  be without  consideration).  While we may  agree that the registration of  Lots  Nos.  2 and 3 in the name of Juan Porciuncula,  <span style="font-style: italic;">married  to Regina Nicolas,</span> on December 11, 1943,  which must have been procured by Attys. Adamos and Feria and the circumstances under which said title was cancelled and a new one issued in their  favor,  arouse  suspicion, the  evidence presented by  appellants falls short of  a degree that may  sustain a conclusion that the absolute deed of sale executed by Porciuncula was vitiated for lack of consent or consideration.  On the other hand and despite appellees' protestations to  the contrary, the insertion of the vendor's status as married  does not seem  to be a mere honest  mistake or could be  attributed  to their ignorance of  the true fact considering  that appellees are familiar with the family of the vendor; and having  prepared  the deeds connected with the transactions in question,  such matter as  status of a person  should ordinarily have been looked into. Although the  way We look at it, such misstatement seems to be part  of a  preconceived scheme  to  facilitate  the transfer  of  the properties  to them and thus  avoid  the consequential  questions that  might have arisen  in case the vendor would appear to  be a widower, such fact alone does not  prove that undue influence  was exercised or fraud in the nature of  specific acts or  machinations was employed to induce the vendor, a very old man, to enter into the contract  of sale sought to be nullified. <br><br>Appellants' assertion that what Juan Porciuncula  sold did not absolutely  belong to  him deserves consideration. It was maintained that upon  the death of Regina Nicolas on <span style="font-style: italic;">August 29, 1931,</span> the properties acquired by the spouses during their marriage ceased to belong to the conjugal partnership which was then dissolved, and instead became the properties of the surviving  spouse and the heirs of the deceased. Thus, appellants  contend, that Juan  Porciuncula as  co-owner  of  the same could only  validly alienate His corresponding interest in the conjugal partnership which  still had to be  determined  after proper liquidation and distribution.  There is no  controversy that the properties involved  herein  were acquired  by  Juan Porciuncula and Regina Nicolas during their marriage and while it is true that upon the death of the wife she was survived by her husband, her daughter  Ines  and granddaughters  Calixta Porciuncula, Adelaida Porciuncula and Pelagia de los Santos, no liquidation of the conjugal partnership appears to have been ever effected, although Juan Porciuncula continued to be the administrator thereof.  As upon the death  of the  wife, Regina Nicolas, her  share in the conjugal partnership was transmitted to her heirs (Art, 657, Spanish Civil Code; now Art. 777); and considering that Juan Porciuncula disposed  of the properties of the partnership  after the demise of his wife and before any partition was  ever made and in the absence of proof that  the heirs had renounced their inheritance from the deceased, because Exhibit  "36"  that in part  is hereafter reproduced, can by no means be taken as Ines Porciuncula's waiver of her share of the property left by  her mother, Regina Nicolas, the conclusion  is inevitable  that as far as the portion or share that  corresponds to said deceased wife  and which descended to her heirs is concerned, any alienation  thereof  by the husband is null and void. <br><br>Appellees  do not  contest  that  the properties in controversy were conjugal; they, however, set up the defense that upon the death of the wife, the husband became the administrator of the  conjugal estate and could  lawfully encumber or  dispose of the same.   This point was already settled  by this Court when it pronounced that: <br><blockquote>The death of either  husband or wife does not make the surviving spouse the de facto administrator  of the conjugal. estate or invest him or her with the  power  to dispose of the same.  The sale of conjugal property by  the surviving spouse without the  formalities established for the sale  of the property of deceased persons shall be null and void, except as to the portion that  may correspond to the survivor in the partition (Corpuz vs. Corpuz, 51 Off.  Gaz. No. 10, p. 5185). </blockquote>Appellees  also advance the argument  that  appellants Ines  Porciuncula and Calixta  Porciuncula received their corresponding share in the proceeds of the sale and signed separate  waiver of whatever right  they may still have. Said waiver,  most likely drawn and prepared by  appellees, containing the thumbmark of Ines Porciuncula (the receipt allegedly  signed by Calixta Porciuncula was said  to have been  lost), was ordered as follows: <br><blockquote>"That I  hereby and  by these  presents acknowledged  to have received this date to my entire satisfaction the sum of five thousand pesos  (P5,000),  Philippine Currency,  in hand paid by  my father JUAN PORCIUNCULA, <span style="font-style: italic;">as my share in full</span> FROM HIS ESTATE in addition to what I  have already  received; <br><br>"That in consideration of the  said sum given to me,  I  hereby voluntarily and by these presents DO waive any right that  I may or might have on any remaining portion  of  His  estate  or on  any property, personal or  real, which he has or will acquire from now on; <br>* * *" (Exh. 36).</blockquote> A perusal  of the  aforequoted receipt discloses that it is more of a renunciation by Ines Porciuncula of whatever she expects  to inherit <span style="font-style: italic;">from  her  fathe</span>r,  upon  receipt of the sum of P5,000  in addition to whatever she may have already received  from him. It cannot  be gainsaid that appellants are  claiming,  not for the  share of Juan Porciuncula in the conjugal partnership, but of Regina Nicolas which was transmitted to them by operation of  law upon  her death  in 1931.  Furthermore, said instrument  is  by itself also void as it partakes of a renunciation of a future inheritance (Art.  816, Spanish Civil Code; now Art. 905). Obviously, therefore, appellees' allegation that appellants had  waived  their right  to inherit from Regina Nicolas cannot  be sustained.  In  this connection,  We may  say that while it may be presumed that the sale in question was made for a valuable consideration, the vendees Adamos and  Feria may not be considered  as innocent purchasers because  it is  inconceivable that they  should not  know all along that the properties being conveyed by Juan Porciuncula were, part of the conjugal estate  which  should be liquidated and  that no partition among  the heirs had yet  been effected.  As  a sale involves the  transfer  of dominion and no man can transfer  to another a better title that he himself had over it, nor can he transmit any right over  properties that do  not  belong to  him  (Coronel  vs. Ona,  33 Phil.  456),  the  dispositions made  by Juan Porciuncula, in so far as the portions or shares  corresponding to the  heirs  of  Regina  Nicolas  are concerned,  must  be held to be a complete nullity. <br><br>The foregoing considerations notwithstanding, We notice that the record of the case is incomplete in many essential points which need clarification, because the  evidence submitted by the parties are  insufficient to arrive at a proper and adequate determination of the questions at issue.  For example, arid as already  stated before,  the  evidence does not show: <br><br>(1) What were the conjugal properties of the spouses Juan Porciuncula and Regina Nicolas  at the time of the latter's death on August 29, 1931; <br><br>(2) On what date Lots   824-b-l,   824-b-2,  824-b-3,  824-b-4, 824-b-5, 818-a and 818-b were received by Pelagia de los Santos, Oliva  Porciuncula,   Adelaida  Porciuncula, Simeon  de  los  Santos and Ines Porciuncula or  in  what capacities  they  accepted said properties; <br><br>(3) Whether there was any liquidation and distribution  of  the personal  properties  of  Regina Nicolas  and  of her  share in  the properties acquired  during her marriage to Juan Porciuncula, and if so, when and how such liquidation and distribution were carried out; <br><br>(4) Whether Ines and Calixta  Porciuncula have ever renounced all or any part of their  inheritance from Regina Nicolas  aside from  Exhibit "36" which refers to the <span style="font-style: italic;">estate of  Juan Porciuncula</span>; <br><br>(5) The real  value of the properties sold to defendants Adamos and Feria, and whether by such sale the legitime  of appellants has been adversely affected; and<br><br>(6) Whether such sale is subject to the liquidation of the conjugal partnership of  the  spouses Juan  Porciuncula and  Regina Nicolas.<br><br>A  writer  on  mystery cases has inspiredly  stated  that "the  law is the science of applying justice to facts which have previously been determined and which are properly adduced in a  court of law.  When those facts  have  not been  properly collected, the  law is groping in  the dark. That is why  we  have  cases  involving  a miscarriage  of justice."   In  order  that any  such miscarriage  of justice may  not happen in the  case  at  bar,  We  are inclined 'to avail of the provisions of Section 9, Rule 50, in connection with  Section 1, Rule 58, of the Rules of  Court, and in the interests of  justice  and for the  proper  determination  of the issues involved therein, We consider necessary to remand the record  of  the case to the lower  court  for rehearing and further  proceedings. <br><br>Wherefore,  the decision in case  G.  R.  No. L-11519 (CFI  Civil Case No. 174) is hereby set aside and  the records thereof remanded to the lower court for reception of  such evidence as the  parties may  care to  produce  in order  to establish their  respective  contentions in  this matter.  Case G.  R. No. L-11520 (CFI  Civil  Case  No. 295)  is  dismissed, appellants  having desisted  from prosecuting the  same.  Without  pronouncement as  to costs. It is  so ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B.
