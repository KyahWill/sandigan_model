				<H3>FLORENTINA VILLAHERMOSA, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the order of Honorable Sotero Rodas, Judge of the 
Manila Court of First Instance, denying the writ of habeas corpus requested by 
Florentina Villahermosa on behalf of her son Delfin Co, who is under detention 
by the immigration authorities for purposes of deportation. 
<p>In the night of March 24, 1947, a party of sixty-nine Chinese landed 
clandestinely on the shores of Sto. Domingo, Ilocos Sur, in an attempt to evade 
our immigration laws. Leading them was Delfin Co, a young man, 18 years old, 
born in Paniqui, Tarlac, of a Chinese father named Co Suy, alias Yu Kui, and 
Florentina Villahermosa his wife. Co Suy died in July, 1940, and in February, 
1946, Delfin left the Philippines for China on board the S/S <em>Cushman</em> as 
a Chinese repatriate, in company with his relative Co Chi Pe. However, due to 
financial difficulties in China he took steps to return; but having met a 
Chinese (Co Soon Tiong), who informed him of a plan to smuggle their compatriots 
into this country, he agreed to lead the party to Ilocos Sur where his mother 
had relatives who could render valuable assistance. The voyage was undertaken; 
but unfortunately, the immigrants were discovered and apprehended immediately 
after arrival, and on the 27th day of March, Delfin Co was examined by the 
Commissioner of Immigration. Formal investigation of the case began on April 10, 
1947. Four days later, the corresponding board recommended that said Delfin Co 
be deported to China as a Chinese citizen. The Commissioner of Immigration 
agreed with the board, and, acting on this recommendation, rendered a decision 
ordering deportation of Delfin Co. </p>
<p>It appears that on April 29, 1947, Florentine Villahermosa, after knowing the 
apprehension of her son Delfin, filed in the civil registry of Tarlac under 
Commonwealth Act No. 63 an oath of allegiance for the purpose of resuming her 
Philippine citizenship which she had lost upon her marriage to Co Suy. On the 
strength of such reacquisition of Philippine citizenship by Florentina, it was 
contended before the immigration authorities that Delfin, being a minor, 
followed the citizenship of his mother, and was a national not subject to 
deportation. These contentions were overruled. They were repeated before the 
court of first instance in this habeas corpus proceeding and were likewise 
rejected. Appellant stresses the same defense. </p>
<p>There are two reasons why Delfin Co must be returned to China. First, he is 
not now a Philippine citizen; and second, granting that he is, at the time he 
entered this country from China he was a Chinese subject to deportation, and any 
subsequent change in his status can not erase the taint of his unlawful, 
surreptitious entry. </p>
<p>Section 1 of Article IV of the Constitution enumerates those who are citizens 
of the Philippines, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Those who are citizens of the Philippine Islands at the time of the 
adoption of this Constitution. </p>
<p>"(2) Those born in the Philippine Islands of foreign parents who, before the 
adoption of this Constitution, had been elected to public office in the 
Philippine Islands. </p>
<p>"(3) Those whose fathers are citizens of the Philippines. </p>
<p>"(4) Those whose mothers are citizens of the Philippines and, upon reaching 
the age of majority, elect Philippine citizenship. </p>
<p>"(5) Those who are naturalized in accordance with law." </p></blockquote>
<p>Delfin Co's claim to citizenship can only be predicated, if at all, on 
paragraph 4 of the above section. But,being a minor, he has not had the 
opportunity to elect Philippine citizenship, and therefore he is as yet an 
alien, his father being a Chinese. </p>
<p>We have heretofore held <span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> that, after 
the Constitution, mere birth in the Philippines of a Chinese father and Filipino 
mother does not <em>ipso facto</em> confer Philippine citizenship and that 
<em>jus sanguinis</em> instead of <em>jus soli</em> is the predominating factor 
on questions of citizenship, thereby rendering obsolete the decision in Roa 
<em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 23 Phil., and U. S. <em>vs</em>. Lim Bin, 36 
Phil., and similar cases on which petitioner's counsel relies. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is contended that Florentina Villahermosa being a Filipina, 
Delfin Co should likewise be.a Filipino. Commonwealth Act No. 63 does not 
provide that upon repatriation of a Filipina her children acquire Philippine 
citizenship. It would be illogical to consider Delfin as repatriated like his 
mother, because he never was a Filipino citizen and could not have 
<em>reacquired</em> such citizenship. </p>
<p>While his Chinese father lived, Delfin was not a Filipino. His mother was not 
a Filipina: she was Chinese. After the death of such father, Villahermosa 
continued to be a Chinese, until she reacquired her Filipino citizenship in 
April, 1947. After that reacquisition Delfin could claim that his mother was a 
Filipina within the meaning of paragraph 4, section 1 of Article IV of the 
Constitution; but, according to that same Organic Act, he had to elect 
Philippine citizenship upon attaining his majority. Until he becomes of age and 
makes the election, he is the Chinese citizen that he was at the time of his 
father's demise <span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>. </p>
<p>It does not help petitioner's case to assert that as a mother she has a right 
to retain custody of her minor son and to keep him here. Where such son has 
violated the immigration laws and rendered himself liable to deportation no rule 
or principle should frustrate the Government's action by the interposition of 
the mother's right to custody. This consideration becomes stronger where, as in 
this case, the re-assumption of Philippine citizenship by Villahermosa has all 
the earmarks of an attempt to impede the banishment of Delfin Co, who by the 
way, besides being guilty of violating our laws, has not shown any signs of 
eagerness to adopt our ways of life.</p>
<p>This petition is moreover to be denied on the strength of precedents 
heretofore established, because Delfin was a Chinese when he arrived here; and 
any posterior change of status can not affect the legality of his detention for 
purposes of deportation. </p>
<p>In Juan Co <em>vs</em>. Rafferty, 14 Phil. 235, a Chinaman claimed the right 
to enter the Islands, and being refused by the customs officials, gave bond that 
he would present himself for deportation if the claim were disallowed. While 
under bond, he was adopted as a son by another Chinaman domiciled herein, in 
legal form. Held: He is subject to deportation, because such adoption had no 
effect upon his right to enter or to remain in the Islands. This Court said that 
the status of an immigrant and his right to stay here is to be determined as of 
the time of his entry (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ju-Toy, 198 U. S. 253, 263) and that 
he could not do afterwards anything to render valid what was originally an 
illegal entry. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Chinese person, not a merchant at the time he applies to enter the 
Islands, will not be permitted to remain here upon the theory that he became a 
merchant during the time he was waiting for the decision of the proper 
authorities". (Tan Guam Sien <em>vs</em>. Collector of Customs, 31.Phil. 56.) 
(<em>See also</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Chan Sam, 17 Phil. 448)</p></blockquote>
<p>that the child born of a Filipino mother married to a foreigner "is not yet a 
Filipino" and "will be one if he prefers to be so upon reaching the age of 
majority". (Aruego, Framing of the Philippine Constitution, Vol. I, p. 209). 
</p>
<p>We declare that Delfin Co is not now a Filipino. We also declare that he 
having entered this country surreptitiously is subject to deportation. </p>
<p>The decision of the lower court denying his petition for habeas corpus is 
affirmed. With costs.</p>
<p><em>Parás, Pablo, Briones,</em> and <em>Padilla, JJ.,</em> concur. </p>Paras, 
J., I hereby certify that the Chief Justice voted to affirm the decision.

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the foregoing decision. Besides, I will only point out that 
petitioner, by the very purpose for which she filed the oath of allegiance 
mentioned therein, made herself unworthy and disqualified to be repatriated 
under Commonwealth Act No. 63. </p>
<p>Section 4 of said Act provides that repatriation sh shall be effected by 
merely taking the necessary oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines (now Republic of the Philippines) and registration in the proper 
civil registry. Allegiance requires the person pledging it, among other things, 
to respect and obey the laws of the country to which the pledge is made. But 
here the person taking the oath of allegiance did so for the express purpose of 
legalizing, so to say, a most serious violation of the immigration laws of the 
Philippines by her son. An oath of allegiance taken for that end is, if 
anything, an affront to the sovereign, besides the criminal responsibilities it 
entails. </p>
<hr shade="" no="" align="center" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The majority decision fails to abide by one of the elemental rules of law, 
enunciated by human wisdom. </p>
<p>That rule is stated in Article 18 of the Civil Code as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Children, while they remain under parental authority, have the nationality 
of their parents."</p></blockquote>
<p>That rule is reaffirmed by the Naturalization Law, No. 2927, as amended by 
Act No. 3448. It provides that children under 20 years of age and residing in 
the Philippines shall become citizens upon naturalization of their parents.</p>
<p>The rule is founded on human nature. Because minor children depend on their 
parents for their sustenance, support and protection, it stands to reason that 
they should follow the nationality of said parents. They have to live under the 
same roof with their parents and as near enough to them t o enjoy patental care 
and protection. Minor children have to follow their parents wherewer the latter, 
by political, moral, mental and economic exigencies, have to establish their 
abode.</p>
<p>To accept the majority's position is to justify its inevitable consequences, 
one of them being the possibility of a fratricidal battle, should the nation of 
one happen to be at war with that of the other. One shudders at the mere thought 
that parents, as soldiers of one belligerent nation, should fire in murderous 
battle against their own children fighting in the enemy trenches, while the 
children aim their guns at the very authors of their lives. </p>
<p>There is unanimity of opinion that petitioner Florentina Villahermosa is a 
Filipino citizen. There is no question that she was born of Filipino parents in 
Lapog, Ilocos Sur, in March, 1905. She is living in Paniqui, Tarlac, the 
province of Ambassador Romulo. Since her birth she has resided in the 
Philippines. She never went to China. She is a widow. She is the mother of 
Delfin Co, a minor of 18 years. She is the mother of another minor named 
Benjamin Co, who is living with her. There should not be any question that under 
the above mentioned elemental rule of law and under express statutory 
provisions, Delfin Co follows the nationality of his mother, His mother is a 
Filipino citizen. Delfin Co is a Filipino citizen. </p>
<p>When on July 18, 1940, her Chinese husband died, Florentina Villahermosa must 
have felt that she regained her Filipino citizenship. She was ignorant of the 
provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 63, so she failed to file the oath of 
allegiance required by it. Because her son came into trouble,she happened to 
learn about the legal requirement and on March 25, 1947, ahel took the oath 
which was filed:on the 29th of the same month with the Civil Registrar of 
Paniqui, Tarlac. </p>
<p>That the purpose of said oath of allegiance is, by her repatriation, to keep 
her son at her side and within the folds of this country, appears to have 
provoked some indignation, as if petitioner has committed a crime or, at least, 
a reprehensible act. There is absolutely no ground for taking such an attitude. 
Petitioner had only exercised a right expressly granted to her by law. The 
statutory provision does not deal with motives or purposes. It is as impersonal 
as the constitutional provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights without taking 
into consideration the purposes and motives for the exercise of said rights. 
</p>
<p>That petitioner had exercised a right expressly granted to her by law for the 
benefit of her son or for the purpose of protecting him against an action 
harmful to him, is only logical. There is nothing objectionable in her taking 
advantage of the law to give tangible expression to her maternal love, which is, 
without any doubt, universally considered the most sublime feeling nature has 
infused on human heart. The feeling is so elemental that it is not unknown even 
to the lowest phila of the animal kingdom. That even the fiercest wild animals 
are not devoid of such feeling is a wonder that cannot fail to move the most 
indifferent person. Many perceive in that fact the operation of an infinite 
intelligence taking care of all living things. </p>
<p>That petitioner had only obeyed the mandates of nature, that she yielded to 
an unconquerable feeling, the one most oraised by moralists, deified by 
spiritual and religious leaders, the subject of glowing eulogium in eloquent 
prose and inspired poetry, whenever and wherever literature has flourished, 
instead of causing criticism, should only merit panegyric and be acclaimed, she 
having followed the noblest impulses of her nature. </p>
<p>Since his birth on May 31, 1928, Delfin Co has been a resident of the 
Philippines until February 2, 1946, when, probably yielding to the youthful lust 
for adventure, without the consent or knowledge of her mother, he stealthily 
went to China. Having returned on March 24, 1947, to the Philippines, his place 
of residence, it is only natural that he should want to remain here and that his 
mother should exert all efforts so that he should not go away again. By the 
repatriation of Florentina Villahermosa, Delfin Co became <em>ipso facto</em> a 
Filipino citizen. As a resident of the Philippines and as a Filipino citizen, he 
is entitled to stay. </p>
<p>The unfortunate fact that a character by the name of Co Soon Tiong was able 
to persuade him to help smuggle a bunch of Chinese into this country, by landing 
them in Lapog, Ilocos Sur, in consideration of a free passage to the 
Philippines, is no reason to deprive him of the right to remain in the country 
of which he is a resident and a citizen. </p>
<p>There are indications that he is entitled to more pity than blame, by his 
failure to resist the wiles of a scheming person, who took undue advantage of 
his immaturity. His anxiousness to return to his country and be at his mother's' 
side must have been too strong for him to refuse a free passage, a mere pittance 
when, as amply publicized, to secure entrance of Chinese immigrants, middlemen 
or procurators earn thousands of pesos per person. </p>
<p>Did Delfin Co commit any crime or offense punishable by law? If he did, let 
him be prosecuted and sentenced through due process of law, and if deportation 
is the punishment provided by law by competent courts of justice, let the 
judgment be rendered and enforced. But it is admitted on all sides that there is 
no law punishing the act of Delfin of rendering help to the smuggling of a bunch 
of Chinese in question. If he did not commit any crime or offense, only a 
subverted sense of justice may justify punishing him with deportation. </p>
<p>We vote, with the revocation of the appealed order of the lower court, to 
declare null and void the order of the Commission on Immigration deporting 
Delfin Co to Amoy, China. </p>

<p align="center">DISSENTING</p>
<p><strong>TUASON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>With regret I am constrained to disagree with the views of the majority. I 
shall briefly state the reasons for my dissent. 
</p><blockquote>
<p></p>
<ol><li>Article 18 of the Civil Code is explicit in its provision that "Children, 
while they remain under parental authority, have the nationality of their 
parents," Delfin Co has become, in my opinion, a Filipino citizen by reason of 
his mother's reacquisition of Philippine citizenship after her husband's death, 
I see no difference, and no valid reason for differentiating, between a 
legitimate child of a Filipino mother by a deceased foreign father and a 
Filipino mother's illegitimate child. The latter under the rules of 
international law as well as the Civil Code takes the citizenship of its 
mother.<br><br>The intention of the framers of the Constitution to withhold 
Philippine citizenship from the child of a Filipino mother and an alien father 
until the child reaches the age of majority, does not create an exception to the 
general rule. It is ny humble and considered opinion that the deferment of 
conferring Filipino citizenship on such a child extends only to those cases in 
which both parents are alive and retain their foreign nationality, or where the 
father having died, the mother has not chosen to regain her original 
citizenship.<br><br>It is not good law which prevents the minor child of a 
citizen of the country, a child to whom by law and by nature she owes 
protection, from joining its parent. I do not believe that the Constitutional 
Convention could ever have contemplated such an inadmissible and irrational 
situation.<br><br>I do not share the apprehension of some members of the Court 
that if a child like Delfin Co should follow the citizenship of her mother his 
citizenship would be at the mercy of being changed as often as its mother 
changes her citizenship by marriage or otherwise. If that should happen, there 
is nothing wrong or ridiculous about it. On the contrary, I think it is more in 
accordance with natural law. That is what happens in the case of an illegitlmate 
child of a Filipino mother marrying a foreigner or obtaining another 
citizenship; and there is in this connection no perceptible difference between 
an illegitimate child and a legitimate child whose father is dead. If a mother 
can and wants to change her citizenship daily, certainly it is natural rather 
than queer that her minor child, which depends upon her for care and support, 
should not be left stranded. <br><br>
</li><li>The decision says: "This petition is moreover to be denied on the strength 
of precedence heretofore established, because Delfin was a Chinese when he 
arrived here; and any posterior change of status can not affect the legality of 
his detention for the purposes of deportation." I do not think this doctrine is 
applicable to the present case. The principle established by the decisions cited 
on this point is that an immigrant can not take advantage of his unlawful entry 
to acquire the conditions imposed by the immigration laws. In the language of 
this Court, (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Chan Sam, 17 Phil. 448-456), "to say to him 
(immigrant) that if by any means he can gain an unlawful entry in the Islands he 
will be relieved of the consequences flowing from his unlawful act if at any 
time after he gains his unlawful entrance he changes his status and assumes the 
occupation of one of the privileged classes, would be to set a premium on the 
unlawful but successful evasion by Chinese laborers of the laws prohibiting 
their entrance into the Islands." And in Tan Guan Sien <em>vs</em>. Collector of 
Customs, 31 Phil., 56, the Court had the same idea when it said, "The law does 
not contemplate that Chinese persons may, by one method or another, gain en 
entrance into the territory of the United States without the fsection six 
certificate', and after such entrance become such a merchant, and then as such, 
insist upon his right to remain." In these two cases, and in the case of Juan Co 
<em>vs</em>. Rafferty, 14 Phil. 235, in which the immigrant was adopted by a 
resident while the immigrants right to enter was under investigation, the 
changes in the immigrant's status were effected by him or with his intervention 
and could not have been accomplished in his absence. </li></ol>
<p>In the case at hand the conversion of the immigrant to Philippine citizenship 
was entirely independent of his will and of his presence in the Philippines. The 
bond that binds the petitioner and her child existed before the latter entered 
the Philippine territory and not from the date of her repatriation only. It is 
the legal and absolute right of the immigrant's mother to reclaim her Philippine 
citizenship regardless of any mental reservation, her motives or her attitude 
toward her country. The legality of her reacquisition of Philippine citizenship 
is nowhere challenged. Assuming then that Delfin Co's nationality follows that 
of his mother, as we believe it does, has Co forfeited his right to be with her 
as a result of his entering the Philippines unlawfully? I know of no law which 
sanctions such punishment for an immigrants fault. If, on the otherhand, the 
theory is that the immigrant must first be purged of his sin by deportation 
after which he may be allowed to come back and settle here, the Court would be 
adopting an empty ceremony that would lead to no useful purpose nor enhance the 
prestige of the administration of law.</p>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in this dissenting opinion.</p><em>Jugdement affirmed.
