				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On June 11, 1956, Victorino Alfonso, Ciriaca Alfonso and Paciencia Alfonso 
filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal against Agueda Santos 
and Santiago Cruz for annulment of certain extra judicial settlement and deed of 
sale covering a parcel of land allegedly owned by Placido Alfonso, the deceased 
husband of Agueda Santos. The complaint was later amended so as to include as 
party defendant Susana Realty, Inc. to which the property was subsequently sold. 
<p></p>
<p>On August 1, 1956, Agueda Santos and Santiago Cruz filed their respective 
answers but Susana Realty, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss alleging (1) lack of 
cause of action; (2) the cause of action, if any, had prescribed; and (3) 
plaintiffs do not have legal capacity to sue. On September 1, 1956, by leave of 
court, plaintiffs were substituted by Geronimo Avecilla who was appointed 
judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased Placido Alfonso on June 8, 
1956. On September 14, 1956, the court granted the motion to dismiss and 
dismissed the complaint in so far as Susana Realty, Inc. is concerned. It found 
that plaintiff has no cause of action against the company, and that if he has 
any, the action has. already prescribed. Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration 
having been denied, he interposed the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>It is alleged in the amended complaint that the spouses Placido Alfonso and 
Agueda Santos owned a parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title 
No. 21913 which was conjugal in nature; that Placido died in 1947 without any 
issue; that Agueda, alleging fraudulently that she was the sole heir of her 
deceased husband, executed an extrajudicial deed of settlement and secured 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3585 in her name; that thereafter she sold the 
laxid to Santiago Cruz who fraudulently secured Transfer Certificate of Title 
No. 3586; that Santiago in turn conveyed the property to Susana Realty, Inc. 
which secured Transfer Certificate of Title No. 31543 in its name; that 
plaintiffs discovered the fraudulent sale between Agueda and Santiago only in 
January, 1956, and that between Santiago and Susana Realty, Inc. in June, 1956, 
Plaintiffs prayed for the annulment of the extrajudicial settlement and the, 
deeds of sale in favor of Santiago Cruz and Susana Realty, Inc. and for the 
reconveyance of the property to them.</p>
<p>The first ground on which the lower court dismissed the complaint is that it 
does not allege a cause of action against Susana Realty, Inc. for the reason 
that while it alleges that Agueda Santos and Santiago Cruz acted fraudulently in 
effecting the sale of the land by the former to the latter, there is, however, 
nothing alleged therein that in the transfer of the land by Cruz to Susana 
Realty, Inc., the latter acted with knowledge of the fraud or of the defect 
vitiating the title of Santiago Cruz. It is further inferred from the complaint 
that the land is covered by a Torrens title on the back of which no encumbrance 
appears. It is for this reason that the trial court found Susana Realty, Inc. to 
have acted in good faith in purchasing the land and held that the action cannot 
prosper against it under Section 55 of Act 496 which provides: "That in all 
cases of registration procured by fraud, the owner may pursue all his legal and 
equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud, without prejudice, 
however, to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of 
title."</p>
<p>We have examined the pertinent allegations contained in the amended complaint 
and have found the above findings of the trial court correct. Indeed, there is. 
nothing alleged therein which may implicate Susana Realty, Inc. in the 
commission of the alleged fraud in the transfer made by Agueda Santos of the 
land to Santiago Cruz although the allegation therein is clear that both Santos 
and Cruz have acted fraudulently. Being an innocent purchaser for value of the 
land, its right is protected by law and the remedy of the persons prejudiced is 
to bring an action for damages against the persons responsible therefor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In fact, in view of the issuance of certificates of title, another line of 
approach conclusive against plaintiffs' side suggests itself; There being no 
allegation of had faith against Santos, his purchase of the duly registered 
title of Afable may not be revoked even if Afable, as alleged in the complaint, 
obtained it thru fraud. Consequently plaintiffs' action for annulment of the 
deed of sale will necessarily fail. Plaintiffs' remedy, if any, is an action for 
damages against Afable by reason of fraud and that remedy may only be demanded 
judicially within four years after discovery of the deception. (Sec. 43 Act No. 
190.)" Raymundo, et al. vs. Afable, et al., 96 Phil., 655.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The second ground on which the order dismissing the complaint is predicated 
is that, even if plaintiff has a cause of action against defendant Susana 
Realty, Inc., the same has already prescribed. The court said: "It is very clear 
that said prescriptive period commences to run from the discovery of the fraud, 
which, in the instant case, is from April 11, 1947, the date of registration of 
the alleged fraudulent document, the affidavit of extra-judicial settlement by 
the defendant Agueda Santos. It is a well-settled rule in land registration that 
registration of a document in the registry office operates, not only to the 
parties to the same, but also against the whole world. It is obvious that the 
four-year period has long expired from aforesaid date of registration."</p>
<p>Again, we find correct the above finding of the trial court. Under Section 51 
of Act 496, every conveyance affecting registered lands if recorded, filed or 
entered in the office of the register of deeds, shall "be notice to all persons 
from the time of such registration, filing, or entering." And it has been held 
that the period of prescription in relation to an action to annul a sale of land 
bought by third persons should be counted from the date of registration of the 
same, which is notice to the whole world (De Guinoo vs. The Court of Appeals, 97 
Phil., 235).</p>
<p>But petitioner maintains that this cause of action has not yet prescribed 
because when Agueda Santos, through fraudulent misrepresentation, secured a 
certificate of title in her name, a constructive trust in favor of the defrauded 
heirs of her late husband was created which grants to said heirs the right to 
vindicate the property regardless of the lapse of time. But the right of action 
in this constructive trust should be exercised against the trustee, who caused 
the fraud, and not against an innocent purchaser for value, as the Susana 
Realty, Inc. This right may also be exercised against Santiago Cruz who also 
obtained title to the land with knowledge of the fraud, but not with regard to 
Susana Realty, Inc. which, as already stated, has bought the property in good 
faith. The remedy in this case of the defrauded heirs is to bring an action for 
damages against those who caused the fraud or were instrumental in depriving 
them of the property. Their action cannot reach an innocent purchaser for value 
who is protected by law (Raymundo, et al. vs. Afable, et al., <u>supra</u>).</p>
<p>After plaintiffs have filed their amended complaint in the lower court and 
defendant Susana Realty, Inc. filed its motion to dismiss alleging that the same 
alleges no cause of action against it because it appears therein that it has 
acted without knowledge of the fraud with which the title of its 
predecessor-in-interest was vitiated, counsel for plaintiffs moved for leave to 
file their amended complaint in order that he may supply the deficiency in so 
far as said defendant is concerned. Of course, defendant Susana Realty, Inc. 
opposed the move and the court denied the motion. Counsel now contends that the 
lower court erred in denying the motion.</p>
<p>While under the rules a party may, upon motion, ask the court for leave to 
alter or amend any pleading, action thereon is addressed to the discretion of 
the court. The court may grant leave to amend upon such terms as may be just or 
where in its opinion the circumstances so warrant (section 2, Rule 17). The rule 
is not mandatory. The rule is further subject to the limitation that, if the 
amendment is allowed, the cause of action should not be substantially changed, 
or the theory of the case altered to the prejudice of the other party. Thus, it 
was held: "The granting of leave to file amended pleadings is a matter 
peculiarly within the sound discretion of the trial court. This discretion will 
not be disturbed on appeal, except in case of an evident abuse thereof. But the 
rule allowing amendments to pleadings is subject to the general but not 
inflexible limitation that the cause of action or defense shall not be 
substantially changed, or that the theory of the case shall not be altered" 
(Torres Vda. de Neir vs. Tomacruz, 49 Phil, 913). In the circumstances, we find 
nothing to show that the lower court has abused its discretion on this matter. 
</p>
<p>We find one procedural error committed by petitioner in this case. Petitioner 
seeks redress from an order of the trial court dismissing his complaint against 
the Susana Realty, Inc. but in doing so he filed a petition for certiorari. This 
is erroneous for his remedy is appeal, the order in question being final in 
character. This alone is enough ground for the dismissal of the present petition 
for certiorari. </p>
<p>Petition is dismissed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
