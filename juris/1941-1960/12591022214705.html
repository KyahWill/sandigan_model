				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is a petition for a writ of certiorari to annul the order of the Director  of Lands directing the petitioner, a homestead  applicant, to exclude from his  application nine hectares of the twenty-four he had applied for and which he had sold to Teodocia Arevado who  later  on  sold  to Alfredo (Alberto) Alfon and Virginia de Moron, and the order of  the Secretary of  Agriculture  and  Natural Resources that affirmed the Director's order.  Both respondent officers  answered the petition.   Alfredo (Alberto) Alfon and Virginia de Moron  were allowed to intervene and file their pleading in intervention (Case No. 218).   After hearing the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur rendered  judgment  dated 10 June 1957, the  dispositive part of which is, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>IN VIEW  OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is  hereby rendered:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li> Declaring null  and void the  sale in favor of  Teodocia  Arevado executed by the petitioner on May 16, 1944;  and cancelling the award made by the  Director of Lands (affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources) in favor of the' intervenors, Virginia de Moron and Alfredo  Alfon;</li>
  <li> Ordering  the respondent  Director of Lands and  Secretary  of Agriculture and Natural Resources to  issue the patent in  favor of  the herein  petitioner;</li>
  <li> Ordering the intervenors, Virginia de  Moron and Alfredo Alfon, to  return the possession  of the land to the herein petitioner who is hereby ordered to return the purchase price of 200.00 pesos to Teodocia Arevado;</li>
  <li> Reserving to the said intervenors the  right of  action  against Teodocia Arevado, if any exists as a consequence of this judgment;</li>
  <li> It appearing that an action  for  forcible entry and detainer and for  damages is now being actually tried by this Court, no judgment on  the  issue of damages is hereby  made but the same shall be taken up in the said civil case for forcible entry and for damages.</li>
  <li> Without special pronouncement as to costs.</li>
</ol>
<p>This judgment is a  reiteration of another rendered on 24 December 1956  which was set aside and new  trial held to hear the evidence for the respondents.  From this  judgment the  respondents  and intervenors have  appealed. Only questions of  law are raised.</p>
<p>The case  and the facts, as  stated and narrated by the trial court,  are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is a petition for certiorari seeking to review and annul the decision of the Director of Lands awarding portions of the tot in question to  Virginia de Moron  and Alberto Alfon, and also the confirmatory judgment  of the  Honorable Secretary of Agriculture and Natural  Resources,  for  being contrary to law and  for having  been achieved with grave  abuse of discretion on the part of the said officials.</p>
  <p>The respondents deny the material averments of the petition and allege that  the  decision in  question was arrived  at  after the petitioner  was  given opportunity to be heard and  actually produced evidence to  support his contention that he did not sell said portions in question to  Teodocia  Arevado, predecessor  in interest  of  the herein intervenors, but  only  mortgaged  the  said portions to her; that said petitioner has  exhausted  every  administrative remedy and has  failed because of  lack of ground and  not  because of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the  respondent officials herein.</p>
  <p>Upon the issues thus  joined, the case  was tried.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of the decision  of the Court, the  following findings of facts of the  respondent Secretary  of Agriculture and Natural Resources may be accepted:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Dumangay Guiting  was an applicant for a  parcel of land in Lunib, Margosatubig,  Zamboanga with an area of twenty-four  (24) hectares.  On February 10,  1934,  his  homestead  application was approved by the  Director of "Lands  upon  the latter's finding that  he  possessed  all the necessary qualifications to enter the homestead and that  the land is disposable and  not claimed  by  another.  Thereafter,  Guiting  occupied  the land and  cultivated the  same.  In  1948, he  submitted  final proof and  as  upon investigation it was found that he complied with all the requisites  preparatory to the issuance  of patents the Administrative Officer  of  the Bureau of  Lands issued on  March 21,  1950 an order for the issuance of  patent to him.</p>
    <p>"Meanwhile,  various  events have transpired  in  connection with the land leading to a contest  over the same..  On May  16, 1944, Guiting executed a  deed of  sale covering  nine (9) hectares of  his  homestead  in favor  of  Teodocia Arevado.  By virtue of said sale, Arevado occupied the land embraced  therein and cultivated it  by herself and thru her tenants until the year 1953 when,  pressed by  the need  for money, she sold the same to Alberto  Alfon and  Virginia  de Moron, who  entered upon the portions conveyed to each  of them, that  is, three (3) hectares to Alfon and six (6) hectares to de Moron.</p>
    <p>"Soon after Alfon and  De Moron entered upon their  respective portions of the land conveyed to them by Arevado in 1953, Guiting filed a complaint  for  forcible  entry  in  the  Justice of the  Peace Court  of  Margosatubig,  Zamboanga del Sur against De Moron and her husband.  After hearing, the Court rendered judgment ordering the defendants to vacate  the land and  to turn it  over to the plaintiff, but the defendants remained therein and  appealed the case to the Court of First Instance. "Sometime before Arevado sold the land to  Alfon and  Be Moron,  her husband Colasito  Gonzalo,  lodged a  protest with the Bureau of Lands alleging that he was the  absolute owner thereof  by virtue of the Deed of  Sale entered into between  his wife and Guiting and  praying that he  be subrogated in the place of the vendor Guiting as owner of the land.  The said protest  gave  rise to an investigation,  the findings  of which served as the basis of the aforementioned decision of the District Land Officer dated January  11,  1955 which  was affirmed in the  order, of the Assistant Director of Lands dated April 26, 1955 which was in turn appealed to this Office by the applicant Guiting."   (Exhibit "6".)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The  findings  of the Assistant Director  of Lands referred   to above are as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Contrary to movant's  allegation as second ground, at the ocular inspection of the  premises  it was  found out that claimants are in actual possession of the premises.  It has  also been ascertained that Teodocia Arevado and her tenants, since 1945 up to the time her  interest  in the land was transferred to Virginia de Moron and Alberto Alfon, had been in the actual occupation  of the premises and had  introduced  thereon  improvements consisting of coconut trees 3 to  4  years  old, coffee, cacao trees and kapok.</p>
    <p>"With respect  to the  third  ground that the  District Land Officer  erred in considering as absolute sale  the transfer  of rights made by  Dumangay  Guiting in favor  of  Teodocia Arevado on May 16, 1944, not  as a mortgage only, this Office after perusing the  evidences submitted by the contending parties believes that the decision is  correct. On this point nothing has been presented by Dumangay Guiting to contest  the due execution of  the instrument of the deed of  absolute sale dated May 16, 1944, except his denial  that he did not know its  contents. The instrument shows that the transaction was one of sale and not  a mere mortgage.  It  was signed by Guiting in  the presence of two witnesses, and acknowledged by him  and his vendee before the  justice of the peace of Margosatubig.  There is  no doubt about the due execution of  the instrument, and the presumption is strong that it embodies the true intent of the contracting  parties, which cannot just be overcome  by the uncorroborated denial of Guiting."  (Exh. "7".)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It  would be well to recall that, as found by the trial court, on  10 February 1934 the  Director of Lands approved the appellee's application  for homestead and  allowed him to enter the homestead land; that on 16 May 1944 he sold nine hectares of his  homestead land to Teodocia  Arevado without  the  previous approval of the Director of Lands; that in 1948  (9  August 1948, see Exhibits 3-Director &amp; 12-Intervenor)  thie appellee filed notice of intention to make final proof and on 10 September 1948 submitted  final proof  (Exhibits  2-Director &amp; 11-Intervenor); that on 21  March 1950  the Director  of  Lands issued an  order directing the issuance of patent in favor of the appellee; that on 21 August 1953, Colasito Gonzalo,  husband  of  Teodocia Arevado,  filed  a protest with the Bureau of Lands claiming ownership to  nine of the twenty-four hectares of homestead land of the  appellee; and  that because of financial difficulty, Teodocia Arevado sold six hectares of the  said parcel of land to Virginia de Moron and three hectares thereof to Alfredo  (Alberto) Alfon.</p>
<p>There is no  question that the sale of the nine hectares of homestead land to Teodocia Arevado without the previous  approval  of  the Director of  Lands was null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>    The  question now is: Did the  respondents-appellants  gravely  abuse  their  discretion   in  ordering  the amendment of the appellee's homestead application  (No. 193441-E-102742)  by excluding therefrom the parts sold to Teodocia Arevado which  were later on sold to the intervenors-appellants,  and requiring the latter to file appropriate public land applications within 120 days from receipt of a copy of the decision of  the district land officer?</p>
<p>Sections 14,  16, 20 and  102 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 provide:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>SEC.  14. No  certificate  shall be given or patent issued  for the land applied for  until at least one-fifth of the land  has been improved and cultivated.  The period within which the land shall be cultivated shall not be less than one nor more than five years, from and after the date of the approval of the application.  The applicant shall,  within  the  said period, notify the  Director  of Lands as soon as he is ready to acquire the title.  If at the date of such notice,  the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands, that he  has resided continuously for at least one year in the municipality in which the land is located, or in a municipality adjacent to the  same, and  has  cultivated at least one-fifth of  the land continuously  since the approval  of  the  application,  and <em>shall make affidavit that no part of said land has been alienated or encumbered, and that he has complied with all the requirements of this Act,</em> then, upon the payment of five pesos, as final fee, he  shall be entitled to a  patent.</p>
  <p>SEC. 16. If at any time  before the expiration of the. period allowed by law for  the making of final proof, it shall be proven to the satisfaction of the  Director of Lands,  after due notice to  the homesteader,  that  the land entered under the  law  not subject to homestead entry,  or  that the  homesteader  has actually  changed his residence, or voluntarily abandoned the land for more than six months  at any one time during the years of residence and occupation herein required, <em>or has otherwise failed to comply with the requirements of this Act, the Director of Lands may cancel the entry.</em></p>
  <p>SEC.  20. <em>If at any time after  the approval  of the application and before  the patent  is issued,</em> the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands that he has complied with all  the requirements  of the law, but cannot  continue with  his homestead, through no fault of his  own, and there is a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser for the rights and improvements of the applicant on the land,  and that the conveyance is not made for purposes of speculation,  then  the applicant, with the previous approval of the Director of Lands may transfer his  rights to the  land and  improvements  to any person legally qualified to apply for a homestead, * * *.  <em>Every transfer made without the  previous approval of the Director of Lands shall be mill and void and shall result in  the cancellation  of the entry and the refusal of  the patent.</em></p>
  <p>SEC.  102. <em>Any person,</em> corporation, or association <em>may file an  objection under oath to any application  or concession under this Act, grounded on  any reason sufficient under this Act for the denial or cancellation of the application or the denial of the patent or grant. </em>If, after the applicant  or grantee has been  given suitable opportunity to be duly heard, the objection is  found to be well  founded, <em>the Director  of Lands shall-deny or cancel the application or deny patent or grant,</em> and the  person  objecting  shall, if qualified, be granted a prior right of entry for a term of  sixty days from the date of the notice. (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the aforequoted provisions of  the Public Land Act,  the Director  of Lands is  empowered to  cancel an application and a homestead entry, or refuse the issuance of patent if, after due hearing, he finds that the applicant has  not complied with  the requirements and the provisions of the  law, or has violated mandatory provisions of the Jaw.   Upon complaint filed  by  Colasito Gonzalo the Director of  Lands conducted  an investigation of the appellee's application and after hearing found that contrary to his previous assertion that he has not encumbered or alienated any part of his homestead land, the appellee had sold nine hectares of his homestead land without his (Director of Lands) previous  approval; and that since  1945 (should be 16 May 1944) the appellee had ceased to be in possession  of nine  hectares of the homestead land.  The act, therefore, of the Director of Lands, with the approval of the Secretary of  Agriculture and Natural Resources, in ordering  the amendment of  the appellee's homestead application in the manner herein before stated, did  not constitute or amount to  a grave  abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the  writ prayed for denied, with  costs against the petitioner and appellee.</p>
