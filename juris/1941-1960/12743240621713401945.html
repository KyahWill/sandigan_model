				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal, taken by the prosecution, from an order of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila granting defendant's motion to quash the information 
and dismissing the case, with costs <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<p></p>
<p>Defendant Lim Hoa <u>alias</u> Lim Hoa Ting is accused of unfair competition in 
violation of Article 189 of the Revised Penal Code. It is alleged in the 
information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 12th day of May, 1954, and for sometime prior and 
subsequent thereto, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, being 
then the owner and manager of a business establishment named Ting Lian Hong 
located at 339-341 Ylang-ylang Street, in said City, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously engage in unfair competition for the 
purpose of deceiving or defrauding A Tung Chiongco Trading, an authorized 
representative of Barrelson Inc., of its legitimate trade and/or the public in 
general and sell his goods, the Lantern Brand Food Seasoning by then and there 
giving it the general appearance of a product named Oak Barrel Brand Food 
Seasoning being sold and distributed by said A. Tung Chingco Trading, as 
follows: the same sizes of the bottle containers, the yellow background color of 
the labels, the grouping or letterings in English and Chinese characters, the 
identical wording and listing of ingredients and instructions for the use of the 
product, the use of a lantern symbol closely resembling an oak barrel, the red 
seal on the neck of the bottle, the white top cover, the same color scheme of 
the letterings, all of which induced the public to believe that the said Lantern 
Brand Food Seasoning is that of an Oak Barrel Brand Food Seasoning, which fact 
would be likely to induce the public to believe that the said products made in 
the Philippines is that of an Oak Barrel Brand Food Seasoning made it the United 
States, and thereby giving other persons a chance to do the same with a like 
purpose, and likewise caused to be affixed or used in his labels a false 
designation of origin or any false description or representation, such as, "VESO 
LANTERN BRAND SEASONING AGENCY L. H. TING'S IMPORTER - PACKED BY CHAMS PRODUCTS 
CO., SAN FRANCISCO, CALIF., 'and offered such goods to the public, to the damage 
and prejudice of said Oak Barrel Brand Food Seasoning's distributor, A. Tung 
Chingco Trading, and the public interest as a whole."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon arraignment, defendant entered a plea of not guilty, but, subsequently, 
he secured permission to withdraw his plea and moved to quash the information 
upon the ground "that the facts charged" therein" do not constitute any offense 
upon which a valid judgment or conviction may be based." The prosecution opposed 
this motion, but, to no avail. Hence, this appeal.</p>
<p>The order appealed from appears to have been influenced by the following 
factors, namely:</p>
<ol><li>The allegation, in the motion to quash, that on May 12, 1953, the accused 
Lim Hoa had secured the registration, in the Patent Office of his trade mark 
"Lantern";<br><br>
</li><li>The opinion of His Honor, the trial Judge, to the effect that "the accused 
Lim Hoa x x x had applied in good faith for the registration of his trade mark 
with the Patent Office"; that the registration of his trade mark with the Patent 
Office"; that </li></ol>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"x x x the accused had applied for a patent and such patent having been 
issued or granting to him, shows conclusively the lack of criminal intent on his 
part to violate the law. The sanction obtained by him from the government which 
approved his patent gives his act the halo of legality and he cannot therefore 
be prosecuted in a criminal action for the acts committed by him under and by 
virtue of the authority and sanction given by the government;"</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>that as "the owner and patentee of the trade-mark 'Lantern' x x" he had, 
under the provisions of section 20, Republic Act No. 166, "the exclusive right 
to use the same in connection with goods, business or services specified in his 
certificate", and that the same "is prima facie evidence of the validity of the 
registration in his favor and of the legality of the acts he had committed by 
virtue of said authority"; and</p></blockquote>
<ol start="3"><li>The finding of His Honor, the trial Judge, to the effect that said 
trade-mark "to the naked eye appears to be very much distinct and different from 
the trade-mark of Kuster Laboratories Incorporated and/or Barelson Incorporated, 
represented in the Philippines by A. Tung Chingco Trading," the complaint or 
offended party in the case at bar. </li></ol>
<p>We have examined the trade-marks or labels in question - complaint's "Oak 
Barrel" and defendant's "Lantern" (reproductions of which were attached to the 
motion to quash) - and the majority of the members of this Court can not agree 
with the view of His Honor, the trial Judge, that the two (2) appear to be "very 
much distinct and different" from each other. Although there are some points of 
difference between said labels, it cannot be, and it is not, denied that the 
points of analogy specified in the information exist.</p>
<p>After reproducing the competing labels, in Brooks Bros. vs. Froelich &amp; 
Kuttner (8 Phil., 580), this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From an examination of these respective labels it will be noted that they 
really of the same color, the corresponding parts of each of the labels being 
practically the same, both in form and color, and are so nearly alike that 
unless they were compared together the common observer would fail to note any 
difference whatsoever. The similarity between the general appearance of the 
packages with the labels imported and offered for sale by the defendant and those 
sold by the plaintiff is so great as to require the closest scrutiny to detect 
the difference, even to one wholly familiar with the packages and wholly aware 
of the difference between them. The similarity is such as to influence the 
purchaser of the goods offered by the defendants, to believe that the same are 
the goods of the plaintiff's manufacture. So faithfully and closely has the 
appearance and arrangement of plaintiff's packages of thread been followed by 
the defendant, that the mind refuses to credit the possibility of attributing 
the many points of identity to mere accidental coincidence on the part of the 
defendant.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">x x x x</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From an examination of the evidence adduced in this caused in the court 
below, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant and 
appellant, in selling the thread in the boxes labeled in the manner described, 
intended to give his goods the general appearance of the thread manufactured and 
sold by the plaintiff, in the devices, labels, and words used by them, in a way 
which would be likely to influence purchasers to believe that the goods offered 
by them were those of the plaintiff, and that the similarity in the appearance 
of the goods offered for sale by the defendant to those of the conclusion that 
the defendant actually intended to deceive the public and defraud the plaintiff. 
(U.S. v. Manuel, 7 Phil. Rep., 221; Nellee vs. Baer, Senior &amp; Co., 5 Phil., Phil. Rep., 608.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>To the same effect is the view adopted in Nelle vs. Baer, Senior &amp; Co. (5 
Phil., 608), U.S. vs. Manuel (7 Phil., 221). U.S. vs. Gow Chiong (23 Phil., 
138) and Flaming &amp; Co. vs. Ong Ten Co. (26 Phil., 579). </p>
<p>For obvious reasons, it is not proper for us to say, as yet, that the 
similarity in the general appearance of the two (2) labels involved in the case 
at bar is such as to warrant the conclusion that the defendant intended to 
engage in unfair competition. However, the similarity between both is sufficient 
to require that the determination of such question be deferred until after the 
trial and the submission of the case for decision on the merits.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is explicitly alleged, in the information, that the defendant 
has "willfully, unlawfully and feloniously" engaged in unfair competition "<u>for 
the purpose of deceiving or defrauding</u>" the complaint herein "of its legitimate 
trade and/or of the public, in general, and sell his goods x x x by then and 
there <u>giving it the general appearance of a product named Oak Barrel Brand Food 
Seasoning</u> being sold and distributed" by said complaint, and that the 
similarities specified in the information "<u>would be likely to induce the public 
to believe" that defendant's product "made in the Philippines is that of an Oak 
Barrel Brand Food Seasoning made in the United States</u>, x x x." Thus, pursuant to 
the information, the acts therein set forth were performed by the accused in <u>bad 
faith</u> and <u>with a fraudulent intent</u>, and <u>tend to mislead the public</u> into 
believing that his products and those distributed by the complaint of is 
predicated upon the opposite premise, namely, that the accused acted in <u>good 
faith</u>, and that the public <u>could not be misled</u> into confusing or mistaking one 
product for the other.</p>
<p>This was a clear error on the part of the lower court. A motion to quash 
assumes the facts alleged in the information to be true. In some cases, <u>
additional</u> facts, not alleged in the information, but <u>admitted</u>, <u>or not denied</u>, 
by the prosecution may be invoked in support of the motion to quash. In passing 
upon the same, the court, however, may not consider a situation <u>contrary</u> to that 
set forth in the information. In any event, in the case at bar, the prosecution 
does not admit that the defendant had acted in good faith. On the contrary, it 
asserts and maintains that he acted with malice and fraudulent intent. Neither 
does it admit that the labels or trade-marks in question are "very much distinct 
and different" from one another. What is more, it alleges and maintains that the 
points of analogy between the two are likely to induce the public to believe 
that defendant's products are the very products being distributed by the 
complainant.</p>
<p>Again, although the certificate of registration of defendant's trade-mark is 
- in the language of the order appealed from - "<u>prima facie</u> evidence of the 
validity" of such registration, such evidence is <u>rebuttable</u>, not conclusive. In 
the case at bar, there is a factor that weakens defendant's alleged "exclusive 
right" by virtue of said registration: the fact that the "Oak Barrel" trade-mark 
was registered - according to said order - on March 4, 1952, or more than a year <u>
before</u> the "Lantern" trade-mark. It is well settled, that "one may be declared 
unfair competitor even if his competing trade-mark is registered" (Alexander 
&amp; Co. vs. Ang, L-6707, May 31, 1955; Parke Davies &amp; Co. v. Kin Foo, 60 
Phil. 928; Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. vs. Kinwa Meriyasu Co., 57 Phil., 262; Yebana 
Co. vs. Hua Seco &amp; Co., 14 Phil. 534).</p>
<p>Lastly, the information herein alleges that defendant, likewise, "caused to 
be affixed or used in his labels a false designation of origin or false 
description or representation," such as, that his products are "packed by Chams 
Products Co., San Francisco, California," - although in fact they are packed by 
defendant in the Philippines. Such false representation falls under the second 
paragraph of Article 189 of out Revised Penal Code, pursuant to which the 
penalty prescribed in Article 188 thereof shall be imposed upon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any person who shall affix, apply, annex, or use in connection with any 
goods or service, or any container or containers for goods, a false designation 
of origin, or any false description or representation, and shall sell such goods 
or services."</p></blockquote>
<p>Said allegation of false representation by the defendant has not been 
contested in the motion to quash. Neither does defendant deny that said false 
representation is a crime punishable under said paragraph 2 Article 189. In 
fact, he now maintains - though not in his motion to quash - that, by reason of 
said avernment, the information charges <u>two</u> offenses. Obviously, this pretense 
is inconsistent with his motion to quash, insofar as it maintains that the first 
part of the information does not charge any offense - particularly the crime of 
unfair competition under the first paragraph of Article 189. Under such theory, 
only the last part of the information charges an offense, namely a violation of 
said paragraph (2) of Article 189. In other words, under the view taken in the 
motion to quash and the order appealed from, the information alleges only one 
(1) offense - a violation of the second paragraph of said Article. At any rate, 
defendant has not objected to the information in the lower court, upon the 
ground that it charges more than one offense.</p>
<p>In short, considering that the crime of unfair competition under the first 
paragraph of said Article 189 depends, to a large measure, upon the intent of 
the accused and the effect of his acts upon the public in general, both of which 
are questions of fact, the determination of which depends upon the evidence 
thereon, it is our considered opinion that the prosecution is entitled, at 
least, to an opportunity to prove the pertinent allegations of the information, 
that, at this stage of the proceedings, it is not fair to assume or conclude 
that said allegations are false, and that the lower court erred, therefore, in 
sustaining defendant's motion to quash.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the order appealed from must be, as it is, hereby reversed, and 
the record of this case is, accordingly, remanded to the court of origin for 
further proceedings, not inconsistent with this decision, with the costs of this 
instance against the appellee. </p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>

concur.</p></div>
