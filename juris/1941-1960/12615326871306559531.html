				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; December&nbsp; 20, 1950,&nbsp; A. Soriano&nbsp; y&nbsp;&nbsp; Cia.,&nbsp; and the Philippine&nbsp; Iron Mines,&nbsp; Inc., both duly organized&nbsp; corporations existing under&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; with principal&nbsp; offices&nbsp; in&nbsp; Manila, entered&nbsp; into&nbsp;&nbsp; an agreement (Exhibit 1), the pertinent terms of which&nbsp; are as follows: <br><blockquote><ol><li> Iron&nbsp; Mines&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; employs Soriano as its&nbsp; Technical&nbsp; Consultant in&nbsp; connection with management and operation of other mining properties of&nbsp; which it has, under contracts, supervision&nbsp; or&nbsp; control, and&nbsp; Soriano hereby&nbsp; accepts&nbsp; such&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the terms, covenants and&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; and&nbsp; conditions hereinafter stated. <br><br></li><li> As Technical&nbsp; Consultant,&nbsp; SORIANO <i>undertakes&nbsp; and agrees to render&nbsp; complete engineering direction</i>&nbsp; on all phases of operation of the properties, opinion and&nbsp; reports necessary to fulfill the generally accepted duty of consultants relative to the&nbsp; prospecting, exploration, development, extraction, metallurgy, geology and handling of mineral properties of Iron Mines and other mineral properties under contract with it, and to lay&nbsp; out&nbsp; plans normally connected with the operation of the&nbsp; said properties, except&nbsp; such&nbsp; extraordinary plans as may&nbsp; require full&nbsp; and undivided attention of Soriano and not in the normal course of&nbsp; the exploitation of the said properties. <br><br></li><li> In addition&nbsp; to the,&nbsp; above services, SORIANO <i>further undertakes and agree* to negotiate and consummate the sale of all the products obtained front the said, mining properties</i>, and for said purpose its representative or&nbsp; representatives may be required to&nbsp; travel abroad. Soriano further&nbsp; agrees&nbsp; to check&nbsp; analysis&nbsp; and conditions of the ore from time to time at&nbsp; point of destination.&nbsp; In all&nbsp; such eases, tho travel and other&nbsp; expenses of Soriano's representatives shall be for the account of Iron&nbsp; Mines. <br><br></li><li> •&nbsp; •&nbsp; *. <br><br></li><li> For its services hereunder, Soriano wilt receive two and&nbsp; onehalf per cent (2 1/2%)&nbsp; of the gross receipts of all minerals or ore of commercial&nbsp; value&nbsp; shipped,&nbsp; payable monthly as soon&nbsp; as&nbsp; such gross receipts&nbsp; shall have been determined.&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; thereto, SORIANO shall also be entitled to&nbsp; a monthly compensation of One&nbsp; Thousand Two Hundreo Pesos&nbsp; (P1,200) for consulting services&nbsp; in Manila,, to be payable&nbsp; at the end of each&nbsp; month."&nbsp; (Exhibit 1). </li></ol></blockquote>On July 18, 1952, after A. Soriano y Cia. had voluntarily paid the 6 per cent broker's percentage tax on the amount it had received&nbsp; from&nbsp; the mining company, the former sent a letter to the Collector of Internal Revenue requesting for the refund of payments thus made corresponding to&nbsp; the period beginning from&nbsp; the 2nd quarter&nbsp; of 1950 to the 1st quarter of 1952, inclusive, amounting to P19,621.06, on the ground that the sum received&nbsp; by said company from the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc., upon which the aforementioned taxes were levied,&nbsp; partook of the nature of compensation for technical services rendered; that the work performed by the&nbsp; Company&nbsp; for&nbsp; the Iron Mines which may be considered&nbsp; as that of&nbsp; a broker, were the negotiation&nbsp; and consummation of the&nbsp; sale of the mineral products&nbsp; in&nbsp; Japan, which were rendered&nbsp; outside the jurisdiction of the Philippines;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the ruling of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue Office—Ruling,&nbsp; BIR&nbsp; 105.02, March 28,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; was&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effect that compensation of a&nbsp; local broker&nbsp; for work rendered outside the&nbsp; country is not&nbsp; subject to the percentage tax. therefore,&nbsp; those particular services performed by the Company for the Iron Mines were exempt from the broker's percentage tax.&nbsp; It appears that despite a follow-up letter dated January 22,&nbsp; 1953, the matter was not acted upon by the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue. <br><br>On July 20, 1954, the Company sent another communication this time demanding for the refund of the amount of P50,058.01 which was allegedly paid erroneously as broker's percentage tax for the period beginning from the 2nd quarter of 1952 to the 2nd quarter of 1954, citing the same Ruling&nbsp; (BIR 105.02)&nbsp; as basis for its demand, and without waiting for the action of the Collector of&nbsp; Internal Revenue, said Company filed&nbsp; on July 21, 1954, a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals, alleging that despite the letters sent to the Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; requesting the refund&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sums&nbsp; of P19,621.06 and&nbsp; P50,058.01 which were erroneously paid as broker's percentage taxes for the 2nd quarter of 1950 to the 2nd&nbsp; quarter of 1954,&nbsp; inclusive, said Official failed and refused to refund said amounts, and, therefore, prayed that same be returned to the&nbsp; Company and for such other relief and remedy as may be deemed just and equitable in the&nbsp; premises.&nbsp; On&nbsp; July 29, 1954, A. Soriano y Cia. filed an amended petition,&nbsp; this time alleging that notwithstanding the&nbsp; length of time that had elapsed, the Collector of Internal Revenue failed to answer the request of&nbsp; petitioner or&nbsp; refund the amount of P19,621.06 which at that time can no longer be recovered because the two-year period fixed by section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; for&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of a&nbsp; suit had already elapsed; that during the period of from the 2nd quarter of 1952&nbsp; to the 2nd quarter&nbsp; of 1954, inclusive, petitioner received from&nbsp; the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc., the sum of P834,305.27 itemized as follows,&nbsp; to&nbsp; wit: P25,656.75 for the last 3 quarters of 1952; P356,821.83 for&nbsp; the 4 quarters of 1953; and P226,826.69 for the&nbsp; 2 quarters of 1954, representing 2 1/2 per cent of the gross receipts.of all the min- erals&nbsp; or ore of commercial value shipped&nbsp; and sold abroad, and based on the said aggregate amount of P834,305.27, A. Soriano y Cia., voluntarily paid&nbsp; a total sum of P50,058.01 as the 6&nbsp; per cent broker's percentage tax in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of Section 195 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 588, in relation to section 194 (t) of the same Code; that respondent failed and refused to refund the said amount of P50,058,01&nbsp; as he had&nbsp; failed&nbsp; and&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; refund&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P19,621.06, and prayed that judgment be rendered ordering respondent to return&nbsp; to petitioner the sum of P50,058.01 and for&nbsp; such other relief that may be deemed&nbsp; just and equitable in the premises. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A motion to dismiss was filed&nbsp; by respondent on August 6, 1954, for lack of cause of&nbsp; action, for&nbsp; it was contended that with the exception of the amount of P5,832.98&nbsp; allegedly paid by petitioner&nbsp; as&nbsp; broker's percentage tax on July 21, 1952,&nbsp; the filing of&nbsp; the petition was premature because the Collector of Internal Revenue had not yet passed upon the claim&nbsp; for refund, that assuming that petitioner made the alleged payment on October 20,&nbsp; 1952, the Collector may yet act on the same&nbsp; before October 21, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this motion to dismiss, the respondent incorporated his answer to the 11 petition denying some of the averments therein and admitting the&nbsp; others.&nbsp; As special defenses, it was averred that under paragraph&nbsp; 3 of the so-called&nbsp; Contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; Services, petitioner was a commercial broker pursuant to Section 194&nbsp; (t) of the&nbsp; Tax Code; that under paragraph 5 of the said agreement, petitioner&nbsp; was paid&nbsp; a definite&nbsp; amount as brokerage&nbsp; fee for negotiating the sale of mineral products and that under said paragraph, petitioner had a distinct characteristic—that of a broker; that the amount of P5,832.98 (corresponding to the 2nd&nbsp; quarter of 1952) paid as broker's percentage tax was in accordance with section 195 of the Tax Code, and therefore prayed that the amended petition be dismissed, with costs&nbsp; against petitioner. <br>&nbsp;<br>Inasmuch as later the&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General received information from the&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue to the effect that the claim for refund made by petitioner was denied, the former moved for the admission of the amended answer, which&nbsp; motion was granted by resolution of the Court of September 1,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; admitting the amended&nbsp; answer&nbsp; and considering the motion to dismiss filed by the same counsel as withdrawn. <br><br>After due hearing and after the parties had filed&nbsp; their respective memoranda, the Court of Tax Appeals rendered decision on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1955, finding&nbsp; that although the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. had already a General Manager in the person of the&nbsp; Atlantic, Gulf &amp; Pacific Co. of Manila which as engineers for more than half a century had established&nbsp; an&nbsp; enviable record of service,&nbsp; it&nbsp; had&nbsp; (no need) to employ the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; as consulting engineers, and&nbsp; in so doing the reason was obvious, i.e., that such set-up was only to avail of the services of said company in order to effect negotiations for the&nbsp; sale of ore to Japan as in fact it was through the representation of Col. Soriano that the Philippine Iron Mines was able to sell over 4,500,000 tons of ore which&nbsp; put said mining company back on its feet.&nbsp; It was, therefore, held that the main and principal&nbsp; purpose for which&nbsp; petitioner was&nbsp; employed by&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Iron Mines, Inc., was to negotiate and consummate the sale&nbsp; of all the products obtained from its mining properties; that although said petitioner undertook and agreed to render engineering direction&nbsp; services,&nbsp; this was&nbsp;&nbsp; only necessary to maintain a favorable volume of sales to the Japanese and to be able to show that the company could fulfill its&nbsp; commitments, declaring&nbsp; that said employment as a consultant was only&nbsp; a means to its principal occupation&nbsp; as a broker. It was observed by&nbsp; the trial court that the compensation for petitioner was not on a fixed monthly basis but based on the gross receipts of all minerals of commercial&nbsp; value shipped and&nbsp; sold; that the compensation&nbsp; received by petitioner was entered in its books as&nbsp; full commission, and made&nbsp; the&nbsp; pronouncement that the&nbsp; exaction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tax would&nbsp; not be violative of the due process clause of the&nbsp; Constitution because what was&nbsp; taxed was not the business of the brokerage transactions&nbsp; of the broker&nbsp; but only his right to&nbsp; receive compensation in the exercise of an occupation recognized by our&nbsp; laws, and,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; affirmed the decision&nbsp; of the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; denying the Company's claim for refund. <br><br>A.&nbsp; Soriano y Cia.&nbsp; appealed from the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; to Us maintaining that the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Tax&nbsp; Appeals erred: <br><blockquote><ol><li> In holding that the petitioner is&nbsp; employed under the contract as a&nbsp; broker; <br></li><li> In holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; services&nbsp; performed by&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; under paragraphs 2 and 3 of the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; constituted an occupation of a broker, that the&nbsp; total compensation&nbsp; derived therefrom&nbsp; are&nbsp; subject to the broker's percentage taxes&nbsp; prescribed in section&nbsp; 195&nbsp; of the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended; <br></li><li> In finding without reasonable support of sufficient evidence that the employment of the petitioner&nbsp; as&nbsp; consulting&nbsp; engineers is&nbsp; merely an incident&nbsp; of its commitment&nbsp; to&nbsp; negotiate and&nbsp; consummate the sales of all the products of the Philippine&nbsp; Iron Mines; <br></li><li> In holding that the broker's percentage tax prescribed in&nbsp; section 195 of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code is a tax on the privilege of: receiving&nbsp; compensation from the&nbsp; exorcise of an occupation&nbsp; and not a tax on brokerage transactions; <br></li><li> In holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission from&nbsp; brokerage&nbsp; transactions made and consummated in Japan&nbsp; is&nbsp; subject to the broker's percentage&nbsp; tax in the Philippines; <br></li><li> In holding that the fact that the full&nbsp; amount of compensation received by&nbsp; the petitioner from&nbsp; the Philippine Iron&nbsp; Mines, Inc. under&nbsp; paragraphs 2 and 3 of the contract&nbsp; was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; as commissions is convincing evidence that&nbsp; the said amount constitutes brokerage commission; <br></li><li> In holding&nbsp; that the collection from the petitioner&nbsp; of a broker's percentage&nbsp; tax on&nbsp; commission&nbsp; from' brokerage transactions&nbsp; made and&nbsp; consummated in Japan does&nbsp; not deprive the petitioner&nbsp; of its&nbsp; property without due process of law; and <br></li><li> In denying the refund of the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P50,058.01&nbsp; as broker's percentage&nbsp; taxes erroneously paid by petitioner on the&nbsp; total&nbsp; gross compensation received by it from the&nbsp; Philippine Iron Mines, Inc. for services under paragraphs 2 and 3&nbsp; of the contract. </li></ol></blockquote>There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; facts already&nbsp; narrated, and consolidating the&nbsp; questions raised by&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; and reducing them to bare essentials, the main issues are: (1) whether the amount of&nbsp; P834,305.27 was received by petitioner A. Soriano y Cia, from the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc., as commission or as compensation for technical services;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2) whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector of&nbsp; Internal Revenue has&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; collect the&nbsp; 6 per cent of&nbsp; said commission as broker's percentage tax, for the right&nbsp; of receiving compensation&nbsp; for the&nbsp; exercise of an occupation recognized by our&nbsp; laws. <br><br>I. A perusal of&nbsp; paragraphs&nbsp; 2&nbsp; and 3 of the&nbsp; contract (Exhibit&nbsp; A)&nbsp; will reveal that the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc.,&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; the services of petitioner&nbsp; not&nbsp; only for technical&nbsp; consultation but&nbsp; also&nbsp; to negotiate and&nbsp; consummate&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of all the mineral products obtainable from the mining properties of the former, and that in consideration of these services,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter was&nbsp; to receive 2 1/2&nbsp; percent of the gross receipts&nbsp; of the ore&nbsp; or mineral of commercial value shipped,&nbsp; payable&nbsp; monthly as soon as such gross receipts shall have been determined (paragraph&nbsp; 5,. Exhibit A).&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; also no&nbsp; dispute that for <i>consultation</i> services&nbsp; in&nbsp; Manila, petitioner was going&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive the fixed&nbsp; amount of P1,200 every month. <br><br>A.&nbsp; Soriano y Cia. tried1 to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; the fact that it had rendered&nbsp; technical&nbsp; services&nbsp; to&nbsp; the mining company&nbsp; by presenting evidence that it&nbsp; assigned to work for the latter 6 mining engineers&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1952; 13 in 1953;&nbsp; and 11&nbsp; in the first 7 months of 1954,&nbsp; which costs the petitioner a total sum of P242,147.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the facts brought about during the regular&nbsp; meeting of the Board of&nbsp; Directors&nbsp; of the Philippine Iron Mines&nbsp; held&nbsp; on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1954, will shed some&nbsp; light as to the purpose behind&nbsp; such efforts of petitioner.&nbsp; The Minutes of said meeting contain the following: <br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; this&nbsp; connection,&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Belden (President), desiring to clarify the&nbsp; position&nbsp; and the&nbsp; work performed by&nbsp; the General&nbsp; Managers and tile&nbsp; Consulting Engineers,&nbsp; explained to&nbsp; Mr. Tuason (Director) that after liberation,&nbsp; prior to&nbsp; the Company's resuming operations in 1948, <i>it was feared that it would not be&nbsp; able&nbsp; to sell a&nbsp; single ton of&nbsp; ore&nbsp; until Col&nbsp; Soriano&nbsp; contacted&nbsp; SCAP Headqiiarters&nbsp; in Tokyo, and&nbsp; the Company&nbsp; was able to sell 200,000 tons. At that time, A. Soriano y Cia., as Consulting Engineers, arranged for the contracts and for the acquisition of the ore and thereafter secured more&nbsp; and&nbsp; more contracts for additional deliveries to Japan</i>,&nbsp; which in effect,,put the company back on its feet.&nbsp; Col. Soriano then added that it was&nbsp; the function of the SCAP to help rehabilitate the economy of Japan and one of&nbsp; the ways of doing1 this was by assuring a supply&nbsp; of ore&nbsp; for'&nbsp; its mills, which ore was available from&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; Col.&nbsp; Soriano&nbsp; pointed out that the economy of&nbsp; Japan and of the Philippines&nbsp; are complimentary to&nbsp; each&nbsp; other, and that the sale&nbsp; of ore to Japan had succeeded in the resumption of&nbsp; operations at Larap.&nbsp; That is the reason, he said, why the company needs General Managers and Consulting Engineers. <br><br>"Continuing the. discussion on this point, Mr. Belden said that in order to&nbsp; maintain a favorable volume of sales&nbsp; to tho Japanese Steel Mills and to assure them of&nbsp; a supply of ore, the company has established this&nbsp; particular set-up&nbsp; and has been able to . show&nbsp; at all times that it can fulfill all its commitments. Up to the present, he said, the Company had&nbsp; been, able to sell Over 4,500,000 tons of iron ore, which has&nbsp; never&nbsp; been done before,&nbsp; thanks to the&nbsp; efforts of the Consulting &nbsp; Engineers", (pp. 87-88,&nbsp; Original-Record.)</blockquote>From&nbsp; the aforequoted&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the Minutes of said meeting, We cannot help but notice that the mining company was&nbsp; on the&nbsp; verge of disaster, fearing&nbsp; that it&nbsp; would not be able to sell a&nbsp; single ton of ore, but for the contracts made by Col. Soriano&nbsp; with the&nbsp; SCAP Headquarters&nbsp; in Tokyo, Japan, and from then on, more and more contracts for the delivery of ore to said country were&nbsp; made possible through&nbsp; the intervention of&nbsp; A. Soriano y Cia., supposedly Consulting Engineers. <br><blockquote>Section&nbsp; 194&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code contains the following definition: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 194. Words and Phrases Defined,—(t) Commercial&nbsp; broker includes all persons, other than importers, manufacturers, producers, or <i>bona fids</i> employees,&nbsp; <i>who, for compensation</i>&nbsp; or profit, sell or bring about sales or purchases of merchandise for other persons, or <i>bring proposed buyers and sellers together</i>, or negotiate freights or other business for owners of vessels,&nbsp; or&nbsp; other means of transportation, or for&nbsp; shippers, or .consignors or consignees&nbsp; of freight carried by vessels or other means of transportation.&nbsp; The term includes commission merchants"</blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;And it is also said that: <br><blockquote> A broker is one <i>who is engaged for others on a commission, to negotiate contracts relative to property with the custody of&nbsp; which he has&nbsp; no concern</i> (12 C. J. S.&nbsp; 53). </blockquote>&nbsp;The record bears out the fact that it was solely&nbsp; through the&nbsp; efforts of Col. Soriano that the mining company&nbsp; was able to&nbsp; make sales of&nbsp; ore&nbsp; to Japan&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; more&nbsp; and more&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; were&nbsp; effected through&nbsp; the&nbsp; mediation of A.&nbsp; Soriano y Cia.&nbsp; For compensation,&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Soriano y&nbsp; Cia. received the amount corresp6nding to 21/2&nbsp; per cent of the gross receipts of the sales made by the mining company, and it was not shown that the former ever acquired custody of the properties of the latter.&nbsp; It, therefore,&nbsp; dawns upon Us that the nature of the work of petitioner, A.&nbsp; Soriano y Cia. is that&nbsp; of a broker.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even granting&nbsp; that it&nbsp; had also&nbsp; rendered consultation&nbsp; services,&nbsp; the same were&nbsp; only needed in order to assure the Japanese Steel Mills&nbsp; of a steady supply of ore,&nbsp; which ultimately redounded to its benefit because petitioner was always to get 2 1/2 Per cent of the&nbsp; receipts from these sales.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is really quite&nbsp; hard to comprehend why the mining&nbsp; company&nbsp; would secure&nbsp; and employ the services of petitioner, A.&nbsp; Soriano y&nbsp; Cia., as Technical Consultant and for&nbsp; complete&nbsp; engineering direction when the Philippine Iron Mines, Inc., already counted with the services, as&nbsp; General Manager, of the&nbsp; Atlantic, Gulf &amp;&nbsp; Pacific Co. of&nbsp; Manila, a "corporation duly registered and licensed to do business in the Philippines, which, as&nbsp; stated in the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from "as&nbsp; engineers for&nbsp; more than half a century has established an&nbsp; enviable record&nbsp; of&nbsp; service".&nbsp; And the&nbsp; Minutes&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; E)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Board meeting&nbsp; previously quoted&nbsp; supplied, the&nbsp;&nbsp; link and revealed the real&nbsp; intent&nbsp; in availing,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; services 1 of&nbsp; petitioner. For this reason, We&nbsp; are&nbsp; inclined to believe that the 2%&nbsp; per cent of the&nbsp; gross receipts from the&nbsp; sales&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the mining company,&nbsp; amounting to P834,305.27, received by petitioner was in consideration of its duty as a&nbsp; broker&nbsp; and not&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical&nbsp; Consultant although the monthly compensation&nbsp; of P1,200 for&nbsp; consulting services in Manila&nbsp; (paragraph 5 of Exhibit 1) might have been paid on this account. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Having arrived at the conclusion that the compensation received by petitioner partook of the nature of brokerage commission,&nbsp; We will next determine whether the Collector of Internal Revenue had the&nbsp; right to&nbsp; collect&nbsp; said 6&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; brokerage percentage&nbsp; tax&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into account&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the brokerage transactions were&nbsp; allegedly. consummated outside&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; jurisdiction. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Petitioner, in its.brief,&nbsp; assailed the ruling of the lower court holding that the broker's percentage tax prescribed in section 195&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; is&nbsp; a tax on the privilege of receiving compensation from&nbsp; the exercise of&nbsp; an occupation&nbsp; and&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; tax&nbsp; on&nbsp; brokerage transactions,&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; theory would have been&nbsp; correct if the tax involved herein were&nbsp; inheritance or death taxes.&nbsp; And in substantiating&nbsp; its stand that the tax in question is a business tax, cited Section&nbsp; 193 (<i>q</i>) of the Tax Code, which&nbsp; prescribes&nbsp; the following: <br><blockquote> "Sec. 193. <i>Amount' of Tax on Business.</i>—Fixed taxes on business shall be collected as follows, the amount stated being' for the'whole year, when not otherwise specified:<br>&nbsp;<br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>&nbsp;(q)&nbsp; Stockbrokers, dealers in securities,&nbsp; real estate&nbsp; brokers,&nbsp; real estate dealers, <i>commercial brokers</i>, customs brokers, and immigration brokers, one hundred fifty pesos. <br>&nbsp;<br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></blockquote>&nbsp;and asserted that the object of the broker's tax referred to in Sections 193 and 195 of the Tax Code is the negotiation&nbsp; or&nbsp; the bringing&nbsp; together of&nbsp; proposed buyers and sellers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; concluded then that since the negotiations in the case at bar were effected&nbsp; in Japan, the compensation received in virtue&nbsp; thereof are not taxable in the Philippines.<br><br>There is&nbsp; no question&nbsp; that&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 193- (q)&nbsp; aforequoted imposes,a fixed rate of P150.00 a year as tax on the business of brokerage, but Section 4,95 of the same code, also referred to&nbsp; by petitioner, treats of&nbsp; a different&nbsp; nature. Said section contains&nbsp; the following: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 195. Percentage <i>TAX&nbsp; ON&nbsp; STOCK, REAL ESTATE, COMMERCIAL, CUSTOMS, AND IMMIGRATION BROKERS</i>—Stock, real&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; <i>commercial</i>,&nbsp; customs, and immigration&nbsp; brokers&nbsp; shall pay a percentage tax equivalent&nbsp; to <i>6 percent&nbsp; of the gross compensation</i> received by them * *." </blockquote>It is clear, therefore, that brokerage is subject to 2 different taxes—-one for the business itself, which is a specific amount fixed by Section&nbsp; 193 of&nbsp; the Tax Code, and another&nbsp; is imposed by Section&nbsp; 195 of. the same code, which is 6 per cent of the gross compensation to be received on account of the brokerage.&nbsp; The latter form of tax is not an exaction on the business, nor on the business transactions, but on the <i>compensation </i>resulting from said transactions&nbsp; and by reason of said business which appellant&nbsp; company&nbsp; received in Manila.<br><br>In the light of the distinction drawn above. We&nbsp; declare that the amount of P50,058.01&nbsp; paid by petitioner in&nbsp; accordance with section 195 of the&nbsp; Tax Code&nbsp; is a levy, not on . the brokerage transactions effected outside of the Philippines, but on the <i>compensation</i> received by petitioner as a broker from another domestic corporation, in virtue of a contract executed in the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties, in executing the same, subjected themselves to the taxing jurisdiction&nbsp; of this country.<br><br>Wherefore, and on&nbsp; the&nbsp; strength of the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against petitioner-appellant.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp;&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp;&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Baututa Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Conception, Reyes, J.
