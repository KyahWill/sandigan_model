				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal taken by&nbsp; the Solicitor-General from the decision of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Zamboanga dated July 24, 1939, granting the petition for naturalization filed by Lam Swee&nbsp; Sang on November 16,&nbsp; 1938.<br><br>It appears that&nbsp; the petitioner herein, Lam Swee Sang, was born on May 8, 1900, at Jolo, Sulu, of a Chinese father and a Filipino (Moro)&nbsp; mother, and that he&nbsp; has been continuously residing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines ever since.&nbsp; He has married a Filipino woman by whom he has three children all of whom are residing in the Philippines.&nbsp; The Solicitor-General opposed the petition on the ground that the petitioner's father being a Chinese citizen, petitioner is also a Chinese citizen and hence ineligible to Philippine citizenship by naturalization under paragraph (e) of section&nbsp; 1 of the Naturalization&nbsp; Law (Act No. 2927).<br><br>The trial court after&nbsp; declaring Lam Swee Sang to be a citizen of the Philippines, on the authority of the cases relied upon, ordered the issuance in his favor of the&nbsp; corresponding certificate of naturalization.&nbsp; It should be&nbsp; observed that if the petitioner is already a Filipino citizen, the present proceedings would be superfluous, and "it would be absurd&nbsp; to issue in his favor a certificate of naturalization as a Filipino citizen.&nbsp; (Basilio Santos Co vs. The Government of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; 52 Phil., 543.)&nbsp; The trial court correctly held that the petitioner is a Filipino citizen.&nbsp; (Roa vs. Collector of Customs, 23 Phil., 315; Torres vs. Tan Chim, G. R. No. 46593, promulgated February 3, 1940; Gallofin vs. Ordonez, G. R. No. 46782, promulgated June 27, 1940; Tan Chong vs. Secretary of Labor, G. R. No. 47616, promulgated October 15,&nbsp; 1941.) In view of this conclusion, the instant proceedings&nbsp; are dismissed without pronouncement&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avancena, C.J., Abad Santos,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz, JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Moran</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ</span>., dissented on the grounds expressed in Torres vs. Tan Chim.<br></div>
