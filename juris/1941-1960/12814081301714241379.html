<p>belonging to Leonides Pablo in the aggregate sum of P100, against their will 
and to their damage and prejudice in the said sum of P100."</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 4, 1947, the other accused not having been apprehended, only 
Feliciano Valderama was arraigned. He pleaded not guilty to the information. 
Thereupon, the prosecution called the first witness Leonides Pablo, who gave his 
testimony. After the conclusion of this witness's testimony, the prosecution 
called its second witness named Emerenciana de San Jose "to prove the robbery 
committed in the house of Inocencio Mateo," as petitioner alleges in paragraph 3 
of the petition.</p>
<p>According to the respondent judge's order (Annex B of the petition), "after 
arraignment and while the second witness for the prosecution was testifying, the 
defense counsel objected to her testimony tending to prove that a robbery was 
committed in the house of Inocencio Mateo, after the first witness had testified 
to a robbery committed in the house of Leonides Pablo." This objection provoked 
the raising of a question which gave rise to the present petition for certiorari 
and mandamus. That question is whether or not the defendant Feliciano Valderama 
in not moving to quash the information upon the ground that more than one 
offense was charged therein before pleading thereto, waived all objection upon 
that ground later in the proceedings.</p>
<p>The respondent judge ruled in his aforesaid order Annex B that under Rule 
113, section 10, waiver of objection for duplicity can only be predicated upon 
failure to move to quash upon such ground where the duplicity "clearly appears 
on the face of the information." His Honor was of opinion that in the 
above-quoted information said defect is not clearly apparent.</p>
<p>Whether two offenses of robbery are alleged in the information, or only one, 
we do not decide. But even hypothetically supposing that the former is the case, 
that the information would have been subject to objection for duplicity if 
timely made, the fact is that for failure to raise the objection before pleading 
to the information, the defendant "shall be taken to have waived" such 
objection. Rule 113, section 10 partly provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * If the defendant does not move to quash the complaint or information 
before he pleads thereto he shall be taken to have waived all objections which 
are grounds for a motion to quash except when the complaint or information does 
not charge an offense, or the court is without jurisdiction of the same * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon this point, we should consider as of decisive importance a very radical 
innovation introduced by Rule 113, sections 1, 2, and 10, in relation with 
General Orders No. 58, upon the subject "demurrer and pleas", particularly 
sections 19 and 21. Section 19 provided that "If, on the arraignment, the 
defendant requires it, he must be allowed a reasonable time, not less than one 
day", to demur or plead to the complaint or information. Section 21 
provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defendant may demur to the complaint or information when it appears on 
the face thereof—</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"3. That more than one offense is charged; except only in those cases in 
which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various allied 
offenses."</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Rule 113, section 1—evincing an aim at a speedier trial 
than General Orders No. 58 did—directs that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon being arraigned the defendant <i>shall immediately</i> (italics 
supplied), unless the court grants him further time, either move to quash the 
complaint or information or plead thereto, or do both. If he moves to quash, 
without pleading, and the motion is withdrawn or overruled he <i>shall 
immediately plead</i>" (italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 2 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The defendant may move to quash the complaint or information on any of 
the following grounds:</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"(<i>e</i>) That more than one offense is charged except in those cases in 
which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various offenses;"</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 10 mandatorily ordains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * If the defendant does not move to quash the complaint or information 
before he pleads thereto he <i>shall</i> be taken to have waived all objections 
which are grounds for a motion to quash except when the complaint or information 
does not charge an offense or the court is without jurisdiction of the same. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p>The mandatory provision last above quoted did not exist in General Orders No. 
58. Neither was there an equivalent provision therein.</p>
<p>And in the jurisprudence which developed from the above-quoted provisions of 
section 21 of General Orders No. 58, it came to be held that when the accused 
does not demur upon the ground of duplicity and goes to trial under the 
complaint or information charging him with more than one offense, he could not 
be heard to complain on appeal against that defect. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Zapanta, 
13 Phil., 409; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Balaba, 37 Phil., 260; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Jamad, 
37 Phil., 305; People <i>vs</i>. Alafriz, 53 Phil., 583; People <i>vs</i>. 
Benito, 57 Phil., 587.) In other words, he was held to have waived the 
objection. On the other hand, Rule 113, section 10, <i>dispenses entirely</i> 
with the necessity of the defendant without objection going to trial down to the 
final judgment of the trial court, in order to hold him to have waived all 
objections based upon any ground on which a motion to quash could have been 
made. If he does not move to quash the complaint or information before he pleads 
thereto "he <i>shall</i> (italics supplied) be taken to have waived all 
objections which are grounds for a motion to quash * * *." If we are now to 
require, before declaring the waiver to have taken place, that the defendant 
first go to trial down to the final judgment of the trial court, as 
<i>before</i>, we would be writing the very important innovation thus introduced 
by said section 10 entirely off the Rules of Court. Mark that said provision 
uses "shall" characteristic of mandatory precepts. We are clearly of opinion 
that this provision denied the trial judge all discretion in the matter, and 
made it his peremptory duty to take the defendant as having waived the 
objection, and to proceed with the already commenced trial accordingly. So long 
as this rule remains in force, it must be obeyed not alone by the parties and 
counsel in criminal cases, but more particularly by the judges who are to take 
cognizance of, try and decide them.</p>
<p>Wherefore, judgment will be entered ordering the respondent judge to proceed 
with the trial of the above-mentioned case, which has already been commenced, 
upon the information already referred to by continuing the examination of the 
second witness for the prosecution, Emerenciana de San Jose, its conclusion, and 
proceeding with the rest of the evidence of one and the other party in the usual 
manner, down to final judgment. No costs will be allowed. So 
ordered.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i>

<p>PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>I concur in the result. I do not think that the testimony of a witness to 
prove that robbery was committed in the house of Inocencio Mateo, after a 
witness had testified that robbery was committed in the house of Leonides Pablo, 
would necessarily have the effect of charging the defendant with two robberies. 
Whether two offenses are charged in an information must not be made to depend 
upon the evidence presented at the trial but upon the facts alleged in the 
information. I am of the opinion that the facts alleged in the information do 
not clearly show that two robberies are charged. For that reason, failure by the 
defendant to move to quash the information on the ground of duplicity of 
offenses charged could not constitute a waiver. Hence the order of the 
respondent Court requiring the petitioner Provincial Fiscal of Nueva Ecija to 
choose or elect which of the two offenses he would stand on is not only 
erroneous but also constitutes a grave abuse of discretion; and as there is no 
other plain, adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law, for no 
appeal may be taken from the order complained of, the writ applied for herein 
must be granted. The order must be set aside, and the respondent Court directed 
to proceed with the trial of the case until final judgment allowing the second 
witness Emerenciana de San Jose to testify.</p>

<p>Petitioner prays that respondent judge be ordered to proceed to try criminal 
case No. 398 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija under the information 
as filed by petitioner on December 7, 1946, and that we set aside the order of 
respondent judge dated March 18, 1947.</p>
<p>The main question in this case is whether the facts alleged in the 
information, quoted in the above order, alleges one offense, as contended by the 
defense, or two offenses, as petitioner pretends. There is no quarrel as to the 
legal effects in each case and as to what should be the logical outcome of 
either contention.</p>
<p>As drafted and as we read it, we do not have any doubt that defense's 
position is entirely correct.</p>
<p>No complete copy of the information was filed with us, so we have to rely on 
the following paragraphs, presumably contained in the body of the information as 
quoted in the order of the lower court dated March 18, 1947, marked as Annex B 
of the petition:</p>

<p>All the above appear in the order under the following statement: "When the 
case reached the Court of First Instance, these defendants were accused of 
<i>robbery</i> (italics ours) committed according to the information as 
follows:"</p>
<p>The text of the information unmistakably convey the idea that only one 
robbery was committed, although with two victims, Inocencio Mateo and Leonides 
Pablo, the owners of the articles stolen.</p>
<p>No matter what the intention of the drafter of the information, the facts 
alleged therein show that only one robbery was committed. The reasons are:</p>
<ol><li>There is singleness of date, October 8, 1946. 
<p></p>
</li><li>There is singleness of place, the Municipality of Gapan. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>There is singleness of jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the lower court. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>There is singleness of act between the several accused, who are alleged to 
have conspired together and mutually aided one another. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>There is singleness in the intent to gain. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>There is singleness in the taking and carrying away of the articles. 
<p></p>
<p></p>
</li><li>And, finally, there is singleness in the word "robbery," used in singular 
number, in the order Annex B, which should have taken it from the first 
paragraph of the information which usually contains the allegation that the 
signer of the information accuses defendants with the crime imputed to them. 
</li></ol>In case there is any doubt as to the ideas conveyed by the information 
and there is any ambiguity as to whether it alleges only one offense, as read by 
counsel for the defense, or two or more offenses, as contended by the provincial 
fiscal, the doubt and ambiguity must be decided against the writer of the 
information, according to a well-known principle of documentary interpretation. 
And the rule appears to be more compelling if we take into consideration that 
the provincial fiscal had the inescapable duty, by constitutional mandate, of 
informing the accused "of the nature and cause of the accusation against him." 
(Section 1 [17], Article III of the Constitution.) 
<p>If during the trial, it appeared that the prosecution's purpose was to charge 
the accused with two offenses, as happened to have been revealed in the case in 
question, the lower court acted correctly in issuing the order of March 18, 
1947, Annex B of the petition, and which is attached to this opinion as appendix 
and part thereof.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we are of opinion that the petition is completely 
without merit and should be denied.</p>

<p>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 398.—THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, complainant,

<p align="center">ORDER</p>
<p>It appears that in a criminal complaint filed by the Chief of Police of 
Gapan, Nueva Ecija, the above-named defendant together with several others were 
charged with two robberies with violence, one in the house of Inocencio Mateo 
and another in the house of Leonides Pablo. Supporting affidavits attest to this 
fact. When the case reached the Court of First Instance, these defendants were

<p>After arraignment and while the second witness for the prosecution was 
testifying, the defense counsel objected to her testimony tending to prove that 
a robbery was committed in the house of Inocencio Mateo, after the first witness 
had testified to a robbery committed in the house of Leonides Pablo.</p>
<p>The Provincial Fiscal argued that the defense counsel having failed to raise 
the question of duplicity before the defendants pleaded, they thereby waived the 
objection on the ground of duplicity (section 10, Rule 113). He further argued 
that in prohibiting the allegation of more than one offense in the same 
information, the law seeks to give the accused a chance to properly prepare his 
defense—which purpose has been subserved in the present information which 
mentions the two offended parties, Inocencio Mateo and Leonides Pablo; and that 
at any rate, only one offense is charged in the information.</p>
<p>For his part, defense counsel contends that the information does not charge 
two crimes and that he had a right to assume that only one crime was charged in 
the information notwithstanding that two offended parties are named therein, as 
it was the duty of the Fiscal to do. He further moves that the Provincial Fiscal 
be required to elect on which offense to stand, whether the robbery committed in 
the house of Leonides Pablo or that committed in the house of Inocencio 
Mateo.</p>
<p>Although section 10, Rule 113 in declaring that when an accused pleads 
without moving to quash the information, he would be deemed to have waived all 
objections which are grounds for a motion to quash, the court believes that this 
rule in so far as duplicity is concerned is applicable only where the 
duplicitousness clearly appears on the face of the information. Moreover, 
general principle of waiver, be it implied or express, requires that the party 
deemed waiving has knowledge of the right he does waive. The mere mention of two 
victims of robbery in the information does not necessarily imply two separate 
and distinct offenses as they could have been held up simultaneously, thus 
giving rise only to one offense. Under the circumstances, the following rule is 
considered controlling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Necessity for Election</i>.—(<i>a</i>) In General. When one offense is 
charged and the evidence tends to show that more than one has been committed 
within the period of limitations prior to the presentation of the indictment, 
and either of them would support the charge in the indictment, the prosecution 
may be required to elect upon which it will rely for a conviction, although the 
charges are only misdemeanors: since, while the different acts may be proper as 
evidence in aid of the particular charge in the indictment, defendant is 
entitled to know which specific act is relied on for a conviction in order that 
he may properly meet the charge, and in order that a conviction shall not be a 
matter of choice between offenses." (16 C. J., p. 860, section 
2169.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the cases holding that a failure to demur would authorize 
the court to convict the defendants for as many offenses as there are charged in 
the information and proven (37 Phil., 260, 305; 50 Phil., 771; 53 Phil., 583; 57 
Phil., 587) are applicable only where two offenses are clearly charged in the 
information and the accused proceeded with the trial without objection on the 
ground of duplicity,—conditions not existing in the present case.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the Provincial Fiscal is hereby required to choose which of the 
two offenses, robbery in the house of Inocencio Mateo or the robbery in the 
house of Leonides Pablo, he could elect to stand on, reserving to the Government 
the right to prosecute the other crime not so elected.</p>
<p>It is so ordered.</p>
