				<H3>FERNANDO IGNACIO AND  SIMEON DE LA  CRUZ, PETITIONERS AND, APPELLANTS VS. THE HONORABLE NORBERTO  ELA, MAYOR  OF  STA.   CRUZ,  ZAMBALES,  RESPONDENT   AND APPELLEE.<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioners,&nbsp; in their behalf and&nbsp; for the benefit of other Jehovah's Witnesses in the province of Zambales, brought this action&nbsp; to&nbsp; compel respondent to grant them&nbsp; a&nbsp; permit to hold a public meeting at the public plaza&nbsp; of Sta. Cruz, Zambales, together with&nbsp; the&nbsp; kiosk, on such date and time as may be applied for by them.</p><p>Respondent,&nbsp; in his answer stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had not&nbsp; refused the&nbsp; request of petitioners&nbsp; to hold a religious meeting&nbsp; at the public plaza as in fact he gave them permission to use the northwestern part&nbsp; of the plaza&nbsp; on&nbsp; July 27, 1952, but they declined&nbsp; to avail&nbsp; of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; prayed that the action be&nbsp; dismissed.</p><p>The questions of fact raised in&nbsp; the pleadings being not controverted,&nbsp; and petitioners having submitted a motion for judgment on. the pleading?, which was concurred in by&nbsp; respondent, the&nbsp; court rendered a&nbsp; decision dismissing the case&nbsp; without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp; Plaintiffs appealed&nbsp; from this decision.</p><p>It appears&nbsp; that petitioners are&nbsp; members of the Watch Tower&nbsp; Bible&nbsp; and Tract Society, commonly known&nbsp; as Jehovah's&nbsp; Witnesses, whose&nbsp; tenets&nbsp; and&nbsp; principles&nbsp; are derogatory to those professed by the Catholic organization. In its publication "face the pacts", that society&nbsp; branded the latter as a religious organization which is "a part of the monstrosity now appearing in and claiming the right to rule the earth."&nbsp;&nbsp; Desiring to&nbsp; hold a meeting in furtherance&nbsp; of its&nbsp; objectives,&nbsp; petitioners asked respondent to give them&nbsp; permission to&nbsp; use&nbsp; the public&nbsp; plaza&nbsp; together with the&nbsp; kiosk, but, instead of granting the permission, respondent&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; them to hold their&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; on the northwestern&nbsp; part corner of the plaza.&nbsp; He adopted as a policy not to&nbsp; allow the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of the kiosk for&nbsp; any&nbsp; meeting by any religious&nbsp; denomination as it is his belief that said kiosk&nbsp; should&nbsp; only be used "for&nbsp; legal purposes."&nbsp; And when their request for reconsideration was&nbsp; denied, petitioners instituted the present action for mandamus. It is now contended by petitioners that the&nbsp; action taken by respondent is unconstitutional&nbsp; being an&nbsp; abridgment of the freedom of speech, assembly, and worship guaranteed by&nbsp; our Constitution.</p><p>The&nbsp; issue&nbsp; raised&nbsp; involves&nbsp; a little digression&nbsp; on the extent to which&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to peacefully assemble guaranteed by the Constitution may be invoked.&nbsp; Fortunately, this issue has already been&nbsp; passed upon by this Court in Primicias <em>vs.</em> Fugoso,&nbsp; 45 Official&nbsp; Gazette,&nbsp; 3280,&nbsp; wherein this Court&nbsp; said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The right to freedom of speech, and to peacefully assemble and petition the government for redress of&nbsp; grievances, are fundamental personal rights of the people recognized and&nbsp; guaranteed by the constitutions of democratic countries.&nbsp; But&nbsp; it&nbsp; is a&nbsp; settled principle growing out&nbsp; of the nature&nbsp; of well-ordered civil&nbsp; societies that the exercise of those rights&nbsp; is not absolute for it may be&nbsp; so regulated that&nbsp; it&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; be&nbsp; injurious to the equal&nbsp; enjoyment of&nbsp; others having equal rights,&nbsp; nor injurious to the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of the community or society.&nbsp; The power to regulate the exercise of such and other constitutional rights is termed the sovereign 'police power', which is the power to prescribe regulations, to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety, and general welfare&nbsp; of the people.&nbsp; This sovereign&nbsp; police power is&nbsp; exercised by&nbsp; the government through its legislative branch by the enactment of laws regulating those and&nbsp; other&nbsp; constitutional and civil rights, and it may be delegated&nbsp; to political subdivisions,&nbsp; such as towns, municipalities and cities by authorizing their&nbsp; legislative bodies called municipal and city councils to enact ordinances&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose."</p></blockquote><p>It therefore appears that the right to freedom of speech and to&nbsp; peacefully assemble,&nbsp; though guaranteed&nbsp; by&nbsp; our Constitution,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not absolute,&nbsp; for it may be regulated in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; may not&nbsp; be "injurious to the equal, enjoyment of others&nbsp; having&nbsp; equal rights, nor injurious to the rights of the community or society", and this&nbsp; power may be exercised under the "police power" of the&nbsp; state, which is the power&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; prescribe&nbsp; regulations to promote&nbsp; the health, morals, peace, education,&nbsp; good order or safety, and general welfare of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that there is&nbsp; no law nor ordinance&nbsp; which expressly&nbsp; confers upon respondents the power to regulate the use&nbsp; of the public&nbsp; plaza, together.with its kiosk,&nbsp; for the purposes for which it was established, but such power may be exercised&nbsp; under his broad powers as&nbsp; chief&nbsp; executive in&nbsp; connection with his specific duty&nbsp; "to issue orders relating to the police&nbsp; or to public&nbsp; safety"&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp;&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 2194, paragraph c,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code).&nbsp; And it may even be said&nbsp; that the above regulation has been adopted as an implementation of the constitutional provision which prohibits any public property to be used,&nbsp; directly or indirectly,&nbsp; by&nbsp; any&nbsp; religious&nbsp; denomination&nbsp;&nbsp; (paragraph&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, section 23,&nbsp; Article VI of the Constitution).</p><p>The power exercised by respondent cannot be considered as capricious&nbsp; or arbitrary considering the peculiar circumstances of this case.&nbsp; It appears&nbsp; that the&nbsp; public&nbsp; plaza, particularly the kiosk, is located at a short distance from the&nbsp; Roman&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Church.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; proximity&nbsp; of&nbsp; said church to the kiosk has caused some&nbsp; concern on the part of the authorities that to avoid disturbance of peace and order, or&nbsp; the&nbsp; happening&nbsp; of untoward&nbsp; incidents, they deemed it necessary to prohibit&nbsp; the&nbsp; use of that kiosk by any religious denomination as a place&nbsp; of meeting&nbsp; of its members.&nbsp; This was the policy adopted by respondent for sometime previous to the&nbsp; request made by&nbsp; petitioners. Respondent never denied such&nbsp; request but merely tried to enforce his policy by assigning&nbsp; them the northwestern part of the public plaza.&nbsp; It cannot therefore be said that petitioners were denied their constitutional right&nbsp; to assemble for, as was said, such right&nbsp; is subject to regulation to&nbsp; maintain public order&nbsp; and&nbsp; public&nbsp; safety.&nbsp; This is especially so considering that the tenets of&nbsp; petitioners congregation are derogatory to those of the Roman Catholic Church, a factor which&nbsp; respondent must have&nbsp; considered in denying their request.</p><p>It is true that the&nbsp; foregoing conclusion&nbsp; is&nbsp; predicated on&nbsp; facts which do not appear&nbsp; in&nbsp; the pleadings&nbsp; nor are supported by any evidence&nbsp; because&nbsp; none was presented for the reason that&nbsp; the&nbsp; case was submitted on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,&nbsp; but those facts like the situation of the "kiosko" and the occurrence of religious controversies which&nbsp; disturbed the peace and order&nbsp; in the municipality of&nbsp; Sta.&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; are&nbsp; matters&nbsp; which may be deemed to come&nbsp; within the judicial&nbsp; knowledge of the court as in fact they were so considered by the trial judge in his decision.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; what he said on this point: "The presiding judge, through information, personal&nbsp; experience and through the papers,&nbsp; has known of unfortunate&nbsp; events which caused the disturbance of peace and order in the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; should be allowed to use the 'kiosko' which is within&nbsp; the hearing distance of the catholic church, this may give rise to disturbance of other religious&nbsp; ceremonies performed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the church."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)&nbsp; This action&nbsp; of the judge may be justified under section 5, Rule 123, of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, which&nbsp; is elaborated by this Court in the following wise:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>There are facts,&nbsp; indeed&nbsp; of which&nbsp; courts should take judicial cognizance. These facts refer&nbsp; to a variety of subjectsâ€”legislative, political, historical,&nbsp; geographical,&nbsp; commercial scientific, and&nbsp; artificialâ€”in addition, to a wide&nbsp; range of matters, arising in the ordinary course&nbsp; of&nbsp; nature&nbsp; or the general current of&nbsp; human&nbsp; events.&nbsp; The matter of&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; notice is ever expanding and will&nbsp; surely&nbsp; keep pace with&nbsp; the&nbsp; advance!&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sciences and the arts.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; a matter to&nbsp; be&nbsp; judicially cognizable&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp; well-established&nbsp; or authoritatively&nbsp; settled, or&nbsp; of common or general&nbsp; knowledge.&nbsp; Obviously, courts&nbsp; should take notice&nbsp; of whatever is or should&nbsp; be generally known because judges should not be more ignorant&nbsp; than the rest of mankind.'&nbsp; (The Municipal Board of the City of Manila, et al. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Segundo Agustin, 65 Phil., 144.)&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>The contention that the northwestern part of the plaza, cannot be considered as part of said plaza but of the road in the&nbsp; northwestern portion beyond the concrete fence&nbsp; is untenable, for it&nbsp; appears that that portion&nbsp; is part of the plaza and has a space capable of accommodating hundreds of people.&nbsp; In fact, during the past celebrations of the traditional town&nbsp; fiesta&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality, said portion has been utilized&nbsp; by the authorities&nbsp; as a place for staging dramas, zarzuelas, and&nbsp; cinematograph shows.&nbsp; Verily, the pretense&nbsp; of petitioners&nbsp; cannot be attributed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the unsuitability of that&nbsp; portion&nbsp; as a&nbsp; meeting place&nbsp; but&nbsp; rather&nbsp; to their obstinate&nbsp; desire to use the kiosk knowing it to&nbsp; be contrary to the policy&nbsp; of the municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p><p>The decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs</p><p>against petitioners.</p><p><em>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp;&nbsp; Jugo, Labrador,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">&nbsp;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> These&nbsp; facts are not disputed by appellant in the memoranda they have submitted after oral argument.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br><p></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><p></p><p align="center"><em>DISSENTING:</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>CONCEPCION, J., </strong></p><p>With&nbsp; due respect to the&nbsp; majority opinion, I&nbsp; am&nbsp; constrained to dissent for the following reasons:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><ol><li>It is admitted in respondent's answer that (as stated in paragraph&nbsp; VIII of the petition)&nbsp; counsel for the petitioners had, on August 25, 1952, written to respondent a letter reading in part as follows:&nbsp; </li></ol><blockquote><p>"May I therefore, request your kind&nbsp; office to grant&nbsp; a permit to Messrs. Fernando Ignacio and Simeon de la Cruz to use the public plaza with the 'kiosko' therein located for the&nbsp; purpose of holding a public lecture to be held on such date and time as shall be chosen by them and subject&nbsp; of course to your&nbsp; final approval."</p></blockquote><p>and&nbsp; that (as&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraph IX&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petition) "respondent mayor has not by any manner answered and responded" to&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned letter.&nbsp; In other words, respondent&nbsp; herein&nbsp; has not&nbsp; granted any permit for the holding, anywhere&nbsp; or&nbsp; under any condition,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the public lecture referred to in said letter, although&nbsp; it is impliedly conceded that&nbsp; petitioners are entitled to&nbsp; hold such public lecture. <br></p><ol start="2"><li>The majority&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; and that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court, invoke the police power of the State as authority for the policy&nbsp; of respondent herein&nbsp; of not permitting the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of the town&nbsp; plaza proper,&nbsp; including&nbsp; the&nbsp; stand&nbsp; or&nbsp; kiosko therein,&nbsp; by petitioners herein.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp; believe that this view is supported&nbsp; by the pleadings,&nbsp; which, in the case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; are controlling, the&nbsp; case having been submitted for decision on the pleadings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ol><p>In an effort&nbsp; to justify his failure to act&nbsp; on&nbsp; the above quoted&nbsp; letter of the petitioners, respondent&nbsp; (who, seemingly,&nbsp; is a&nbsp; lawyer or has studied&nbsp; law,&nbsp; for he signed his pleadings and&nbsp; appeared,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court, in&nbsp; his own behalf) alleged, in his answer, by&nbsp; way of special defense, that he had</p><blockquote><p>"put up an&nbsp; off-limit to use the 'kiosko' for any religious meeting, conference, or rites by any religious denominations, as it is his belief, in&nbsp; good&nbsp; faith, that said 'kiosko', although&nbsp; a&nbsp; public&nbsp; edifice is intended for use&nbsp; by the general public, only on&nbsp; legal purposes and objectives other than religious one."&nbsp; (Record on Appeal,&nbsp; pp. 12- 13.)</p></blockquote><p>This allegation indicates that respondent's policy was prompted, not by&nbsp; considerations of&nbsp; public order, but&nbsp; by his belief&nbsp; that no&nbsp; public&nbsp; property may be used&nbsp; for religious&nbsp; purposes, even if there&nbsp; were&nbsp; no danger of&nbsp; breach of peace.&nbsp; In other words, what he&nbsp; had in mind was the provision of&nbsp; Article VI, section 23, paragraph 3,&nbsp; of the Constitution;&nbsp; reading:</p><blockquote><p>"No public money or property shall&nbsp; ever be appropriated, applied, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sectarian&nbsp; institution, or&nbsp; system of religion, or for the/use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister,&nbsp; or&nbsp; other religious&nbsp; teacher or dignitary as&nbsp; such, except when such priest, preacher, minister, or&nbsp; dignitary&nbsp; is assigned to the armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; or to&nbsp; any penal institution,&nbsp; orphanage,&nbsp; or leprosarium."</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, had his policy been motivated by a concern for the preservation of harmony and&nbsp; good will among the people, respondent would&nbsp; have applied his off-limit policy not merely to religious meetings, but, also, to any activity which might&nbsp; lead&nbsp; to a public, disturbance.</p><p>There is another clear proof that the protection of peace and order had&nbsp; nothing to&nbsp; do&nbsp; with&nbsp; said policy&nbsp; of respondent herein.&nbsp; In paragraph XII of the petition it is asserted:</p><blockquote><p>"That petitioners desire to hold peaceful meetings, in the town of Sta. Cruz,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; province of&nbsp; Zambales."</p></blockquote><p>Replying thereto, respondent said, in paragraph&nbsp; (6) of his answer:</p><blockquote><p>"That the respondent has no knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the statements contained in&nbsp; paragraphs XI and XII&nbsp; of the petition"</p></blockquote><p>Had respondent&nbsp; refrained from acting upon petitioners request for permit,&nbsp; or adopted his aforementioned off-limit policy, for fear that&nbsp; petitioners may&nbsp; provoke&nbsp; a public disorder, said respondent would have so&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; in his answer, instead of stating therein that he had "no knowledge sufficient to form&nbsp; a belief" in connection with the peaceful nature of petitioners' proposed&nbsp; meetings.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">If he had no such&nbsp; knowledge sufficient to form a belief, then he could not have entertained' the aforesaid fear of breach of the peace.</span></p><ol start="3"><li>The above quoted special defense in respondent's answer advances the proposition that <span style="font-style: italic;">religious&nbsp; assemblies or gatherings may not be held in public property,</span> which is obviously false. Public&nbsp; squares,&nbsp; roads, highways&nbsp; and buildings are&nbsp; devoted to public use, and, as such, are open to all, without distinction.&nbsp; Incidentally to such use, religious acts may be performed in said&nbsp; public property.&nbsp; It is the appropriation thereof mainly for religious purposes that&nbsp; the. Constitution does&nbsp; not&nbsp; sanction.&nbsp; Thus, for injstance,&nbsp;&nbsp; public&nbsp; lands&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; donated&nbsp; for&nbsp; the construction thereon of churches, convents or seminaries. However, public streets, boulevards and thoroughfares are used, almost daily, for religious processions in the Philippines.&nbsp; Masses and. other religious services are often held at&nbsp; the&nbsp; Luneta, the&nbsp; Quirino Grandstand and the Rizal Memorial Stadium, in the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila, as&nbsp; well as in other public property,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; penal&nbsp; institutions,&nbsp; leprosaria and army camps.&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as&nbsp; the use of&nbsp; public property for religious purposes is incidental and temporary, and such as to be reasonably compatible with&nbsp; the use td which other&nbsp; members&nbsp; of&nbsp; thÂ«&nbsp; community&nbsp; are similarly entitled, or&nbsp; may be authorized to make, the injunction in section&nbsp; 23(3)&nbsp; of Article&nbsp; VI of the&nbsp; Constitution is not infringed (see Aglipay&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Ruiz, 64 Phil., 201; People <em>vs.</em> Fernandez,&nbsp; CA-G. R. No.&nbsp; 1128-R).<br>&nbsp; <br></li><li> A mere general possibilityâ€”which, at any rate, may be&nbsp; remoteâ€”that, if petitioners were&nbsp; allowed to use the grandstand&nbsp; in the,town&nbsp; square of Sta.&nbsp; Cruz, Zambales, they&nbsp; may say or do something tending to disturb&nbsp; public order, is insufficient to&nbsp; warrant&nbsp; denial of&nbsp; the&nbsp; license prayed&nbsp; for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, we would, in effect, nullify the Bill of Eights, for all rights are susceptible of abuse and, hence, the possibility of such abuse, is always present in the exercise&nbsp; of any right.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection, it&nbsp; is important to note&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner's aforementioned&nbsp; request is covered by the constitutional mandates on due process, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly&nbsp; and freedom of religion.&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; a right of such&nbsp; magnitude as to&nbsp; be guaranteed by no less than four (4)&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the fundamental&nbsp; lawâ€”and these of the most transcendental and vital to&nbsp; the democratic system underlying the structure of our Republicâ€”cannot be curtailed on the basis of an abstract and speculative possibility of a threat to peace or breach of peace, which may or <span style="font-style: italic;">may not</span> result,&nbsp; if and when, in the exercise of their religious profession,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; should transcend the proper&nbsp; bounds, for&nbsp; which, at any rate,&nbsp; they could, and would, be&nbsp; punished under existing laws.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></li><li> In an effort to bolster up the position therein taken, the decision&nbsp; appealed from says that the permit&nbsp; sought by petitioners, If granted "may give rise to disturbance of other religious ceremonies performed" in the Catholic Church, which&nbsp; is said to&nbsp; be "within&nbsp; hearing distance'* from&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned <span style="font-style: italic;">kiosko</span> and&nbsp; would amount&nbsp; to giving petitioners a "license to disturb <span style="font-style: italic;">anytime the religious</span> practices or ceremonies of that rival denomination".&nbsp; The weakness of&nbsp; this view is patent.<p></p></li></ol><p>To&nbsp; begin with, respondent couldâ€”and, perhaps, shouldâ€” limit&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; at&nbsp; which&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; could give their lectures on&nbsp; religion.&nbsp; Secondly, a&nbsp; license&nbsp; to hold&nbsp; such <span style="font-style: italic;">lectures</span> is not a grant of authority to <span style="font-style: italic;">disturb</span> the religious services held in said Catholic Church.&nbsp; Thirdly,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is a matter&nbsp; of common knowledged that&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Churches are not open throughout&nbsp; the day.&nbsp; Masses,&nbsp; if any, are held in the morning.&nbsp; There may be&nbsp; weddings, baptisms and other religious services before&nbsp; noon and often times in the late afternoon, but,&nbsp; generally, such churches are closed in the evening.&nbsp; Masses, and other&nbsp; religious activities&nbsp; are not&nbsp; held daily&nbsp; in some churches, particularly in chapels.&nbsp; Hence, petitioners could be authorized to give their lectures at such times as would&nbsp; avoid any possible interference&nbsp; with the normal activities&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Catholic Church.</p><ol start="6"><li> Said decision further states&nbsp; that the&nbsp; stand in the public square&nbsp; is&nbsp; within&nbsp; the hearing distance&nbsp; of said Catholic Church.&nbsp; The majority decision adds that "the proximity of said church to the <span style="font-style: italic;">kiosko</span>&nbsp; has caused&nbsp; some concern on the part of the authorities".&nbsp; There is, however, no&nbsp; allegation in the pleadings,&nbsp; or proof, to this effect. Such is merely the impression that the&nbsp; Judge <span style="font-style: italic;">a&nbsp; quo</span> tended to convey in his decision, <span style="font-style: italic;">without anything in&nbsp; the record to bear it, </span>but predicated, in the language of said&nbsp; decision, upon his avowed knowledgeâ€”acquired&nbsp;&nbsp; "through information, personal experience and through the papers"â€”of "unfortunate events which caused the disturbance of&nbsp; peace and order in community".&nbsp; Regardless of the propriety of considering such knowledge and information of&nbsp; the trial Judge as a factor in deciding the case,&nbsp; it&nbsp; seems evident that the events alluded to did not take place in Sta.&nbsp; Cruz, Zambales, and did not refer to incidents t provoked, either by petitioners&nbsp; herein, or&nbsp; by Jehovah's&nbsp; Witnesses, the sect to which they&nbsp; belong.&nbsp; Otherwise, said events would have surely been&nbsp; pleaded specifically in respondent's&nbsp; answer. The same, in fact, indicates that there had been no such "events" in Sta. Cruz, Zambales, as may be deduced from respondent's above quoted allegation to the effect that&nbsp; he has "no&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; sufficient to form&nbsp; a beliefh on&nbsp; the peaceful character of the meetings sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; held&nbsp; by petitioners herein.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>&nbsp; I cannot&nbsp; but take exception to the&nbsp; statement, in the majority opinion, that "the&nbsp; situation of the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">kiosko</span> and the&nbsp; occurrence of religious controversies which disturbed the peace and order i<span style="font-style: italic;">n the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sta. Cruz,&nbsp;</span> are matters which may be deemed to come within the judicial knowledge of&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; as in fact they were so considered by the trial Judge in his decision".&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court did not mentionâ€”and, I&nbsp; think, it did not have&nbsp; in mindâ€” any particular breach of&nbsp; peace in the <em>municipality of Sta. Cruz.</em> It did&nbsp; not say so in the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from. In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; respondent's brief has not specified,&nbsp; or&nbsp; even hinted,&nbsp; any such&nbsp; incident&nbsp; "in the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of Sta. Cruz."</li></ol><p>Moreover, such&nbsp; incident,&nbsp; if&nbsp; any, is not one of which courts may take judicial&nbsp; cognizance of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 123, section 5 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court specifies what&nbsp; matters&nbsp; are subject to&nbsp; judicial notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; provides:</p><blockquote><p>"The existence and territorial extent of states, their forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of&nbsp; nations,&nbsp; the admiralty and maritime courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the world and their seals,&nbsp; the political&nbsp; constitution and history of,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; the&nbsp; official acts of the legislative, executive, and&nbsp; judicial departments&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, the&nbsp; geographical divisions and political history of the world, and all smaller matters which are&nbsp; of public knowledge, or are capable of&nbsp; unquestionable demonstration, or sought to&nbsp; be&nbsp; known to judges because of their judicial functions, shall be judicially recognized by the court without the introduction&nbsp; of proof; but&nbsp; the court may receive evidence upon any of the subjects in&nbsp; this section&nbsp; stated, when&nbsp; it shall find it necessary&nbsp; for its&nbsp; own information,&nbsp; and may&nbsp; resort for&nbsp; its&nbsp; aid to appropriate books&nbsp; or&nbsp; documents of reference."</p></blockquote><p>Nothing&nbsp; contained in&nbsp; this section&nbsp; has any bearing&nbsp; on the events&nbsp; above&nbsp; referred to,&nbsp; except possibly&nbsp; the clause relative to "all similar matters which are of public knowledge".&nbsp; I&nbsp; believe,&nbsp; however, that&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; public&nbsp; or common knowledge of any&nbsp; religious controversy that has brought about a&nbsp; disturbance of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; and&nbsp; order <span style="font-style: italic;">in Sta. Cruz,&nbsp;</span> Zambales.&nbsp; What&nbsp; is&nbsp; more,&nbsp; the allegations in respondent's answer, as well as the tenor of his brief, palpably&nbsp; show, to&nbsp; my mind, that there&nbsp; has never been&nbsp; any such breach of peace in&nbsp; said municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; in- dependently of the technical aspect&nbsp; of the question,&nbsp; would it not be too&nbsp; hazardous for this Court to take judicial notice of something,&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of which is,&nbsp; to say the least, so debatable, that it may not be an objective reality?</p><ol start="8"><li>Even, however, if the&nbsp; grandstand in the public square of Sta. Cruz, Zambales, were within the hearing distance of the Catholic Church, the decision appealed from must, to my mind, be reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically, all plazas&nbsp; in the Philippines have a church&nbsp; nearby.&nbsp; Besides, thousands of churches and chapels&nbsp; may be&nbsp; found&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; populated portions&nbsp; of our&nbsp; municipalities,&nbsp; barrios,&nbsp; sitios or other smaller communities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Affirmance of the decision appealed from would imply, therefore, that religious sects or denominations,&nbsp; other&nbsp; than&nbsp; those to&nbsp; which said churches or chapels belong, could be barred from engaging in religious activities within the hearing distance thereof.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; modern&nbsp; technology, particularly the&nbsp; use of amplifiers, has extended, and is still extending, considerably the range of the hearing distance, it is clear that, in order to be beyond that range, said religious sects or denominations would have to hold their services or gatherings far away&nbsp; from&nbsp; the town or the&nbsp; populated localitiesâ€”where people&nbsp; are less likely&nbsp; to&nbsp; be. In other&nbsp; words, the&nbsp; late commers would have to preach in the desert&nbsp; or, at least, in deserted&nbsp; places.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>The majority decision,&nbsp; likewise, states:</li></ol><blockquote><p>"It&nbsp; appears that petitioners are members of the&nbsp; Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, commonly known&nbsp; as Jehovah's Witnesses, whose&nbsp; tenets&nbsp; and principles are deregatory to&nbsp; those professed by the Catholic organization.&nbsp; In its publication 'Face the Facts', that society branded the latter as&nbsp; a&nbsp; religious organization&nbsp; which&nbsp; is a part of the monstrosity now appearing in and&nbsp; claiming the&nbsp; right to rule the earth"</p></blockquote><p>The publication alluded&nbsp; to has not been introduced in evidence.&nbsp; It has not been incorporated in the pleadings. I do not think it belongs to the class which is subject to judicial notice.&nbsp; Said statement in&nbsp; the majority&nbsp; opinion is based only upon a quotation in respondent's brief.</p><p>Assuming said publication to be a fact, it is my&nbsp; firm conviction that the writ prayed&nbsp; for must be&nbsp; granted. It is not unreasonable&nbsp; to assume,&nbsp; as I do,&nbsp; that all sects, churches, denominations, sectarian institutions and systems of religion that refuse to recognize the supreme authority of the Holy See, consider the same, or its policies, more or less as a "monstrosity".&nbsp; They may&nbsp; not officially use this word to characterize their opinion about the Roman Catholic Church, but, their disagreement with the latter must&nbsp; be fundamental or&nbsp; serious&nbsp; enough for&nbsp; them&nbsp; to consider the position of&nbsp; the Catholic Church comparable to that of a monster.&nbsp; Otherwise, said religious organizations would nave joined hands with Catholic church or would not have seceded therefrom.&nbsp; In any event, everyday&nbsp; experience shows that, in the political field,&nbsp; minority parties generally&nbsp; regard and publicly proclaim&nbsp; that the administration of the Government by the party in power is so clumsy,, corrupt and inimical to the&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the people as to be tantamount to, if not worst than, a monstrosity.&nbsp; If such criticism sufficed to warrant denial to the critic of a license to&nbsp; speak within the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; of the "monster",&nbsp; then minority parties could&nbsp; be enjoined from holding public meetings within hearing distance of public buildings, for the same are occupied, used by, or under the care of men chosen&nbsp; by,&nbsp; and generally belonging to, the majority party.</p><p>In short,&nbsp; carried to its logical conclusion, the proposition&nbsp; that one may be prevented from speaking within the hearing distance of another, if the former considers the views&nbsp; or policies&nbsp; of the latter&nbsp; as a monstrosity,&nbsp; would lead&nbsp; to consequences which are inconsistent with the&nbsp; fundamental principles&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; our&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; and Republic are based.</p><ol start="10"><li>The case of Fugoso <em>vs.</em> Primicias&nbsp; (45 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 3280), cited in the majority opinion, is authority in favor of petitioners herein, for it applied the&nbsp; clear and present danger rule, and no such clear and present danger exists in the case at bar.&nbsp; It is true that said&nbsp; rule has not been consistently adhered to by this Court, and that the same has,&nbsp; in effect, shown its preference for&nbsp; the dangerous tendency rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in every case in which the latter was applied, there had been&nbsp; a tangible specific act of the party adversely affected&nbsp; thereby,&nbsp; which incited or tended to incite in a substantial manner a breach of the peace.&nbsp; Thus, in People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Evangelista (51 Phil., 254), People <em>vs.</em> Nabong&nbsp; (57 Phil., 455), and People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Feleo (58 Phil., 573), the defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; found to&nbsp; have advocated the overthrow of the government by the use of force.&nbsp; The defendant in&nbsp; People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Perez (45 Phil., 599), had expressed himself publicly in favor of beheading our then Governor-General Wood.&nbsp; In the case of Espuelas <em>vs.</em> People&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; (90&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 524,&nbsp;&nbsp; December 17, 1951), this Court held that the acts of Espuelas tended to&nbsp; stir&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; people&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; lawful&nbsp;&nbsp; authorities. In&nbsp; Evangelista&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Earnshaw&nbsp; (57 Phil., 255), we upheld the refusal of the Mayor&nbsp; of Manila to grant permit to the communist party to hold further political meetings in said city, <span style="font-style: italic;">after the members of said party had in public meetings&nbsp; incited&nbsp; the people to rise in arms against the&nbsp; government,</span>&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason several criminal&nbsp; cases&nbsp; for sedition were&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; the leaders of&nbsp; said&nbsp; party, who,&nbsp; subsequently, were&nbsp; convicted of the crimes charged against them.</li></ol><p>In&nbsp; the case at bar, it is not claimed that petitioners themselves, or&nbsp; their immediate&nbsp; associates, had&nbsp; ever&nbsp; performed any illegal&nbsp; or even improper act in&nbsp; preaching the tenets of their faith. Respondent's answer indicates that, prior to the date set forth&nbsp; in petitioners request for license, or July 27, 1952,&nbsp; said petitioners had been allowed to&nbsp; hold a religious meeting,&nbsp; though not in the grandstand in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; and seemingly,&nbsp; had held said meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, nothing appears to have been said or done in the course thereof, which&nbsp; could be,&nbsp; or&nbsp; is being, assailed on legal or moral grounds.&nbsp; Hence, the position taken by respondent mayor&nbsp; is to my mind absolutely&nbsp; untenable.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Reyes, A., </em>and<em> Reyes, J.
