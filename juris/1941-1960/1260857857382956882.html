				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Action  for mandamus  instituted  on  March  22,  1954, against the City Auditor and the City Treasurer of Manila to pass in audit and pay the claims  of petitioners for refund of  meat  inspection  fees  collected  under Ordinance No. 2991  (approved November 23, 1946), from the year 1946 to   1951,   amounting  to   around P179,461.33.   The Mayor  of the  City of Manila  is joined as defendant because  he  has  ordered  the  City  Auditor and the  City Treasurer to suspend action on the said claims, and it is sought to prohibit him from enforcing said order. <br><br>The  case was submitted for  decision upon an agreed statement of facts and various  documents  having relation to official  action  in connection with the claims.  The stipulation of facts is as follows:<br><blockquote>"1. Petitioners  (with the  exception of Atty.  Bayani Subido)  are duly licensed meat vendors in the city markets who paid meat inspection  fees under Ordinance No.  2991. <br><br>"2, The respondent  Hon.  Arsenio H. Lacson  is  the  incumbent Mayor of  Manila,  while the respondent Hon. Marcelino  Sarmiento is the incumbent City Treasurer of  Manila. <br><br>"3. That on June 11, 1951 in an  opinion No. 6 the Secretary  of Justice ruled  that Ordinance No. 2991 was illegal and void because it was "patently beyond the  power of the City of Manila to enact," and that the City  of Manila forthwith stopped the enforcement  of the said ordinance. <br><br>"4. That  on May 5, 1951,  petitioners, through their counsel, Atty. Bayani Subido, filed their claims for refund of meat  inspection fees with the City Treasurer. <br><br>"5. That  the Hon. Manuel de la Fuente, then mayor of the City of Manila referred the  matter to the Auditor General for a ruling as to whether or not meat inspection fees claimed by  the petitioners were refundable,  the  same having been  paid without protest. <br><br>"6. That on June 17, 1952, the respondent Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson informed petitioners' counsel Atty.  Bayani   Subido  that the Auditor  General had authorized the  refund  of meat  inspection fees regardless of whether or not  the fees were paid with or without protest,  and requested that complete  statement of  claims for refunds be submitted to his office so that he  may ask the Municipal Board to appropriate the necessary funds  therefor. <br><br>"7.  That petitioners,  by counsel, informed  the  respondent  Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson  that they had submitted the  complete statement of claims to the Municipal Board totalling P219,007.93 meat inspection fees paid by petitioners to the City Government under Ordinance No. 2991.<br><br>"8.  That on October  31, 1952, the respondent  Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson approved the City Budget for the year 1952-1953 which city budget was denominated as Ordinance No. 3538 of the City of Manila.<br><br>"9.  That after  the  approval  of Ordinance No.  3538 by the  re. spondent Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson, the Secretary of the  Municipal Board, informed  the  respondent City  Treasurer in a letter  dated November  3,  1052  that  the  claims  of  petitioners amounting to P219,007.93 filed through counsel have been included in  the amount of P297,349.93 under  "Miscellaneous  Expenditures"  of  the Appropriation Ordinance  No. 3538 of  the  City of Manila  for  the  fiscal year 1952-1953. <br><br>"10. That when petitioners  presented the vouchers covering the refund of meat inspection fees paid by  them from 1946-1951 the respondent  City Treasurer advised them  that he will pay only the claims for  two years from the  date  the claims  were filed in accordance  with a  7th  Indorsement of  the Auditor  General,  dated April  7, 1952, that  is, from May 5,  1949 to May 5, 1951. <br><br>"11. That in view of the information given by the respondent City Treasurer,  petitioners  filed separate  vouchers  for the  authorized period from May  5, 1949  to May 5, 1951, and another  set for the remaining claims,  that is,  for the period from May 5, 1946 to May 5, 1949.<br><br>"12. That the respondent Mayor suspended the payment of  meat inspection fees in  an order dated January 16, 1953, after the claims of petitioners amounting to P33,834.80  had been  paid.   Ground for the  suspension  was  the investigation  ordered  by  the  respondent Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson  of the alleged loss of public  documents in the City Veterinarian's office  bearing on the refund. <br><br>"13. That the petitioners, through counsel,  urged the respondent Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson to exclude them from the suspension order in a letter dated January  17, 1953.  But the respondent Mayor, replying oh the same day, assured petitioners that payments will  be resumed after a thorough  investigation of the alleged loss  of documents  in the City Veterinarian's Office  bearing on the claims. <br><br>"14. That in a  letter dated  February  23,  1954,  the  respondent mayor authorized the respondent City Treasurer 'to effect the refund of said fees  (meat inspection fees) provided that the claims therefor had been filed within the period  of  two years from the date of collection thereof by the City'.                                  <br><br>"15. That on January 18, 1954, the Auditor General revised its ruling contained in his 7th Indorsement dated April 7, 1952, allowing the payment of refunds of meat inspection fees within  five years from the  date the claims  were filed,  provided however, that said dealers or their attorneys were not  officially advised nor furnished a copy of the  aforementioned 7th  Indorsement of  April 7,  1952 of the Auditor General before  November 19, 1952. <br><br>"16. That petitioners were advised of the  contents of the 7th Indorsement of April 7,  1952 of the Auditor General on  December 18, 1952 by the respondent City Treasurer.<br><br>"17. That the claim  of petitioner B.  Almario for P5,711.70 within the two-year period  was paid in July,  1954. <br><br>"18. That the respondent City  Treasurer will make payment of the claims  of petitioners upon the revocation  of the ban contained in letter dated January 16,  1953  (Exhibit I)   and  letter dated February 23, 1954 (Exhibit  'P').  In other words, when these letters are revoked by this Honorable Court, the respondent City Treasurer will pay the claims upon presentation  of the vouchers. <br><br>"19. That respondent City Treasurer is the department head that approves the vouchers  for claims for refund of meat inspection fees as prepared by his  office. <br><br>"20. That previous to  the issuance of letter dated  February 23, 1954,  the  vouchers  for refund of  meat inspection fees were  not passed  through, the respondent City  Mayor's Office for  approval.<br><br>"21. That the respondent City Treasurer is under the supervision and control of the Mayor in accordance with the City  Charter.<br><br>"22. That the City Auditor will act on the vouchers for refund of meat inspection fees when the  same are submitted to him. <br><br>"23. That the  claims of  petitioners  still unpaid are those paid within the five-year period from the  filing of the claims."</blockquote>The  Court of First Instance, Hon.  Froilan  Bayona presiding,  ruled that "there  exists no authority promulgated by  Congress which  gives any one the  authority to sue  the City Mayor  and Treasurer of the  City of  Manila  in lieu of  the said  City as a  public corporation, because  any judgment that could be  rendered against said  officials  for refund  of license  fees  unlawfully  collected  and  levied would  be unenforceable against  the  City of Manila and the funds of the  latter  (City of Manila)  in possession or custody of said  officials cannot be paid or disposed by them  to satisfy any judgment."  From the above judgment petitioners have appealed to this  Court. <br><br>There  is no question that an action for  refund of fees collected  under an illegal ordinance, should, under  ordinary circumstances, include the City of Manila  as a party as the  funds have been received  by  it  and will have to  be  returned  by it if the  action succeeds.   The  officials concerned are not ordinarily the real party in interest but the  City  or public  corporation itself.   The  situation  in the  case  at bar  is,  however,  entirely  different,  because (1)  the claims for refund have been passed upon favorably and have been authorized to be paid  by  the Auditor General of the Philippines, whose decision  has,  upon appeal to the President of the Philippines, been confirmed by the latter; (2) the petitioners  herein had submitted the list of their claims to the Municipal Board of the City and the latter in its Ordinance No.  3538, which  is the appropriation ordinance  for the City for the  fiscal year  1952-1953, had approved an item amounting to P297,349.93 designated as "Miscellaneous Expenditures," which  includes the sum of P219,007.93, representing  the total amount  to be refunded to the petitioners  (Exhibit  "D," attached  to the Stipulation of  Facts);  (3) some of the claims presented of the same nature as those  of the petitioners had already been paid and  the City Treasurer is ready and willing  to make payment of  the claims, except that the City Mayor has ordered the suspension of  the payments  (see  par. 18, Stipulation  of  Facts). <br><br>It is apparent,  therefore,  that the  City had agreed  to the refund of the fees collected under the  invalid ordinance by the approval in accordance with law of the corresponding appropriation  for the purpose, so that the only impediment  to the petitioners' action is the  refusal  of the City Treasurer to  approve the vouchers and pay the claims under  the excuse  that the  City Mayor  has  ordered the suspension of such payments. <br><br>It has been held that when an officer refuses or neglects to perform an act which the law imposes as an obligation or a  duty,  mandamus. lies against such officer  to  compel. him to execute the  ministerial act.  We  have so held in the cases  of Lamb vs. Phipps, 22 Phil., 456; Cia. Gen. de Tobacos vs. French and Unson, 39 Phil., 34; Suanes vs. Chief Accountant of the Senate,  et al., 81 Phil.,  818.  It is no longer necessary to  include  the City as the real party in interest,  because it  has  already acquiesced  to the  refund by the approval of the  appropriation  necessary  for the purpose.  The City has  ceased to be  the  real party in interest; the real parties in interest now are the  officers or officials of the City who refuse to perform their ministerial acts and duties  to  pay the claims, to the prejudice of the petitioners. <br><br>It is urged in support  of the decision of the court a quo that the  City  Mayor  who  is vested with the executive control of all the departments of the City government has the power to order  the  suspension of such payments  by the City  Treasurer.   Before the present action was  instituted, the suspension might have been in  part justified, because of suspicions entertained by the City Mayor that irregularities have been committed in the refund of claims of other persons similarly situated as the petitioners.  But such excuse or reason  has ceased to exist with the report of the Chief, General  Investigation Section of the Police Department of the City, dated June 7, 1953 (Exhibit "U"), finding no such irregularities. <br><br>Then the acts of the  chief executive  of  the  City and even of the President  of the Philippines should  and must be in accordance with law and reason; in other words, the control that the law  vests in executive officers is  not arbitrary; the control must be exercised in accordance with law and the  facts.  Abuse of such  power  of control  is  not within the  contemplation  of the  law granting  authority of control to executive officials.  In the case at bar, under the circumstances, the control by the Mayor can  be  said  to have been abused, there being no reason or ground for further ordering the  suspension of payments, it being apparent that the claims  appeared to be legitimate.  The objection to  the action  in this  particular is, therefore, without merit. <br><br>It is also urged that the action of mandamus does not lie but an  ordinary action for refund  of the inspection fees  collected under the  illegal ordinance.  We hold that under the  circumstances  of the  case an ordinary action would not  be adequate.  The extraordinary legal remedy of mandamus and prohibition are more speedy and adequate to bring about the end or purpose desired by the petitioners. As the Auditor has already authorized  payment  of the claims, and the President  has affirmed the decision of the Auditor, and the Municipal Board of the City  of Manila has already appropriated the funds necessary for the  payment of the claims, an ordinary action would be  superfluous and  would entail more delay than is necessary for the purposes of petitioners. <br><br>Other questions and objections raised in the brief  of the respondents are  either beyond the agreed statement  of facts or improperly  injected in this Court on appeal,  such questions not having been raised  for the first  time  in the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> and, therefore, not subject  to be considered in this Court.   (Coingco vs. Flores, 82 Phil., 284, 46 Off. Gaz.,  1566;  People vs. Mejares, 90  Phil, 102; Talento, et al. vs. Makiki, et al., 93  Phil., 855, 49 Off. Gaz., 4331; The Shell Co. P. I., Ltd. vs. Vaño, 94 Phil., 389, 50 Off.  Gaz., 1046 Lamko vs. Dioso, et al.,  97  Phil., 821.)                             <br><br>The judgment appealed from  is hereby reversed and let the writ issue as prayed for in the petition,  against the respondent  City Mayor, to prevent him  from  suspending or interfering with the approval and payment of the claims of the petitioners and against the City Treasurer to compel him to  pay the petitioners' claims after the approval of the vouchers supporting the same.  The action against the City Auditor is hereby dismissed, it  appearing from the stipulation  of  facts  that he has  nothing to  do  with the payment of the claims.   Costs against respondents in both instances. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor,  Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
