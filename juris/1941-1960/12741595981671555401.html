				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On March 31, 1954, the defendant-appellee was charged with having violated 
Section 5 (b) in connection with Section 8 of Republic Act No. 55 in an 
information which reads as follows:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 17th day of February, 1948, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully and unlawfully fail 
and refuse to pay, and continue to do so, the war profits taxes due from him in 
favor of the Republic of the Philippines in the total amount of P33,643.651 
Philippine currency."</p></blockquote>
<p>After his arrest, he was arraigned, duly assisted by his attorney, and 
entered the plea of not guilty. Thereafter he filed a motion to quash the 
information on the ground that the criminal action or liability charged therein 
had been extinguished by prescription, and the court, after proper hearing, 
sustained the motion.<br><br>The provisions of Sections 5 (b) and 8 of Republic 
Act No. 55 are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 5 (b) <u>Time of Payment</u>.-The total amount of the tax imposed by this Act 
shall be paid on or before the last day of the sixth month following the approval 
hereof. The deficiency tax due on the amended return required to be filed under 
section 4 (b) of this Act on account of the receipt of payment for war damage or 
other claims shall be paid within thirty days from the receipt of the assessment 
of the Collector of Internal, Revenue. To any sum or aims due and unpaid after 
the date prescribed for the payment of the same there shall be added the 
surcharge of fifteen <u>per centum</u> on the amount of the tax unpaid and interest at 
the rate of one <u>per centum</u> per month upon said tax from the time the same 
becomes due,"</p>
<p>"SEC. 8. <u>Penalty</u>.-Any individual or responsible officer of a partnership, 
company or corporation violating any provision of this Act or of the regulations 
promulgated hereunder, or any person conniving with such individual or 
responsible officer for the purpose of evading the tax herein imposed, shall, 
upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment from five years to twenty years or 
a fine of not less than five thousand pesos but not more than thirty thousand 
pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Evidently, in the information quoted above, the accused herein was charged 
with an offense against a law administered by the Collector of Internal Revenue, 
for it clearly appears from the provisions of Republic Act No. 55, especially 
from Sec. 9 thereof, that the execution of all its provisions was entrusted to 
the Collector of Internal. Revenue; and in accordance with Sec. 1 of Act 3585 
which amended Act 3326, all offenses against any law or part of law administered 
by the Collector of Internal Revenue shall prescribe after five years.</p>
<p>Act 3326, enacted on December 4, 1926, is "an Act to establish periods of 
prescription for violations penalized by special acts and municipal ordinances 
and to provide when prescription shall begin to run." It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. Violations penalized by special acts, unless otherwise provided 
in such acts, prescribe in accordance with the following rules: (a) after a year 
for offences punished only by a fine or by imprisonment for not more than one 
month, or both; (b) after four years for those punished by imprisonment for more 
than one month, but less than two years; (c) after twelve years for those 
punished by imprisonment for two years or more, but less than six years; and (d) 
after twelve years for any other offence punished by imprisonment for six years 
or more, except the crime of treason, which shall prescribe after twenty years. 
Violations penalized by municipal ordinances shall prescribe after two 
months,</p>
<p>"SEC. 2. Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of 
the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the 
discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its 
investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>"The prescription shall be interrupted when proceedings are instituted 
against the guilty person and shall begin to run again if the proceedings are 
dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy.</p>
<p>"SEC. 3. For the purposes of this Act, special acts shall be acts defining 
and penalizing violations of the law not included in the Penal Code.</p>
<p>"SEC. 4. This Act shall take effect on its approval."</p></blockquote>
<p>Act No. 3326 was amended by Act No. 3585 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. Violations penalized by special acts shall, unless otherwise 
proved in such acts, prescribe in accordance with the following rules: (a) after 
a year for offences punished only by a fine or by imprisonment for not more than 
one month, or both; (b) after four years for those punished by imprisonment for 
not more than one month, but less than two years; (c) after eight years for 
those punished by imprisonment for two years or more, but less than six years; 
and (d) after twelve years for any other offence punished by imprisonment for 
six years or more, except the crime of treason, which shall prescribe after 
twenty years: Provided, however, That all offences against any law or part of 
law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue shall prescribe after five 
years. Violations penalized by municipal ordinances shall prescribe after two 
months."</p></blockquote>
<p>Acts 3226 and 3585 were not repealed by Act otherwise known as the Revised 
Penal Code; their provisions remained intact and in full force. It follows that 
Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code providing for the prescription of crimes 
would not apply to prescription of violations of special laws or part of laws 
administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, for Article 10 of said law (Act 
3815) clearly provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<u>Offenses not subject to the provisions of this Code</u>.-Offenses which are or 
in the future may be punishable under special laws are not subject to the 
provisions of this Code. This Code shall be supplementary to such laws, unless 
the latter should specially provide the contrary."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing provisions, defendant herein filed his motion to 
quash on the ground that since February 7, 1948 up to the filing of the 
information on March 31, 1954, more than five years have elapsed, contending 
that if he had ever violated Republic Act No. 55, that violation must have taken 
place either on February 7, 1948, as alleged in the information, or on April 30, 
1947, which was the last day of the sixth month following the approval of said 
Act within which the tax in question should have been paid, otherwise the 
defendant would incur the penalty prescribed by Section 8 of said Act. This 
contention was upheld by the lower court, presided by Hon. Antonio G. Lucero, in 
the decision appealed from, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the certified copies of the documents presented by the defense, it 
appears that on <u>May 22, 1947</u>, Collector Bibiano L. Meer, of the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue, sent to the accused an assessment for war profit tax amounting 
to P219,842.00 and required him to pay it on or before June 15, 1947. On June 4, 
1947, Atty. Modesto Formilleza, as counsel for said accused, contested the 
assessment in a letter he sent to the Collector of Internal Revenue in which he 
expressed his reasons why his client could not see his way clear to paying said 
assessment. In a well-reasoned motion to quash, Atty. Cesar Miraflor argued that 
from whatever angle the case is viewed, it is apparent that the criminal action 
or liability on the part of the accused, if any, has already been extinguished. 
Before connecting premise and conclusion, it is essential to discuss the law 
applicable. Defense counsel contended that the prescriptive period applicable in 
this case is that found in Act 3585, approved by the Philippine Legislature on 
November 27, 1929, which provides, in its pertinent portion, that all offenses 
against any law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue 
shall prescribe after five years. It is worthy to note in this connection that 
Act 3535 establishes period of prescription for violations penalized by Special 
Acts, as its caption so states, and there can be no question that Republic Act 
No. 55 is a Special Act. There can be also no question that Republic Act No. 55 
is being administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, as shown not only by 
the notice of assessment sent to the accused on May 22, 1947, but also by the 
provisions of Section 9 of said Rep. Act Mo. 55 which states that "all 
administrative, special and general provisions of law, including the laws in 
relation to the assessment, remission, collection and refund of National 
Internal Revenue taxes, are hereby extended and made applicable to all the 
provisions of this law (Rep. Act No. 55), and to the tax herein imposed." This 
provision is quite clear as to require interpretation. On the other hand, Asst. 
Fiscal Reyes argued that the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on 
prescription should govern this case. However, whatever strength this argument 
might carry is totally destroyed by Article 10 of the Revised Penal Code which 
provides that offenses which are, or in the future may be punishable under 
special laws are not subject to the provisions of this code. It is, therefore, 
clear that the provisions of the Revised Penal Code do not govern offenses 
punishable under special laws. Besides, Article 367 of the Revised Penal Code, 
which enumerates the special acts repealed by said code, does not mention Act 
3585, and so the prescriptive periods of Act 3585 still stand. As a desperate 
move to be able to wiggle out of the legal predicament, the prosecution 
contended that the crime charged in the information is a continuing offense but, 
as the defense counsel has correctly stated, for a continuing crime to exist, 
there should be plurality of acts performed, and, on this criterion, it is 
evident that this argument is without foundation. Even if this Court should hold 
that the prescriptive period provided for in Section 354 of the National 
Internal Revenue Code could be applied on the case, the period prescribed 
thereunder is five years, which is the same period prescribed in Act 3585. 
"Whether this Court takes as basis for prescription May 22, 1947, which is the 
date when Collector Meer sent the assessment to the herein accused, or June 4, 
1947, the date when the accused wrote the letter to the Collector of Internal 
Revenue wherein he stated his reasons for refusing to pay the assessment, or 
February 17, 1948, the date alleged in the information as the time when the 
accused refused unlawfully to pay his war profit tax:, the conclusion will not 
alter, namely, that the five-year period from the date of the discovery of the 
offense has already prescribed when the information was filed on March 31, 1954. 
This conclusion would not also alter whether this Court applies Act 3585 or the 
National Internal Revenue Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor General claims that the lower court erred (1) in holding that 
the criminal liability of the defendant had been extinguished by prescription; 
(2) in denying appellee's motion for reconsideration dated January 25, 1956; and 
(3) in dismissing the criminal case against the defendant. Mainly, the 
contention of the Solicitor General is to the effect (a) that the law of 
prescription applicable to the present case are Articles 90 and 91 of the 
Revised Penal Code; (b) that the violation of law is a continuing offense and, 
therefore, does not prescribe notwithstanding the lapse of five years from 
February 17, 1949 up to the filing of the information; and (c) that the period 
of prescription in the case at bar should commence from the time the tax 
violation was referred to the Fiscal's Office for investigation, claiming 
that "Under Section 2, Act No. 3226, when the date of the violation needs to be 
discovered, as in the case here, the prescription begins 'from the discovery 
thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its investigation and 
punishment.'"</p>
<p>Upon careful perusal of these contentions, we find them completely untenable, 
under the facts of the case, because it cannot be disputed that Articles 90 and 
91 of the Revised Penal Code do not govern offenses punishable under special 
laws, that Republic Act No. 55 is a special law, and therefore, the prescriptive 
law applicable to the instant case should be Act 3326; as amended by Act 3585, 
it being a well-known principle in statutory construction that in case of 
conflict between a special law and a general law, the former should govern.</p>
<p>As to appellant's contention that the offense charged in the information is a 
continuing one, we cannot subscribe to that theory for the simple reason that, 
under the provisions of Republic Act No. 55, upon failure of the herein 
defendant-appellee to pay the taxes in question on February 17, 1948 or on April 
30, 1947, there has been a complete violation of law for which he should have 
been immediately prosecuted. Clearly, under Section 5, paragraph (b) of Republic 
Act No. 55, the moment a person fails to pay his war profits taxes within the 
period specified therein, he should be considered as having violated the law and 
no other action would be necessary for his prosecution.</p>
<p>Anent the theory that in the present case the period of prescription should 
commence from the time the case was referred to the Fiscal's Office, suffice it 
to state that such theory is not supported by any provision of law and we need 
not elucidate thereon. Moreover, the record of the case shows that on May 22, 
1947, Collector Bibiano L. Meer of the Bureau of Internal Revenue assessed the 
war profits tax in question against the accused and fixed June 15, 1947 as the 
date of its payment without the herein accused paying it, and, according to the 
information, the accused, on February 17, 1948, willfully and unlawfully failed 
to pay said tax. Therefore, the violation of law in question was known to the 
prosecution, it was not concealed, and consequently it cannot now be pretended 
that same has not yet prescribed because it was not discovered until the papers 
of the case were sent to the Fiscal's Office of the City of Manila. Certainly 
appellant had knowledge of the illegal acts of the accused even before February 
17, 1948, and that knowledge precludes the appellant from evading the operation 
of the Statute of Limitations.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General contends, however, that at the behest of appellee, the 
Internal Revenue examiners assigned to the case submitted an amended assessment 
of February 25, 1950 and, therefore, the prescriptive period for violation of 
the war profits tax law should be considered as having been suspended up to the 
aforementioned date, because up to that time it was legally impossible for 
appellant to charge appellee criminally in view of the fact that the war profits 
tax was as yet undetermined and, in support of that contention, the case of 
Lattimore vs. U.S., 12 F. Supp. 895, was invoked, wherein it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is important to recognize that the ordinary period of limitation may be 
extended or suspended not only by what has come to be recognized as a 'waiver' 
but also by the acts of the taxpayer involved. It has been held, for example, 
that where the taxpayer has strenuously objected to collection of the tax arid 
has urged the Commissioner to withhold collection pending the adjustment of the 
controversy between him and the Commissioner and where the Commissioner yielded 
to the request and postponed collection until after the statute had run on 
collection, conferences being held in the interim, the taxpayer can not claim 
that the collection was not timely." (Merten's Law of Federal Income Taxation, 
Vol. 10, Sec. 57. 41 p. 195, 1953 ed.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We have carefully examined this Lattimore case and we find it completely 
inapplicable to the case at bar, for it refers to civil action for collection of 
taxes and not to criminal prosecution for violation of law for non-payment of 
taxes. We hold that a petition for reconsideration of assessment may affect the 
suspension of the prescriptive period for the collection of taxes, but not the 
prescriptive period of a criminal action for violation of law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the order appealed from, the same is hereby 
affirmed.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista
