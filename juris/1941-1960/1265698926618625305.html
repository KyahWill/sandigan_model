				G.R. No. L-1602, September 09, 1948</h4>
				<H3>BIENVENIDO YAP, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Bienvenido Yap was born of Chinese parentage on May 27, 1918, in Capiz, where 
he has been continuously residing ever since. He speaks and writes English and 
Hiligaynon, the Visayan language in the locality. He started his studies in the 
Capiz Chinese Elementary School and continued in the Capiz High School where he 
was in the fourth year at the outbreak of the last war. He is married to Gloria 
Lim, a native, born of a Chinese father and by this union he has two children 
born in Capiz, Wilfred Yap on May 26, 1944 and Roubin Yap on April 12, 1946. He 
is engaged in business with an invested capital of P10,000. During the 
occupation he rendered services to the guerrillas.
<p>The lower court granted his application for Philippine Citizenship.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General raises two questions in this appeal.</p>
<p>He contends, in the first place, that the lower court erred in not finding 
that the applicant ha a failed to establish satisfactorily that he had 
previously filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the 
Philippines and that he is not exempted from the prerequisite of filing said 
declaration.</p>
<p>Applicant alleged under oath in his petition that he had filed his 
declaration of intention to become a Filipino citizen with the office of the 
Solicitor General in 1941, although all the records have been lost by reason of 
the war. This allegation is not disputed in any answer or objection and is 
supported by the unrebutted testimony of applicant, who was duly cross-examined 
in the trial court. This is enough evidence. Appellant's contention that 
applicant's testimony should be supported by documentary proof is not well 
taken. There is nothing in the law in support of such requirement.</p>
<p>The second and last question raised by the Solicitor General is that the 
lower court erred in not finding that applicant has failed to establish that the 
laws of China grant Filipinos the right to become naturalized citizens 
thereof.</p>
<p>We find on record Exhibit E, a document supposed to be a copy of the Chinese 
law of citizenship, where it appears that a Filipino can acquire Chinese 
citizenship by naturalization. Although we do not see any certification attached 
to the exhibit, the lower court's decision states that applicant presented a copy 
of the Chinese law certified by a clerk Of Court of Cebu. The pronouncement is 
in a way supported by the fact that Exhibit E carries the dry seal of the Court 
of First Instance of Cebu. The pronouncement Of the lower court has not been 
disputed, and it can be assumed that when the copy was submitted to the lower 
court, the latter must have seen a certification attached to it which might have 
been misplaced. At any rate, the controversy appears to be academic, considering 
the fact that at the hearing of this case, counsel for appellant stated that in 
another case there is such certified copy of the Chinese law where it appears 
that Filipinos are given the right to acquire Chinese citizenship.</p>
<p>There being no error in the appealed decision, the same is 
affirmed.</p><em>Par√°s, Actg. C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, 
Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
