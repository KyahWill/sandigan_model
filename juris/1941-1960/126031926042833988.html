				<H3>ANDRESA FUERTES,  PETITIONER, VS. PUBLIC  SERVICE COMMISSION, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition for review of the decision rendered by the Public Service Commission dated 30 January 1956, granting Andresa Fuertes,&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein petitioner, a&nbsp; certificate of public&nbsp; convenience to&nbsp; operate a 1-ton ice plant in the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nasipit, province of Agusan,&nbsp; and to sell&nbsp; the ice produced&nbsp; in&nbsp; Nasipit&nbsp; and its neighboring towns, Carmen and&nbsp; Buenavista, but&nbsp; not in Butuan City where there&nbsp; is already an authorized operator.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not satisfied with the decision Andresa Fuertes has appealed claiming that the&nbsp; decision has no reasonable support in evidence, and&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is contrary to&nbsp; law.<br><br>The pertinent findings and pronouncement of the Public Service Commission are, as follows:<br><blockquote>This is&nbsp; a petition for&nbsp; a certificate of public convenience to install, maintain and operate a 1-ton ice plant in Nasipit, Agusan, and to sell the ice&nbsp; produced therein the Nasipit,&nbsp; Buenavista,&nbsp; Carmen and Butuan City,&nbsp; on the ground that public&nbsp; convenience&nbsp; requires&nbsp; the proposed plant.&nbsp; A written&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; was filed by Flora Consing on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; operates a&nbsp; 5-ton plant in&nbsp; Butuan City but at the hearing before the Justice of the Peace of Nasipit who was authorized&nbsp; to receive the&nbsp; depositions, no&nbsp; appearance was entered by the oppositor and&nbsp; neither was any evidence&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by her in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of her opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The evidence&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; applicant is a Filipino citizen and is financially qualified to operate the 1-ton plant proposed by her; that there is sufficient demand for ice which may be served by the 1-ton plant proposed&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; there is no ice plant in the&nbsp; towns&nbsp; of Nasipit, Buenavista and Carmen. Evidence was presented to show the need for allowing the&nbsp; applicant to&nbsp; send ice to Butuan City but we&nbsp; do not find&nbsp; this&nbsp; evidence satisfactory&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that the testimony of applicant's witnesses as to&nbsp; insufficient supply&nbsp; of ice in that City is not&nbsp; satisfactory some of them saying&nbsp; that their testimony as to inadequacy of&nbsp; supply of ice&nbsp; was based&nbsp; on what they heard&nbsp; from&nbsp; others.&nbsp; At any rate we believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; the 1-ton plant should not be authorized&nbsp; for a large territory because&nbsp; of the limited&nbsp; production and that we should not allow&nbsp; the&nbsp; service&nbsp; of an ice plant from&nbsp; one town&nbsp; in&nbsp; another town where there is already an&nbsp; established&nbsp; plant.&nbsp; We find from&nbsp; the evidence that applicant may be granted a certificate for a 1-ton&nbsp; ice plant in Nasipit but with authority to&nbsp; sell only in Nasipit, Carmen and&nbsp; Buenavista but not in&nbsp; Butuan&nbsp; City&nbsp; where&nbsp; there is an authorized operator.<br></blockquote>The only point to be decided in this case is whether the petitioner&nbsp; may&nbsp; be granted authority to&nbsp; sell&nbsp; her ice&nbsp; in Butuan City where there is&nbsp; already an authorized operator.<br><br>The testimony of petitioner's&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; Catalino Pizarro,&nbsp; Teodoro&nbsp; Ronquillo&nbsp; and Purisima Vda. de Bausa, does not&nbsp; show&nbsp; satisfactorily that&nbsp; the&nbsp; service&nbsp; of&nbsp; Flora Consing's&nbsp; 5-ton&nbsp; ice plant in Butuan&nbsp; City is&nbsp; irregular and unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Asked whether or not the supply of&nbsp; Flora Consing's&nbsp; ice plant was adequate and&nbsp; sufficient for the residents of Butuan City,&nbsp; Catalino&nbsp; Pizarro&nbsp; answered:&nbsp; "I do not know&nbsp; if they&nbsp; have enough&nbsp; but&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth is that many&nbsp; of us&nbsp; are&nbsp; being&nbsp; supplied by&nbsp; Mardoria's&nbsp; ice&nbsp; plant and there&nbsp; are&nbsp; many&nbsp; others who are being supplied by the Mardoria's&nbsp; ice plant;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * I cannot&nbsp; state clearly whether they cannot supply the&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; ice because&nbsp; I&nbsp; do not buy&nbsp; from them."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of Teodoro&nbsp; Ronquillo that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been buying ice from Andresa&nbsp; Fuertes&nbsp; (the petitioner) since June 1954 because she had been selling her ice to him&nbsp; and he liked her ice; and&nbsp; that of&nbsp; Purisima Vda. de&nbsp; Bausa that&nbsp; she had also been buying&nbsp; ice&nbsp; from Andresa&nbsp; Fuertes since&nbsp; 1954; that she did not buy&nbsp; from Flora Consing's ice plant&nbsp; because her plant's production is insufficient, are not enough&nbsp; to show that a&nbsp; 5-ton ice plant cannot supply the amount&nbsp; of ice needed by the consuming public.<br><br>Significantly, the petitioner has weakened her case when she testified&nbsp; that the population of the town&nbsp; of Nasipit is 12,000 more or less; Buenavista, 12,000 more&nbsp; or less; Carmen,&nbsp; 9,000 more or less; and Butuan City, 45,000 more or less;&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the towns&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nasipit,&nbsp; Buenavista and Carmen there is no authorized ice plant operator, whereas in Butuan City&nbsp; Flora Consing is operating a 5-ton ice plant;&nbsp; that according to the information she had received from the residents of Butuan City the ice plant of Flora Consing&nbsp; used to&nbsp; have break downs,&nbsp; and for that reason they bought ice from her.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the total number of inhabitants&nbsp; of the three towns where the&nbsp; petitioner is authorized by the Public Service&nbsp; Commission to sell her ice is true, then such&nbsp; number&nbsp; of inhabitants&nbsp; would be more than what her 1-ton ice plant could&nbsp; supply.&nbsp; There would be no need for her to invade Butuan City where&nbsp; there is already an authorized operator.<br><br>The&nbsp; information that the petitioner had received from certain residents&nbsp; of Butuan City as to the break downs&nbsp; of Flora Consing's ice plant is hearsay.&nbsp; But even&nbsp; granting that there had been such break downs,&nbsp; those were to&nbsp; be expected in the normal operation of&nbsp; any machine-run establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the absence of&nbsp; a showing that the supply of ice&nbsp; to the general public was insufficient, such break downs&nbsp; would not be a&nbsp; justification for the petitioner's insistence on&nbsp; invading the&nbsp; territory of&nbsp; another&nbsp; operator whose&nbsp; plant's production&nbsp; is five times more, as&nbsp; to cause the latter ruinous competition.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
