<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the People's Court finding the appellant 
guilty of the complex crime of treason with murder, and sentencing him to suffer 
the penalty of death, to pay a fine of P10,000, and to indemnify the heirs of 
Simon Domayre in the sum of P2,000 and the heirs of Felix Tamayo in the sum of 
P2,000, plus the costs. The information contained 11 counts, but the People's 
Court based the judgment of conviction only on counts 3, 4, 9, and 10.
<p>The appellant is a Filipino citizen and was a USAFFE soldier at the outbreak 
of the last war. he surrendered to the Japanese forces and later joined the 
occupation Japanese constabulary. As sergeant in said organization, he was in 
command of the detachment in Palompon, Leyte.</p>
<p>Under count No. 3, the prosecution alleges that some time in May, 1944, three 
Filipinos escaped from forced labor in a landing field in Opon, Cebu, and 
disembarked in Palompon, Leyte. Appellant arrested the three in the market of 
Palompon and brought them to the Social Center building, from which they were 
taken by appellant to the Palompon Elementary School then occupied by the 
Japanese. Said three men were blindfolded and thereafter bayoneted to death by 
the Japanese.</p>
<p>Under count No. 4, it is alleged that Simon Domayre, a guerrilla suspect, was 
arrested in Barrio San Pedro, Palompon, Leyte, some time in June, 1944, upon 
order of the appellant. Placido Pajaron, who made the arrest with another 
unidentified person, delivered Simon Domayre to the appellant in the Social 
Center building, where appellant boxed Simon and hit him with a baseball bat, 
made him drink as much water as he could, put him on the table, placed a board 
on his stomach, after which appellant and two Japanese soldiers stepped on the 
board causing the water to ooze from Simon's mouth and nose. Subsequently, the 
appellant brought Simon to the municipal jail. At about eight or nine o'clock in 
the evening, two men maltreated Simon upon order of the appellant, after which 
appellant slapped and kicked the two men upon seeing that they were half-hearted 
in their task. The appellant then ordered Carlos Guzman, a policeman, to kill 
Simon and, upon Guzman's refusal to do so, he was boxed by the appellant who 
afterwards hit Simon in the forehead with a bottle causing his death.</p>
<p>Under count No. 9, the evidence for the Government shown that in July, 1944, 
the appellant arrested and boxed Nicanor Sy on suspicion that he was aiding the 
guerrillas. The appellant brought Nicanor to the Social Center building of 
Palompon, Leyte, where lie was investigated and maltreated by the appellant.</p>
<p>The evidence for the prosecution as to count No. 10 is to the effect that in 
the later part of June, 1944, the appellant arrested in Palompon, Leyte, Felix 
Tamayo and brought him to the constabulary headquarters where he was maltreated 
by the appellant. The latter brought Felix to the Social Center building where 
he tied him to the bars of a window and investigated him about his guerrilla 
connections. Upon his refusal to admit that he was a soldier, the appellant gave 
Felix fist blows and later hit him with an iron bar. When Felix still denied, 
the appellant thrust the iron bar into his mouth until Felix was forced to admit 
that lie was a soldier. The appellant later brought Felix to the seashore and 
bayoneted him to death.</p>
<p>Count No. 3 is supported by the testimony of Cipriano Payos and Deogracias 
Astorga, two school teachers of Palompon, Leyte. The contention of attorney for 
appellant is that the two-witness rule has not been satisfied because Astorga 
learned of appellant's reason for arresting the three men who escaped from 
Japanese forced labor only from the boatmen who brought them to Palompon. This 
contention is not tenable because, according to the record, Astorga came to know 
the motive for said arrest also from the conversation between the appellant and 
his three victims when the latter were arrested.</p>
<p>Count No. 4 is established by the testimony of Cipriano Payos and Carlos 
Guzman. The criticism of attorney for appellant on this point is that only Payos 
testified to the maltreatment of Simon Donayre in the Social Center building. 
However, we find that the two prosecution witnesses testified that they saw the 
torture and killing of Simon in tho municipal building, and this is a sufficient 
overt act. She alleged inconsistency between Guzman and Payos as to who struck 
the fatal blow on Simon may be explained by the fact that tho two witnesses were 
not in the same positions when they witnessed the incident.</p>
<p>Count No. 9 is proved by the testimony of Nestorio Omega and Nicanor Sy, the 
latter being the very person arrested by the appellant. It is contended by 
appellant that Omega did not actually see the arrest but only saw Nicanor in the 
municipal jail, We believe, however, that the charge of having arrested Nicanor 
includes the act of confinement, and when witness Omega testified that he saw 
Nicanor in the municipal jail, he was in fact testifying on the arrest 
charge.</p>
<p>Count No. 10 is born out by the testimony of Deogracias Astorga, Nestorio 
Omega and Nicanor Sy. It is claimed by attorney for appellant that it was only 
Astorga who saw the arrest of Felix Tamayo and his maltreatment in the 
constabulary headquarters. But we find that the three witnesses saw the 
maltreatment of Felix in the Social Center building of Palompon, Leyte, as well 
as the act of killing by the appellant of Felix on the beach.</p>
<p>The evidence does not reveal any indication that the witnesses for the 
prosecution had testified falsely against the appellant for any improper motive. 
Hence the appellant's guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. But the 
People's Court erred in finding the appellant guilty of the complex crime of 
treason with murder, because murder was an ingredient of the crime of treason, 
as we have heretofore held in several cases. Under the circumstances of this 
case, and taking into account appellant's past services with the USAFFE and the 
fact that he was made a mere tool of the Japanese, we are not prepared to impose 
the penalty of death.</p>
<p>With the sole modification, therefore, that the appellant is hereby sentenced 
(for the crime of treason) to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, the appealed judgment 
is in ail other respects affirmed. So ordered, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes</em>, and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur. </p></div>
