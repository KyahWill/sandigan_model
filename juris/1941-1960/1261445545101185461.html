				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
convicting the appellant of qualified theft. The case is before us because the 
appeal raises only a question of law.
<p>It appears that in the morning of January 19, 1955, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, one Dr. Licerio Velasquez, owner of a <em>jeepney</em> with license 
plate No. AC-2553, whose driver was on vacation and had recommended the 
appellant to take his place, entrusted the vehicle to the said appellant for a 
"pasada", that is to say, for transporting passengers for a compensation, the 
vehicle being destined for that purpose as its license plate would indicate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The understanding was that appellant was 
to bring back the vehicle in the evening of that same day and pay P10 "in hire." 
But appellant never returned, and after a search the vehicle was found in a 
machine shop in Tarlac, where it was left by appellant allegedly for the purpose 
of having it repainted. Arrested by the police several days later, appellant 
voluntarily signed a statement to the effect that, though he took the vehicle 
for a "pasada", his real intention was to steal it, for he already had an 
agreement with one Mrs. Juana Lim that he would steal a jeepney and she would 
wait at the Balintawak monument.</p>
<p>In asking for appellant's acquittal, counsel <em>de oficio</em> contends 
that, while appellant may have committed estafa, he cannot be held guilty of 
theft, on the theory that as the possession of the vehicle was obtained with the 
consent of its owner, there has been no illegal taking.</p>
<p>To this we cannot agree. In the case of U. S. <em>vs</em>. De Vera (43 Phil, 
1000), this Court said that when the delivery of a chattel has not the effect of 
transferring the juridical possession thereof, or title thereto, it is presumed 
that the possession of, and title to, the thing so delivered remains in the 
owner; and the act of disposing thereof with intent of gain and without the 
consent of the owner constitutes the crime of theft. This, we think, is actually 
the case here. For as we see it, appellant had only substituted for the regular 
driver of a vehicle devoted to the transportation of passengers for a fare or 
compensation and therefore operated as a public utility; and while his 
arrangement with the owner was to turn in, not all the fare collected, but only 
a fixed sum known in the trade as "boundary", still he cannot be legally 
considered a hirer or lessee, since it is ordained in section 26 of the Rules of 
Regulations of the Public Service Commission that "no motor vehicle operator 
shall enter into any kind of contract with any person if by the terms thereof it 
allows the use and operation of all or any of his equipment under a fixed rental 
basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In the eye of the law then, 
appellant was not a lessee but only an employee or agent of the owner, so that 
his possession of the vehicle was only an extension of that of the latter. In 
other words, while he had physical or material pqssession of the 
<em>jeepney</em>, the juridical possession thereof remained in the owner. Under 
those circumstances his disposing of the <em>jeepney</em> with intent of gain 
and without the consent of its owner makes him guilty of theft.</p>
<p>Quoting from Ruling Case Law, this Court has also said in the same case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A felonious taking is necessary in the crime of larceny, and generally 
speaking, a taking which is done with the consent or acquiescence of the owner 
of the property is not felonious. But if the owner parts with the possession 
thereof for a particular purpose, and the person who receives the possession 
avowedly for that purpose has the fraudulent intention to make use of it as the 
means of converting it te his own use and does so convert it, this is larceny, 
for in such case, the fraud supplies the place of the trespass in the taking, 
or, as otherwise stated, the subsequent felonious conversion of the property by 
the alleged thief will relate back and make the taking and conversion 
larceny.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this theory, appellant, who, according to his own confession, took the 
vehicle from its owner already with the intention of appropriating it, should 
also be deemed guilty of theft. (People <em>vs</em>. Trinidad, 50 Phil., 
65.)</p>
<p>Wherfore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
