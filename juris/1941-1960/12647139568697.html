				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On September 16, 1949, plaintiff filed with the Municipal Court of the City of Manila an action  for ejectment and collection of the rentals  due for the occupation of a property situated  in the  City  of Manila against defendant, plus attorney's fees  and costs.  On March 9,  1951, after due  hearing, the court  rendered  judgment  ordering  defendant  to pay plaintiff the amount  prayed  for  in  the complaint but dismissing the counterclaim put  up by defendant.  Defendant  appealed from this decision to  the Court of First Instance  of  Manila</p>
<p>On April 30, 1951, defendant  filed  his answer which is a virtual reproduction of the  answer he filed in  the municipal court.  The most important affirmative defense set up by defendant, aside from two counterclaims, is that plaintiff was indebted to defendant in the sum of P25,000, plus interest, as evidenced by a promissory note, a photostatic copy of which was attached to the answer.  To this answer, plaintiff filed a  reply.</p>
<p>Issues having been joined, the case was set for hearing on July 26, 1951 but, for some reason or another, the hearing set  for that date was cancelled and on April 26, 1953 the parties  were notified that it  was postponed  to May 7, 1953  at 1  o'clock in the afternoon.  When this  date and time came, the trial  judge called the case for hearing, but neither defendant nor his counsel showed up,  where upon, the trial judge allowed  plaintiff to  present  his evidence.  When  the first wtiness was about to  testify, Atty. Manuel  Pineda,  who represented himself as an assistant  in the law office of  defendant's counsel, appeared and  informed  the court  that he  had filed  with the clerk of court at 12:20 o'clock that afternoon a motion for post-ponement of the hearing.  The trial judge, after going over the motion and. hearing  the explanation given by Atty. Pineda, declared the same to be without merit and proceeded with the hearing until it was finished.  Thereafter, he rendered judgment ordering defendant to pay to plaintiff the amount of P25,125,, plus P100 as attorneys' fees, and the cost of action.</p>
<p>On June 10, 1953, defendant  filed  a motion  for new trial seeking to set aside the  decision alleging as  reason that his counsel's failure to appear at the trial  of  the case was due to excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could hot have guarded against by reason of which he has  not been  given  his day in court,  supporting  his motion  with the necessary affidavit of merit.  To this motion, plaintiff filed a  written  opposition and  on June 23, 1953, the court issued an  order denying the motion for lack of merit  The  case was taken to the Court of Appeals but it was later certified to this Court because it involves purely a question  of  law.</p>
<p>It appears that this case was  set for hearing on May 7, 1953 at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and .that notice of said hearing was  received by counsel for appellant sometime on April 26,  1953.   But on May 6, 1953, said counsel received by registered mail an order  of the Court of First Instance of Batangas enjoining him to appear at  the trial of a criminal case, also set for hearing  on May  7, 1953, (Criminal  Case No. 431,  People vs. Arguelles, et  al.) and further requiring him to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt as a  consequence of his failure to appear  at the  hearing of the  case on April 15,  1953. So, in the  afternoon of May 6,  1953, he requested his  assistant,  Atty.  Manuel B,. Pineda, to prepare an urgent motion  for postponement based on the facts above-stated with specific instruction to file  it  as  soon as  possible. However, due to a misunderstanding between Atty. Pineda and the secretary of  counsel,  the motion  was filed only on May 7,  1953,  at  about 12:20 o'clock in  the afternoon. But notwithstanding said motion and the  appearance  of Atty.  Pineda at  the hearing reiterating the request for postponement even if  the trial  had just begun, the court denied  the motion.  Do  these  facts  constitute excusable negligence  which may justify the reopening of the case?</p>
<p>As a general rule,  "The matter of adjournments and postponements of trials lies generally within the discretion of courts and such discretion will not be interfered with either by mandamus,  or by appeal, unless a grave abuse thereof is shown."  (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. I,  1952 ed., p.  650, and cases cited therein). But it has also been  held that "Whether a trial may be continued because a party's attorney is engaged in another trial on the same date, is a question to be determined in the discretion of the court  according to the peculiar circumstances of each case.  Continuance  may  be granted if the attorney is without fault,  or  it causes no  undue prejudice either to the adverse party or to the interest of a  prompt administration of justice.   A practitioner  may have  two cases in two different courts  set for  trial on the same date  without his previous  knowledge and consent, and under  this circumstance  it is but fair to grant him postponement of one of the trials if. petition to that effect is presented at such time as is practicable to  prevent the adverse party  from coming to court  with his  witnesses on the day set for  trial thus incurring  unnecessary expenses; otherwise, he may be made to pay for such expenses  as   a  pre-requisite  to  continuance."   (Moran, Comments  on  the Eules of  Court,  Vol.  I, 1952 ed., p. '651-652,  and cases  cited.)</p>
<p>We believe that the facts  of this  case come  squarely within  the purview of  the second rule above-mentioned for it appears that the failure of counsel to appear at the hearing set for May 7, 1953  was due  to an order he received from the Court of  First Instance of  Batangas enjoining him to appear before  said  court on  the  same date to proceed with the. trial of a criminal case which, by the' way involved'a detention prisoner.  It further appears that the order required counsel to show cause why he should not be punished! for  contempt of  court as a  consequence of his failure  to  appear on the hearing  of said case on April 15, 1953 and,  as counsel states, his failure was due to illness and so he was not able to be present  at the trial.</p>
<p>It is true that counsel was notified of the hearing ten days before, or on April 26, 1953, but it should be noted that he received the order of the Court of First Instance of  Batangas  only in the afternoon of May 6, 1953, and immediately took steps to file a motion for postponement. It is however unfortunate that, due to a misunderstanding, the motion was filed in court by his secretary only in the afternoon  of the following, day.  These  facts  are undisputed.  Considering that this is the first  postponement that was asked  by counsel and  his client, the  appellant, has a valid  and meritorious  defense  which  consists  in a  promissory  note  signed by appellee in the amount  of P25,000, we believe that the failure of counsel  to  appear is due to excusable negligence and it is but fair that his client be given another opportunity to present his evidence to prevent  a miscarriage of justice.  Anyway,  if  a new trial is granted, no undue prejudice would be  caused  to the adverse party.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the  decision  appealed  from  is  set  aside. The case is remanded to the lower court for new trial  on the merits.  No  pronouncement as to costs.</p>
