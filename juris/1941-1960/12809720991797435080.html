				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant Canuto Cadiz was charged with treason in the People's
 Court in an information containing six counts.  The substance of the 
accusation is that, being a Filipino citizen, defendant adhered to the 
enemy during the period from December, 1944, to May, 1945, by joining 
the Japanese soldiers and the makapilis in the apprehension and 
maltreatment of members of the guerrilla forces, specially Fundador 
Baltazar, Maximo Castro, Eric Broderick, Vicente Santos, Juan Serapio, 
and Jose Serapio.
  <p>    There is no dispute that during the period above stated 
defendant was a Filipino citizen, and the evidence for the prosecution 
shows that, although at first he was a member of a guerilla unit, he 
later changed allegiance, defecting to the enemy early in December, 
1944.  Accompanying the Japanese and their ally, the makapilis, in their
 campaign against the resistance movement in Bulacan province, defendant
 participated in the apprehension of the above-named members of the 
guerilla forces and in the maltreatment of some of them.</p>
  <p>    But to comply with the two-witness rule, we have to confine 
discussion to the arrest of Fundador Baltazar, Maximo Castro, Vicente 
Santos, and Jose Serapio.</p>
  <p>    The arrest of Fundador Baltazar was testified to by himself.  
He declared that on December 6, 1944, he was arrested by defendant, who 
was accompanied by some Japanese soldiers and one Paulo Capa in Sapang 
Palay, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.  He also stated that his captors 
tied him with a rope, took him to the garrison and maltreated him 
because he was a member of a guerrilla unit.  Baltazar was corroborated 
by Tranquilino Lucas, who was himself apprehended on the same day and in
 the same place, and also by Vicente Ponce, who was likewise arrested 
and even dealt a first blow by the defendant.</p>
  <p>    The arrest of Maximo Castro was also effected by the defendant 
during the same month.  Castro was arrested while he and Antonio 
Desquitado were taking a pair of carabaos to the Japanese garrison in 
Tungkan Manga, defendant suspecting that Castro and Desquitado were 
taking the animals to the guerrillas in the mountains.  The arrest was 
testified to by Castro and Desquitado, with the corroboration of Vicente
 Nepomuceno, who saw Castro with hands tied being led by the makapilis 
to the <i>poblacion.</i></p>
  <p>    The arrest of Vicente Santos is established by the testimony of
 himself and Jose Serapio, while that of Jose Serapio is established by 
the testimony of himself and Vicente Santos.</p>
  <p>    Testifying in his defense, the defendant claimed that he was 
drafted into the service of the enemy and joined the makapili 
organization against his will, having been told that all the members of 
his family would be killed if he did not accompany the Japanese patrols.
  He admitted being with the group that raided Sapang Palay and arrested
 Fundador Baltazar and three other guerrillas, but said that he had been
 forced to do so by Paulo Capa, the head of the makapilis, and by one 
named Gubat.  He also admitted being in the group that arrested Maximo 
Castro, but explained that he did not lead that group and was merely 
acting under orders from Paulo Capa.  He said that some members of his 
group were able to escape from the Japanese and that he himself could 
have done so if he did not fear for the life of the members of his 
family.  He, however, admitted that he had no children.  He further 
declared that after the Americans had liberated San Jose del Monte on 
February 4, 1945, he and many other Filipinos headed for the mountains 
of Ipo, carrying supplies for the Japanese, who were then retreating, 
and that he finally managed to escape on May 15, 1945.</p>
  <p>    The trial court did not believe defendant's exculpatory 
statements, declared him guilty of treason and sentenced him to 10 
years, 8 months and 1 day of <i>reclusion temporal,</i> a fine of 
P5,000.00 and the costs.</p>
  <p>    From this sentence defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, 
but that court certified the case here, being of the opinion that 
defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
  <p>    The case hinges principally on the credibility of witnesses, 
and there being nothing in the record to show that those who testified 
for the prosecution had any reason to impute to the defendant a crime he
 had not committed, we have no justification for doubting their 
testimony.</p>
  <p>    The contradictions which the defendant claims to have noted in 
the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution refer to mere matters
 of detail and do not affect their veracity.  And while it is true that,
 due to lapse of time, some of the witnesses were not able to give the 
exact date of the arrest of Fundandor Baltazar, Maximo Castro, Vicente 
Santos, and Jose Serapio, except to say that it took place in December, 
1944, there is no doubting the fact that these arrests were actually 
made, for defendant has confessed to the apprehension of the first two 
and of three other guerrilla members whom he did not name.</p>
  <p>    From the evidence submitted, we find that the trial court did 
not err in declaring defendant guilty of treason, and the sentence 
imposed below being sufficient punishment for the treasonous sets 
perpetrated by him, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.
