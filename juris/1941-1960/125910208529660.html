				<H3>NORTH CAMARINES LUMBER CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS,  C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is an appeal from a resolution of the  Court of Tax Appeals dismissing the petition  for review filed by the  petitioner  for  lack of jurisdiction  to try it  on the merits,  the  same  having been  filed  beyond  the  30-day period  fixed in Section 11 of  Republic Act  No.  1125.</p>
<p>The petitioner,  North Camarines Lumber  Co.,  Inc.,  is a domestic  corporation  engaged  in  the lumber business. On June  19, 1951  and  July 31,  1951, it.sold  a total of 2,164363 board feet of logs to  the  General Lumber Co., Inc., with the  agreement  that  the latter would  assume responsibility for  the payment  of the sales  tax thereon in the  amount of P7,768.51.  After  being  consulted  on the  matter,  the respondent  Collector  of Internal Revenue,  in his  letters dated June  18,  1951 and  August  6, 1951, advised the  petitioner that he  was interposing no objection to the arrangement, provided the General Lumber Co., Inc., would file the. corresponding bonds to cover the sales tax liabilities.</p>
<p>The General  Lumber Co., Inc., complied with the condition.   In view, however, of  its failure  and that of the surety to pay the tax liabilities, the respondent Collector, in his letter dated August  30, 1955,  required the petitioner to pay the total amount of P9,598.72 as sales tax and incidental  penalties in the sale  of logs to the General Lumber Co., Inc.  Although the date of receipt by petitioner of this  letter does not  appear  in the records, it may be presumed to be September 9, 1955, when the petitioner addressed a letter to the respondent Collector, which was received on September 12, 1955, wherein the petitioner acknowledged receipt  of the letter of demand and  at the same time  requested  for the reconsideration of the assessment.  This  was  denied  by the respondent  Collector in his letter of December 8, 1955, received by  the  petitioner on  January 5, 1956.  The  respondent  Collector having denied  the  second request for reconsideration in his letter dated January 30, 1956,  which the  petitioner received on February 16, 1956, the latter, on  March IS, 1956, filed a petition  for review with the Court of Tax Appeals.  The  Court,  after a preliminary  hearing  on respondent Collector's motion to dismiss, ruled that,  as the petition  was filed  beyond  the  30-day period  prescribed by Section 11  of Republic Act  No.  1125, it has no jurisdiction to try  the  same.  Accordingly, the  case was dismissed.</p>
<p>In  contending that the  Court of Tax Appeals  erred, the petitioner points out that Section 7, and not Section 11, of  Republic Act No. 1125  confers and determines the jurisdiction of the respondent court, and that  Section 11 refers merely to the prescriptive period for filing appeals.</p>
<p>While the petitioner is correct as to the attribute of Section 7, it should be remembered that, for the respondent court to have jurisdiction over any case, the party seeking  redress must first invoke its exercise in  the  manner and within the time  prescribed by the law.  Thus  Section 7,  which enumerates the specific cases falling within the  jurisdiction of the Court  of Tax Appeals must be read together  with Section 11 which fixes the time for  invoking said jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There is no question that petitioner's  case is  covered by Section 7 and, therefore, comes within the jurisdiction of the  respondent court.  But was said  jurisdiction  invoked by the petitioner within the  period prescribed by Section 11?</p>
<p>The respondent court ruled that the time consumed by the petitioner in perfecting its appeal after deducting the time during  which the period for appeal was suspended by a pending request for reconsideration is  as follows:</p>

<p>As the petitioner had  consumed  thirty-three days,  its appeal was clearly filed out  of  time.  It is argued,  however, that in computing the 30-day period fixed in Section 11 of Republic Act No. if 25, the letter of the respondent Collector  dated January  30, 1956,  denying  the  second request for reconsideration,  should be considered as the final decision contemplated in Section 7, and not the letter of demand dated August 30, 1955. <br></p><p>This contention is  untenable.  We  cannot countenance the theory  that would make the  commencement of the statutory 30-day period  solely dependent on the  will  of the taxpayer and place the latter in a position to put off indefinitely  and at his  convenience the finality of a tax assessment.  Such an absurd procedure would be detrimental to the interest of the Government,  for  "taxes are the lifeblood  of the  government,  and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need."   (Bull  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> U.S. 295, U.S.  247.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution  appealed from is affirmed, with  costs.   So  ordered.</p>
