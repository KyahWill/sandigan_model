				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In and prior to the year 1947, Lot No. 12-f, Block 2255, of the&nbsp; San Lazaro Estate, located at 450 Malabon Street corner&nbsp; Felix Huertas Street, Manila, with an area of 131 square&nbsp; meters, together&nbsp; with the building&nbsp; and&nbsp; other improvements thereon, had&nbsp; been declared for taxation purposes under&nbsp; Assessment&nbsp; No. 1784&nbsp; of the Office&nbsp; of the Manila City Assessor, in the names of&nbsp; Juana de la Cruz, Francisco de la Cruz, and Eustaquia B. Vda. de la Cruz, in the amount of P12,770.00.&nbsp; "The same property was covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 12185 of the land records of Manila, in the names only of Juana de la&nbsp; Cruz and&nbsp; Francisco de&nbsp; la Cruz.&nbsp; On&nbsp; September 26, 1948, the same&nbsp; property was&nbsp; mortgaged&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rehabilitation Finance Corporation&nbsp; (R. F.&nbsp; C),&nbsp; for P16.500.00 the mortgage contract&nbsp; being&nbsp; annotated on the back&nbsp; of&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title No. 12185. For delinquency in the real estate taxes for the years 1948 and 1949, the said property was advertised for sale&nbsp; at&nbsp; public&nbsp; auction in&nbsp; the name of Eustaquia B. Vda. De la&nbsp; Cruz, the advertisement having been duly published&nbsp; in the Philippines Herald&nbsp; of September 28,&nbsp; October 5&nbsp; and 12,&nbsp; 1949, and copies of the notice&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; posted at the&nbsp; City Hall&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila.<br><br>Pursuant to the notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale, the property&nbsp; was sold at public auction&nbsp; by the&nbsp; City Treasurer&nbsp; on October 29, 1949 and was awarded&nbsp; to petitioner&nbsp; Leon C.&nbsp; Santos as the highest bidder, for the sum of P509.20.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 9, 1950, the City Treasurer issued&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; of sale in favor of&nbsp; Santos,&nbsp; which certificate, however, was&nbsp; never presented for registration&nbsp; at the&nbsp;&nbsp; Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Manila Register of Deeds, neither has any memorandum thereof been made&nbsp; on the back of Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 12185.&nbsp; On&nbsp; August 26, 1950, the City Treasurer&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; a notice&nbsp; to Juana and Francisco that the property covered by&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 12185 had been sold at public auction on October&nbsp; 29, 1949, and that they had one year from said date within which&nbsp; to redeem the property,&nbsp; the last day being&nbsp; October&nbsp; 29, 1950.&nbsp; On June 20,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; Juana and Francisco deposited the sum of P1,014.65 with the City&nbsp; Treasurer "for payment&nbsp; of real estate taxes&nbsp; for the years&nbsp; 1948 to 1951&nbsp; on the property described in and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 12185."<br><br>On&nbsp; November 12,&nbsp; 1951, the&nbsp; City Treasurer&nbsp; executed and issued a deed of sale&nbsp; on&nbsp; the same property in&nbsp; favor of Santos.&nbsp; Said deed was registered&nbsp; and annotated&nbsp; on the back&nbsp; of Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 12185&nbsp; on February 15, 1952.&nbsp; In the meantime, the mortgage debt of P16,500.00 to&nbsp; the R.F.C. remained unpaid and appeared as outstanding in the books&nbsp; of said R.F.C. at P16,925.58 as of October 29, 1949.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; Juana&nbsp; and&nbsp; Francisco would appear to have made payments on&nbsp; account,&nbsp; reducing the&nbsp; same indebtedness to P9,822.18 as of&nbsp; February 8, 1955.<br><br>The present action had&nbsp; its origin in the petition filed by&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila on October 16, 1954, asking the court to direct the Register of Deeds to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 12185 and&nbsp; to&nbsp; issue&nbsp; in&nbsp; lieu thereof a.&nbsp; new certificate in&nbsp; his (Santos)&nbsp; name.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition was&nbsp; opposed not only&nbsp; by Juana and Francisco but also by the ,R.&nbsp; F. C.&nbsp; The parties filed a&nbsp; stipulation of facts&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; after&nbsp; a&nbsp; short hearing wherein&nbsp; some evidence&nbsp; was&nbsp; submitted,&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court by its order of June 13, 1955, denied the petition.&nbsp; Santos is now appealing said order of denial, attributing to the trial&nbsp; court the&nbsp; following errors:<br><blockquote><center>"ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS</center><br>"(1) The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in concluding that the&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; in the case of Metropolitan&nbsp; Water&nbsp; District us. Aurelio Reyes, 74 Phil. 143,. is decisive of the case at bar.<br>"(2) Tile&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; erred in declaring that the deposit&nbsp; of P1,014.65&nbsp; made by oppositors Juana de la Cruz and Francisco de la Crua on June 20,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; constitute legal exercise, of their&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of redemption.<br>"(3) The lower court erred in&nbsp; declaring that the cases of Mercedes Valbuena, et al., vs. Aurelio Reyes, et al., G. R. No. 48177, September 30, 1949,&nbsp; and Lourdes T.&nbsp; Paguio vs. Maria&nbsp; Rosado de Ruiz,&nbsp; O.&nbsp; R. No. L-5301,&nbsp; May 10, 1953, are not applicable to the case at bar.<br>"(4) The&nbsp; lower court finally erred in denying&nbsp; the petition."</blockquote>The trial court citing&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Metropolitan Water District vs. Aurelio Reyes,&nbsp; 74 Phil. 143,&nbsp; based&nbsp; its denial of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; mainly&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner Santos failed to register in the Office&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Register of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; the certificate of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; him,&nbsp; dated September 9,&nbsp; 1950;&nbsp; that&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp; running&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; one year for purposes of&nbsp; redemption did not and&nbsp; could not start from the&nbsp; date of the&nbsp; sale; that said&nbsp; period of&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; should&nbsp; start&nbsp; either from the date&nbsp; when the&nbsp; registered&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of the property&nbsp; were actually&nbsp; notified of the&nbsp; sale, on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on February 15,&nbsp; 1952, when the final deed of sale was registered, and that&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; either case&nbsp; the&nbsp; registered owners should be regarded as having made the redemption within the period of one&nbsp; year, because they&nbsp; bad&nbsp; deposited&nbsp; in the Office&nbsp; of the City Treasurer&nbsp; on June 20,&nbsp; 1951 the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P1,014.65.&nbsp; We reproduce the&nbsp; pertinent portion of the decision, as follows:<br><blockquote>"After a careful study of the issue involved and the pleadings of all the parties, this court has come to the conclusion that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Metropolitan Water District vs. Aurelio Reyes, 74 Phil, 143, is decisive of the case at bar.&nbsp; In that decision it was held that:<br><blockquote>"It is not necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; register a&nbsp; tax lien because it is automatically registered,&nbsp; once the tax accrues, by virtue of Section 39 of Act&nbsp; No. 496.&nbsp; But there is no provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; law&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effect that the sale of&nbsp; registered land&nbsp; to foreclose a tax lien&nbsp; need not be registered.&nbsp; On the contrary,&nbsp; section 77 of said&nbsp; Act specifically provides (in so far as it is pertinent here) that whenever registered land is sold for taxes or for&nbsp; any assessment, any&nbsp; officer's&nbsp; return or any&nbsp; deed,&nbsp; demand,&nbsp; certificate,&nbsp; or&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; other&nbsp; instrument made in&nbsp; the course of&nbsp; proceedings to enforce such liens&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; filed with&nbsp; the register&nbsp; of deeds&nbsp; for&nbsp; the province where the land&nbsp; lies&nbsp; and registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration book, and&nbsp; a&nbsp; memorandum made upon&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; certificate,&nbsp; in&nbsp; each&nbsp;&nbsp; case,&nbsp; as&nbsp; an adverse claim&nbsp; or&nbsp; encumbrance.&nbsp; Section 50 also expressly provides that the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the&nbsp; land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; tax sale&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Treasurer to respondent&nbsp; on&nbsp; May 4, 1937, did not bind the land and did not affect petitioner&nbsp; until it was registered on November 3, 1938."<br><br>"According to&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; transcribed&nbsp; doctrine,&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of one year in the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar. did not&nbsp; run&nbsp; against the oppositors for&nbsp; it appears in the stipulation of facts that the&nbsp; certificate of sale has never been registered in the office of the Register of Deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Granting that the&nbsp; oppositors had knowledge of the sale&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, which is&nbsp; tantamount&nbsp; to registration&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; Assistant&nbsp; Treasurer of the City&nbsp; of Manila to them on&nbsp; August 26, 1950, Exhibit&nbsp; "N", Guatilo vs. Marayilla, 48 Phil, 442 or granting that the&nbsp; one&nbsp; year period should&nbsp; be counted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the registration of the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; sale, Exhibit&nbsp; "G", on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 15, 1952, in&nbsp;&nbsp; either&nbsp;&nbsp; case the&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; had&nbsp; one year&nbsp; within&nbsp; which to exercise their rights&nbsp; to&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; or&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; delinquent taxes from the&nbsp; date of such&nbsp; knowledge or&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the registration of the deed of sale.&nbsp; Since the&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; had&nbsp; made deposit in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case&nbsp; in the Office of&nbsp; the Treasurer of the City of Manila on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1951 or&nbsp; before&nbsp; the expiration&nbsp; of one year in said either&nbsp; case, for&nbsp; realty tax&nbsp; due 450&nbsp; Malabon, corner Felix&nbsp; Huertas, Lot&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp; of&nbsp; Block 2255—of&nbsp; 1926 San Lazaro for the&nbsp; sum of P1,014.66,&nbsp; Exhibit "F", it&nbsp; is evident that such&nbsp; deposit constituted legal&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of their rights&nbsp; of redemption or&nbsp; legal tender&nbsp; of&nbsp; payment of the delinquent&nbsp; taxes.<br><br>"The mere&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; accounted as&nbsp; deposit and&nbsp; trust fund&nbsp; under&nbsp; official&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 694376-V is&nbsp; not,&nbsp; in the opinion of this&nbsp; Court a" sufficient valid&nbsp; reason to deprive the oppositors&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; over&nbsp; the property&nbsp; herein involved, especially&nbsp; so&nbsp; if&nbsp; they had&nbsp; not&nbsp; been&nbsp; notified of such classification of trust fund."</blockquote></blockquote>Petitioner-appellant&nbsp;&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Metropolitan Water&nbsp; District case as well&nbsp; as the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Marina V. Tolentino vs.&nbsp; Romarieo Agcaoili, G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L—4349-51, cited by the&nbsp; trial court,&nbsp; are not&nbsp; applicable; that&nbsp; what are&nbsp; controlling are&nbsp; those&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mercedes&nbsp; Valbuena,&nbsp; et al. vs. Aurelio&nbsp; Reyes, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> G. E.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-5301, May 10, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the two&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; Valbuena&nbsp; and&nbsp; Paguio, the&nbsp; only question involved&nbsp; therein was the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of the tax sale made by the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Treasurer of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; for&nbsp; tax&nbsp; delinquency. There we&nbsp; held that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; not necessary for&nbsp; the City Treasurer&nbsp; to give personal notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax&nbsp; sale&nbsp; and that publication&nbsp; of the&nbsp; notice of the sale was sufficient. The&nbsp; question of the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; redemption and when it should&nbsp; begin&nbsp; to run was&nbsp; not discussed.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; we agree with the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Metropolitan Water District and&nbsp; Tolentino are applicable. In the Tolentino case, which also involved the non-registration of the&nbsp; certificate of sale,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court went further and&nbsp; extended the doctrine laid down&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Metropolitan Water District case by saying,&nbsp; after&nbsp; citing&nbsp; Section 77 of Act No. 496, the following:<br><blockquote>"From&nbsp; the above quoted provision it appears&nbsp; that whenever a registered&nbsp; land is sold on execution, or taken or&nbsp; sold for taxes, or for&nbsp; any assessment&nbsp; to&nbsp; enforce&nbsp; a lien of&nbsp; any&nbsp; character,&nbsp; it is required that the officer's&nbsp; return,&nbsp; or the certificate, or affidavit, or other instrument made in the course of the proceedings which are required&nbsp; by law to be recorded, be&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; register of deeds&nbsp; for&nbsp; the province where&nbsp; the land lies, be registered in the registry&nbsp; book&nbsp; and&nbsp; a ' memorandum&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; be made upon the proper certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title.&nbsp; This&nbsp; provision does not require that&nbsp; the&nbsp; document&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; registrable, be&nbsp; notarized.&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact it expressly&nbsp; permits an officer's&nbsp; return, or&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate, or&nbsp; other instrument made in the course of&nbsp; the proceedings to be filed&nbsp; for registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; in&nbsp; effecting'&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration the&nbsp; register a£ deeds&nbsp; does not have to issue a new&nbsp; certificate of title to&nbsp; the purchaser;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; enough that he&nbsp; makes&nbsp; a&nbsp; memorandum&nbsp; entry on&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of title to afford constructive notice to&nbsp; all the world. This&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that&nbsp; the registered&nbsp; owner may&nbsp; be apprised&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; annotation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; encumbrance and&nbsp; may take the necessary&nbsp; steps to protect his&nbsp; interest.&nbsp; He may choose either to&nbsp; abandon his property&nbsp; or redeem it within&nbsp; the period provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; by&nbsp; law, This requirement is fundamental because it&nbsp; is one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the safeguards&nbsp; that the&nbsp; law establishes in order that owners of land&nbsp; who may have failed to take note&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of their properties for&nbsp; delinquency&nbsp; in&nbsp; the payment of taxes may&nbsp; be notified&nbsp; of the action taken in connection with their properties.&nbsp; The&nbsp; failure&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; take&nbsp; this step vitiates fundamentally her petition."</blockquote>In those&nbsp; two cases,&nbsp; specially&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Tolentino&nbsp; case, we held that the period of redemption of one year should start from the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the registration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificate of sale or the final deed of sale in&nbsp; favor of the purchaser, so that the&nbsp; delinquent registered owners or third parties interested in the redemption may know that the delinquent property&nbsp; had been sold, and that they had one year from said constructive&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of the sale by means of&nbsp; registration within&nbsp; which to&nbsp; redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; property,&nbsp; if&nbsp; they wished to do&nbsp; so.<br><br>In further&nbsp; support of this&nbsp; doctrine of the&nbsp; necessity of&nbsp; registering&nbsp; auction sales,&nbsp; we have the&nbsp; case of Philippine&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Commission vs.&nbsp; Abadilla,&nbsp; 74&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 68, wherein this Court&nbsp; held that as regards&nbsp; registered land sold at public auction in&nbsp; execution of a&nbsp; judgment, the registered owners may redeem the land&nbsp; so&nbsp; sold within one year, not from&nbsp; the date of the&nbsp; auction sale of which they had no&nbsp; notice,&nbsp; but&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date the&nbsp; sale was registered.<br><br>Petitioner, however, cites Section 70 of Republic Act 409, which is the revised Charter of the City of Manila, which expressly provides that&nbsp; the redemption&nbsp; period of one year should start from the date of sale, as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 70. <i>Redemption of real estate.</i>—Within one year from&nbsp; the date of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; the&nbsp; delinquent taxpayer,&nbsp; or anyone for him, shall have the right&nbsp; of paying to the city&nbsp; assessor&nbsp; and collector&nbsp; the amount' of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; taxes,&nbsp; penalties,&nbsp; and&nbsp; costs together&nbsp; with interest on&nbsp; the purchase price at the rate of fifteen per centum, per&nbsp; annum from the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; purchase of the date&nbsp; of the redemption;" * * *</blockquote>and contends&nbsp; that to&nbsp; apply Sections 50 and&nbsp; 77 of Act 496 in the&nbsp; sense&nbsp; that&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of redemption should start from the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tax sale, would render Section&nbsp; 70 of&nbsp; the Revised Charter of&nbsp; Manila nugatory or&nbsp; meaningless. But as the E. F. C.&nbsp; suggests, the two apparently conflicting laws must be harmonized and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; redemption shall&nbsp; be within one&nbsp; year from&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale"&nbsp; provided therein should be interpreted&nbsp; to refer to the date that the sale is actually registered.&nbsp;&nbsp; We favor the suggestion.&nbsp; It should be remembered that the real&nbsp; properties in the City of Manila are&nbsp; all registered&nbsp; under the&nbsp; Torrens System, and&nbsp; that all transactions and&nbsp; conveyances&nbsp; and liens, whether voluntary or otherwise, involving said&nbsp; properties must be recorded&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Register&nbsp; of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; and annotated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; corresponding certificate of title,&nbsp; this for&nbsp; the&nbsp; information not only&nbsp; of the registered owners, but&nbsp; also&nbsp; of&nbsp; third&nbsp; parties;&nbsp; and Section&nbsp; 50 of the Land Registration Act expressly provides that the act of registration is the&nbsp; operative act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; an auction sale to satisfy a&nbsp; tax lien&nbsp; should be registered so&nbsp; that the&nbsp; delinquent&nbsp; registered owner&nbsp; who does not&nbsp; wish to lose his&nbsp; property&nbsp; for&nbsp; mere&nbsp; tax delinquency, specially if the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the tax is&nbsp; out of all proportion to the value&nbsp; of the property, or&nbsp; a third person&nbsp; holding a lien on&nbsp; said&nbsp; delinquent property&nbsp; and&nbsp; not wishing that the registered&nbsp; owner lose the&nbsp; said property, would&nbsp; be&nbsp; duly informed, at least constructively, by means of registration of the tax sale, so that&nbsp; they can decide whether or not to make redemption.<br><br>This is&nbsp; a sound rule&nbsp; and will tend&nbsp; to counteract an allegedly&nbsp; anomalous practice&nbsp; which&nbsp; has been&nbsp; called to our&nbsp; attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote from Professor Narciso Peña's book entitled Land Titles and Deeds, 1955&nbsp; Eev. ed.,&nbsp; See. 25, p. 278:<br><blockquote>"25. <i>When ona-year period for redemption begins to run.</i>—Tn cases of tax sales as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as those&nbsp; of&nbsp; other auction sales&nbsp; by virtue of attachments, the statutes generally provide for a period of one year for purposes&nbsp; of redemption.&nbsp; When sale&nbsp; involves&nbsp; registered land; the problem&nbsp; that may confront us is:&nbsp; When&nbsp; does that period commence to run?&nbsp; Is it from the&nbsp; actual! date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; auction&nbsp; sale or from the date of registration of said sale?<br><br>"Upon&nbsp; the assumption that in the cage of&nbsp; a&nbsp; tax&nbsp; sale the period commences from the&nbsp; actual date&nbsp; set for&nbsp; the auction,&nbsp; it has been the common&nbsp; practice&nbsp; among purchasers, from&nbsp; whom&nbsp; the property may be redeemed, to withhold the&nbsp; registration of the deed or certificate of sale&nbsp; until after the lapse of one year,&nbsp; when the sale, becomes final thinking that if registration were to be done&nbsp; earlier the owner or holder oi the title would be awakened in time,&nbsp; for incidentally he would he&nbsp; advised by the Register of Deeds to surrender&nbsp; the title for annotation of the sale, preparatory&nbsp; to its&nbsp; consolidation in the vendee&nbsp; after the lapse of&nbsp; one&nbsp; year.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand, if registration takes place after the&nbsp; lapse of the' statutory period, the owner would no longer have any&nbsp; more opportunity to exercise his legal right of redemption."</blockquote>We agree with&nbsp; the trial court that the&nbsp; deposit made by the registered owners Juana and Francisco&nbsp; of the sura of P1,014.65 in the Office of the City Treasurer should and could be used for purposes&nbsp; of redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be that the treasurer in receiving said deposit had considered it as a&nbsp; trust&nbsp; fund,&nbsp; but his&nbsp;&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; stand in&nbsp; the way&nbsp; of&nbsp; redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not&nbsp; knowing&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; redemption was valid under the law, he probably wanted to play safe&nbsp; and instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; accepting the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; for purposes of redemption, he classified it&nbsp; as trust funds.<br><br>We deem it.&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; discuss the&nbsp; other&nbsp; points raised in the&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; order of&nbsp; June 13,&nbsp; 1965,&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
