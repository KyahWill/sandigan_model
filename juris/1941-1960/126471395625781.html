				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Mariano de Guzman  (petitioner herein) filed in the Court of  First Instance of Bulacan  a complaint  against the herein respondents Florentina de Guzman, Domingo Sanchez and Sergio de Guzman  (the first two  being husband and wife), alleging that the petitioner is the owner of a parcel of land situated in Binahg,  Bocaue, Bulacan, and covered by tax declaration No. 1756, having purchased the same on October  3, 1944 from Doroteo  de Guzman; that the respondents were some of the tenants  of  petitioner's pfedecessor-in-interest, Doroteo de Guzman, each occupying a lot of some 150 square meters; that after the petitioner had purchased the land, he asked the respondents to pay a reasonable rental or, in  default thereof, to vacate  their respective lots;  that despite repeated  demands,  the. respondents had refused either to pay the rental or to vacate the  premises;  that P10 per year was a reasonable rental for each lot; and praying that the respondents be sentenced to pay to the petitioner  the annual rental of  P20  from 1945, to vacate the  premises, and to pay moral damages in the sum to be fixed by  the court, attorney's fee in the sum of P500, and the costs of  suit.</p>
<p>The respondents in their answer alleged that the portions occupied by respondents Florentina de Guzman and Sergio de Guzman  were inherited by the  latter from their respective mothers, the same having been originally owned by their grandmother and predecessor-in-interest, Basilia Parulan; and that said respondents and their predecessor-in-interest had been  in actual, peaceful,  public, continuous and  uninterrupted possession of said portions  for more than  50 years under claim of exclusive title.</p>
<p>After trial, the court rendered a. decision, ordering the respondents to vacate the premises in question.   Upon appeal by the respondents, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision,  reversing the judgment of the  Court of  First Instance of Bulacan  and holding that the owners of the land described in the complaint are  the persons specified in said  decision in the proportions therein indicated, without  costs.  The  case is now before us upon  appeal by certiorari  taken  by the petitioner  (plaintiff below).  As the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are conclusive in this  instance, we  deem it  proper and more  expedient to quote in full the  appealed  decision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The spouses Felix de Guzman and Basilia Parulan were the owners of  a parcel of  land situated in  Binan, Bocaue,  Bulacan. They had seven children named Romualdo, Pedro,  Robijia, Juana, Juan,  Pablo and  Tiongi al surnamed De Guzman,  Robijia died during the Spanish Revolution and in all likelihood Tiong and  Juan died without leaving any issue.  Romualdo, the oldest,  had a son named Doroteo.   Pedro was  married to  Potenciana Marcelo and bad two daughters named Mercedes and Ana.  Juana had a natural son named Sergio de  Guzman and  Pablo also  had a  son named Mariano.  Ana;  one  of the daughters of Pedro  de Guzman and Potenciana Marcelo, had a natural daughter named  Florentine.  The land was registered for taxation purposes  in the name of Romualdo de Guzman, being the oldest (Exhibit  S)  who had been  paying the taxes  on said  land up  to his death in 1923.  His son Doroteo sold  the land in 1944 to his cousin  Mariano who then  found living in said land Florentina de Guzman, the natural daughter of Ana de  Guzman,  Sergio  de  Guzman,  the natural  son of  Juana  de Guzman, Vidal Eustaquio, Serapio Benedicto,  Teodoro  Claudio and Manul de Leon.  Florentina  upon  being  informed that  Mariano bought the land showed  displeasure but acknowledged him as the owner and  in  fact  paid  the rent corresponding to 1945  in  the amount of P5 according to Mariano, the  plaintiff.  Sergio de Guzman,  however,  would not  pay any rent. In 1950  Mariano  de "Guzman again tried to collect rents from  Florentina and  Sergio, both of whom, claiming ownership of the land through inheritance from their parents,  refused to pay rents and hence the filing of an  action by  Mariano de Guzman  in the Court of First  Instance of Bulacan for the  recovery of possession of the  parcel of land in question and  the collection  of rents from the defendants  Florentina  de  Guzman,  her husband Domingo  Sanchez and  Sergio  de Guzman  at the rate of  P10 a  year  each or a total  of P120 for the  years 1945 to  1950  and for  attorney's  fees in the  amount of P500.  The  defendants  in their  answer alleged that they  are the owners of the portions repectively occupied by them, having in- herited them from their mothers who in turn  inherited said land from their grandmother Basilia Parulan.   After due trial the case was decided in favor of  the plaintiff  and  the  defendants  were ordered to vacate the land,  from which  decision  defendants have appealed  alleging that the lower court erred:</p>
  <p>"1. In finding that Exhibit A validly  transferred the ownership of the whole land to the plaintiff  and  that Doroteo  de Guzman solely acquired the land  by inheritance  from  his father.</p>
  <p>"2. In  holding  that the payments of the land taxes  by  the defendants were not in the concept of owners adverse to and exclusive of Romualdo de Guzman.</p>
  <p>"3. In  holding that the possession  of the defendants  was not sufficient  to defeat the rights of the plaintiff and bis predecessor in interest.</p>
  <p>"4. In holding  that  the occupancy of the defendant Florentina de Guzman  since birth and the defendant  Sergio  de Guzman for 25  years  did not  confer upon  them  right  of ownership  by prescription.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"5. In concluding that the mistaken belief of the defendants that they succeeded to the rights  of their mothers  precluded them from claiming the ownership by acquisitive' prescription.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"It is a  fact  not denied by  plaintiff and, his  predecessor in interest  that  Ana  de  Guzman, mother of  Florentina,  had  been living on the land in question where Florentina was horn. In fact Doroteo  de  Guzman testified  that  upon the  death of his father Romualdo, he  entrusted the  collection of the  rents  from  the other occupants of the land to Ana de Guaman and that Sergio de Guzman is the  natural son  of Juana  de Guzman who also lived  on the land in question where  Sergio was  born,  thus confirming  the  testimony  of Florentina that it was her mother who had  been paying the  taxes  on said  land and  collecting rents from the other occupants, some of whom built  their houses on said land with her permission.  Exhibit 4, official receipt No. .0-972210, shows  that  taxes on  the land  in  question   were paid  by  Ana de Guzman  in  1936  notwithstanding the fact  that the assessment was  in  the  name of Romualdo de  Guzman.</p>
  <p>"As  possessors of the land in  question, Ana  de Guzman and Juana  de Guzman  were  ahead of Doroteo de Guzman,  the predecessor  in  interest of  the  plaintiff.  Long before the  death  of his father, Romualdo, in  1923, Doroteo had been  living  in  Tondo, Manila,   where he  began  to reside  in 1913  and worked  as  a laborer.   Plaintiff Mariano de Guzman, son of Pablo de Guzman, one of the seven children of  Felix de Guzman and Basilia Parulan,  had never lived on the  land in question and that is  why he had  to, inquire  at  the  time  he  bought  it  who  were  the occupants thereof.  Both  Doroteo  de  Guzman  and his  successor in interest Mariano de  Guzman pretended to ignore who were the former owners of the  land  prior to  Romualdo de  Guzman notwithstanding the fact that they had to admit that they are  related to the  defendants.</p>
  <p>"The registration" of the land in question for  purposes of taxation exclusively in the name of Romualdo de Guzman did not make him the owner thereof or the one possessing it exclusively, continuously, adversely and in the concept  of owner, it. having been explained satisfactorily by the defendants that Romualdo was the  oldest  of the seven children of  Felix de Guzman and Basilia Parulan and that  the  land in question has been occupied at least by Pedro  de Guzman and his wife Poteneiana' Mareelo who were succeeded upon their death by Ana de  Guzman and also by  Juana de Guzman, one of the seven children  who was later  succeeded in said possession by her  natural  son, the  defendant Sergio de Guzman.  The  possession,  therefore of the  land  in  question was in common  among Romualdo, his brother Pedro, their sister Juana and their respective heirs.  Mariano  de Guzman, the plaintiff, could not have purchased from  Doroteo except  his  (Doroteo's)  share  as  heir  and successor in interest of Romualdo.  He himself is a co-owner of the  land  in question, being  the successor in  interest  of his  father Pablo  de Guzman.</p>
  <p>"This action was commenced for the  recovery of the possession of the  land  in  question.  But both  parties produced  evidence  to show  that  they  are  the owners of the  land and hence the court is not barred from deciding the case of ownership as did the lower court  and convert this case into an action of partition.  According to the evidence presented by both  parties, the only surviving heirs who   left  successors were Romualdo, father  of  Doroteo;  Pedro, father of Mercedes and Ana,  the latter being the  mother  of defendant Florentina;  Juana,  mother of  Sergio, and  Pablo,  father of plaintiff Mariano de Guzman. Doroteo sold his  share  to Mariano and hence he  has become the owner  of  two shares, the share purchased by bun and the  share which  belongs to  him as  heir of Pablo.  Ana, together with Mercedes,  should  own  the  portion of Pedro.  But  Ana  having died,  her  share  should  go  to her natural  daughter Florentina.  Sergio should get the share  of her mother  Juana.  The  only question,  therefore,  to be  resolved  is whether Florentina, as natural child of  Ana, is entitled to  inherit. The lower  court held that she is  not entitled  to  share in  the inheritance of  the legitimate parents of her  mother, namely Pedro de Guzman and Potenciana Marcelo.  But  this  is  not the case, for where a mother inherits from  her  legitimate parents her share, upon  her death can be  inherited by her  natural  daughter.   In the same situation is  Sergio  de Guzman  who being the natural son of Juana de  Guzman  could not inherit from the latter's legitimate parents,  Felix  de  Guzman  and  Basilia Parulan,  directly.  But the latter having died, Juana  inherited her share in their estate and upon the death of  Juana, Sergio can  inherit  from her  said share.</p>
  <p>"In view whereof, we hereby reverse the decision appealed from and hold that the owners of the  parcel of land in  question are the persons above-mentioned in  the proportion above-indicated, without costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  is noteworthy that although  the action  commenced in the  Court  of  First Instance of Bulacan was one for ejectment, the Court of Appeals, in view of the fact that both parties adduced evidence of ownership, held that it is not barred from deciding the question of title and frBni converting the action into  one of partition.  Accordingly,. the Court of Appeals found that  the land involved originally belonged to  the spouses Felix de Guzman and Basilia Parulan, who had seven children named Romualdo, Pedro, Robijia,  Juana,  Juan,  Pablo and Tiong, all surnamed De Guzman; and concluded that  according  to the  evidence presented by both parties,  "the only surviving heirs who left successors were  Romualdo, father of Doroteo; Pedro, father of Mercedes and Ana,  the latter being the mother of defendant Florentina; Juana, mother of Sergio, arid Pablo, father of plaintiff Mariano de Guzman.  Doroteo sold  his  share to Mariano and hence he has become the owner of two shares, the share purchased  by him and the share which belongs to him as heir  of Pablo.  Aria, together  with Mercedes, should own the portion, of Pedro. But Ana having died,  her share  should go to her natural daughter Florentina.   Sergio should get the share of her mother Juana.   The only question, therefore to be resolved is whether Florentina, as natural child of Ana, is entitled to inherit.   The lower court held that she is not entitled to share in the  inheritance of the legitimate parents of her mother,  namely  Pedro de  Guzman  arid Potenciaria Marcelo.   But this  is  not  the case, for where  a mother inherits from her ligitimate parents  her  share, upon her death can be inherited by  her natural daughter.  In the same situation is Sergio de Guzman who, being the natural son of Juana de Guzman could not inherit from the latter's legitimate  parents,  Felix  de  Guzman  and Basil fa Parulan,  directly.  But the  latter having died, Juana in herited her  share in their estate and upon the death of Juana, Sergio can inherit from her said share."</p>
<p>The  petitioner assails the propriety of converting the action for ejectment into one of partition; contends that Florentina de Guzman and Sergio de Guzman, being natural or illegitimate  children,  have no right to  get from their toothers what was inherited by the latter from their legitimate parents; and controverts the conclusion  that the land in question originally belonged to the spouses Felix de Guzman and Basilia  Parulan and  that the possession thereof was  in common  among Romualdo,  Pedro, Juana, and their respective heirs.  We would have been inclined to affirm the judgment of the Court of  First  Instance of Bulacan ejecting the respondents, were it not for the fact that we  are bound  by the findings' of fact of the Court of Appeals.  Even  so, we are not in a  position  to affirm tile appealed decision for the reason that  not  all heirs or co-owners are parties hereto.  For example,  Mercedes" de Guzman, who was  adjudged  to be  entitled to a share, was a mere witness.</p>
<p>We therefore constrained to remand,  as  we hereby remand, the case to the court of origin for further proceedings, after all the parties in interest or heirs of the spouses Felix de Guzman and Basilia Parulan shall have been impleaded either as plaintiff or defendant,  considering the action  as  one for partition.   So ordered without pronouncement  as  to costs.</p>
