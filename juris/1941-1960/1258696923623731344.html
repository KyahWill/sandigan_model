				<H3>VISAYAN REALTY, INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. BIBIANO L. MEER, IN HIS CAPACITY AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE , DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action instituted by the Visayan Realty, Inc., in the Court of 
First Instance of Cebu against the Collector of Internal Revenue seeking the 
refund of the sum of P69,138.67 paid as forest charges.
<p>Defendant, in his answer denied the claim and, by way of counterclaim, 
alleged that plaintiff is still indebted to the Government in the sum of 
P9,986.70, representing forest charges and surcharges he has not paid during the 
period from November, 1935 to December, 1940.</p>
<p>The case was submitted on a stipulation of facts, and thereafter the court 
rendered judgment dismissing both plaintiff's complaint as well as defendant's 
counterclaim. But, on a motion for reconsideration, the court amended its 
decision, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view thereof, this Court, after reconsidering its conclusions in its 
original decision, Hereby pronounces judgment declaring tha plaintiff entitled 
to the recovery of P20,716.52, corresponding to the forest charges from December 
29, 1928 to November 4, 1940, which they have paid under protest minus the sum 
of P9.986.70, due in favor of defendant the "Collector of Internal Revenue, or a 
balance of P10,729.82 which the Court orders said defendant to pay to plaintiff 
in accordance with the means provided for by law with the costs against the 
defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p>From this judgment both parties have appealed, plaintiff from that portion 
which orders defendant to pay to plaintiff only a balance of P10,729.82 instead 
of what is claimed in the complaint, and defendant from that portion which 
declares that plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of P20,716.52 and not 
only the amount of P15,940.66, and in any event, from that portion which holds 
that plaintiff and its predecessors-in-interst were exempted from the payment of 
the corresponding forest charges mentioned in the complaint.</p>
<p>In 1927, Fortunato S. Veloso, Manuel H. Veloso, Gabino M. Veloso and 
Buenaventura M. Veloso filed with the Department of Agriculture and Commerce 
sales applications for four tracts of land situated in barrio Odiongan, 
municipality of Gingoog, Oriental Misamis, which were numbered 9204, 9207, 9208 
and 9269, respectively. On September 8, 1928, the Director of Forestry certified 
that said tracts of land were not needed for forest purposes subject to the 
condition that the applicants cannot cut and dispose of for commercial purposes 
any timber growing thereon without license from the Bureau of Forestry. Said 
tracts of land were awarded for sale to the aforementioned four persons in the 
year 1929, the parcel covered by sales application No. 9204 having been awarded 
on June 10, 1929, that covered by sales application No. 9207 on July 12, 1929; 
that covered by sales application No. 9208 on February 5, 1929; and that covered 
by sales application No. 9269 on July 11, 1929.</p>
<p>In 1935, the four awardees transferred their rights and interest under the 
sales applications to the Visayan Realty, Inc., plaintiff herein. This transfer 
was approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce on September 6, 1940, 
and on November 7, 1940, patents were issued to the plaintiff by the Director of 
Lands and sent to the Register of Deed? for registration. Accordingly the 
Register of Deeds issued for each parcel of land Original Certificates of Title 
Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>
<p>It also appears that the Bureau of Forestry issued Ordinary Timber License 
No. 486-K, on April 16, 1934 and Ordinary Timber License No. 461-A in January, 
1936 in favor of the Estate of Mariano G. Veloso, Inc., granting the latter the 
right to cut timber within an area of 576 hectares covered by the sales 
applications above mentioned. Subsequently, a similar license was issued to the 
plaintiff covering the same area which was supplemented by a letter of the 
Director of Forestry dated August 5, 1937 and, still later, the Bureau of 
Forestry issued two more licenses to the plaintiff for the same purpose, which 
were supplemented by letters of the Director of Forestry dated September 22, 
1938, February 25, 1939, and June 12, 1940, authorizing plaintiff to cut timber 
from the four tracts of land above mentioned.</p>
<p>From January 13, 1930 to November 4, 1940 the Collector of Internal Revenue 
collected from the plaintiff the amount of P69,138.67 representing forest 
charges for the timber cut and removed from said four tracts of land. The 
payments made during the period from January 13, 1930 to June 1, 1939 amounting 
to P53,198.01 were made without protest. However, the payments corresponding to 
the period from July 3, 1939 to November 4, 1940 amounting to P15,940.66 were 
made under protest. It also appears that plaintiff had not paid to the 
Government the amount of P9,986.70 for forest charges and surcharges 
corresponding to the period from November, 1935 to December, 1940 despite the 
demand made for its payment by the Collector of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellant in its first assignment of error contends that the lower 
court erred in ruling that the ownership of the four tracts of land did not pass 
to the plaintiff when the award of the sales was made in 1929 but only when the 
sales patents were "registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds or when 
the corresponding certification of title covering the lands were issued in favor 
of the plaintiff. Plaintiff-appellant contends that the title to those four 
tracts of land passed from the Government to said plaintiff as of the dates when 
the sales applications of its predecessors-in-interest were approved in 1929 and 
not when certificates of title were issued by the Register of Deeds in 1940, 
because the issuance of said certificates of title is but a matter of formality 
which cannot diminish nor affect the <em>substantial fact</em> that the naked 
ownership of said lands had already passed from the Government to plaintiff's 
predecessors-in-interest from the time their sales applications had been awarded 
to them. From this time, plaintiff contends, the sales became perfected and 
binding between the parties.</p>
<p>The claim of plaintiff-appellant cannot be entertained. The award of a sales 
application merely authorizes the applicant to take possession of the land so 
that he coutd comply with the requirements prescribed by law before a final 
patent can be issued in his favor (Section 28, Commonwealth Act No, 141).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Before these requirements are complied 
with, the Government still remains the owner thereof, as in fact the application 
could still be cancelled and the land awarded to another applicant should it be 
shown that the legal requirements had not been complied with. What divests the 
Government of its title to the land is the issuance of the sales patent and its 
subsequent registration in the Office of the Register of Deeds. Such 
registration is the operative act that would bind the land and convey its 
ownership to the applicant (Section 107, Commonwealth Act No. 141; Section 122, 
Act No. 496). Since the timber in question was cut by the plaintiff before the 
issuance of sales patent in its name or in that of its predecessors-in-interest, 
it follows that plaintiff was not yet the owner of the lands when the timber 
growing thereon had been cut, and so it cannot claim exemption from the payment 
of the forest charges upon the mere plea that it already acquired ownership of 
said lands.</p>
<p>The case of Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs</em>. Wagner &amp; 
Wagner, 49 Phil., 944, relied upon by the plaintiff is not in point. This case 
is predicated on the concurring opinion of Justice Johnson in another case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which has reference to the fulfillment of 
subsequent conditions or conditions to be complied with after the issuance of 
the patent, whereas the present case refers to precedent conditions, or 
conditions to be complied with before the issuance of the patent. The 
circumstances surrounding the two cases are therefore different.</p>
<p>Moreover, Section 1513 of the Revised Administrative Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> expressly provides that forest charges 
"shall be collected for all wood cut upon any land the title to which is not 
registered with the Director of Forestry as required by the Forest Law", and, in 
the absence of such registration , "wood cut and removed from alleged private 
lands shall be considered as cut and removed under license from public forest or 
forest reserves." This requirement is mandatory, and failure to comply with it 
would subject the timber cut to forest charges, and this requirement was not 
complied with by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The fact that the Director of Forestry has certified that the four tracts of 
land in question were not needed for forest purposes and can therefore be opened 
to public sale does not take said lands out of the operation of said Section 
1513 of the Revised Administrative Code for the only reason behind such 
certification is to remove said land from the classification of timber or 
mineral lands and transfer it to that of agricultural or alienable lands so that 
it could be opened to private disposal and be utilized for agricultural 
purposes. In fact, when said certification was made, it was so made subject to 
the condition that the applicant can not cut and dispose of for commercial 
purposes any timber growing thereon without license from the Director of 
Forestry. And in order to implement this intent of the law, the Bureau of 
Forestry issued the following administrative order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Utilization of Forest Products</em>.—The utilization of forest products 
which may exist on areas certified as alienable and disposable under this Order 
or on areas within approved homestead or sales application shall still be 
subject to the Forest and Internal Revenue Laws and regulations; <em>Provided, 
however</em>, That the holder of approved homestead or sales, application may be 
allowed to cut, gather and remove from the land reasonable amount of timber and 
other products which may need for his own personal use and not for sale or 
barter, and such forest products shall be considered as cut, gathered and 
removed under a gratuitous license." (Forestry Administrative Order No. 13—1, 
Section 7).</p></blockquote>
<p>Having reached the foregoing conclusion, we don't deem it necessary to 
discuss the other errors assigned by defendant-appellant for the reason that 
whether the forest charges in question were paid or not under protest would be 
immaterial in view of our finding that the plaintiff is not exempted from the 
payment of said forest charges.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. Plaintiff-appellant is 
hereby ordered to pay to defendant-appellant the sum of P9,986.70 representing 
the forest charges and surcharges said plaintiff has failed to pay during the 
period from November, 1935 to December, 1940. without pronouncement as to 
costs.</p>
