				<BR><BR><div align="justify"></div>Irineo Bondoc and about eleven others had conspired and resolved to kill 
Mayor Victor Tizon of Capas, Tarlac and his escort of policemen, while the 
former was conducting community assemblies in different places in his 
municipality in the early part of 1946.
<p>Bondoc and his co-accused learned that in the morning of January 19, 1946, 
Mayor Tizon and his policemen were going to the <em>sitio</em> of Talimundoc, 
Capas. At about 9 a.m., the mayor, the chief of police, one police sergeant and 
five policemen, all armed and in uniform, were walking on the road to 
Talimundoc, and when they reached a place covered on the left with thick cogon 
grass, about one kilometer from Talimundoc, there was suddenly a volley of shots 
fired from that place. The mayor and his party returned the fire, but in the 
exchange of shots which lasted from ten to fifteen minutes, policeman RicardoQuizon and Candido Dayrit were killed, the first instantaneously, and the 
latter, before reaching the municipal building.</p>
<p>Mayor Tizon, looking towards the place of the ambuscade, fired his revolver 
and saw Irineo Bondoc, without hat and wearing a short-sleeved khaki shirt and 
short khaki pants, with the group of ambuscaders firing at him. The mayor, upon 
coming face to face with appellant, noticed that the latter lay down and, with 
his carbine, fired several shots at him. Then, when the group of appellant 
dispersed, the mayor saw Irineo Bondoc again as he was crossing a concrete 
bridge over an irrigation canal. During the exchange of shots between the two 
groups, the two policemen who were killed were standing almost behind the 
mayor.</p>
<p>It appears that policeman Ricardo Quizon met instantaneous death, because a 
bullet perforated the frontal bone and destroyed and splashed the brain 
substance; while policeman Candido Dayrit died of profuse hemorrhage caused by 
two bullet wounds penetrating the upper part of his right knee.</p>
<p>This case, No. 363 of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, is before us by 
an appeal entered by Irineo Bondoc from the judgment rendered by the lower 
court; which found him guilty of tiro murders and sentenced him in each case to 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>, the total of which shall not, however, exceed forty 
years in accordance with Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>The facts stated at the beginning of this decision and which led to the 
filing of the information for double murder against this appellant were 
sufficiently proven by the prosecution, not only through the testimony of Mayor 
Tizon and Dr. Sikat, but also by that given by two other witnesses. Francisco 
Sanchez testified that he was the justice of the peace of Capas, Tarlac who 
conducted the preliminary investigation in this case. He identified Exhibit A as 
the same statement given before him by Irineo E. Bondoc on November 29, 1947. 
Bondoc made a statement in the Pampango dialect which was translated by the 
justice of the peace into the English language. The answers of the accused were, 
according to the witness, given spontaneously and voluntarily without any 
promise of reward or immunity, without any intimidation or force having been 
used, in the presence of many witnesses. In said Exhibit "A" (page 1) Bondoc 
admitted that he was "one of those who were criminally responsible for the 
murder," that he did it "in compliance with an order from the director Mr. Ruben 
Velasco of Squadron 50 of the Hukbalahap."</p>
<p>Another witness, Lamberto Baun, municipal policeman of Capas, testified that 
he was one of the members of the party of Mayor Tizon on the morning of January 
19, 1946, escorting said official who was going to Talimundoc to hold a 
community assembly. Before the ambuscade, Irineo Bondoc was already known to the 
witness who also was acquainted with other members of the attacking group, such 
as Pederico Aquino and Atanasio Dayrit. Lamberto Baun described the attack; he 
said that the two policemen who were killed in the encounter, Ricardo Quizon and 
Candido Dayrit and another one were close behind Mayor Tizon when they were 
shot.</p>
<p>The defense, by means of two witnesses, tried to establish an alibi for the 
accused. Eustaquio Lunga took the stand for that purpose, but upon 
cross-questioning by the prosecution he admitted his inability to reckon dates. 
He could not give the date of the town fiesta of his hometown during the year 
immediately preceding the date of the trial, which made his testimony on the 
alleged presence of the appellant in his house in Tarlac, the capital of the 
province, on a much earlier date, January 19, 1946, most unreliable and 
unconvincing.</p>
<p>Another witness, Modesto Bondoc, gave testimony on his accidental meeting 
with the wife of appellant, In the house of his parents in Tarlac on the eve of 
the trial without knowing that he was going to testify, which clearly stamps his 
testimony as an eleventh hour fabrication.</p>
<p>Considering that this Court has ruled time and again that a defense of alibi 
which the accused tried to establish by such means must be looked upon with 
suspicion, it is obvious that it cannot prevail against the explicit and 
positive identification made of Irineo Bondoc by Mayor Tizon of Capas and 
policeman Lamberto Baun who, without hesitation, while on the witness stand, 
testified that they saw him with the group of ambuscaders firing his carbine at 
the party of the mayor and his policemen. (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Olais, 36 Phil. 
828.)</p>
<p>During the pendency of this appeal, counsel for appellant moved for the 
dismissal of this case on the ground that Irineo Bondoc being a Hukbalahap, and 
having committed the crimes charged against him in furtherance of the aims of 
such dissident organization, is entitled to the benefits of Presidential 
Proclamation Mo. 76 issued by the President of the Philippines on the 21st of 
June 1948, which granted amnesty to the leaders and members of the Hukbalahap 
and the PKM, "who have committed the crimes of rebellion, sedition, illegal 
association, assault upon, resistance, and disobedience to persons in authority, 
and/or illegal possession of firearms; <em>Provided, however</em>, That this 
amnesty shall apply to those who shall have presented themselves with all their 
firearms and ammunition to the duly constituted authorities of the Republic of 
the Philippines within twenty days from the date this proclamation is concurred 
in by the Congress."</p>
<p>Counsel urges that Irineo Bondoc had made an application for registration 
under said Amnesty Proclamation No. 76, which is certified to by the provincial 
warden of Tarlac. But such motion for dismissal is opposed by the Solicitor 
General on the ground that the petitioner did not comply (<em>a</em>) with the 
provision of Circular No. 27(<em>a</em>) of the Secretary of Justice, dated July 
21, 1948, outlining the procedure to be followed by applicants for amnesty who 
are presently in jail, either as detention or convicted prisoners; and 
(<em>b</em>) with the provisions of Amnesty Proclamation No. 76 requiring the 
surrender of firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Amnesty Proclamation No. 76, intended for crimes committed after the 
liberation by members of the Hukbalahap and PKM who were no longer engaged in 
the resistance against the Japanese forces, but against the constituted 
government of the Republic of the Philippines, was issued by the President to 
bring about "the return of these dissident and recalcitrant elements of our 
population to their homes and the resumption by them of their lawful pursuits or 
occupations as loyal and law-abiding citizens will accelerate the rehabilitation 
of this war-devastated country, restore peace and order, and secure the welfare 
and happiness of their communities.</p>
<p>For the enforcement of the provisions of said Proclamation No. 76, Circular 
No. 27 was issued by the Secretary of Justice prescribing the conditions under 
which persons applying for the benefits of such proclamation could have the 
benefits thereof extended to them. According to paragraph 1 of said circular, it 
is necessary that members of the Hukbalahap and PKM organizations should present 
themselves, with <em>all</em> their arms and ammunition to the duly constituted 
authorities of the Philippines, within twenty days from June 25, 1943, when the 
said proclamation was concurred in by the Congress. Paragraph 2 requires that a 
person claiming the benefit of the amnesty, must, on or before July 15, 1948 
present himself together with <em>all</em> his arms and ammunition to an officer 
of the law who shall issue to him a certificate in the form prescribed 
therein.</p>
<p>The record fails to show that this appellant has complied with such 
requirement as to entitle him to the benefits of the .Amnesty Proclamation No. 
76, particularly the fundamental requisite mentioned in said circular re the 
surrender of firearms and ammunition. Considering that the rebellious attitude 
of those dissident organizations, the Hukbalahap and PKM and their members, is 
predicated on the fact that they have in their possession firearms so that 
without them they cannot maintain their defiant attitude against the government, 
We believe that this appellant has failed to comply with such requirement and 
therefore his motion to dismiss lacks merit (People <em>vs</em>. Santos, G.R. 
No. L-1320 and 1821, promulgated on June 27, 1949, Volume 15, No. 1, Lawyers 
Journal, page 2l).</p>
<p>It is quite evident that appellant, who confessed his active participation in 
the ambuscade by firing several shots at the mayor and his escort of policemen, 
did not take the stand, and simply relied on his two above mentioned witnesses 
in an unsuccessful attempt to establish an alibi, is guilty of the two murders 
charged in the information. And although in Our opinion, in the light of the 
facts clearly disclosed by the evidence, this appellant and his confederates 
have also committed the crimes of (<em>a</em>) assault upon a person in 
authority—the mayor of Gapas who was then engaged in the performance of his 
duties—and (<em>b</em>) assault upon agents of an authority—the municipal 
policemen who were also engaged in the performance of their duties—yet such 
omission or oversight by the prosecution will not bar us from finding, as We do 
hereby find, Irineo Bondoc <em>alias</em> Dick Tracy guilty of the murder of 
each of the two policemen who lost their lives in that ambuscade.</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, and finding no error committed by the judge 
<em>a quo</em> in the instant case, the judgment appealed from is hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Tuason, J</em>., concurs in the result. </p>
<p><i>Moran, C. J.</i>, Mr. Justice Paras voted for the affirmance of the judgment appealed from, 
but on account of his being on leave at the time of the promulgation of this 
opinion, his signature does not appear herein.
