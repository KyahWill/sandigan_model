				<BR><BR><div align="justify">There is&nbsp; no&nbsp; dispute as to the following facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year&nbsp; 1877 Simeona de Mesa married&nbsp; Regino Beltran in San&nbsp; Pablo,&nbsp;&nbsp; Laguna.&nbsp; They have three children&nbsp; named Mariano,&nbsp; Eulalio, and Romualda, all&nbsp; surnamed Beltran. In 1902 Regino left his wife Simeona, lived&nbsp; somewhere else and&nbsp; until his&nbsp; death&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1925,&nbsp; never&nbsp; returned&nbsp; to the conjugal home.&nbsp; On July&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1912, during the lifetime&nbsp; of&nbsp; Regino&nbsp; and&nbsp; while living&nbsp; separately from&nbsp; him,&nbsp; Simeona bought a parcel of land&nbsp; now become&nbsp; a commercial&nbsp; lot in San&nbsp; Pablo&nbsp; City under tax declaration No.&nbsp; 17047.&nbsp; After the acquisition of the property,&nbsp; Simeona and sometimes her son Mariano managed it&nbsp; until the&nbsp; two sold the same on October 11, 1939 to Arsenio Escudero and his wife Rosario Adap.&nbsp; Romualda&nbsp; Beltran, one of the three children of Simeona and Regino&nbsp; married Ponciano Flores and bore him 9 children.&nbsp; She died on July 30, 1941, and two years later her mother Simeona died.&nbsp; On May 9, 1949, the children of Romualda and Ponciano brought an action (civil case No. 9269)&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Laguna against Escudero and Adap to recover 1/6 of the parcel&nbsp; in&nbsp; question on&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory that&nbsp; the parcel&nbsp; having been bought by Simeona during her&nbsp; marriage, it was conjugal property; that 1/2 of it belonged to her husband Regino, and that at the latter's death&nbsp; said 1/2 was inherited by the 3 children, one of them being Romualda, mother&nbsp; of Ponciano's children.&nbsp; After hearing,&nbsp; and on the basis&nbsp; of the stipulation of the parties or their admissions the trial court found the facts&nbsp; as above related, and holding that Romualda as one&nbsp; of the three&nbsp; children of the marriage inherited 1/3 of the 1/2 corresponding to her father Regino, declared that the sale of said 1/6 of the parcel was null and void and ordered the defendants to transfer the said portion to the plaintiffs and to pay back rentals from October 11, 1939, up to the time of delivery of said portion.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal to the Supreme Court, in a decision promulgated on March 11, 1953, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court with modification as to the amount of back rentals to be paid.<p>On the&nbsp; basis of the decision&nbsp; of the trial court in that civil case No. 9269, the 5 children of Eulalio Beltran (one of the 3 children of the marriage of Simeona and&nbsp; Regino and who died in 1941) filed the present action (civil case No. 9298) on Angust 1, 1949, against the same defendants in the first case, Arsenio Escudero&nbsp; and his wife&nbsp; Rosario Adap,&nbsp; claiming an equal portion of 1/6 of the parcel&nbsp; in question, on the same theory maintained by the plaintiffs in the first case, namely, that their father Eulalio inherited from his&nbsp; father&nbsp; Regino 1/6&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said parcel which&nbsp; is of the 1/3 of the 1/2 corresponding to Regino of the conjugal property.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; support of&nbsp; their action,&nbsp; plaintiffs, after establishing that they were the legitimate children of Eulalio contended that the. trial court had no&nbsp; jurisdiction to consider any other question of&nbsp; fact&nbsp; and&nbsp; should&nbsp; adopt and admit&nbsp; the findings of fact&nbsp; made&nbsp; in the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court in&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 9269,&nbsp; and&nbsp; then offered in evidence a&nbsp; copy of said decision,&nbsp; complaint, stipulation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties, printed&nbsp; record&nbsp; on appeal, motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; and&nbsp; correction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the stipulation,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; several&nbsp; other&nbsp; pleadings&nbsp; and&nbsp; orders filed in said case.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the trial court in the present case&nbsp; received&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants, and on the basis of all the evidence&nbsp; presented by both parties, rendered judgment on December&nbsp; 27, 1951, finding the same facts already related by us, and in addition, the following.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1904 or&nbsp; 1905&nbsp; Simeona&nbsp; de Mesa gave to her daugther Eduarda (Romualda) 3 parcels of&nbsp; land as&nbsp; her&nbsp; advance inheritance.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1908 she also gave to her son Eulalio Beltran as inheritance another parcel which she had acquired, and she caused&nbsp; the document of acquisition to be made in the name of Eulalio in&nbsp; order that he could vote. In&nbsp; order to effect&nbsp; a&nbsp; fair distribution among her 3 children, Simeona on July 11, 1928, donated the lot in question in San Pablo City to her son Mariano Beltran together with another parcel of coconut land. Eulalio Beltran,&nbsp; father&nbsp; of the&nbsp; present&nbsp; plaintiffs, agreed to this donation by signing as a witness to the corresponding deed.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 12, 1936, Mariano&nbsp; as owner of the lot in question mortgaged the same to&nbsp; Eulalio for the sum of P700. In accepting the&nbsp; mortgage, Eulalio in effect, recognized Mariano as the owner of the parcel. On November 10, 1939, Eulalio brought&nbsp; an action against Mariano to&nbsp; foreclose the mortgage and included as defendants his mother Simeona and the purchasers of the parcel, Arsenio Escudero and his wife Rosario Adap, but on February 11,1941, Simeona and her children Eulalio and Mariano reached an agreement&nbsp; and settled the case amicably.&nbsp; The agreement was reduced to writing and Eulalio&nbsp; not only&nbsp; signed the&nbsp; same but expressly stated therein his&nbsp; consent to the sale of the lot to Arsenio Escudero and Rosario Adap.</p><p>On the basis of its findings the trial court through Judge Arguelles rendered&nbsp; judgment on December 27, 1951, dismissing the complaint for lack of evidence and merit.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; also found that the plaintiffs prosecuted the case with malice&nbsp; and intention to suppress vital&nbsp; evidence throwing light in this case, and condemned plaintiffs&nbsp; to pay the defendants the sum of P500 as&nbsp; damages for attorney's fees&nbsp; contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; counterclaim,&nbsp; plus costs.</p><p>Plaintiffs filed a motion for new trial an$ reconsideration of the judgment on February 8, 1952.&nbsp; Before action could be taken on this motion, plaintiffs on March 18, 1953, filed a&nbsp; pleading&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; "Additional&nbsp; Ground for Motion for New Trial" and attached in support of said pleading a copy of our decision in G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5302 affirming with modification the decision of the trial court in&nbsp; civil case No. 9269.</p><p>In the meantime,&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; M.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mendoza&nbsp; came&nbsp; to preside over&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court, and&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 22, 1953, he granted&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for reconsideration&nbsp; and&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial. After holding the new trial, Judge Mendoza reviewed all the&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; including that presented at&nbsp; the&nbsp; new trial, and arrived at the same conclusion as&nbsp; to the facts found by&nbsp; Judge Arguelles&nbsp; and holding that the plaintiffs were estopped from questioning&nbsp; the validity of the sale to defendants of Yn of the parcel in question for the reason that their own father Eulalio had&nbsp; expressly consented&nbsp; to the same, Judge Mendoza accepted and adopted the decision previously rendered by Judge Arguelles and dismissed the complaint for lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and merit,&nbsp; quoting the dispositive part of&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * *. The piaintiffs' complaint is hereby ordered dismissed for lack of evidence&nbsp; and&nbsp; merit,&nbsp; and defendants are&nbsp; absolved&nbsp; there from by virtue of their alleged defenses, which have been duly substantiated, condemning the plaintiffs to pay the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; the nominal sum&nbsp; of P500&nbsp; as&nbsp; damages for&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees under&nbsp; the defendant's counter-claim,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the costs of this action."</p></blockquote><p>Plaintiffs are&nbsp; now&nbsp; appealing from the said decision&nbsp; to this&nbsp; court&nbsp; considering the issues&nbsp; involved&nbsp; to be purely questions of law.&nbsp; Appellants made the following assignment of&nbsp; errors:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>That&nbsp; the lower court&nbsp; finally erred in&nbsp; not&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; the defendants-appellees are estopped from alleging that the plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; are not the exclusive&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of the&nbsp; one-sixth&nbsp; (1/6) portion of the property in litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>That the lower court erred in allowing the defendants-appellees to present evidence to prove facts&nbsp; which have&nbsp; already been&nbsp; resolved in civil case No.&nbsp; 9269 and affirmed by the Honorable Supreme Court in G. R. No. L-5302.&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>That&nbsp; the lower court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in completely&nbsp; disregarding&nbsp; and in not giving any weight whatsoever&nbsp; to the decision&nbsp; of the Supreme Court in civil case No. 9269-G. R. No. L-5302, affirming the decision of the trial court in said civil case No. 9269.</li></ol><p>It is the&nbsp; contention of appellants that&nbsp; the parties in the present case are&nbsp; the&nbsp; same parties involved in civil case No. 9269; that the same property is involved; that plaintiffs in the first case and the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; in the&nbsp; present case derived their&nbsp; title&nbsp; from the&nbsp; same&nbsp; source,&nbsp; namely, their grandfather Regino&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore are privies to him; that the parties in the first case entered into a stipulation of facts which stipulation was made the basis of the findings of the trial court and of&nbsp; this Tribunal in its decision affirming with modification that of the trial&nbsp; court in civil case No.&nbsp; 9269, and&nbsp; that consequently, the defendants in the present case should&nbsp; not have been&nbsp; allowed to present any&nbsp; evidence other than that&nbsp; presented and&nbsp; considered in the first case,&nbsp; and that defendants are&nbsp; now in estoppel by record and judgment; in other words,&nbsp; they are bound by the final judgment in the civil case No. 9269.</p><p>We cannot agree to this contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the first place, the parties in&nbsp; the two cases are not the same.&nbsp; They are different.&nbsp; It is true that Arsenio Escudero&nbsp; and his wife Rosario Adap&nbsp; are defendants&nbsp; in both cases, but it is also a fact that neither&nbsp; Eulalio&nbsp; nor&nbsp; his children, the present plaintiffs, were parties in the first case.&nbsp; True,&nbsp; there was a stipulation of facts in&nbsp; the first case&nbsp; but&nbsp; the stipulation did not include the present plaintiffs or their predecessor-in-interest Eulalio Beltran.&nbsp; The parties in civil case No. 9269 stipulated as to the conveyance of the parcel in question only by Simeona and her son Mariano.&nbsp;&nbsp; They could not have included Eulalio or his children, because the latter's right or interest in the parcel, if any, was not involved.&nbsp; On the basis of said stipulation in the first case alone, without any other evidences, it is&nbsp; possible to conclude&nbsp; that&nbsp; since the parcel,in question was conjugal property, and&nbsp; Eulalio&nbsp; as one of the 3 heirs, had a right to 1/6 of it and since&nbsp; he did not intervence in the conveyance of said parcel to the defendants, he&nbsp; or&nbsp; his&nbsp; heirs could now claim that&nbsp; 1/6 portion.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as shown by the&nbsp; eyidence presented&nbsp; by the defendants in the&nbsp; present&nbsp;&nbsp; case,&nbsp; Eulalio had agreed to the donation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcel by his mother Simeona to his brother Mariano.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,&nbsp; Eulalio recognized the&nbsp; title&nbsp; of Mariano over said parcel by&nbsp; accepting it in a mortgage&nbsp; to secure a loan to Mariano.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still later, he signed a document agreeing to and ratifying the&nbsp; conveyance of the said parcel to the defendants.&nbsp; There can be no clearer and more explicit renunciation and waiver of&nbsp; a&nbsp; right to a property now claimed as an inheritance.</p><p>The rule or doctrine of estoppel&nbsp; by record only applies as between the same parties or their privies and can neither be&nbsp; used&nbsp; against&nbsp; strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; present&nbsp; plaintiffs and their father and predecessor-in-interest Eulalio were strangers to the transaction and&nbsp; proceedings held in civil case No. 9269 and so&nbsp; not&nbsp; only are not bound by it but may not take advantage of the said transaction or proceedings.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Estoppels by record,&nbsp; to the extent that&nbsp; they bind&nbsp; parties, will also&nbsp; bind their&nbsp; privies;&nbsp; but they can exist only as&nbsp; between&nbsp; the same&nbsp; parties or those in legal privity with&nbsp; them, and&nbsp; can be used neither by nor against strangers."&nbsp; (31&nbsp; C. J. S. 195).&nbsp; </p><p>"The rule&nbsp; of&nbsp; estoppel&nbsp; by&nbsp; record&nbsp; bars a&nbsp; second action&nbsp; between the same&nbsp; parties on an&nbsp; issue necessarily&nbsp; raised and decided&nbsp; in the first&nbsp; action;&nbsp; so,&nbsp; an&nbsp; issue of ownership of property&nbsp; and&nbsp; its incidents thus adjudicated cannot be relitigated in a second action between the same parties. * * *"&nbsp; (<em>Ibid.</em>)&nbsp; </p><p>"An&nbsp; estoppel operates on the parties to the transaction&nbsp; out of which it arises -and&nbsp; their&nbsp; privies.&nbsp; Conversely, a&nbsp; stranger to a transaction is neither bound by, nor in position to take advantage of, an estoppel arising therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason for the latter rule is that mutuality is an essential element of an estoppel; an estoppel must bind both parties or neither is bound."&nbsp; (19 Am. Jur. 809.)</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp; view of the foregoing, finding the decision appealed from to be&nbsp; in accordance with law, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.
