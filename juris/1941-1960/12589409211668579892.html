				<H3>UNITED PEPSI-COLA SALES  ORGANIZATION  (PAFLU), PETITIONER,  VS. HON. ANTONIO  CAÑIZARES,  JUDGE OF  THE COURT OF FIRST  INSTANCE  OF MANILA,  AND PEPSI-COLA  BOTTLING COMPANY OF  THE  PHILIPPINES, INC.,  RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to nullify an  order  of preliminary  injunction issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> by the Court  of First Instance of Manila in  its Civil Case No.  32397. <br><br>It appears that on April 25, 1957, the respondent Pepsi-Cola  Bottling Company  of  the Philippines, Inc. filed  a complaint for injunction in the court  below against the United Pepsi-Cola Sales Organization (UPSO), the Philippine Association of  Free Labor Unions  (PAFLU) and Gary Miranda,  UPSO President, alleging that on  April 16,  1957, about 100 of  its employees  and  laborers, who are members of  the defendant unions,  declared  a strike and  formed picket lines alongside  the whole length  of its premises at Aurora Boulevard and Balete Drive, completely blocking the entrance to said   premises;  that  in the course of the picketing,  certain acts of violence, intimidation, and other unlawful acts were committed; that plaintiff had requested the Quezon City Police Department to extend protection to its non-striking employees, but said police department failed to furnish the protection requested; that reasonable efforts to settle  the labor dispute from which the  strike arose had  been made by plaintiff  with the aid of  the Conciliation  Service of the  Department  of Labor;  that plaintiff  had no other adequate  remedy  in law; and that unless  a temporary restraining order was issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>, substantial and irreparable injury to plaintiff's property would be unavoidable. <br><br>On the same day that the complaint was  filed, the lower court received testimony  under oath of the witnesses for plaintiff and thereafter,  upon the Company's filing  of  a bond  of P1000,  issued a writ of preliminary injunction, ordering defendants to: <br><blockquote>"(a) Refrain and desist  from obstructing, stopping,  blocking, coercing, intimidating or in any way or manner preventing the non-striking employees of the plaintiff company from going in and out of the  company premises in pursuance of their respective work; <br><br>(b)  Refrain  and  desist  from  obstructing,  stopping,  blocking, coercing,  intimidating or in any  way or manner  preventing  or hampering the ingress and egress of the public to and from company premises; and <br><br>(c)  Refrain  and  desist  from  obstructing,  stopping,  coercing, intimidating or in any way or manner preventing plaintiff company's employees, irrespective  of date of employment, from carrying  on the work assigned  to them by the company in  its premises  at Quezon City or elsewhere."  (Annex  "C", Petition) </blockquote>Without  asking the  lower  court  for  a  dissolution  of the injunction, the defendants filed with this  Court the present petition for certiorari, two days after the  issuance of the enjoining writ. <br><br>Two arguments are advanced by petitioner union against the validity of the writ of preliminary injunction  in question, namely: (1) that the lower court had no jurisdiction to take  cognizance of the  injunction case and issue the order  of injunction in view of the pendency of an  unfair labor practice case between the same parties in the Court of Industrial Relations; and (2) that the writ in  question was not issued in accordance with the procedure  outlined by  Republic Act No. 875. <br><br>In our opinion, the petition must  be  dismissed  and the writ prayed for denied. <br><br>First, because  petitioner did not bring up before the trial court, prior to asking certiorari, the issue of jurisdiction as well as the facts upon which such issue may be  resolved  or decided—i.  e., the supposed  interrelation and connection between the acts described in the complaint for injunction  and the unfair  labor practice case  in the Court of Industrial  Relations,  which connection  was not apparent on the face of  the record;  thereby depriving the trial court of the opportunity to determine for itself whether it had jurisdiction to  take cognizance of  the case and issue  the injunction order.  Settled  is the rule that certiorari will  not lie where  the relief sought is obtainable by application in the court of origin and the attention of the court has not been  called to its supposed error (Herrera <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Barreto, 25 Phil., 245;  Uy Chu <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Imperial, 44 Phil.  27; Manila Post Publishing Co.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sanchez, 81 Phil. 614; Alvarez vs. Ibañez, 83 Phil., 104; 46 Off. Gaz. 4233; Nicolas <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Castillo, 97 Phil., 336; Ricafort <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Fernan, 101  Phil., 575, 54  Off.  Gaz.,  [8] 2534). <br><br>We see nothing  in the Company's 'complaint and petition for preliminary injunction that could  apprise or warn the  court below  that  an  unfair labor practice case was involved.  Nor can the  lack  of jurisdiction of the lower court be simply assumed from the bare fact that an unfair labor practice case had  been filed with the Court of Industrial Relations.  The criterion, to bring the  case under the  jurisdiction of the  Industrial  Court,  is whether  the acts complained  of in the petition  for  injunction arose out  of, or are connected or interwoven with,  the unfair labor practice case (PAFLU <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Caluag, G.  R.  L-9104, Sept. 10,  1956), a question of fact that should be brought to the attention of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> to enable it to pass upon the issue  whether it has jurisdiction or not over the case. As  defendants failed  to show to  the trial court that it had  no jurisdiction they can not complain now that it abused its discretion in  issuing the writ of preliminary injunction. <br><br>Second, the writ of preliminary injunction  was issued by the lower court in accordance  with  the provisions of R. A. 875, sec. 9(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>), requiring that an injunction <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> be issued only "upon  testimony  under oath, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in  issuing  a temporary injunction  upon hearing after notice".  We find that this procedure  has been followed in this case, it  appearing that the   allegations  of  the verified  complaint are  substantially sufficient to justify the issuance of a  writ of preliminary injunction, and the court, in its order directing the issuance of the writ <span style="font-style: italic;">ex  parte</span>, states  that  plaintiffs's verified complaint  was  "supported by testimony  of witnesses given under oath" (Annex "C", Petition). <br><br>Finally, a temporary restraining order issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>, "shall be effective for no longer  than five  days and  shall be void at the expiration of said five days," according to sec.  9(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)  of Rep. Act 875.  The order  of injunction in question having been issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>, it became void and of no effect after the fifth day of its issuance, by operation of law and  even without any judicial pronouncement to that effect (Reyes vs. Tan, 99 Phil., 880, 52 Off. Gaz. [14] 6187;  Allied Free Workers  Union <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Apostol, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, p. 292). <br><br>Wherefore, the petition for certiorari  is  denied, but the writ  of  preliminary injunction,  issued  by  the  trial court on  25 April 1957,  is  declared  no longer operative.   No. costs.   So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
