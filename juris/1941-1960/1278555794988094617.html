				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of 
Manila in the above-entitled cases awarding plaintiffs the compensation provided 
for in the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>
<p>The record of the cases was forwarded to the Court of Appeals for review, but 
as there was no question of fact involved in the appeal, said court forwarded 
the record to this Court. The appeal "was pending when the Pacific War broke 
out, and continued pending until after liberation, because the record of the 
cases was destroyed as a result of the battle waged by the forces of liberation 
against the enemy. As provided by law, the record was reconstituted and we now 
proceed to dispose of the appeal.</p>
<p>Appellant, who was the owner of the motor ships <em>San Diego II and 
Bartolome S</em>, states in his brief the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no dispute as to the facts involved in these cases and they may be 
gathered from the pleadings and the decision of the trial Court. In case CA-G. 
R. No. 773, Dionisia Abueg is the widow of the deceased, Amado Nunez, who was a 
machinist on board the M/S <em>San Diego II</em> belonging to the 
defendant-appellant. In case CA-G. R. No. 774, plaintiff-appellee, Marciana S. 
de Salvation, is the widow of the deceased, Victoriano Salvacion, who was a 
machinist on board the M/S <em>Bartolome</em> S also belonging to the 
defendant-appellant. In case CA-G. It. No. 775, the plaintiff-appellee, Rosario 
R. Oching is the widow of Francisco Oching who was captain or natron of the 
defendant-appellant's M/S <em>Bartolome S</em>.</p>
<p>The M/S <em>San Diego II</em> and the M/S <em>Bartolome</em>, while engaged 
in fishing operations around Mindoro Island on Oct. 1, 1941 were caught by a 
typhoon as a consequence of which they were sunk and totally lost. Amado Nunez, 
Victoriano Salvacion and Francisco Oching while acting in their capacities 
perished in the shipwreck (Appendix A, p. IV).</p>
<p>It is also undisputed that the above-named vessels were not covered by any 
insurance. (Appendix A, p. IV.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Counsel for the appellant cite article 587 of the Code of Commerce which 
provides that if the vessel together with all her tackle and freight money 
earned during the voyage are abandoned, the agent's liability to third persons 
for tortious acts of the captain in the care of the goods which<br>the ship 
carried is extinguished (Yangco <em>vs.</em> Laserna, 73 Phi]., 330) ; article 
837 of the same Code which provides that in cases of collision, the shipowners' 
liability is limited to the value of the vessel with all her equipment and 
freight earned during the voyage (Philippine Shipping Company <em>vs.</em> 
Garcia, 6 Phil., 283) ; and article 643 of the same Code which provides that if 
the vessel and freight are totally lost, the agent's liability for wages of the 
crew is extinguished. From these premises counsel draw the conclusion that 
appellant's liability, as owner of the two motor ships lost or sunk- as a result 
of the typhoon that lashed the island of Mindoro on October 1, 1941, was 
extinguished.</p>
<p><br>The <em>real and hypothecary </em>nature of the liability of the 
shipowner or agent embodied in the provisions of the Maritime Law, Book III, 
Code of Commerce, had its origin in the prevailing conditions of the maritime 
trade and sea voyages during the medieval ages, attended by innumerable hazards 
and perils. To offset against these adverse conditions and to encourage 
shipbuilding and maritime commerce, it was deemed necessary to confine the 
liability of the owner or agent arising from the operation of a ship to the 
vessel, equipment, and freight, or insurance, if any, so that if the shipowner 
or agent abandoned the ship, equipment, and freight, his liability was 
extinguished.</p>
<p>But the provisions of the Code of Commerce invoked by appellant have no room 
in the application of the Workmen's Compensation Act which seeks to improve, and 
aims at the amelioration of, the condition of laborers and employees. It is not 
the liability for the damage or loss of the cargo or injury to, or death of, a 
passenger by or through the misconduct of the captain or master of the ship; nor 
the liability for the loss of the ship as a result of collision; nor the 
responsibility for wages of the crew, but a liability created by a statute to 
compensate employees and laborers in cases of injury received by or inflicted 
upon them, while engaged in the performance of their work or employment, or the 
heirs and dependents of such laborers and employees in the event of death caused 
by their employment. Such compensation has nothing to do with the provisions of 
the Code of Commerce regarding maritime commerce. It is an item in the cost of 
production which must be included in the budget of any well-managed 
industry.</p>
<p>Appellant's assertion that in the case of Enciso <em>vs.</em> Dy-Liaco (57 
Phil., 446), and Murillo <em>vs.</em> Mendoza (66 Phil, 689), the question of 
the extinction of the shipowner's liability due to abandonment of the ship by 
him was not fully discussed, as in the case of Yangco <em>vs.</em> Laserna, 
<em>supra</em>, is not entirely correct. In the last mentioned case, the 
limitation of the shipowner's liability to the value of the ship, equipment, 
freight, and insurance, if any, was the <em>lis mota</em>. In the case of Enciso 
<em>vs.</em> Dy-Liacco, <em>supra</em>, the application of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act to a master or patron who perished as a result of the sinking 
of the motorboat of which he was the master, was the controversy submitted to 
the court for decision. This Court held in that case that "It lias been 
repeatedly stated that the Workmen's Compensation Act was enacted to abrogate 
the common law and our Civil Code upon culpable acts and omissions, and that the 
employer need not be guilty of neglect or fault, in order that responsibility 
may attach to him" (pp. 449-450) ; and that the shipowner was liable to pay 
compensation provided for in the Workmen's Compensation Act, notwithstanding the 
fact that the motorboat was totally lost. In the case of Murillo <em>vs.</em> 
Mendoza, <em>supra</em>, this Court held that "The rights and responsibilities 
defined in said Act must be governed by its own peculiar provisions in complete 
disregard of other similar provisions of the civil as well as the mercantile 
law. If an accident is compensable under the Workmen's Compensation Act, it must 
be compensated even when the workman's right is not recognized by or is in 
conflict with other provisions of the Civil Code or of the Code of Commerce. The 
reason behind this principle is that the Workmen's Compensation Act was enacted 
by the Legislature in abrogation of the other existing laws." This quoted part 
of the decision is in answer to the contention that it was not the intention of 
the Legislature to repeal articles 643 and 837 of the Code of Commerce with the 
enactment of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>
<p>In the memorandum filed by counsel for the appellant, a new point not relied 
upon in the court below is raised. They contend that the motorboats engaged in 
fishing could not be deemed to be in the coastwise and inter-island trade, as 
contemplated in section 38 of the Workmen's Compensation Act (No. 3428), as 
amended by Act No. 3812, inasmuch as, according to counsel, a craft engaged in 
the coastwise and inter-island trade is one that carries passengers and/or 
merchandise for hire between ports and places in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>This new point raised by counsel for the appellant is inconsistent with the 
first, for, if the motor ships in question, while engaged in fishing, were to 
be considered as not engaged in inter-island and coastwise trade, the provisions 
of the Code of Commerce invoked by them regarding limitation of the shipowner's 
liability or extinction thereof when the shipowner abandons the ship, cannot be 
applied (Lopez <em>vs.</em> Duruelo, 52 Phil., 229). Granting however, that the 
motor ships run and operated by the appellant were not engaged in the coastwise 
and inter-island trade, as contemplated in section 38 of the Workmen's 
Compensation Act, as amended, still the deceased officers of the motor ships in 
question were industrial employees within the purview of section 39, paragraph 
(d), as amended, for industrial employment "includes all employment or work at a 
trade, occupation or profession exercised by an employer for the purpose of 
gain." The only exceptions recognized by the Act are agriculture, charitable 
institutions and domestic service. Even employees engaged in agriculture for the 
operation of mechanical implements, are entitled to the benefits of the 
Workmen's Facundo <em>vs.</em> Santos Compensation Act (Francisco <em>vs.</em> 
Consing, 63 Phil., 354). In Murillo <em>vs.</em> Mendoza, <em>supra</em>, this 
Court held that "our Legislature has deemed it advisable to include in the 
Workmen's Compensation Act all accidents that may occur to workmen or employees 
in factories, shops and other industrial and agricultural workplaces as well as 
in the inter-island seas of the Archipelago." But we do not believe that the term 
"coastwise and inter-island trade" has such a narrow meaning as to confine it to 
the carriage for hire of passengers and/or merchandise on vessels between ports 
and places in the Philippines, because while fishing is an industry, if the 
catch is brought to a port for sale, it is at the same time a trade.</p>
<p>Finding no merit in the appeal filed in these cases, we affirm the judgment 
of the lower court, with costs against the appellant.</p>
