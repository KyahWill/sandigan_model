				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>From the judgment  of  the Court of Tax  Appeals  (in CTA Case No. 74)  reversing his  decision  of January 27, 1955,  which holds respondent  Jose  Cojuangco liable  for deficiency sales  taxes, petitioner Collector of Internal  Revenue interposed the present petition for  review.</p>
<p>The case was submitted  for decision of the Tax court on the basis of a "Stipulation of Facts" which  incorporated, as  annexes, certain  records  of  the  Bureau  of  Internal Revenue.  The  material facts may  be briefly  stated  as follows:</p>
<p>At a public bidding held by the Surplus  Property Commission on April 22, 1948, Fernando Villa-Abrille was the successful  bidder for the purchase of all  movable  goods (except  some  items  specified)  found at  CMD-3  Area, Samar Naval Base, Guiuan,  Samar,  priced at P94,500.00. The award of the bid was duly approved by  the Government Enterprise  Control Committee, and  its terms and conditions  were set forth in SPC-Invoice No. 7770,  dated May  28, 1948  (Annex D).  Villa-Abrille deposited  the amount  of P10,000.00 under Manager's Check No.  13040 (Philippine  Bank  of Commerce)  to cover  the required deposit of 5%  of the  purchase price, for which Official Receipt  Np. 689017,  dated April  22,  1948,   (Annex A), was  issued.   Not  having  the necessary funds  to  cover the balance  of  the  purchase price,  the 5% compensating tax and the necessary expenses for labor and  materials for the reconditioning of said goods for use or  sale,  he invited Cojuangco to provide said funds.   The latter  accepted the offer and on May 28,  1948, he and Villa-Abrille entered into an agreement  (Annex B),  which reads:</p>
<p align="center">"AGREEMENT</p>

</blockquote>
<p>After the above agreement  was  signed by  respondent and Villa-Abrille,  the latter  paid to the Surplus Property Commission the unpaid balance of  the  purchase price of the surplus goods in the amount  of P84,400,00 which includes  the compensating tax in the amount of P4,500.00, payment thereof being evidenced by Official Receipt  No. A-690575 dated  May  28,  1948 (Annex B),  issued in the name of Villa-Abrille.   Accordingly, SPC-Invoice No. 7770 (Annex  C)  was issued in the name  of  Villa-Abrille, to cover the sale in question. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Villa-Abrille  sold a portion of the surplus goods to Hume Pipe &amp; Asbestos  Co. on August 11, 1949, and  the rest to Ellin &amp;  Co. on February  2,  1951  and May 28, 1952.   In accordance with the provision of Paragraph 12 of the aforequoted agreement,  Villa-Abrille deposited with the Philippine Bank of Commerce the amount of  P145,000.00  under  Special  Account and/or  Trust Account,  in the name of Fernando  F.  de  Villa-Abrille and/or  Jose Cojuangco, and/or  Demetria S. Cojuangco. Due to  the deficiency tax assessment (to  be described later)  made by petitioner on respondent, the amount of P37,531.38 was,  on June  7,  1955, segregated from said account,  and deposited in the  name of petitioner,  the disposition  of  which  was made  dependent  on  the  final decision  of  the case.</p>
<p>The aforementioned purchase of the  surplus goods from the Surplus Property Commission by Villa-Abrille was subsequently investigated  by Provincial  Revenue Agent H.  I. Bernardo, who, on April  1, 1953, submitted his report (Annex  E)  to petitioner,  on the basis of which report, petitioner made the following  assessment against respondent  on January 27, 1955:</p>

<p>As a consequence, Cojuangco filed with the Court of Tax Appeals  a petition,  which was later amended, praying that the Collector be  ordered to cancel said  assessment.   To this  petition, petitioner herein  (respondent  in  the Tax Court)  filed his answer on  July 2,  1955.  Based  on the facts already stated, the lower court rendered judgment, dated October 30,  1957, reversing the Collector's stand, on  the theory that  only Villa-Abrille  could  be held liable for the deficiency percentage taxes.</p>
<p>Not agreeable with the decision, the Collector of Internal Revenue brought this  petition  for review.</p>
<p>The legal  issues in  the case  may be boiled down to the following:  (1)  Whether or not  liability for percentage (sales) taxes under Section  186 of the National Internal Revenue Code arose on account of the sale made to Villa-Abrille of the surplus goods in question by the Surplus Property Commission, and  (2) whether or not respondent Jose  Cojuangco could be held  liable by the  Collector for the payment of said taxes, should the same be held assessable.</p>
<p>Anent the first  issue, we have already held in Co Cheng Tee <em>vs</em>. Meer, 87 Phil., 18; 47  Off. Gaz.  (Supp.  No. 12) 269<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, that a purchaser of certain commodities  from  the Surplus Property  Commission and the Foreign Liquidation Office is  an importer within the purview of the Tax Code. As such importer, the purchaser may be held liable either for compensating taxes or percentage (sales) taxes under Section 183 (B) of  the Revised Internal Revenue Code in connection with Section 186 of the same code, depending on whether the things bought  were acquired exclusively for personal use or for mercantile or commercial purposes. In the first case, the importer is liable for compensating taxes,  and in the second, he is liable for percentage or sales taxes.  In this instance, the tax liability is for percentage taxes, considering that the acquisition of the surplus goods in question  was for commercial purposes or resale. This fact is not seriously disputed by the  parties in this appeal.</p>
<p>The resolution of  the second issue hinges principally on the question of who should be considered as the importer, and thus be  held accountable for  the  percentage taxes. The Collector urges that the importation  of  the  surplus goods was made f er and in behalf of the association between Jose Cojuangco and Villa-Abrille,  so that  anyone of the members  thereof  may be held liable for  the  tax,  while Cojuangco maintains that it was Villa-Abrille solely who caused the same.   The respondent's position was sustained by the Court  of Tax Appeals.</p>
<p>We  find no reversible error in  the  decision appealed from.  There is no provision in the agreement between Cojuangco and Villa-Abrille (which is the sole reliance of the  collector)  that indicates  any  joint interest in the acquisition of the  goods from the Surplus Property  Commission.  It is not denied that the bid of Villa-Abrille was accepted  (and the contract of  sale  in  his favor thereby perfected) on April 22, 1948, more than one month before the  contract  with  Cojuangco, and that in SPC  Invoice No. 1770 wherein the conditions of the sale appear, only Villa-Abrille name is  mentioned.   Coincidentally,  paragraphs 3 and 4 of the agreement with Cojuangco stipulate that "the First Part (Villa-Abrille) . ..  undertakes to pay the Surplus Property  Commission, Manila, the total sum of P94,500 in full payment of the surplus properties", and that the  First Part undertakes to repair and recondition ... all the surplus properties . . . and to sell them for profit at the hest prevailing market price".  Note that the express stipulation is that Villa-Abrille alone (and not the association) is to pay for the goods  he bought; and  only Villa-Abrille is to repair and sell the same, clearly implying that Cojuangco acquired no  title to or direct interest in the goods themselves, and  only  Villa-Abrille was intended to  deal with  third persons in connection with the acquisition and  disposition  of said  goods.  The  business was  only   Villa-Abrille's;  and  Cojuangco  undertook no obligation  in  connection therewith.</p>
<p>These facts support  the  conclusion of the  Tax Court that, at the most, Cojuangco was a mere contributor  to a joint account enterprise with Villa-Abrille, and that the business remained exclusively  the  latter's, so  that  only Villa-Abrille became in law the buyer, importer, and seller of the goods, and the one liable for sales taxes thereon (V. Aldecoa &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., 30 Phil., 153).</p>
<p>The Collector  calls  attention to the agreement's provisions that  "in case of conflict the decision of the  Second Part (Cojuangco) shall prevail" (paragraph 9) ; that he was to be furnished  an inventory of the goods acquired, and was to be consulted "regarding the sales price"  (p. 11) ; that the proceeds of  the sale were to be deposited in  a joint "and/or"  bank  account,  and to be withdrawn by checks under  joint signature  (p. 12).  These  conditions, when  considered with  paragraphs 3 and  4,  heretofore quoted, appear to be  mere measures designed to protect the investment of Cojuangco and secure proper payment of his fifty per  cent of the net  profit; but they do  not establish that he had any joint interest in the  surplus properties themselves, nor in the purchase, reconditioning^ or sale thereof.</p>
<p>The Collector warns that agreements of this sort could be  used to defraud  the  government of taxes  due  it. No such  fraud  is shown  in  this case, and the desire to forestall future  deceit does  not justify  the imposition of a tax on the wrong person.  There is no showing that the taxes sought to be  recovered can  not be collected from Villa-Abrille.   On  the  other hand,  whether  Cojuangco's right to half  of  the  net profit involves prior deduction of all taxes  as part of  the costs of operation is,not in issue at present  and need  not be decided.</p>
<p>We agree with the Tax Court that respondent Jose Cojuangco is  not personally liable for the sales taxes now sought  to be recovered, and, therefore, affirm the decision under appeal.   No costs.</p>
