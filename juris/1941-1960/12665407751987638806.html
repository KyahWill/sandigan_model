				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Camarines&nbsp; Norte, Hon. Melquiades G. Ilao,&nbsp; presiding, dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the&nbsp; action. On August&nbsp; 27, 1956 the Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions&nbsp; (PAFLU) together with Domingo Bautista and some other employees of the Philippine&nbsp; Iron&nbsp; Mines, Inc. who are&nbsp; at the same time&nbsp; members of the National Miners&nbsp; and Allied Workers Union (NAMAWU)&nbsp; instituted this&nbsp; action&nbsp; designated as&nbsp; "acounting and&nbsp; recovery&nbsp; of money with preliminary injunction" against Roy Padilla, Alicio Luison, and&nbsp; Angel R. Paez,&nbsp; president,&nbsp; secretary treasurer and auditor, respectively,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; latter labor union&nbsp; (NAMAWU)&nbsp; which was&nbsp; formerly a local member of the plaintiff (PAFLU),&nbsp; but&nbsp; disaffiliated on&nbsp; August 4, 1956&nbsp; and&nbsp; joined the Philippine&nbsp; Trade Union Council (PTUC), another labor union federation.&nbsp; On September 6, 1956 the defendants filed&nbsp; a motion to dismiss alleging four grounds, the most&nbsp; important of which is that&nbsp; the court lacks jurisdiction over&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject matter since it refers&nbsp; to violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; internal&nbsp; labor&nbsp;&nbsp; organization procedures. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;During the&nbsp; hearing the parties agreed, upon the&nbsp; suggestion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judge, that&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as the&nbsp; first&nbsp; and principal ground of the&nbsp; motion questioning the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the court is&nbsp; decisive and sufficient to dismiss&nbsp; the plaintiffs' complaint, they confine&nbsp; their&nbsp; discussions&nbsp; and arguments on&nbsp; this ground alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 29, 1956 the lower court granted the defendants'&nbsp; motion to dismiss 'without prejudice&nbsp; to the filing of a new complaint before the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; court."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; not&nbsp; satisfied with the ruling of the court, filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; Instead of filing a new complaint&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations,&nbsp; they immediately appealed to this Honorable Court. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;It is conceded by both parties that "the subject matter of any given case" is determined, not by the nature of the action which party is entitled under the facts and the law to bring, but by the nature&nbsp; and character of the pleadings and issues submitted by the parties to&nbsp; the court for trial and judgment"&nbsp; (Belandres&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp; Sugar&nbsp; Central Mill Co., 97&nbsp; Phil,, 100; 51 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [6], 2881); that "jurisdiction over the subject&nbsp; matter&nbsp; means&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature of the cause of action and relief sought" (Perkins <i>vs.</i> Roxas, 72 Phil., 514); and to determine whether the court has or has no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over the subject matter of the action, the provisions of the law should be inquired into (Moran, Comments on&nbsp; the Rules of&nbsp; Court, Vol. I, pp. 136-137, 1957 ed.) <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;An examination of the causes of action, the 'allegations and the reliefs prayed for in the plaintiffs' complaint show that the defendants-officers failed to submit a monthly report of the income and&nbsp; expenses; that&nbsp; when pressed upon they submitted a statement of income and expenses covering the period from October 1955 to&nbsp; June 1956,&nbsp; omitting the month of September 1955 when they collected the sum of P453.60; that the expenses and disbursement submitted are not supported by vouchers,&nbsp; invoices, and receipts; that the report has&nbsp; a deficiency&nbsp; of&nbsp; P12,563.50.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; demand the submission of&nbsp; a correct&nbsp; or an amended statement of income and expenses supported by proper vouchers, invoices 'and receipts, or should the defendants&nbsp; fail to do so, to order them to pay the NAMAWU the alleged deficiency out of&nbsp; their own&nbsp; personal&nbsp; funds. The plaintiffs also denounce the allegedly unauthorized act of defendant Roy Padilla in alloting to himself and to his employees exorbitant salaries, allowances and expenses totalling to P2,180 a month; and they seek to annul such actuation in fixing his own salary and those of his employees, the same&nbsp; being violative of the NAMAWU constitution and not having been approved by the PAFLU National Executive Council. <br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiffs further&nbsp; complain of&nbsp; the affiliation&nbsp; of NAMAWU with the PTUC without having&nbsp; first&nbsp; disaffiliated from the PAFLU,&nbsp; thus violating the constitution and by-laws of&nbsp; the&nbsp; union;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendants Roy Padilla and Alicio&nbsp; Luison are alleged to continue to hold their positions&nbsp; as&nbsp; President and Secretary-Treasurer, in spite of their having been suspended; that they refuse to surrender their&nbsp; positions to&nbsp; Getulio Arriola and Benito Bonao who were appointed to take their place; that they were withdrawing or about to withdraw&nbsp; the&nbsp; remaining funds&nbsp; of the NAMAWU; that they incurred or&nbsp; are about to&nbsp; incur&nbsp; additional&nbsp; obligations, and are&nbsp; determined&nbsp; to commit further anomalies and irregularities to the further damage of the&nbsp; plaintiffs and the NAMAWU.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly the plaintiffs seek&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare as null and void the disaffiliation of the NAMAWU from the PAFLU and its affiliation with the PTUC, the&nbsp; ousting of the defendants from their respective positions, and that they be restrained from the commission of further anomalies and irregularities.<br><br>An&nbsp; inquiry into the provisions of Republic Act No. 875 more particularly Sections 17 and 2, the pertinent portions of which&nbsp; are quoted&nbsp; below, will&nbsp; also&nbsp; reveal, to wit:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 17. Rights and&nbsp; Conditions&nbsp; of Membership in Labor Organizations.—It is hereby declared&nbsp; to be the public policy of the Philippines&nbsp; to encourage the following internal labor&nbsp; organization procedures.&nbsp; A&nbsp; minimum of ten percent&nbsp; of the members of&nbsp; a labor organization may&nbsp; report&nbsp; an alleged&nbsp; violation of these&nbsp; procedures&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; labor&nbsp; organization to the Court. If the Court finds, upon&nbsp; investigation, evidence to substantiate the alleged violation and that efforts to correct the alleged violation through the procedures&nbsp; provided&nbsp; by the&nbsp; labor&nbsp; organization's constitution or by-laws have been exhausted, the Court shall&nbsp; dispose of the complaint as&nbsp; in 'unfair&nbsp; labor practice'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The&nbsp; officers of a legitimate labor&nbsp; organization&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not be paid any other compensation, in addition&nbsp; to the salaries&nbsp; and expenses&nbsp; of&nbsp; their positions&nbsp; which shall be&nbsp; specifically provided for in its constitution or by-laws, except&nbsp; in&nbsp; pursuance of a resolution approved in&nbsp; a&nbsp; meeting by&nbsp; a majority vote. <br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>)&nbsp; The&nbsp; treasurer&nbsp; of a legitimate labor organization&nbsp; and every officer thereof who is&nbsp; responsible for the accounts of such organization&nbsp; or for the collection,&nbsp; disbursement,&nbsp; custody&nbsp; or&nbsp; control of the&nbsp; funds, moneys and other properties of the organization, shall render to the organization and to its members at the times&nbsp; specified hereunder,&nbsp; a&nbsp;

his office. The account shall be verified by affidavit and copy thereof shall be&nbsp; furnished&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Labor.&nbsp; The&nbsp; organization&nbsp; shall cause such account to&nbsp; be audited by&nbsp; a&nbsp; qualified person." <br><br>"Sec. 2.
