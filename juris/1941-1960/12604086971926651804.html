				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The fiscal of Bataan&nbsp; has appealed from the order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; of first instance of that province dismissing the information, dated&nbsp; July 28,1953, that charged Dalmacio Salazar&nbsp; with a&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 319&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, because&nbsp;<blockquote>"in&nbsp; or about&nbsp; the&nbsp; periods&nbsp; comprised&nbsp; between&nbsp; July 16,&nbsp; 1957&nbsp; to February, 1948 *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * the herein defendant <i>Dalmacio Salazar,</i> having mortgaged 75 cavanes of palay under&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of the Chattel Bank, did then and&nbsp; there wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and fraudulently, sell and dispose of the said&nbsp; property without the knowledge and consent of the Bataan Agency,&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the damage&nbsp; and prejudice of the&nbsp; said bank in the&nbsp; sum of P262.50 Philippine Currency."<br></blockquote>According&nbsp; to said&nbsp; court, since&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime <span style="font-style: italic;">must have been discovered</span> prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; February 1948, more than five years had elapsed and&nbsp; therefore the crime had prescribed.&nbsp; The applicable&nbsp; provisions of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code are the following:<br><blockquote>"ART,&nbsp; 319. <i>Removal, sale or pledge&nbsp; of mortgaged of property.</i>— The penalty of arresto mayor or&nbsp; a fine amounting to twice&nbsp; the value of the property shall be imposed&nbsp; upon: * * *<br><br>"2. Any&nbsp; mortgagor who shall sell or&nbsp; pledge personal&nbsp; property already&nbsp; pledged, or&nbsp; any&nbsp; part thereof,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Chattel Mortgage Law, without the&nbsp; consent of the mortgagee * * *"<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 90. <i>Prescription&nbsp; of crimes.</i>—* * *&nbsp; Those&nbsp; punishable by a correctional penalty shall prescribe&nbsp; in ten years; with the&nbsp; exception of those&nbsp; punishable by&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor&nbsp;</span> which&nbsp; shall prescribe&nbsp; in five&nbsp; years." * * *<br><br>."Art.&nbsp; 26. <i>Fine—When&nbsp; afflictive,&nbsp; correctional or light penalty,—</i> A fine, whether imposed as a single or as an&nbsp; alternative penalty shall be considered an afflictive penalty,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it exceeds 6,000 pesos; a correctional&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; if it&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; exceed 6,000 pesos&nbsp; but is not less than 200 pesos;&nbsp; and a light penalty,&nbsp; if it be less than 200 pesos."<br><br>"ART.&nbsp; 39. <i>Subsidiary&nbsp; penalty.</i>—If&nbsp; the&nbsp; convict has no&nbsp; property with&nbsp; which&nbsp; to&nbsp; meet the&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; (fine)&nbsp; he&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; subject to a subsidiary&nbsp; personal&nbsp; liability at&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; one&nbsp; day&nbsp; for each 2 pesos and 50 centavos, subject to the following rules:&nbsp; * * *<br><br>"2. 'When&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal penalty imposed&nbsp; be only a&nbsp; fine,&nbsp; the subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed six months&nbsp; * * *"<br></blockquote>His Honor explained that five years&nbsp; was the&nbsp; prescriptive period, inasmuch as the offense was punishable with <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor.</span>&nbsp; Reminded,&nbsp; on a motion to reconsider, that the penalty&nbsp; could be&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; P525&nbsp; (twice the amount of P262.50)&nbsp; he&nbsp; declined&nbsp; to&nbsp; change his&nbsp; order pointing out that, anyway, the subsidiary imprisonment for&nbsp; such fine, could not exceed&nbsp; sis months&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 39 Revised&nbsp; Penal Code).<br><br>The Government's appeal&nbsp; rests&nbsp; oil two propositions: (a)&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense prescribed in ten years because the fine could&nbsp; be P525, which is a&nbsp; correctional penalty,&nbsp; tinder articles 90 and 26: (6) granting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that the period was five years, such period began only from the discovery of defendant's misdeed, which occurred&nbsp; in January 1953 as the prosecution&nbsp; offered to&nbsp; prove in the&nbsp; court below.<br><br>We&nbsp; find the first proposition to be in accordance with law and it&nbsp; is unnecessary to consider the second.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">could have been</span> ordered to pay a fine of P525, which&nbsp; is a correctional penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, as the offense was punished with a correctional&nbsp; penalty, it&nbsp; prescribed <span style="font-style: italic;">in ten&nbsp; years.&nbsp;</span> That his subsidiary imprisonment could not exceed six months&nbsp; is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp; The rule&nbsp; on prescription (as to fines) did&nbsp; not refer&nbsp; to subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment.&nbsp; It took into account&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature of the penalty: afflictive, correctional, and light.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Arresto mayor</span> was one exception.&nbsp; Subsidiary imprisonment, is not <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, and there is no reason to classify it as such, considering especially that exceptions are restrictively applied.<br><br>To adopt the lower court's viewpoint would&nbsp; mean that the heaviest fine, even exceeding P6.000, is never "afflictive," because the subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment could not go beyond six months.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would be&nbsp; rewriting and amending article 26 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The&nbsp; appealed order is reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
