				<H3>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. PEDRO C. RELATIVO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant-appellant Pedro C. Relativo owed the Philippine 
National Bank the sum of P600 for which he executed a promissory note jointly 
and severally, with two other persons, now dead. The debt was payable within six 
months counted from February 12, 1947. 
<p align="justify">In this suit by the Bank for collection, he asserts the 
obligation has already been paid because, on June 23, 1949 "he presented himself 
at the Naga Agency of the plaintiff and tendered payment of the loan out of a 
check for P5,000 issued by the U. S. Treasury in favor of Bernarda Vda. de 
Rullas, who then accompanied said defendant, demanding that her check be cashed. 
This defendant identified her as the payee, but plaintiff's Assistant Agent, 
Martin Saludo of the Naga Agency, dishonored the check on the ground that the 
identification and guaranty offered by the defendant were not sound and not free 
from suspicion. The same check was, however, honored and cashed at a latter 
date by the Legaspi Branch of the plaintiff through identification of another 
counsel hired by the payee." </p>
<p align="justify">Therefore the issue is whether the tender of payment in the 
manner above described resulted in the discharge of defendant-appellant's 
monetary undertaking. </p>
<p align="justify">We are clearly of the opinion that it did not, for several 
reasons, principally the following: <br></p><p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>.—The promissory note executed by 
appellant undertook to pay in the Philippine currency; and according to the 
trial judge, as "the tender of payment was made in check, and not his own at 
that, the plaintiff acted rightly in refusing it. This is true even if the check 
may be good." (Belisario vs. Natividad, 60 Phil., 156, and Villanueva vs. Santos 
Off. Gaz., March 1941, 681.)</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>.—The tender of payment was conditional. Under the Civil 
Code, a tender of payment, to be valid, must be unconditional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In offering the 
check, the defendant debtor, practically told the Bank, "Here is P600 but you 
must pay the remainder of the check, (P4,400) to Bernarda Vda. de Rullas". That 
condition the Bank's Agency was unwilling to accept.</p>
<p align="justify">And without in any manner implying that the creditor's refusal 
to accept the condition should be justified, we may state that the Bank in this 
case had some reasons to reject the condition, because of the financial risk it 
takes in making the payment, in connection with the identity of the payee, or 
the genuineness of the check or other possible infirmities of the commercial 
paper which banking institutions are expected to foresee or provide against.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant labors under the impression that <span style="font-style: italic;">it was the duty</span> 
of the Bank to honor and cash the check when and if the payee Vda. de Rullas 
presented it. The check is not before us, but we may grant appellant all 
favorable presumptions. We may assume that the check was in fact genuine, that 
it was negotiable, that it was drawn upon the Philippine National Bank, that the 
person presenting the check was in reality the payee Bernarda Vda. de Rullas, 
and that the drawer had enough funds in the hands of the plaintiff bank. Still, 
and in spite of the above circumstances, Bernarda Vda. de Rullas could not 
compel nor sue the Bank to obtain payment of the check, because it does not 
appear that it had been accepted. (Sec. 189, Neg. Inst. Law.) </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The payee of a check unaccepted cannot maintain an action on 
it against the bank on which it is drawn." (General American Life Ins. Co. vs. 
Stadium, N. C. 1943, 25 S. E. 2d, 202)</p>
<p align="justify">"The reason why the holder of the check is not permitted to sue 
the bank has been stated by the authorities to be, that there is no privity 
between the holder and the bank until by certification of the check or the 
acceptance thereof, express or implied, or by any other act or conduct, it has 
made itself directly liable to the holder." (Standard Trust Co. us. Commercial 
Nat. Bank, 1914, SI S. E. 1074, 166 N. C., 112.) </p>
<p align="justify">"The holder's remedy is against the drawer where payment of a 
check is refused." (Pease, etc., Co. vs. State Nat. Bank, 1905, 88 S. W., 172, 
114 Tenn., 693.) </p>
<p align="justify">"The bank is liable only to the drawer for a refusal to pay a 
check unless the check has been accepted or certified." (Farmers', etc., Nat. 
Bank vs. Elizabethtown Nat. Bank, i906, 30 Pa. Super. Ct., 271.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">If the Bank was not the drawee, appellant's case would be less 
meritorious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The payee of an unaccepted check cannot maintain an action 
against a bank, other than the drawee, which refuses to pay the check on 
demand." (Independent Oil Men's Assoc. vs. Ft. Dearborn Nat. Bank, 1924, 142 N. 
E. 458, 311 111., 278, affirming 226 111. App. 570.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The foregoing exposition of the right—or lack of right—of 
Bernarda Vda. de Rullas to get payment should be enough answer should appellant 
insist in his position that the Bank caused him damage—and therefore he has a 
counterclaim—for depriving him of the opportunity to earn the money he could 
have earned upon payment of the check through his services or cooperation. As 
there was no duty of the bank enforceable by Rullas, (nor by this defendant), no 
wrong was done, for which damage could be claimed. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>.—Tender of payment even if valid, does not by itself 
produce legal payment, unless it is completed by consignation. </p>
<p align="justify">The effect of a valid tender of payment is merely to exempt the 
debtor from payment of interest and/or damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Tender of payment alone is not a mode of extinguishing 
obligations. Tender of payment in the Civil Code is treated as subtitle in the 
section on <span style="font-style: italic;">Payment</span> as a mode of extinguishing obligations. But the subtitle is 
"Tender of payment <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> consignation". And article 1176 provides that after a 
valid tender of payment "the debtor shall be released from responsibility <span style="font-style: italic;">by the 
consignation</span> of the thing or sum due". As'a complement, article 1180 says that 
"<span style="font-style: italic;">after the consignation</span> has been duly made, the debtor may petition the judge to 
order the cancellation of the obligation." All of which patently indicate that 
consignation must follow, supplement or complete the tender of payment if 
discharge of the obligation is to be obtained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"B. Ofrecimicnto de pago y consignacion.—Consiste el primero 
en una declaracion de voluntad dirigida al acreedor, por la que el deudor 
manifiesta su firme decision dc cumplir immediatamente la obligation; y la 
segunda en el deposito que en forma legal hace el deudor de la cosa objeto de la 
obligacion, cuando el acreedor no quiere o no puede recibirla. <span style="font-style: italic;">Solo la 
consignacion es forma de pago</span>. La oferta unicamente nos interesa aqui en cuanto 
es un acto preparatorio.de la consignacion." (Castan, Derecho Civil, Vol. 2, p. 
521.). </p>
<p align="justify">"A. <span style="font-style: italic;">In General</span>.—Under a statute in some jurisdictions an 
obligation for the payment of money is extinguished by a due offer of payment, 
if the amount is immediately deposited in accordance with the statute. In the 
absence of such statute, or if there is a failure to comply with the statute) a 
tender of money does not ordinarily operate as a satisfaction of the debt. * * 
*" (62 Corpus Juris, p. 683.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The appellant cites article 1170 of the Civil Code providing 
that delivery to the creditor of a check "shall produce the effects of payment 
only when realized or when by the fault of such creditor <span style="font-style: italic;">the privileges inherent 
in their negotiable character have been lost</span>"; and he argues, that the 
underlined portion applies to his defense against the Bank. Yet it appears that 
the refusal of the plaintiff's Naga Branch did not impair the check. So much so 
that it was subsequently honored and cashed by the Legaspi branch. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment of the court of first instance of 
(Jamarines Sur requiring this defendant-appellant to pay the debt with interest, 
attorneys fees and costs is hereby affirmed. He shall also defray the costs of 
this appeal.</p>
