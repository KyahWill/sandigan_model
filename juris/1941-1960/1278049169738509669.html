<p>The evidence shows that on July 3, 1042 various Moros (Maranaos) from Barrio 
Baris, Municipality of Kolambugan, province of Lanao, raided the barrio of 
Malingao, killing 11 Christian residents including men and women, wounding two 
of them, and, thereafter, robbing them of their belongings. This incident was 
reported to the home guards, an organization composed of ex-Philippine 
Constabulary soldiers and civilians whose duty it was to preserve peace and 
order among the inhabit ants, protect them, and prevent the infiltration of the 
Japanese in their communities. The report was made to appellant Crispin Lawas, 
head of the home guards in Balimbing and to Sgt. Benaojan, also head of home 
guards in Salong. Upon learning of the incident, Lawas and Benaojan and some 
home guards proceeded to the barrio of Malingao to check up the report. There 
they found the asad bodies of the Christian Filipinos killed by the Maranaos and 
learned that the Maranaos who had committed the act came from the barrio of 
Baris. So they proceeded to the barrio of Baris in the afternoon of July 10. 
Upon reaching Baris, they divided themselves into two groups, one headed by Sgt. 
Benaojan and the other by Crispin Lawas. That headed by Sgt. Benaojan gathered 
the Maranaos around the place of ex-Mayor Gunti, while that headed by Crispin 
Lawas, those that live around the house of Datu Lomangcolob. Some seventy of 
them, including Manaronsong Lomangcolob. school teacher, Datu Lomangcolob 
Sumala, his wife and children, Gunti Ampaso, his wife and children, Pasintao, 
his wife and four children, Laito, his wife and four children, Pacpac, his wife, 
niece and nephew, Mainanding Lomangcolob and two children, Dibton and children, 
Garagabos and wife, Rutum, his wife and children, Aboli and a child, Adki's 
children, and others were brought by the home guards to the barrio of Salong, 
where they arrived in the evening of July 10th, between seven and eight o'clock. 
When the home guards were in the barrio of Baris, they or some of them took away 
three carabaos, two horses, and many personal belongings, especially of Datu 
Lomangcolob. This is the basis of the charge of robbery.</p>
<p>The Maranaos were confined during the night of July 10 under guard in the 
house of one Restituto Requino. The next morning, Crispin Lawas and Agustin 
Osorio began investigating the principal Moros. Some 15 of them were brought 
down in groups of five before Lawas and Osorio. A table was set up near the rice 
mill of Pedro Lacson and there Lawas and Osorio questioned them. In the course 
of the investigation, and for reasons which are disputed, the home guards then 
on duty and present at the investigation fired at the Moros and most of them 
were killed. In the course of the melee that followed, some of the home guards 
and others who could not be identified, went up the house of Restituto Requino 
and fired at the woman and children who were on the second floor of the house. 
Some of the women and children were stabbed. No less than 35 women and children 
were killed and no less than 16 of the Moros down below were also killed. Among 
the killed were Datu Lomangcolob Sumala, Gunti Ampaso, Pasintao, Laito, Pacpac 
and Rutum. For this killing, two charges of multiple murder were filed, one 
against Crispin Lawas, Agustin Osorio and Clemente Osorio, and another against 
Hermenegildo Tabacon, Felipe Si-it, Agapito Gumisad, Generoso Osorio and 
Patricio Pinos.</p>
<p>Insofar as the crime of robbery is concerned, principal witness Manaronsong 
Lomangcolob, son of. Datu Lomangcolob. Sumala, declared that the Home guards who 
gathered them in . the barrio of Baris and later brought them to the barrio . 
of. Salong took from them (the Maranaos) 3 carabaos worth P800, 2 horses worth 
P100, and jewelry and other personal belongings worth P500. The animals were 
taken away by the following home guards: Lawas, 1 horse; Agapito Gumisad, 1 
horse; and Clemente Osorio, Felipe Si-it and Generoso Osorio, one carabao each. 
Of the accused, the following were seen coming down from the houses of the 
Maranaos, bringing with them <u>malongs</u>, bracelets and other personal 
belongings: Generoso Osorio, Felipe Si-it, Hermenegildo Tabacon, Agustin Osorio, 
Clemente Osorio and Agapito Gumisad.</p>
<p>Of the above-named accused, only Lawas testified, but he made no denial of 
the taking by him of one of the horses. None of the briefs or memoranda filed on 
behalf of the appellant claims or mentions grounds why appellants should not be 
held guilty of robbery, although certain discrepancies appear in Lomangcolob's 
testimony as to the manner in which the said horses and carabaos ware taken. 
Admitting that there are discrepancies in tho said testimony as to the details 
of the taking, the evidence conclusively shows that the accused designated above 
took the animals and properties in question. No denial of this fact was ever 
made. There is insinuation that some of the animals may have been some of those 
taken at the raid of Malingao, but no satisfactory evidence exists on which a 
finding to that effect can be predicated. The evidence also shows that the 
accused were armed at the time of the taking of the animals and other personal 
properties. The finding of the trial court that the accused are guilty of 
robbery as above-indicated is fully supported by the evidence. There is no 
evidence, however, of the existence of any conspiracy among the accused in the 
commission of tha acts of robbery and each one must respond for his own 
individual act.</p>
<p>As to the charge of multiple murder, tha death of about fifty of the 
Maranaos, including fifteen men, twenty five women and ten children is not 
questioned; but the circumstances under which their death took place are the 
object of conflicting evidence. The three witnesses for the prosecution claim 
that the Moros were fired at when Datu Lomangcolob refused to be tied at the 
hands, while the defense claims that they were fired at because they attempted 
to grab the arms of the home guards. The evidence submitted by both sides on 
this issue may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Manaronsong Lomangcolob testified that while he and four of his companions 
namely, Gunti Ampaso, lacpac and Datu Lomangcolob ware in front of the table 
before which Crispin Lawas and Agustin Osorio were making the investigation, 
Lawas first asked them to sign blank papers, and that they, the Maranaos, 
refused; but they were beaten with rifles and boxed, so Datu Lomangcolob 
enjoined him and his companions to sign the blank papers as demanded by the 
investigators; that afterwards Crispin Lawas informed the Maranaos that they 
would be brought to Captain Morgan at Balimbing and for this purpose their hands 
were to be tied; that for the purpose of tying their hands, Hermenegildo 
Tabacon, one of the home guards, brought some pieces of split rattan; that as 
Datu Lomangcolob was approached to have his hands tied, he refused and, 
thereupon, Crispin Lawas fired his revolver at him and ordered the guards to 
fire; that following instructions, the home guards fired at the Moros and many 
of them fell down dead; that those Moros who tried to escape were also fired at; 
and that after a short time Crispin Lawas ordered his men to "cease fire", and 
the firing stopped.;</p>
<p>Pedro Lacson, a resident of Barrio Salong, corroborated tha principal parts 
of the above testimony of Manaronsong Lomangcolob, declaring that he (Lacson) 
was under the eaves of his house observing the investigation that Lawas and 
Osorio were conducting; that he noticed Lawas ordering the men to be brought 
down from the house of Restituto Requino; that in the course of the 
investigation, Lawas said that the Moros would be brought to Balimbing where 
Captain Morgan was and that the Moros were to have their hands tied; that Datu 
Lomangoolob expressed willingness to go to Captain Morgan, but that he was not 
willing to have his hands tied; and that then a commotion ensued and then 
Crispin Lawas gave his men the order to fire. In connection with the massacre of 
the women in the second floor of the house of Restituto Requino, it is very 
clear that in the course of the shooting two persons, not companions of Lawas, 
went up the house of Requino and, perhaps, helped in boloing the 15 women and 
children in said house.</p>
<p>A third witness corroborated the most important details of the above 
testimonies. Manking Aguam, claiming to be 11 years old when the incident took 
place, testified as follows: That he was with the women and children in the 
upper floor of the house of Restituto Requino before the investigation began; 
that he saw some of the accused as they brought down the male Maranaos for the 
purpose of investigation; that the firing was caused by the refusal of the 
Maranaos to accede to have their hands tied as ordered by Crispin Lawas: that in 
the course of the shooting, Agapito Gumisad, Felipe Si-it, Clemente Osorio, Tito 
Requino and Patricio Pinos shot at the women and children and stabbed them with 
boloes; and that Gumisad was trying to stab him and what he did was to jump down 
and run away.</p>
<p>Only two of the accused took the witness stand, namely, Crispin Lawas and 
Agustin Osorio. Other witnesses testified for them, but their testimonies are of 
no material value insofar as the main issue is concerned. Crispin Lawas 
testified that upon the receipt of the report of the raid on the Christian 
Filipinos by the Maranaos on July 9, he met with Captain Morgan, the head of the 
home guards and tha PC; that thereupon Captain Morgan instructed him to 
accompany Sgt, Benaojan and proceed to Barrio Malingao to investigate the 
incident; that in pursuance of said order, he and Sgt. Banaojan went to Barrio 
Malingao and saw the dead persons there; that he found out after investigation 
that some of the Moros who made the raid came from Barrio Baris, so he and Sgt, 
Benaojan and their men proceeded to Baris; that the people of that place were 
gathered together in the afternoon of July 10 and that they took them along to 
Barrio Salong; that when they reached that place, Sgt. Benaojan ordered the 
Moros to stay in the house of Restituto Requino and that this was done; that at 
dawn the following day, Lawas went to Captain Morgan to make a report, and that 
Captain Morgan ordered him to investigate the leaders of the Moros and, 
afterwards, send the result of his investigation to him; that he returned to the 
barrio of Salong the following morning; that at about 8:00 o'clock in the 
morning of the following day (July 11), he ordered a table to be placed on the 
ground and that the investigation of the Moros be conducted; that the 
investigation took place in the following order: first Mayor Gunti, Datu 
Lomangcolob, Datu Pacpac and Manaronsong Lomangcolob together; that as said 
investigation proceeded, the Moros suddenly rushed at the home guards to grab 
their guns and so a commotion arose; that he and Agustin Osorio did not know 
what had happened and upon hearing gun fire he stood astounded; that because of 
the presence of the women and children, he ordered his guards to cease fire, 
which was done; that throughout the time of the firing, he could not do anything 
but stand up; that his companion Agustin Osorio in the meanwhile lied flat on 
the ground; and that afterwards he went to the middle of the place where the 
gathering was and found out that many Moros were dead.</p>
<p>For his part, accused Agustin Osorio testified that on July 10, he was 
ordered by Sgt. Benaojan to go to Camp 5 with 4 soldiers to investigate the 
maltreatment of a Christian Filipino; that on their way back from the 
investigation, they heard shots coming from Barrio Malingao and so they went to 
that barrio and upon arriving there they found 11 Christian Filipinos dead and 2 
wounded; that he received information about the incident from one, Piano 
Taborada, who said that the ones who made the raid were from Barrio Baris; that 
when he returned to Barrio Salong, he reported the incident to Sgt. Benaojan; 
that he accompanied Sgt. Benaojan and Crispin Lawas on July 10 to Barrio 
Malingao where they saw 11 Christians dead and 2 wounded; that after the 
investigation conducted in Barrio Malingao, they went to Barrio Baris where they 
arrived at five o'clock in the afternoon; that upon reaching Barrio Baris, Mayor 
Gunti sounded the "agong" and the people of the barrio swarmed around them; that 
they brought some of the men to the barrio of Salong and there they were ordered 
to sleep in the house of Restituto Requino; that after breakfast the following 
morning, July 11, an investigation was to be made and after the male Moros were 
brought down he and Lawas began investigating them; that after investigating 6 
of the Moros, and while investigating the 7th, he immediately noticed a 
commotion among the Moros and the soldiers because of the fact that the former 
were grabbing the firearms of the latter; that in the course of the struggle the 
guns of the soldiers were exploded; that because of the noise Lawas could not 
give any order so he and Lawas laid themselves down flat on the ground and after 
one minute in this position, Lawas ordered that the guards cease firing and the 
firing stopped; that he could not tell where the firing started because at the 
time when it began Lawas was dictating to him and he was writing down what Lawas 
dictated; and that after the firing had ceased, ha looked around and found many 
teoros. dead, while the soldiers (home guards) had run away.</p>
<p>There is no question that before Lawas fired at Datu Lomangcolob and the home 
guards also fired at the other Monos, there was a sort of commotion, evidently 
produced by the announcement made by Lawas that the Moros were to be brought to 
Captain Morgan at Balimbing and that their hands were to be tied. The existence 
of this commotion is admitted by Pedro Lacson, eye witness to the incident, who 
said "But then the Moros refused that they will go there with the Christian 
<u>and immediately a commotion started and because of that</u>, Crispin Lawas 
ordered them to be fired at." The issue lies on the cause or origin of said 
commotion, for while the prosecution contends that this was produced by the 
refusal of Datu Lomangcolob to have his hands tied, the defense claims that the 
commotion was produced by the Moros suddenly rushing at the soldiers to grab 
their firearms, arid so they were fired at. The theory of the defense is not 
warranted by the facts and circumstances proved and admitted. Had the Moros 
actually rushed at the soldiers to grapple with these for the possession of the 
firearms, they would have mixed up with the soldiers in body struggles and it 
would have been impossible for the soldiers to fire at them without hitting 
their own companions. Had there been a free for all struggle for the arms of the 
soldiers, the latter could not have fired at and hit the Moros without hitting 
others or their own companions. But only one of the home guards was wounded by a 
stray bullet; no others received any injury in the course of the commotion. 
Besides, a volley of shots appeared to have been fired immediately when the 
commotion started, as a result of which many Moros fell down dead. This would 
not have been the case had real grappling for the possession of the guns taken 
place as claimed by the defense. If a struggle for the possession df the 
firearms had taken place, the shots would have come intermittently. If there 
were shots made after the first volley had been fired they were aimed at the 
escaping Moros. All the above circumstances belie the claim of the defense that 
the Moros tried to grab the firearms of the solders, and that the latter fired 
at them as a consequence of the said attempt. </p>
<p>On the other hand, neither can the theory of the prosecution that upon 
refusal of Datu Lomangcolob to have his hands tied, Lawas gave the order to fire 
at the Moros, be admitted on its face value. Witness Pedro Lacson, who appears 
to be the most impartial of the witnesses, admits that there was a commotion, 
although he did not specify the nature and character thereof. If any commotion 
ever existed at all, it must have bean caused by the announcement that the Moros 
were to be tied. This announcement must have angered the Morors, who must have 
protested the act; theretofore, they had submitted themselves to the arrest 
without protest or resistance. The most reasonable inference is that upon 
hearing that their hands were to be tied and as the leader was going to have his 
hands tied and he refused or resisted, the Maranaos must have angrily protested, 
showing an attitude of hostility or resistance; and this attitude must have been 
interpretted by Lawas and the soldiers as a determination to resist and even to 
fight, Perhaps, this belief also must have produced the impression upon the mind 
of Lawas that the Moros were bent on something like the use of force, such as 
the grabbing of the firearms of the soldiers, and perhaps it may have been in an 
attempt to forestall such a frantic and unexpected attack that Lawas gave the 
order to fire and that he himself fired at Datu Lomangcolob. We think that this 
must have happened; that Lawas believed that the Moros were about to resist and 
even attempt to fight for the arms, so he gave the order to fire.</p>
<p>There can not, therefore, be any circumstance that would qualify the killing 
of the Maranaos as murder; there was no evident premeditation; neither was there 
treachery because the Moros were face to face with the soldiers; and neither 
could there be abuse of superior strength because the soldiers did not expressly 
take advantage of their arms to commit the offense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no circumstance present in the killing which may 
sufficiently serve to mitigate the offense that has been committed. It is 
possible that an attitude of hostility accompanied the refusal of Datu 
Lomangcolob to have his hands tied, which attitude must have been shared by his 
companions; and it is also possible that the fear of well-known Moro 
ferociousness could have made Lawas and his companions believe that the Moros 
were bent on refusing to be tied. But there is no evidence that they went beyond 
showing their refusal or hostility, or an apparent act on their part such as 
would induce a reasonable belief that the Maranaos were about to begin an 
aggression against their captors. Their peaceful conduct at the time of their 
arrest and before the investigation showed that they were submissive and 
obedient. No circumstance, therefore, can sufficiently justify a finding that 
the offense was committed with any mitigating circumstance. The offense 
committed is plain, simple homicide, with respect to Crispin Lawas and Agustin 
Osorio, as it is also with respect to thos3 soldiers who fired at the Moros at 
the time the commotion arose.</p>
<p>But with respect to the killing of the women and children in the upper story 
of the house of Restituto Requino, the killing is plainly attended by the 
circumstance of abuse of superior strength. The women and children were 
defenseless; there is no evidence that they showed any act of defiance or 
hostility, and while the soldiers were given an order to fire at the Moros then 
on the ground, said order could not imply or include an order to go up the house 
and massacre the innocent and defenseless women and children therein. Persons 
who participated in the killing of the women should be made to suffer the 
penalty commensurate with the degree of perversity which attended this act. 
While evident premeditation may not be assumed, because the massacre of the 
women and children was part of the impulse that resulted in the killing of the 
Moros on the ground, yet the women and children were defenseless and could offer 
no resistance at all. Their defenseless condition should be considered as 
included in the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, not as an 
independent circumstance of treachery. We find, therefore, that only one 
aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the crime, or the killing of 
the women and children, and that is tha abuse of superior strength, which 
aggravating circumstance raises the offense to that of murder.</p>
<p>The question which still has to be considered is tha determination from among 
the appellants of those who may be convicted of the murder of the women and 
children.in the house of Restituto Requino. Witness Pedro Lacson declared that 
he saw two men armed with bolos going up the house as the shooting of the Moros 
on the ground was in progress, but he asserted that these did not belong to the 
group of home guards led by Crispin Lawas. But Manking Aguam identified Agapito 
Gumisad, Felipa Si-it, Clemente Osorio, Pedro Benaojan, Tito Requino and 
Patricio Pinos as among those who went up and shot or stabbed the women and 
children in the house. The identification is not contradicted nor denied by the 
defense, but except as to Gumisad, who was well known to the witness before the 
incident, the identification is not as positive and certain as to amount to 
proof of their identities beyond reasonable doubt. Thus witness identified Tito 
Requino as one of the assailants; but Requino was never known before that time 
by the witness. He also identified another as Benaojan, but the other evidence 
submitted by the State itself shows that Benaojan was not present at the time of 
the incident. In another part of his testimony, the witness said that Tabacon, 
Pinos and Generoso Osorio were among those who brought down the Moros; while in 
tha same testimony, he asserts it was one old man, Mauricio Macasarte, who also 
went up. There was no corroboration offered by any more competent and 
disinterested witness. This vacillating and doubtful identification, coupled 
with tha fact that the witness was only eleven years of age at tha time of the 
incident and made tho identification seven years later, and that he had an 
interest in the conviction of the accused, can not serve as legal basis for a 
finding that the persons pointed out at tha trial were in fact the very persons 
who committed the murder of the women and children, With the exeeption of 
Agapito Gumisad and Hermenegildo Tabacon, whose appeals have been dismissed, the 
other appellants Felipe Si-it, Generoso Osorio and Patricio Pinos can not, 
therefore, be found guilty of murder. </p>
<p>As to whether Crispin Lawas and .Agustin Osorio can be held responsible 
therefor, it is true that the authors of the murder were home guards under their 
immediata command. But the evidence submitted fails to disclose any previous 
common design to massacre all the Moros under detention, including the women and 
children. The evidence is to the effect that the women and the children were not 
arrested or taken into custody, but that they only accompanied their husbands 
and relatives who were brought for investigation. There was no evidence of a 
previous conspiracy by reason of which Crispin Lawas and Agustin Osorio, as 
leaders, may be held for the murder of the women and children.</p>
<p>May they be held guilty of murder by induction on the basis of the order 
given by Lawas to fire at the Moros as the commotion started? It is true that 
Lawas was the leader of the home guards in Balimbing among whom were Agapito 
Gumisad, Felipe Si-it, Hermenegildo Tabacon and Patricio Pinos. But the order 
given was to fire at the Moros (on the ground), and nothing else; the order was 
to fire at the Moros who showed resistance or protest against his order that 
they be tied. The order could not have been interpreted to mean that the women 
and children in the house, who did not appear to have shown any resistance or 
hostility at all, should also be fired at. Lawas clearly did not intend that the 
women and children inside the house should also be fired at. He can not be held 
guilty of the crime committed, as it has been held that in order to make the 
inducer responsible for the crime committed, it is necessary that the inducement 
is material land precedes the commission of the act, and that such inducement 
was the determining cause thereof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"xxx, it may be stated as a general proposition that, where the inducement 
offered by the accused is of such a nature and made in such a way that it become 
the determining cause of the crime, and such inducement was offered with the 
intention of producing that result, then the accused is guilty by inducement of 
the crime committed by the person so induced. The inducement to the crime must 
be intentional on the part of the inducer and must be made directly for the 
purpose in view.</p>
<p>"The verb 'induce' is sufficiently broad, generally speaking, to cover cases 
where there exists on the part of the inducer the most positive resolution and 
the most persistent effort to secure the commission of the crime, together with 
the presentation to the person induced of the very strongest kind of temptation, 
as well as words or acts which are merely the result of indiscretion or lack of 
reflection and which carry with them, inherently, almost nothing of inducement 
or temptation. A chance word spoken without reflection, a wrong appreciation of 
a situation, an ironical phrase, a thoughtless act, may give birth to a thought 
of, or even a resolution to, crime in the mind of one for some independent 
reason predisposed thereto without the one who spoke the word or performed the 
act having any expectation, that his suggestion would be followed or any real 
intention that it produces a result. In such case, while the expression was 
imprudent and the results of it grave in the extreme, he would not be guilty of 
the crime committed. Therefore, in applying the principles laid down to concrete 
cases it is necessary to remember only that the inducement must be made directly 
with the intention of procuring the commission of the crime and that such 
inducement must be the determining cause of the crime." (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Indanan, 24 Phil. 203, 218)</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither Crisipin Lawas nor Agustin Osorio may, therefore, be held responsible 
for the crime of murder in connection with the massacre of the women and 
children by inducement, and they must be acquitted of the charge of murder.</p>
<p>One last question involves the determination of the number or crimes for 
which each of the appellants may be found guilty, whether each one should be 
considered as having committed as many crimes as there were persons who were 
killed, or only for one complex crime of multiple homicide. The information is 
for multiple murder, and no inference can be made therefrom, that the accused 
are being charged of as many offenses as there were victims. Then the evidence 
positively shows that the killing was the result of a single impulse, which was 
induced by the order of the leader to fire, and continued with the intention to 
comply therewith, as the firing stopped as soon as the leader gave the order to 
that effect. There was no intent on the part of the apellants either to fire at 
each and everyone of the victims as separately and distinctly from each other. 
It has been held that if the act or acts complained of resulted from a single 
criminal impulse, it constitutes a single offense (Article 43 of the Revised 
Penal Code; People vs. Acosta, 60 Phil. 158). So also it has been held that the 
act of taking two roosters belonging to two different persons in the same place 
and on the same occasion cannot give rise to two crimes having an independent 
existence of their own, because there are not two distinct appropriations nor 
two intentions that characterize two separate crimes (People <em>vs</em>. De 
Leon, 49 Phil. 237, citing decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain of November 
2, 1898 and October 4, 1905). And in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Guillem, 47 
0.G. No. 7, 3433, a single act, that of throwing a highly explosive hand grenade 
at President Roxas, resulting in the death of one victim and in physical 
injuries on others was considered as a single act, also falling under the first 
part of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code. It may be added that there is 
absolutely no evidence as to the number of persons killed by each and every one 
of the appellants, so even if we were induced to hold each appellant responsible 
for each and every death caused by him, it is imposible to carry that desire 
into effect as it is impossible to ascertain the individual deaths caused by 
each and everyone. We are, therefore, forced to find the appellants guilty of 
only one offense, that of multiple homicide for which the penalty to be imposed 
should be in the maximum period.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in G.R. No. 7618, for robbery, the judgment of conviction appealed 
from is hereby affirmed, but the maximum of the penalty imposed is hereby raised 
to 6 years 10 months and 1 day of prision mayor, in view of the presence of the 
aggravating circumstance of superior strength in the commission of the offense. 
The individual liabilities of each of the persons sentenced for said crime are 
hereby also affirmed. In G.R. Nos. 7619 and 7620, the appellants Crispin Lawas, 
Clemente Osorio, Agustin Osorio, Felipe Si-it, Generoso Osorio and Patricio 
Pinos are each found guilty of the crime of multiple homicide and each sentenced 
to suffer the penalty of not less than 15 years 6 months and 21 days nor more 
than 18 years 2 months and 21 days, both of <u>reclusion temporal</u>, to 
indemnify the heirs of each of the deceased, jointly and severally, in the 
amount of P3,000.00, and to pay the costs proportionately.</p>
