<p>The above is a true and correct copy from itg original and in witness 
whereof, I hereby sign my name at Badoc, Ilocos Norte, thia 27th day of July, 
1951.</p>
<p>(Sgd.) F. M. TOLENTINO <br><em>Municipal Treasurer</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Upon this stipulation the Court rendered judgment declaring that the marriage 
between the defendants Leoncio Cardenas and Florencia Riñen entered into on 19 
April 1948 is null and void <em>ab initio</em>. Coats were taxed against them. 
From this judgment the defendants appeal.</p>
<p>The appellants insist on their contention that there is nothing in the 
stipulation which shows that Minister George W. Wright had authority to 
solemnize the marriage between Leoncio Cardenas and Eulogia Bigornia; that it 
does not appear in the stipulation of facts that a marriage license was issued 
to enable them to marry.</p>
<p>A marriage license as provided for in article 53, paragraph 4, of the new 
Civil Code arid in section 7 of the Marriage Law (Act No. 3613), which took 
effect on 30 August 1950 and 4 December 1929, respectively, was not required by 
General Orders No. 68, the law in force on 10 July 1927 when the marriage was 
entered into by and between Cardenas and Bigornia. The marriage certificate 
attesting that a marriage ceremony was performed by a minister named George W. 
Wright gives rise to the presumption that all legal formalities required by law 
had been complied with and fulfilled. If the minister was not authorized to 
perform such marriage ceremony it was incumbent upon the defendants to show such 
lack of authority on the part of the minister.</p>
<p>In disposing of this appeal we did not overlook article 88 of the new Civil 
Code which provides that "No judgment annulling a marriage shall be promulgated 
upon a stipulation of facts * * *." This article and article 101 on legal 
separation of the same Code contemplate the annulment of a marriage or legal 
separation where the parties might secure the annulment of their marriage or 
their legal separation by collusion. In thia case the possibility of such 
collusion is remote, because the interest of the two wives are conflicting. 
Apart from this, the marriage certificates attached to the stipulation of facts 
are evidence and cannot be deemed to be a stipulation of facts.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p>

Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
