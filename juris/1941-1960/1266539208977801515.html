				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> For the violent&nbsp; death of Ladislao Olarte,&nbsp; three&nbsp; men, namely Roque "Elmedulan,&nbsp; Felipe&nbsp; Elumba. and&nbsp; Cruz Alvarico, were charged with&nbsp; murder&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Misamis Occidental.&nbsp; Upon motion,&nbsp; Cruz Alvarico was granted separate trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a separate decision he was found guilty as charged and sentenced&nbsp; to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial of the two other accused, the&nbsp; court below also found them&nbsp; guilty of murder and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and to indemnify jointly and severally, with Cruz Alvarico, the heirs of the deceased Ladislao Olarte in the amount of P3,000.00.<br><br>Only Roque Elmedulan appealed. <br><br>The incriminatory facts&nbsp; as&nbsp; disclosed by the&nbsp; evidence for the prosecution are as follows: Between 11&nbsp; a.m. and 12 noon, February 21,&nbsp; 1955, in Barrio Colambutan Bajo, Tudela, Misamis Occidental, Ladislao Olarte was. sitting on a pile of coconut husks, while tending his grazing cows. Suddenly from behind him stealthily came Felipe Elumba, followed by Gruz Alvarico and Roque Elmedulan,&nbsp; Probably&nbsp; sensing&nbsp; danger, Olarte&nbsp; turned his&nbsp; head.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; that very moment&nbsp; Elumba bludgeoned&nbsp; him on&nbsp; the head.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blow&nbsp; landed&nbsp; on his right eyebrow, felled him&nbsp; and&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; him&nbsp; unconscious.&nbsp; Then appellant&nbsp; and&nbsp; Alvarico joined in mauling him.&nbsp; Thereafter, the three&nbsp; brought their unconscious victim to the foot of the stairs of Alvarico's house nearby.&nbsp; Appellant took the bolo&nbsp; from the victim's waist&nbsp; and&nbsp; gave him two parallel slashes on the face, resulting in death.&nbsp; Then, with his own bolo, Elumba hacked the posts&nbsp; and stairs of Alvarico's&nbsp; house, while appellant smeared&nbsp; the floor and walls of the room&nbsp; and the stairs with blood.&nbsp; Appellant instructed Alvarico to report to the police that he killed the deceased when the later tried to invade his house and attack him.&nbsp; Appellant promised him&nbsp; to shoulder all expenses for lawyers and to give him money.&nbsp; Accordingly, Alvarico, carrying the victim's bloody&nbsp; bolo, surrendered&nbsp; to&nbsp; the police&nbsp; authorities at the municipal building of Tudela, alleging that he had killed Olarte&nbsp; in self-defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; chief of police filed a complaint for homicide against Alvarico.&nbsp; Later the charge was changed to murder and included appellant&nbsp; and Felipe Elumba as accused.<br><br>The above&nbsp; facts were&nbsp; established by the testimony of Cruz Alvarico, Jorge&nbsp; Sericos and Roel Olarte.&nbsp; Background for the crime was the&nbsp; quarrel&nbsp; between Elumba and Olarte over&nbsp; a piece of land. &nbsp;<br><br>Appellant and Alvarico were Elumba's bosom friends.&nbsp; On one occasion, appellant joined&nbsp; Elumba&nbsp; in threatening&nbsp; Olarte when the latter attempted to gather coconuts from the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, whenever the three passed by Olarte's house,&nbsp; they challenged Olarte to come down and&nbsp; fight them to death. Appellant set up the defense of alibi which Bernardino Taylaran attempted&nbsp; to corroborate.&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; testified that from about 10:30 a.m. to&nbsp; noon of the day in question he was&nbsp; in Taylaran's&nbsp; house.&nbsp; But his alibi does not completely establish the impossibility&nbsp; of his having participated in the crime which was committed between 11 a.m. and 12 noon.&nbsp; According to Taylaran, appellant reached his house and&nbsp; stayed&nbsp; there for less than half an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taylaran's house is but half an&nbsp; hour's walk from Alvarico's house.&nbsp; In view of these facts, appellant's alibi becomes&nbsp; practically worthless, more so considering that prosecution witnesses Jorge Sericos and Roel Olarte have positively testified that they saw him at the&nbsp; scene of the crime near&nbsp; Alvarico's house. <br><br>In&nbsp; the main, appellant assails&nbsp; the&nbsp; credibility&nbsp; of the prosecution&nbsp; witnesses. <br><br>Cruz&nbsp; Alvarico, who&nbsp; testified for the prosecution during Elumba and appellant's trial, made three separate statements, one&nbsp; dated January 22, 1955 (Exhibit C) wherein he admitted having killed Olarte&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter attacked him in his&nbsp; own&nbsp; house; and two others,&nbsp; dated January 27, 1955 and February&nbsp; 7, 1955 (Exhibits D and H) wherein he completely disowned participation&nbsp; in the crime.&nbsp; At the trial he testified in accordance with the last two affidavits.&nbsp; He declared that as he was returning home at about noon of the fatal day, appellant called him to the house of Felipe Infelis where he saw Olarte's corpse atop&nbsp; a pile of&nbsp; coconut&nbsp; husks; that Elumba&nbsp; intimidated him into&nbsp; owning&nbsp; the crime after&nbsp; which the two&nbsp; carried the corpse&nbsp; to Alvarico's house; that appellant then took Olarte's bolo and&nbsp; hacked the deceased&nbsp; twice on the face; that Elumba struck with his bolo the stairs and walls of the house, while appellant smeared with blood the walls, floor and&nbsp; stairs; and that appellant instructed him to confess to the crime,&nbsp; after&nbsp; promising him&nbsp; to shoulder&nbsp; all expenses&nbsp; for lawyers and&nbsp; to give&nbsp; him money.<br><br>After the three accused&nbsp; had been found guilty and sentenced, Cruz Alvarico, while in the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinglupa, made&nbsp; a deposition wherein&nbsp; he admits sole responsibility&nbsp; for Olarte's death.&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; made this deposition as&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; for his&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; new trial filed in this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we&nbsp; find that it&nbsp; cannot be the basis of a new trial because it is not newly discovered evidence.&nbsp; Its contents are&nbsp; a mere reiteration of Alvarico's first affidavit. <br><br>Appellant asks us to accept Alvarico's allegation of self-defense as narrated in said first affidavit and to reject his subsequent&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; as well as his testimony&nbsp; in&nbsp; court. This we cannot&nbsp; do because the evidence of record clearly shows that&nbsp; Olarte was not killed in self-defense by just one man but had&nbsp; been murdered by three&nbsp; men, among them appellant herein. <br><br>Physical facts obtaining in&nbsp; the&nbsp; record negative the alleged self-defense on the&nbsp; part of&nbsp; Alvarico.&nbsp;&nbsp; The victim suffered a&nbsp; contused wound,&nbsp; 1.5&nbsp; cm.&nbsp; long and&nbsp; extending to the&nbsp; bone,&nbsp; on the right supraorbital ridge, which wound could have been produced by a blunt instrument only.&nbsp; No mention of this was ever made by Alvarico.&nbsp; All he said was that after&nbsp; he succeeded in wresting&nbsp; the bolo&nbsp; from Olarte, he "struck him and was hit twice on his face and then he ran away towards our yard and he fell down and died in our yard"&nbsp; (Exhibit C).&nbsp; According to Dr.&nbsp; Ibe, who performed the necropsy, Olarte's&nbsp; two facial wounds were inflicted when the victim was lying prone&nbsp; on his back and&nbsp; when he was&nbsp; already in a state of shock, produced by the&nbsp; blow on&nbsp; the&nbsp; right eyebrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact, the front part&nbsp; of Olarte's body was clean of blood.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood from the&nbsp; two facial wounds had clotted on the left upper portion of his back.&nbsp; This would not have been the case if said injuries were sustained while Olarte&nbsp; was still on his feet struggling with Alvarico. <br><br>Of course not the whole of Alvarico's testimony merits credence.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; his statement&nbsp; regarding appellant's participation is supported by the nature of Olarte's wounds on the face.&nbsp; Also, the bolo marks on the posts and stairs and the bloodstains&nbsp; (which appear to&nbsp; have been deliberately bedaubed with lingers&nbsp; rather&nbsp; than accidentally spattered in the course of a fight) on the floor and walls of Alvarico's house reveal the truth of his statement that appellant and Elumba had made the necessary preparations in his house to make it appear that Olarte had been, killed there in legitimate self-defense.<br><br>Furthermore, appellant's&nbsp; presence at the scene&nbsp; of the crime during the crucial moment was established by Roel Olarte and Jorge Sericos.&nbsp; Roel, ten year old grandson of the&nbsp; deceased, was washing his&nbsp; shoes at the well&nbsp; near Alvarico's house,&nbsp; when he&nbsp; saw&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; and Elumba conversing with Alvarico who was carrying the deceased's gory bolo.&nbsp; We need not discard Roel's&nbsp; testimony just because he was related to the victim, as appellant would want us to&nbsp; do.&nbsp; His&nbsp; relationship to the deceased did not necessarily make him a&nbsp; biased witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he had really been rehearsed by his&nbsp; mother, as claimed by&nbsp; appellant, then he would not have merely stated that he saw appellant at the scene&nbsp; of the crime, but would have declared outright that&nbsp; he actually saw appellant,&nbsp; Elumba and Alvarico committing the crime. <br><br>The attack on Olarte took place near the Timus river.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time the&nbsp; three&nbsp; assailants,&nbsp; were approaching,&nbsp; to attack Olarte, Jorge Sericos was in a place just across the river.&nbsp; He testified that he saw Elumba&nbsp; Olarte a heavy blow on the right side of a head; that when Olarte fell, Afararico; and appellant&nbsp; helped&nbsp; Elumba&nbsp; in hitting him; and that the-three carried Olarte to Alvarico's house.<br><br>Appellant argues that Sericos could not&nbsp; have seen the commission of the crime&nbsp; because Olarte was allegedly&nbsp; at the downward slbpe-on the farther side of a hill and-was beyond&nbsp; Serico's line of sight. This argument is supported by sketches attached to appellant's brief. But these sketches are based purely on assumptions as to the relative positions of Sericos and Olarte, and are&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; worthless.&nbsp; On the other hand the commissioner's report states that&nbsp; from the place where Sericos was (indicated as point C in the sketch attached to the report), could be seen the&nbsp; place where Olarte was sittingon&nbsp; a pile of coconut husks (point B).&nbsp; Sericos was positive that he saw the beginning of the attack on Olarte.&nbsp; With such an exciting scene? being enacted before his very eyes, it&nbsp; is only&nbsp; to be expected that Sericos' would have sought&nbsp; a vantage point from where he&nbsp; could see better the&nbsp; crime being committed by the three&nbsp; assailants. <br><br>We are convinced beyond reasonable, doubt&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; fully participated and cooperated in&nbsp; the execution of the plot to kill Ladislao Olarte and should therefore be penalized&nbsp; accordingly. <br><br>Wherefore, being supported&nbsp; by the evidence of record and&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appealed judgment&nbsp; is hereby affirmed at appellant's costs. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
