				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners, who were respondents in the court below, seek the review by 
certiorari of the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations (in Case No. 
1108-V) dated September 11, 1959, as amended on September 21, 1959, and of the 
Resolution <em>en banc</em>, denying their motion for reconsideration.
<p>The antecedents are as follows:</p>
<p>In a petition filed in the Court of Industrial Relations '(Case No. 1108-V), 
Francisco Esquivel, Pedro Gabriel, and Pedro de la Paz, sought recovery of 
overtime compensation from the "New Angat-Manila Transportation" and Florencio 
Elchico (as manager of the said transportation business), amounting to 
P20,481.28, and, together with Pacifico Almazar, Lazaro Gutierrez, and Filemon 
de Guzman, for separation pay in this total sum of P10,756.25.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>To the petition, only respondent Elchico filed an answer, alleging that the 
"New Angat-Manila Transportation" was owned, successively, by Matias 
Fernando,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Encarnacion Elchico Vda, de 
Fernando,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Jose Elchico;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> that at the time said petition was filed, 
there was pending in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, testate and intestate 
proceedings where claims against tfre estate of Jose Elchico may he filed; that 
the causes of action which took place as early as 1930, do not survive the 
deceased employer, and even if they do, they were either fictitious of 
unwarranted. As counterclaim, respondent demanded the sum of P2,000.00 as 
attorney's fees. This counterclaim was duly answered and denied by 
petitioner.</p>
<p>In a decision rendered on September 12, 1959, the trial judge ordered the 
respondent to pay the overtime compensation demanded by petitioners, except the 
claim of Pedro Gabriel which, was dismissed, and separation pay in. amounts 
equivalent to <em>one month</em> salary for every year of service of each. This 
decision was later amended on September 21, 1959 in the sense that the basis for 
the computation of the separation fcay was <em>one-half month</em> salary 
instead of one-month salary. The court examiner was thus directed to make the 
necessary computation of the amounts due the petitioners, and submit the. 
corresponding report for proper adjudication. Copy of the original decision was 
received by counsel for respondents on September 17, while the amended decision 
was received by said respondents on September 21.</p>
<p>On September 22, 1959, respondents' counsel filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the "Decision dated September 12, 1959, as modified by the 
Amended Decision dated September 21, 1959". This motion, however, was denied by 
resolution of the court <em>en banc</em>, allegedly for having been filed beyond 
the 5-day reglementary period. It is this resolution, as well as the 
aforementioned decision, as amended, that respondents ask us to review by means 
of the instant petition for certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p>Herein petitioners raise several points against the actions taken by the 
respondent Court, among which is the question of jurisdiction. This we find to 
be decisive in the case at bar.</p>
<p>In the case of Price Stabilization Corporation vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this Court 
declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Analyzing these cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the 
underlying principle, it will be noted in all of them, though not stated in 
express terms, is that where the employer-employee relationship is still 
existing mr is sought to be reestablished because of its wrongful severance (as 
where the employee seeks reinstatement), the Court of Industrial Relations has 
jurisdiction over all claims arising out of, or jn connection with employment, 
such as. those related to the Minimum Wage Law and the Eight-Hour Labor Law. 
After the termination of the relationship and no reinstatement is sought, such 
claims become mere money claims, and come within the jurisdiction of the regular 
courts.",</p></blockquote>
<p>and held that such principle shall govern all cases of the same nature.</p>
<p>In the instant case, respondent-employees, who were dismissed from 
petitioners' employ in 1958, do not aspire for reinstatement to their former 
positions, but merely seek recovery of compensation allegedly still due and 
owing them; as a matter of fact, their petition specified that it was only for 
"collection of overtime pay and termination pay". Following the ruling laid down 
in the <em>PRISCO</em> case (<em>supra</em>), therefore, this case should 
properly be filed in the regular courts or probate court, as the case may 
be.</p>
<p>With the above consideration, we find no necessity to pass upon the other 
errors assigned by the petitioners.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision, as amended, rendered by the respondent Court, as 
well as its resolution <em>en banc</em> appealed from, are hereby set aside, 
without prejudice to the refiling of the appropriate action in the proper court. 
No pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Gutierrez David, Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision and resolution set aside.</em></p>

issues raised in the present case. </p>
