				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 20,&nbsp; 1926,&nbsp;&nbsp; the heirs of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Gregorio Aouesta (present plaintiffs)&nbsp;&nbsp; filed a case for reivindicacion against Brigido Losanto&nbsp;&nbsp; (father of present defendants),&nbsp;&nbsp; which was&nbsp; decided against Lozanto by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate&nbsp; on March 8, 1928, Upon appeal by Lozanto, the Supreme&nbsp; Court affirmed the judgment on April 21, 1950. As five years had elapsed without the plaintiffs having obtained, the&nbsp; necessary execution,&nbsp;&nbsp; they instituted on .September 3,&nbsp; 1937,&nbsp;&nbsp; an action to enforce&nbsp;&nbsp; said judgment in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate,&nbsp;&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No,&nbsp; 854,&nbsp;&nbsp; which was disposed of in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiffs on March 15,&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp;&nbsp; the dispositive part of the&nbsp; decision reading as follows: <br><div align="justify"><blockquote>“POR TANTO, se dicta sentencia, ordernando la ejecucion de la referida sentencia en la causa civil No. 487 en cuanto a la entrega del terreno en cuestion en dicha causa, entendiendose que dicha entrega debe verificarse previo pago por los demendantes al demandado de la suma de P221.74; sin pronunciamiento en cuento a las costas.” </blockquote>&nbsp;This decision was likewise&nbsp; not executed within the&nbsp; statutory period of five&nbsp; years, However,&nbsp;&nbsp; in November, 1946,&nbsp; Brigido Lozanto received from the&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; the amount .mentioned therein.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs were&nbsp; net able tc&nbsp; tales possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in question because&nbsp; the present defendants refused to vacate&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp;&nbsp; the plaintiffs instituted in the&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; court of Cataingan? Masbate,&nbsp;&nbsp; on December 14, 1946, on-action for unlawful detainer which was however dismissed at their instance&nbsp; to give way to&nbsp; another action for possession and ownership filed by them en August 5, 1949&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate&nbsp; against the&nbsp; present defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs'&nbsp;&nbsp; right of action was premised on. the allegation of ownership in virtue&nbsp; of the decision in Civil Case No,. 854. In their answer the defendants alleged in substance&nbsp; that the&nbsp; decision in Case No. 854 had lapsed and&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; oould no longer be enforced against them who,&nbsp; moreover,&nbsp; were&nbsp; not parties to said case;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they not only had acquired ownership ever&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in question as a result of plaintiffs failure&nbsp; to enforce&nbsp; their judgment within the&nbsp; statutory period but also had acquired title&nbsp; to and over said land by acquisitive prescription by actual, continuous,&nbsp; open, notorious, hostile,&nbsp; peaceful,&nbsp; public and uninterrupted possession for more&nbsp; than forty years. The&nbsp; case was submitted for&nbsp; decision upon the&nbsp; following stipulation of facts;<br><br>&nbsp;"Come now the plaintiffs and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants by their undersigned attorneys, and to this Honorable&nbsp; Court respectfully submit the&nbsp; above&nbsp; case&nbsp; for&nbsp; decision on the following stipulation of&nbsp; facts In the&nbsp; above entitled case&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;"1.&nbsp;&nbsp; That on September 20,&nbsp; 1926,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of the&nbsp; late Gregorio Acuesta,&nbsp; the present plaintiffs, filed a case&nbsp; for re-ivindicacion against Brigido Lozanto,&nbsp;&nbsp; the father of&nbsp; the herein defendants which was decided against Brigido Lozonto by the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate&nbsp; on March 8,&nbsp; 1928. This decision was&nbsp; appealed by the defendant Brigido Lozanto&nbsp; and was affirmed by the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court on April 21,&nbsp; 1930, copies of the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Masbate&nbsp; and the Supreme Court marked&nbsp; as&nbsp; annex 'A'&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; 'B'&nbsp;&nbsp; respectively are herewith enclosed and made&nbsp; part of this stipulation.<br>&nbsp;<br>“2.&nbsp; That no execution was issued to en force&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment of&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court before&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; five&nbsp; years period elapsed&nbsp; so&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiffs on September&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1937,&nbsp;&nbsp; filed an action to enforce&nbsp; the judgment of&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp;&nbsp; Court which was docketed as Case Mo. 854 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Masbate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was decided in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiffs on March 15, 1940,&nbsp;&nbsp; but this decision was not also executed within the&nbsp; five years period provided by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; on November, 1946, Brigido Lozanto received from the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount mentioned in the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment of 1930,&nbsp; as well as of 1940,&nbsp; above mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy of the&nbsp; judgment of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Masbate&nbsp; in Case No.&nbsp; 854 is herewith marked as annex “C'&nbsp; made port of this stipulation.<br><br>&nbsp;"3.&nbsp; That when the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; tried to&nbsp; take possession of the land,&nbsp;&nbsp; after paying Brigido Lozanto as stated above, the present defendants in this instant case&nbsp;&nbsp; (Case No. 212), namely:&nbsp; Severe,&nbsp; Celestino and Eugenio,&nbsp; all surnamed Lozanto refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; surrender the pos­session of&nbsp; the land claiming ownership of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; by acquisitive prescription because the&nbsp; judgment above mentioned have&nbsp; elapsed. As a consequence,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; present plaintiffs filed a case of unlawful detainer in the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court of Cataingan,&nbsp; Masbate,&nbsp; on December 14, 1946,&nbsp; which at the&nbsp; instance&nbsp; of the plaintiffs the&nbsp; same was dismissed on February, 1947&nbsp; to give way to&nbsp; the present action for possession and ownership which was filed on August 3, 1949. Copy of the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp;&nbsp; court of Cataingan, Masbate is herewith marked as&nbsp; annex 'D'&nbsp;&nbsp; and made&nbsp; a part of this stipulation.<br><br>&nbsp;"4.&nbsp; That during all the&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp; that the above mentioned cases Nos,&nbsp; 487,&nbsp; 854,&nbsp;&nbsp; 44&nbsp; (in the justice of the peace&nbsp; court), and the present case&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; 212,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case were never placed in possession of&nbsp; the land in question.<br>&nbsp;<br>“5.&nbsp; That the land in question in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 212,&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; same land in question in case Nos.&nbsp; 487,&nbsp; 854&nbsp; and No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 44 of the&nbsp;&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp;&nbsp; court,</blockquote>&nbsp;On. December 15, 1950,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First instance&nbsp; of Masbate rendered a decision with the following dispositive part:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHEREFORE,&nbsp; from all&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; conclusion is inevitable&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiffs did not acquire the&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; in question by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment of 1940, the&nbsp; basis of the&nbsp; action of the&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; and therefore, the plaintiffs have no right to bring the&nbsp; present action against the present defendants, who as aforesaid were not parties to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; suit which gave rise&nbsp; to the&nbsp; judgment of 1940 (Sec,&nbsp; 44,&nbsp;&nbsp; par.&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Rule&nbsp;&nbsp; 39&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules of&nbsp; Court;&nbsp; Acasic&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Albao,&nbsp; 10 Phil.,&nbsp;&nbsp; 410;&nbsp; Rabino&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Ravida,&nbsp; 14 Phil.,&nbsp;&nbsp; 704;&nbsp; Martinez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Diza,&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 Phil.,&nbsp; 498;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cho&nbsp; Chun Chao&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Garcia,&nbsp;&nbsp; 47 Phil,,&nbsp; 530;&nbsp; Razote&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Razote,&nbsp; 49 Phil.,&nbsp; 181;&nbsp; Provincia del Santisimo Nombre&nbsp; de Jesus <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Conrad,&nbsp; 59 Phil.,&nbsp;&nbsp; 503;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Lilius vs, Manila Railroad Co.,&nbsp;&nbsp; 62 Phil., 56)&nbsp; and this Court has no other alternative&nbsp; than to dismiss this case with costs&nbsp; against the&nbsp; plaintiffs."&nbsp;&nbsp; From this&nbsp; decision the&nbsp; plaintiffs have appealed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The lower court sustained the proposition that plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; action is one for&nbsp; the enforcement of the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment in Case No. 854.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our opinion this is erroneous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While. the&nbsp;&nbsp; complaint mentions&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision in Case&nbsp; No,&nbsp; 854,&nbsp;&nbsp; the purpose obviously was not to enforce&nbsp; it but merely to set it forth as a basis for or evidence&nbsp; of plaintiffs' ownership;&nbsp; and this is clear from the&nbsp; allegation in the&nbsp; complaint to&nbsp; the effect that the&nbsp; defendants are "three&nbsp; of the children of Brigido Lozanto from whom the&nbsp; plaintiffs acquired the land above-described by virtue&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; rendered by this Honorable&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Masbate&nbsp; in Civil Case Mo. 854",&nbsp; and also from the allegtion that "pursuant to the&nbsp; tenor of the&nbsp; said decision the plaintiffs paid Brigido Lozanto the&nbsp; sum of P221.74 for the&nbsp; coconut trees planted by him on the&nbsp; said land, after which,&nbsp; on November 11,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Brigido Lozanto delivered the possession of the land above&nbsp; described to the herein plaintiffs,"<br><br>As a matter of fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was no need for any action to enforce&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision in Case Mo, 854,&nbsp; because Brigido Lozanto had voluntarily accepted from the plaintiffs the payment ordered therein,&nbsp; and there&nbsp; is nothing in the&nbsp; stipulation of facts&nbsp; to&nbsp; show that Lozanto had refused or failed to perform his obligation under said decision; the&nbsp; stipulation merely reciting that the defendants had refused to surrender possession of the land under claim of ownership by acquisitive prescription through lapse of judgment.<br><br>What has been stated is sufficient for a reversal of&nbsp; the appealed decision and a judgment in plaintiffs'&nbsp;&nbsp; favor. In. the interest of equity, however,&nbsp; in view of the allegation in the answer that the defendants have&nbsp; acquired ownership through adverse possession for more&nbsp; than forty years, and it being agreed that the plaintiffs were never in occupancy,&nbsp; the&nbsp; case will be,&nbsp; as it is hereby so ordered, remanded to the&nbsp; court below for&nbsp; the ventilation of the defendants' claim of ownership by adverse possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pronounce­ment as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., and <i>Endencia,</i> JJ., </i>concur.</div></div>
