				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Ponciano Primero is&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of a riceland situated in the barrio, of San Juan, municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gen, Trias,&nbsp; province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civite,&nbsp; containing&nbsp; an&nbsp; area&nbsp; of 27,837 square meters, with Torrens title registered in the Registry of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; for&nbsp; the province of&nbsp; Cavite, while respondent Sinforoso&nbsp; Quion is his tenant in&nbsp; said land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Desiring&nbsp; to lease said&nbsp; riceland to&nbsp; one Porfirio&nbsp; Potente for the purpose of. raising thereon Zacate&nbsp; (a species of grass for horses' feed), on March 3, 1956, petitioner served a written notice thereof to&nbsp; respondent and requested&nbsp; him&nbsp; to vacate the premises, but the latter refused to do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 7, 1956, the petitioner&nbsp; executed the contract of lease&nbsp; in favor of Porflrio Potente, but the respondent still continued in. the land thereby hindering its delivery to the lessea, hence the petitioner filed with the Court of Agrarian Relations the petition under consideration to&nbsp; secure an order&nbsp; directing' the respondent to vacate the premises in question so that it&nbsp; may&nbsp; be delivered to&nbsp; the lessee.&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; summons, the respondent filed his answer to the petition and on March 20, 1956,&nbsp; moved for the dismissal of the petition on the ground&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that&nbsp; it states&nbsp; no cause&nbsp; of action, the facts stated therein not being constitutive&nbsp; of&nbsp; any of the causes for the&nbsp; dispossession&nbsp; of a&nbsp; tenant enumerated in section 50 of Republic Act No. 1199;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that under section 49 of the same Act,&nbsp; no&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; dispossessed&nbsp; of his holding&nbsp; except for any of the causes enumerated in section&nbsp; 50&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Act, and&nbsp; ('6)&nbsp; that under section 9 of the same&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; the lease of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in&nbsp; question&nbsp; did not&nbsp; of itself&nbsp; extinguish the relationship between the&nbsp; respondent as&nbsp; tenant and&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner as landowner.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due hearing, the motion was grunted,&nbsp; Executive Judge Guillermo S.&nbsp; Santos ruling as follows: <br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; that the petition states no cause of action—because petitioner seeks the dispossession of respondent-tenant&nbsp; on a ground which is not one of the causes recognized by law.&nbsp; As a rule, dispossession of a tenant in an agricultural land&nbsp; can only be "allowed for any of the causes enumerated in&nbsp; Sec. 50&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rep, Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1199. Lease of&nbsp; a holding&nbsp; to another person who will convert it to&nbsp; a zacatal is not one&nbsp; of those grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; is the conversion of the holding into a zacatal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason advanced by&nbsp; petitioner is without merit." </blockquote>Thereupon,&nbsp; petitioner appealed- from&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of dis- missal, and&nbsp; in this&nbsp; instance claims (1)&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; has the right to dispossess .his tenant in&nbsp; case he&nbsp; leases&nbsp; his&nbsp; land for purposes of converting it into a ZACATAL; (2)&nbsp; that the lessee Potente, as new landholder,&nbsp; has&nbsp; the right to employ a man of his choice in the Zacatal; and (3) that Zacate (horses' feed)&nbsp; is not&nbsp; an&nbsp; agricultural product within the purview of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1199. <br><br>Carefully&nbsp; considered, the&nbsp; question&nbsp; involved in this case is simply whether,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts stated in&nbsp; the petition, the&nbsp; petitioner has right to secure from, the Court of Agrarian Relations&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; eject&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; tenant from the riceland held&nbsp; in tenancy by him only because said land was leased to one Porfirio Potente who will convert the same&nbsp; into&nbsp; a Zacatal,&nbsp; and said&nbsp; respondent refused&nbsp;&nbsp; to vacate it thereby hampering its delivery to the&nbsp; lessee. <br><br>The controlling law on&nbsp; the case&nbsp; are sections 9, 49 and 50&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1199, which read&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 9. <i>Severance&nbsp; of Relationship</i>.—The tenancy&nbsp; relationship is extinguished&nbsp; by the voluntary surrender&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; by, or&nbsp; the death or incapacity of, the tenant, but his&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; or the members of .&nbsp; his immediate farm&nbsp; household may continue to work the land until the&nbsp; close&nbsp; of the agricultural year.&nbsp; The&nbsp; expiration of the period of the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; as fixed by the&nbsp; parties, and the sale or alienation of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; do not of themselves extinguish the&nbsp; relationship.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the latter case, the purchaser&nbsp; or transferee shall assume&nbsp; the rights and obligations of the former-landholder&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation&nbsp; to the&nbsp; tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tn case of&nbsp; death&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; landholder,&nbsp; his heir or heirs shall&nbsp; likewise assume his&nbsp; rights&nbsp; and obligations. <br><br>"Sec. 49. <i>Ejectment,&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tenant.</i>—Notwithstanding&nbsp; any agreement or provision of law as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; period, in all cases&nbsp; where land devoted to any agricultural&nbsp; purpose is&nbsp; held under any system&nbsp; of tenancy, the tenant shall not be dispossessed of his&nbsp; holdings except&nbsp; for any of&nbsp; the&nbsp; causes hereinafter enumerated&nbsp; and&nbsp; only&nbsp; after&nbsp; the same&nbsp; has been proved before, and the dispossession is authorized by, the&nbsp; court.<br><br>"Sec. 50. <i>Causes&nbsp; for the Dispossession of a&nbsp; Tenant.</i>—Any of&nbsp; the&nbsp; following&nbsp; shall he a sufficient cause for the dispossession&nbsp; of a tenant from his holdings:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; The bona&nbsp; fide intention of the&nbsp; landholder&nbsp; to cultivate&nbsp; the land himself personally or through the employment of farm machinery and&nbsp; implements:&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *. <br>(b)&nbsp; When the tenant violates or fails to comply with any of&nbsp; the terms and conditions of the contract or any of the provisions of this Act: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this subsection shall not apply&nbsp; when the&nbsp; tenant has substantially&nbsp; complied with the contract&nbsp; or v/ith the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Act.<br>(c) The tenant's failure to pay the&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; rental or to deliver the landholder's share: <i>Provided, however</i>, That (his shall not&nbsp; apply when the tenant's failure is caused by a fortuitous event or force majeure. <br>(d) When the tenant uses the land&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; purpose other&nbsp; than that specified by agreement of&nbsp; the parties. <br>(e) When a&nbsp; share-tenant fails&nbsp; to follow those proven farm practices which will contribute towards the proper care of the land&nbsp; and increased agricultural production. <br>(f) When&nbsp; the tenant through&nbsp; negligence permits serious in jury to&nbsp; the land which will impair its productive capacity. <br>(g) Conviction by a competent court of a&nbsp; tenant or any member ox his immediate family or farm household of&nbsp; a&nbsp; crime against the landholder or a member of&nbsp; his immediate family." </blockquote></blockquote>Under the foregoing&nbsp; clear provisions of law,&nbsp; we&nbsp; find that the agrarian court committed no reversible error when ii: dismissed the petition, firstly,&nbsp; because under the aforequoted section&nbsp; 9 of Rep.&nbsp; Act 1199,&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; lease entered into by the petitioner and Porfirio&nbsp; Potente did&nbsp; not of itself extinguish the relationship of landlord and tenant between the petitioner&nbsp; and the respondent, and&nbsp; the lessee Potente should assume the obligations of the former landholder, the herein petitioner, in relation to his&nbsp; tenant,&nbsp; the herein,&nbsp; respondent; secondly, because under section 49, a tenant&nbsp; cannot be dispossessed&nbsp; of his&nbsp; holding&nbsp; except&nbsp; for any of the causes enumerated in said section 50, and&nbsp; certainly the lease&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land in&nbsp; question to Potente is&nbsp; not one&nbsp; of those&nbsp; causes for the&nbsp; dispossession&nbsp; of a tenant enumerated in section 50 of the Tenancy Law quoted above. Consequently,&nbsp; we&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; under the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law governing the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the petition under consideration&nbsp; is completely&nbsp; untenable, for once a tenancy&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; is established, the tenant is entitled to security of tenure with right to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; working&nbsp; on&nbsp; arid&nbsp; cultivating the&nbsp; land until he&nbsp; is&nbsp; dispossessed of&nbsp; his&nbsp; holdings&nbsp; for&nbsp; just cause provided&nbsp; by&nbsp; law&nbsp; or the&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; is&nbsp; legally terminated. <br><br>Petitioner contends, however,&nbsp; that sections 9 and 50 of Republic&nbsp; Act 1199 are&nbsp; unconstitutional and void&nbsp; for&nbsp; they are against paragraph 1, section 1 of Article III—Bill of Rights of our Constitution.&nbsp; It is argued that the petitioner has a&nbsp; perfect right to dispossess&nbsp; his&nbsp; tenant because he wants to lease his land to a third person for the purpose of converting it into a ZACATAL&nbsp; and that "the lessee has a perfect right to employ laborers&nbsp; of his own choice and to deny a lessee that right will be tantamount to a deprivation&nbsp; of the right of the owner to&nbsp; lease his land for a better income, for no lessee will&nbsp; enter&nbsp; into&nbsp; a contract of lease of a&nbsp; riceland to&nbsp; convert the same into a ZACATAL if&nbsp; he&nbsp; will be denied the&nbsp; freedom to employ a tenant of his own choice."&nbsp;&nbsp; We find&nbsp; no merit in this contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of law assailed&nbsp; as unconstitutional do not impair the right&nbsp; of the landowner to&nbsp; dispose or&nbsp; alienate his property nor prohibit him to make such transfer or alienation; they only provide that in case of transfer or in case of lease,&nbsp; as in&nbsp; the instant&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenancy relationship between the landowner and his tenant should be preserved in&nbsp; order to insure the&nbsp; well-being of the tenant or protect him from being unjustly dispossessed by the transferee or purchaser of the&nbsp; land; in&nbsp; other words,&nbsp; the purpose of the law in&nbsp; question is to maintain the tenants in the peaceful possession and cultivation&nbsp; of the land or afford them protection against&nbsp; unjustified dismissal from their&nbsp; holdings. Republic Act 1199 is unquestionably a remedial legislation promulgated pursuant to the social justice precepts of the Constitution and in the exercise of the police power of the State to promote the common weal.&nbsp; It is a statute relating to&nbsp; public&nbsp; subjects within the domain&nbsp; of the general legislative powers of the State and. involving the public rights and public welfare of the&nbsp; entire community affected by it. Republic Act 1199, like&nbsp; the previous tenancy laws enacted by our lawmaking body, was passed by Congress&nbsp; in compliance with the constitutional mandates that "the promotion of social justice to insure the well-being and economic security of all the people <i>should be&nbsp; the concern of the State</i>" (Art.&nbsp; II, see. 5)&nbsp; and that&nbsp; "the&nbsp; State&nbsp; shall regulate&nbsp; the relations between landlord and tenant&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; in agriculture&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * *."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; XIV, sec.&nbsp; 6).<br><br>As&nbsp; to&nbsp; the "last question raised by the petitioner, to wit, whether&nbsp; the Zacatal is an agricultural product as contemplated by Act 1199, we find unnecessary to&nbsp; discuss it&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the foregoing conclusion&nbsp; we&nbsp; arrived at, for the true question involved&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; is whether the lease&nbsp; of petitioner's land to Porfirio Potente constitutes just cause for&nbsp; dispossessing the respondent of his holding on the land as tenant thereof. <br><br>Wherefore, finding no error in the order&nbsp; appealed from, the&nbsp; same is hereby affirmed with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; the petitioner-appellant. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Bautdsta Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J. B.&nbsp; L.</i>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; <u style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ</u>.,&nbsp; concur. Order&nbsp; affirmed.</div>
