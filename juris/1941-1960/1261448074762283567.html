				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">To a revindicatory complaint filed in 1950 in the Court of First Instance by 
Nazario Trillana over a parcel of land in Hagonoy, Bulacan, the defendants 
Faustino Manansala et al., set up title through sale and prescription.
<p>Both parties allegedly deriving ownership from the registered owner Marcos 
Bernardo, presented at the hearing:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) Plaintiff—the contract of absolute sale (Exhibit A) executed in 
his favor in June 1948 by Vicenta Bernardo, daughter and the only surviving heir 
of Marcos Bernardo;</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) Defendants—the document Exhibit 1, in tagalog, which is 
translated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right"><em>"Julio 20, 1934-1944</em></p>
<p>I Marcos Bernardo married of legal age and residing at barrio S. Sebastian, 
Hagonoy, Bulacan, P. I. now I own a land (latian) * * * now my above mentioned 
property I mortgage to Mr. Faustino Manansala and Maria Lopez husband and wife 
in the amount of P1,070 beginning today July 20, 1934 until April 1944 and if I 
cannot pay said amount come April 1944 the property I mortgaged is hereby paid 
to Mr. Faustino Manansala and Maria Lopez husband and wife * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>The judge found Exhibit 1 to be a forgery, and rendered judgment for 
plaintiff, saying as to prescription, that even if defendants had possessed the 
land since 1934, they could not acquire by prescription because they had no just 
title, inasmuch as they knew Exhibit 1 was false.</p>
<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals saw differently. It was not convinced of the 
document's (Exhibit 1) falsity, and held that since defendants admittedly took 
possession of the realty in July 1934 pursuant to such document and retained it 
thereafter, the action filed in 1950 was late, inasmuch as more than 15 years of 
adverse possession forfeited the plaintiff's right to recover, if any.</p>
<p>Doubting the legal feasibility of acquiring, thru prescription, land obtained 
under Exhibit 1, we gave due course to the petition for review on certiorari, 
being impressed with counsel's contention that said written document represented 
a contract of antichresis, which may not give rise to acquisitive 
prescription.</p>
<p>Upon a fuller examination of the matter, we are now persuaded that our 
preliminary impressions were justified. The document Exhibit 1, having used the 
words "Isinangla", "sinangla" and "matubos obviously indicated a mortgage, 
which, coupled with delivery of possession of the land to the creditor, amounted 
to antichresis.</p>
<p>And several decisions of this court consistently hold that the antichretic 
creditor cannot ordinarily acquire by prescription the land surrendered to him 
by the debtor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The most that defendants could contend under Exhibit 1 is that it was a sale 
with <em>pacto de retro</em>. Yet no argument is needed to show that, even under 
such contract, prescription does not run during the period of redemption 
(1934-1944).</p>
<p>In this connection we notice the Court of Appeals did not regard the contract 
as a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale. The Court of Appeals declared the agreement 
was a "kaliwaan" or exchange, which according to defendants meant, "after the 
execution of the document we delivered the money, and plaintiff delivers 
possession of the land".. The arrangement however contemplated a subsequent 
"re-exchange" when the owner redeems (matubos) on or before April 1944. Such 
exchange and re-exchange agreed in Exhibit 1, dovetail with an antiehretic 
relationship, which we think was the true agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>It has not escaped our notice that the document says "if I cannot redeem come 
April 1944, the .property I mortgage is hereby paid to Mr. Faustino Manansala". 
But that in our opinion merely authorized Manansala to get the property for 
payment, thru the proceedings prescribed for mortgages. Otherwise the 
stipulation would be open to attack, either as <em>pactum commissorium</em> or 
as against the law. (Arts. 1859 and 1884 Civil Code.)</p>
<p>Now as the contract Exhibit 1 did not divest Marcos Bernardo of ownership of 
the property, his heir Vicenta Bernardo could, and she did, validly convey such 
ownership to Nazario Trillana in 1948, by Exhibit A. Subject of course to the 
rights of the antiehretic creditors, the defendants Manansala et al.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and one will be 
promulgated requiring defendants to deliver the lot to the plaintiff 
(substituted by Candida Cruz, Juana Trillana and Francisco Trillana) upon 
payment by the latter of the amount of Pl,070.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> No interest is to be satisfied, because 
the fruits gathered by the Manansalas are considered as interest; no special 
damages too. Costs against defendants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>
