				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> by Alfonso Montebon on behalf of 
Elpidio S. Cruz, a prisoner at the Iwahig Penal Colony. A similar petition was 
filed with this Court by Felicisima Santiago in the name of the same prisoner 
(Santiago <i>vs</i>. Director of Prisons, 77 Phil., 927), a petition which was 
denied by us in a decision promulgated on January 30, 1947. The ground of the 
first petition was the alleged illegality of one of the prisoner's three 
convictions for <i>estafa</i>. The present application contests the validity of 
the prisoner's recommitment decreed by the Commissioner of Justice of the 
Philippine Executive Commission under date of June 3, 1943, for the unexpired 
portion of his (prisoner's) maximum aggregate sentences in three cases in which 
he had been paroled by the Board of Indeterminate Sentence on June 26, 1941, 
when he still had over five years to serve. The Commissioner of Justice's 
recommitment order was made by virtue of Administrative Order No. 21, dated June 
21, 1942, and approved by the Chairman of the Executive Commission, which read: 
"The Board of Indeterminate Sentence and the Board of Pardons having been 
abolished, the powers, duties and functions thereof shall henceforth be assumed 
and exercised by the Commissioner of Justice."
<p>The petitioner does not reveal the nature of his interest in the prisoner's 
incarceration, or what relation, if any, he has with him. As to the effect on 
this case of our decision 4n the first application, <i>res judicata</i> as an 
inflexible doctrine has been held not to apply in <i>habeas corpus</i> 
proceedings. Still the court in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, it 
has also been held, may give controlling weight to the prior refusal. Such 
discretion was used against the petitioner in Wong Doo <i>vs</i>. United States 
(68 Law. ed., 241), on the ground that the petitioner had had full opportunity 
to offer in the first case proof on the point he raised in the second. By a 
similar criterion and reasoning, that principle might be brought into play here. 
No reason whatever is shown why the petitioner did not question in the first 
petition the legality of the recommitment order of the Commissioner of Justice. 
Nevertheless, we choose not to dispose of this application on a point of 
procedural technicality, but will decide it on the merits.</p>
<p>The authority of the Commissioner of Justice under the then existing 
government, laws, and military, executive and administrative orders, to take 
over the powers, functions and duties of the Board of Indeterminate Sentence, is 
beyond dispute. In an international sense it matters not how the Commissioner of 
Justice was vested with that authority. For most purposes the government of the 
occupant is likely to exercise the lawmaking function through decrees or 
regulations emanating from a military source; and these become as effective in 
operation as though they were expressed in statutory enactments. As a matter of 
practical expediency the occupant may be disposed to utilize certain existing 
agencies of that government and to suspend the operation of others. (III Hyde, 
International Law, 2d ed., l883.) This Court has held that the Philippine 
Executive Commission was a <i>de facto</i> government, in Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. 
Valdes Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 113).</p>
<p>As to whether the Indeterminate Sentence Act was in force during the 
occupation, the answer is in the affirmative. A proclamation of the Commander in 
Chief of the Japanese forces of January 2, 1942, directed that "so far as the 
military administration permits, all the laws now in force in the Commonwealth, 
as well as executive and judicial institutions, shall continue to be effective 
for the time being as in the past." This was nothing more than a confirmation of 
the well-known rule of the Law of Nations that municipal laws, as 
contra-distinguished from laws of political nature, are not abrogated by a 
change of sovereignty. (Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, 
<i>supra</i>.) The Indeterminate Sentence Law is not a political law. It does 
not affect political relations. In fact, it is a part of the Commonwealth's 
criminal and penal system directly related to the punishment of crime and the 
maintenance of public peace and order, which Article 43 of Section III of the 
Hague Regulations of 1907 compels the belligerent occupant to take all steps in 
his power to reestablish and insure as far as possible.</p>
<p>But the petitioner takes the position that the recommitment of which he 
complains was not such an act of the belligerent occupant as should be accorded 
respect and recognition by the Commonwealth Government, now Republic of the 
Philippines, after the cessation of the enemy occupation. We have only to refer 
to the Co Kim Cham case for a precedent that refutes this contention. In that 
case it was said, "It is a legal truism in political and international law that 
all acts and proceedings of the legislative, executive and judicial departments 
of a <i>de facto</i> government are good and valid." We held that in consonance 
with the theory of <i>jus postliminii</i> in international law, such acts and 
proceedings remained good and valid after the liberation or re-occupation of the 
Philippines by the American and Filipino forces. The decision cited Hall's work 
on International Law, 7th ed., p. 518, according to which the fact that the 
territory which has been occupied by an enemy comes again into the power of its 
legitimate government or sovereignty, does not, except in a very few cases, wipe 
out the effects of acts done by the invader, which for one reason or another it 
is within his competence to do.</p>
<p>Enforcement of the criminal law by the forces of occupation is not only valid 
and binding; it is imposed on them as a high obligation by the Hague Convention, 
as we have pointed out. The reason underlying this requirement is thus stated in 
Williams <i>vs</i>. Bruffy (96 U. S., 176, 192), cited in Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. 
Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, <i>supra</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'The existence of a state of insurrection and war did not loosen the bonds 
of society, or do away with civil government or the regular administration of 
the laws. Order was to be preserved, police regulations maintained, crime 
prosecuted, property protected, contracts enforced, marriages celebrated, 
estates settled, and the transfer and descent of property regulated, precisely 
as in the time of peace. No one, that we are aware of, seriously questions the 
validity of judicial or legislative acts in the insurrectionary states touching 
these and kindred subjects, where they were not hostile in their purpose or mode 
of enforcement to the authority of the national government, and did not impair 
the rights of citizens under the Constitution.' The same doctrine has been 
asserted in numerous other cases."</p></blockquote>
<p>The petition is denied without costs.</p><i>Paras, Pablo, Bengzon,</i> and 
<i>Padilla, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The decision on this case hinges on the question raised by petitioner as to 
the validity of the recommitment of prisoner Elpidio S. Cruz, as decreed by the 
Commissioner of Justice of the Philippine Executive Commission on June 3, 1943, 
to serve the unexpired portion of the maximum aggregate sentences in three cases 
in which said prisoner had been paroled by the Board of Indeterminate Sentence 
on June 26, 1941.</p>
<p>The Board of Indeterminate Sentence was abolished by virtue of Administrative 
Order No. 21, issued on June 21, 1942, with the approval of the Chairman of the 
Philippine Executive Commission under the Japanese regime. Under said 
administrative order, the powers, duties and functions of the Board of 
Indeterminate Sentence and the Board of Pardons had been transferred to the 
Commissioner of Justice of said Executive Commission.</p>
<p>The majority decided to uphold the validity of Administrative Order No. 21, 
dated June 21, 1942, and of the order of recommitment issued by the Commissioner 
of Justice on June 3, 1943, on the strength of the majority decision in the case 
of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 113).</p>
<p>For the reasons alleged in our dissenting opinions in said case of Co Kim 
Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, and others where the same questions 
had been raised, we are constrained to dissent. We are of opinion that both 
Administrative Order No. 21 and the order of the Commissioner of Justice on June 
3, 1943, are null and void under a proclamation of General MacArthur, and under 
the provisions of our Constitution. As we have explained in our concurring 
opinion in Laurel <i>vs</i>. Misa (77 Phil., 856), no governmental act shall be 
recognized as valid unless made under the authority of our people, on whom, 
according to our fundamental law, sovereignty resides exclusively. The acts of 
the Philippine Executive Commission and of the Commissioner of Justice during 
enemy occupation having been made under the exclusive authority of the Japanese 
Imperial Government should not be given any validity.</p>For all the foregoing, 
we vote for the immediate release of prisoner Elpidio S. Cruz.</div>
