				<H3>PARSONS HARDWARE CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND PARSONS WORKERS & EMPLOYEES UNION, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 19,1939, respondent Parsons Workers &amp; Employees Union addressed a six-point petition to the management of petitioner here, Parsons  Hardware Co., Inc., praying, among others,  for a general increase  in the salaries  and wages of its employees  and workers.  The petition was denied and the Union thereafter sought the intervention of the Department of Labor. Efforts at amicable settlement failed, and on  August  11, 1939, the Secretary of Labor certified the case to the Court of Industrial Relations for arbitration and settlement,  under the  provisions of section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 103. Upon the question of the general increase in the  salaries and wages of the employees and laborers of the petitioner here (the only question left unadjudged in the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations of August  24, 1939), evidence was submitted by both parties and a thorough examination of the financial condition of the company was ordered.  On December 28,1939, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered its supplementary  decision, the dispositive part of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>"After a careful consideration of all the facts submitted and the circumstances of the case the Court holds and so decides  that the minimum wage  of the workers should be fixed at P1.25 daily and P30.00  a month for the monthly salaried  employees.  The  respondent  Parsons  Hardware<br><br>Company, Inc., is, therefore, hereby ordered to raise accordingly the  minimum pay of all its employees  and laborers effective January 2, 1940."</blockquote><br>This decision was, after several incidents, finally complied with by the company with respect to twenty-three of its laborers.  On September 23, 1940, respondent Union sought the application of the raise to sixteen laborers of the company who were not paid the minimum wage specified therein, and on December 5, 1940, another motion to the same effect was filed in behalf of two more laborers.  The Court of Industrial Relations by its order of February 3, 1941, resolved both motions favorably to the respondent.  Petitioner now  challenges this order on two  grounds:  (1)  that the eighteen employees and laborers concerned were not members  of the Union on May 29,1939 when the Union's petition was  submitted to the company and, therefore, they are not entitled to the benefits of the minimum  wage fixed by the decision of the court; and (2) that before a minimum wage may  be made applicable to all employees and laborers, an order of the Court to that  effect must have  been issued pursuant to the  provisions of section 5  of Commonwealth Act  No.  103, and not  under section 4 thereof,  as in the instant case.<br><br>Upon the first ground urged by petitioner, even assuming that  the eighteen laborers were not members  of the Union at the time  its petition for a general increase in salaries was submitted, we are of the opinion and so hold that as they are laborers of the company they are entitled to the increase. The  order of the  Court of Industrial Relations raising the minimum  wage  of laborers  and employees  of  the  herein petitioner applies to "all its employees and laborers" without distinction as to whether they are or they are not members of the respondent Union.  It has to be so, because to accord such increase only to members of the Union would constitute an unjust  and unwarranted  discrimination against the non-members. Upon petitioner's second ground, we have more than once said:<br><br><blockquote>"Under the provisions of section 5, of Act 103, minimum wages are determinate in reference to a given industry or given locality, which  should be of general application and have  the force and effect  of law,  after  approval by the President of the Philippines.  This section however, does not contemplate the arbitration and settlement of industrial or agricultural disputes causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout, and  is designed merely to provide for a workable device whereby a  scheme of minimum  wage or share for laborers or tenants in a given industry or locality may be evolved, whenever  conditions therein warrant.<br><br>"If an industrial dispute between  an employer and its employees causing or  likely  to  cause a strike or lockout arises from differences as  regards a minimum wage, the Court of Industrial Relations would be without authority to take cognizance of the dispute for arbitration and settlement  unless the President of the Philippines, under section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, directs it to investigate and study all pertinent facts related to the industry concerned,  with a view to determining the  necessity and fairness of fixing a minimum wage which shall apply generally to all the employees engaged in such industry.  To adopt such a narrow construction would be to set at naught the plenary powers conferred upon the Court to  enable  it to settle all questions, matters, controversies or disputes arising between, and or affecting employers  and employees and to frustrate the very objective of the law, namely, to create an instrumentality through which the intervention of the Government could be made effective in order to prevent non-pacific methods in  the determination of industrial or  agricultural disputes.  It is fundamental that the intention and policy of the National Assembly, as expressed in the enactment, should be effectuated, and the  Act  should  receive a construction that will lead  to this result."  (International Hardwood and Veneer Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Pangil Federation of Labor, G. R. No. 47178, Nov. 25,1940; Antamok Gold Fields Mining Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of Industrial Relations et al., G. R.
