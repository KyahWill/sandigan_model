				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Cadastral&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; L.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; (G.L.R.O.)&nbsp; Cad. Rec. No. 284, a petition was, on February 23, 1956,&nbsp; filed by Gabino&nbsp; Bachoco in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Occidental Negros,&nbsp; asking for the&nbsp; reconstitution of the Original&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; of Title No. 25977 issued in the name of Juana Montinola for lot No. 106 of the Sagay Cadastre on the basis of the decree&nbsp; of registration entered in&nbsp; that case, the reconstitution to be made&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with Republic Act No. 26 from a copy of&nbsp; said decree on file in the office of the Register&nbsp; of Deeds.&nbsp; The petition alleged. among other things, that the lot in question was adjudged to Juana Montinola in said cadastral case on May 31, 1923 and the corresponding&nbsp; original&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title therefor&nbsp; (OCT No.&nbsp; 25977)&nbsp; was subsequently issued in her name pursuant&nbsp; to the decree of registration issued by the Chief of the Land Registration Office on December 7, 1928; that Juana Montinola was married&nbsp; to Nicolas Batusing and&nbsp; upon her death she left four children with him&nbsp; as her only heirs, one of whom was Cresencia Batusing;&nbsp; that Cresencia Batusing's share in the lot in&nbsp; question was by her&nbsp; conveyed to petitioner through&nbsp; a deed of&nbsp; sale dated January 17, 1925 and acknowledged before a notary public; that due to the loss or destruction of the original certificate of title to the lot as well&nbsp; as the owner's&nbsp; duplicate copy thereof,&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed in question had remained unregistered; and&nbsp; that—to quote from the petition—"it is&nbsp; the&nbsp; desire of petitioner that&nbsp; the said original certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title be reconstituted so that, not only may he then be able to register his deed of sale affecting&nbsp; the portion of&nbsp; Cresencia Batusing,&nbsp; but that he be&nbsp; able&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate of title covering&nbsp; his portion of&nbsp; said&nbsp; lot No.&nbsp; 106."<br><br>As provided&nbsp; in&nbsp; Republic Act No. 26, which is the law invoked&nbsp; by&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; the petition was set for hearing with&nbsp; notice to interested parties, and in due time Ignacia Esperancilla and Tomasa Esperancilla,&nbsp; children of Cresencia Batusing, appeared&nbsp; and opposed the petition,&nbsp; claiming that they had&nbsp; no knowledge&nbsp; of the existence of&nbsp; the deed alleged to have been executed by their&nbsp; late mother and that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; any event, the said&nbsp; deed, which was alleged&nbsp; ta have&nbsp; been executed more than three years before the issuance of the decree of registration on December 7, 1928, was ineffective and did not&nbsp; convey to petitioner any interest which would entitled him to ask for&nbsp; the reconstitution of the certificate&nbsp; of title.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing, the court,&nbsp;&nbsp; having found&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; to be as alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition, ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; register&nbsp; of deeds&nbsp; of the province&nbsp; to reconstitute the&nbsp; original&nbsp; certificate of title (No.&nbsp; 25977)&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot&nbsp; in question,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner's duplicate of&nbsp; said&nbsp; certificate, on the basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; rendered in the cadastral case and the decree issued&nbsp; by the General Land Registration&nbsp; Office. And the&nbsp; court further ordered that once the&nbsp; reconstitution had been accomplished, a second owner's duplicate&nbsp; certificate of title&nbsp; be issued to petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; But on a motion for reconsideration on&nbsp; the grounds (1)&nbsp; that the alleged sale was ineffective as&nbsp; against a decree of registration subsequently issued and&nbsp; (2) that as the certificate of title was not&nbsp; lost in petitioner's&nbsp; possession, the&nbsp;&nbsp; reconstituted owner's duplicate&nbsp; certificate of title should not be delivered to him,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court reconsidered its order&nbsp; and denied the petition for reconstitution.<br><br>Appealing from the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; denial, petitioner&nbsp; raises various questions; but&nbsp; under our view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case not all of them need be considered.<br><br>Under Republic Act No. 26, a petition for the reconstitution&nbsp; of a lost&nbsp; or destroyed original&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title for registered land may be&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the Court of First Instance "by the&nbsp; registered owner,&nbsp; his&nbsp; assigns or&nbsp; any person having an&nbsp; interest in the&nbsp; property."&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner claims&nbsp; to have such interest,&nbsp; and as the&nbsp; validity of the claim is disputed,&nbsp; it would be most convenient&nbsp; for the proper resolution of that claim that the missing certificate of title be first reproduced.&nbsp; Insofar,&nbsp; therefore, as&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; merely asks for the reconstitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; original certificate of title, we&nbsp; can see no reason why his petition may not be granted, and, as a matter of fact on page 23 of the&nbsp; record on&nbsp; appeal, there is an allegation, which has not&nbsp; been challenged,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; the&nbsp; oppositors in open court had expressly manifested that they were not opposing the reconstitution of the&nbsp; title of Juana Montinola and that what they were opposing was the delivery of said title&nbsp; to petitioner&nbsp; for him to hold&nbsp; and possess1&nbsp; once it was reconstituted.<br><br>It appears, nowever, that it is not merely the reconstitution&nbsp; of Juana&nbsp; Montinola's original&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title that petitioner wants.&nbsp; For as already stated, the petition avers&nbsp; that&nbsp; he wants&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; reconstituted so that he&nbsp; may&nbsp; have the deed in his favor&nbsp; registered and secure for himself a certificate&nbsp; of title covering his portion of the lot in question, and in his brief he also prays that&nbsp; the previous&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the court authorizing&nbsp; the reconstitution of&nbsp; the original certificate and the issuance to him&nbsp; of the second owner's&nbsp; duplicate thereof&nbsp; be carried out, all of which&nbsp; would involve a material change in&nbsp; the original certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title,&nbsp; a change which,&nbsp; not being consented to by the other parties whose interest&nbsp; will be affected thereby, cannot be authorized under the summary proceedings for reconstitution prescribed in Republic Act No.&nbsp; 26.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reconstitution of a lost&nbsp; or destroyed certificate of title under that&nbsp; Act is limited&nbsp; to the reconstitution of the certificate&nbsp; as&nbsp; it stood at the time of its loss&nbsp; or destruction&nbsp; and should not be stretched to include changes which alter&nbsp; or affect the&nbsp; title&nbsp; of the registered&nbsp; owner A change of that nature, specially&nbsp; when&nbsp; urged on the basis of a disputed deed and opposed by other parties in interest, raises an issue which should be ventilated and decided in an ordinary action.<br><br>And&nbsp; it may be well&nbsp; to&nbsp; state here that not even the proceedings authorized&nbsp; in section 112 of the Land Registration&nbsp; Act could be availed of for the end which appellant has in view, for such proceedings&nbsp; apply only "if there is unanimity among the parties or there is no adverse claim or serious objection on the part of any party in interest"; otherwise the&nbsp; matter&nbsp; in controversy should be&nbsp; threshed out "in an ordinary case or in a case where the incident belongs"&nbsp; (Enriguez,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. <i>vs.</i> Atienza,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., 100 Phil., 1072&nbsp; and&nbsp; cases therein cited).<br><br>This&nbsp; view of the case&nbsp; dispenses with&nbsp; the necessity of discussing appellant's objection to the&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from on the ground that the said&nbsp; order does not contain a statement&nbsp; of the facts or&nbsp; the&nbsp; law upon which&nbsp; it is based.<br><br>Conformably to the&nbsp;&nbsp; above, the order&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is modified&nbsp; in the sense&nbsp; that appellant's petition for reconstitution&nbsp; is&nbsp; granted&nbsp; only insofar as&nbsp; it orders the reconstitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; original&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title&nbsp; issued in the&nbsp; name of Juana&nbsp; Montinola, without prejudice&nbsp; to the filing, once the said&nbsp; title&nbsp; is reconstituted, of the proper&nbsp; action to have appellant's alleged interest recorded in said&nbsp; certificate. Without special&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.
