				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; Estelita, Teresita, Norma and Ramon, all minors surnamed Dayao, are children of the deceased Antonio Dayao who from 1949 up to his death on 28 July 1952&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; laborer-carpenter&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage Company, Inc.&nbsp; The respondents children claim compensation&nbsp; against the Company for the death of their father.<br><br>&nbsp;At 8:00 o'clock in the morning of 28 July 1952 Antonio Dayao&nbsp; together with&nbsp; nine other&nbsp; laborers of the Luzon Brokerage Company, Inc. rode&nbsp; on the&nbsp; firm's truck proceeding to Paranaque, Rizal, to perform a company's work of moving the household effects of one Karning or Cummins&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; new residence,&nbsp; about&nbsp; 200&nbsp; meters from his former, on the same Street.&nbsp; The&nbsp; effects which the workmen moved down were refrigerator, electric range, freezer, beds,&nbsp; tables&nbsp; and&nbsp; other furnitures.&nbsp; A&nbsp; mechanical lifter "was used to&nbsp; load&nbsp; them&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck.&nbsp; The&nbsp; household effects were brought to the new dwelling and were unloaded from the truck by the&nbsp; lifter&nbsp; and carried upstairs by Dayao and his companions.&nbsp; During&nbsp; the hauling of that day, Dayao appeared normal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; group proceeded to Plaza Militar,&nbsp; Malate, Manila, where they ate their lunch.&nbsp; Afterwards, Dayao took a nap.&nbsp; At&nbsp; 12:55 o'clock p.m., as Epitacio&nbsp; Aguirre,&nbsp; the supervising foreman, was waking the laborers for the afternoon&nbsp; work, he noticed several of his&nbsp; men agog over Dayao who apparently&nbsp; in deep&nbsp; slumber suddenly stood up gasping for air and wanted to jump.&nbsp; After having been examined by&nbsp; a doctor who was called to render&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; aid, Dayao was taken&nbsp; in a taxicab to the Philippine General Hospital, but before arrival he died. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On 29 July 1952 the Luzon Brokerage Company,&nbsp; Inc. filed with&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Commission the employer's report&nbsp; of&nbsp; accident on Dayao's&nbsp; death (Annex A).&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise&nbsp; on 11&nbsp; August 1952&nbsp; the Dayao&nbsp; children, assisted by Arsenio Mariano, a relative, filed&nbsp; with the Commission a formal notice of injury and claim for compensation (Annex B).&nbsp; The case was assigned to a&nbsp; referee of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; who, after hearing, rendered an&nbsp; opinion holding&nbsp; untenable the claim of the surviving children,&nbsp; on the ground that their father's death was not an accident arising out of and in the course of his&nbsp; employment but due to natural causes (Annex C). After receipt&nbsp; of a copy of the opinion on 16 February 1954, on 31 March 1954 the claimants filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission a petition for review thereof (Annex G). On the last mentioned day, the referee forwarded&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire record&nbsp; of the case to the Commissioner&nbsp; (Annex H). On 13 April&nbsp; the Company moved for the dismissal of the petition&nbsp; for review, it having been filed out of time according to the&nbsp; Company (Annex&nbsp; I).&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; was denied, so&nbsp; also&nbsp; its motion for reconsideration&nbsp; (Annex K), for the reason that it had&nbsp; been filed "within the&nbsp; extensions granted for the filing thereof."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annexes J and L.) The Company filed an answer and objection&nbsp; to the petition for review (Annex M). On 18 February 1956 the Workman's Compensation Commissioner rendered a decision reversing&nbsp; that of the referee and&nbsp; awarding death compensation to the Dayao&nbsp; children in the sum of P3,900 and the further sum of P200 for burial expenses?&nbsp; He also ordered the respondent Company&nbsp; to pay to the Commission P40 as fees&nbsp; (Annex N).<br><br>From the Commissioner's decision, the respondent Company&nbsp; has appealed.<br><br>The four errors assigned by the&nbsp; Company raise&nbsp; only two issues, namely: the petition for review of the referee's. opinion was filed out of time and the death of Dayao was caused not by&nbsp; overexertion in the&nbsp; hauling&nbsp; work but&nbsp; by a natural disease known among Filipinos as "bangungot." Hence—the Company&nbsp; argues—no&nbsp; compensation may&nbsp; be granted. <br><br>The claimants&nbsp; received a copy of the referee's decision on 16 February&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to and under&nbsp; section 3 of Rule 10 of the Rules of the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation Commission, which provides that—<br><blockquote>All&nbsp; petitions for&nbsp; review must be filed&nbsp; within <span style="font-style: italic;">fifteen (15) days </span>from the receipt of notice of any&nbsp; referee's order or award of&nbsp; the Commissioner unless <span style="font-style: italic;">further time is granted by the referee or&nbsp; the Commissioner within said&nbsp; fifteen days</span> (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>the claimants could seek review of the referee's opinion until&nbsp; 3 March&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; On claimants' motion, the Commission extended the period to 17 March&nbsp; (Annex E).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 16&nbsp; March or&nbsp; one day&nbsp; before&nbsp; the expiration&nbsp; date,&nbsp; the claimants moved&nbsp; for a second extension of time to file the petition for review&nbsp; (Annex D); on 27 March&nbsp; they filed a third motion for a&nbsp; 4-day extension or until&nbsp; 31&nbsp; March (Annex F);&nbsp; and finally, on 31 March 1954 the petition for review was filed (Annex&nbsp; G). <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The petitioner Company claims that the petition&nbsp; for review was out of time, it having been filed 44 days from the claimants'&nbsp; receipt of the referee's&nbsp; opinion.&nbsp; It&nbsp; contends that a&nbsp; petition for review may be filed only within an extension of time which the referee or Commissioner must grant within the&nbsp; original reglementary&nbsp; period&nbsp; of 15 days&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; referee&nbsp; or&nbsp; Commissioner has&nbsp; no power&nbsp; or jurisdiction to allow any extension beyond the said&nbsp; 15&nbsp; days.&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; petitioner's theory,&nbsp; only one extension can be&nbsp; granted&nbsp; and such&nbsp; extension&nbsp; must&nbsp; be asked for and granted within the&nbsp; original&nbsp; 15-day&nbsp; period, i.e., if&nbsp; the&nbsp; 15-day reglementary period is extended to&nbsp; 20 days and the first 15 days have already lapsed, no further extension could be granted&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; last&nbsp; 5 days.&nbsp; This is an erroneous&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of section 3&nbsp; of Rule 10 of the&nbsp; Ruled&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission, because any additional period of time allowed or granted forms&nbsp; part of the whole period within which&nbsp; a petition for extension of time or for review&nbsp; of the referee's opinion may be filed; it fails to take into&nbsp; consideration the view that the workmen's compensation&nbsp; law must be liberally. (Construed in favor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; laborer or&nbsp; his&nbsp; dependents to achieve its purpose;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; such interpretation&nbsp; is too narrow and&nbsp; impractical, for very often not only one or two but three or more extensions of time are necessary, depending upon many factors and grounds which the referee&nbsp; or&nbsp; the Commissioner in the exercise of his discretion&nbsp; may consider valid and justifiable.&nbsp; In the instant case, the ground for the second motion for&nbsp; extension was the death of&nbsp; the father of&nbsp; the claimants' lawyer&nbsp; in Palauan,&nbsp; Occidental Mindoro, the attendance of said&nbsp; counsel at the&nbsp; funeral and&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrangement of family affairs&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; D).&nbsp; The reason for the&nbsp; third&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that counsel&nbsp; himself was sick of&nbsp; influenza,&nbsp; duly supported by&nbsp; a medical certificate.&nbsp; These&nbsp; motions were filed before the extended periods expired.&nbsp; And according to the referee&nbsp; and Commissioner the motions for extension were filed "within&nbsp; the extensions&nbsp; granted for the&nbsp; filing thereof."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex J.) <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;That Antonio Dayao&nbsp; died of heart&nbsp; failure is not disputed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; point of controversy is:&nbsp; what caused such&nbsp; failure?&nbsp; Was it— as the petitioner Company claims—a natural disease locally called "bangungot" where the victim dies in his sleep allegedly due to bad&nbsp; dreams or nightmares?&nbsp; If this be the cause then the death is not&nbsp; compensable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, was it—as maintained by the respondents— the overexertion or undue fatigue&nbsp; their deceased father suffered in helping lift, carry and transfer from one place to another the heavy&nbsp; household effects belonging to&nbsp; Mr. Kerning or Cummins?&nbsp; If this be the cause then the death is compensable. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Two&nbsp; medical&nbsp; expert&nbsp; witnesses testified.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Angelo Singian,&nbsp; assistant chief medical examiner of&nbsp; the Manila Police Department, who autopsied the deceased, stated that the cause of the cardiac failure of Dayao was the strenuous work he&nbsp; did before he died to which a fibrocaseous tuberculosis the late&nbsp; Dayao had been&nbsp; suffering for two years greatly contributed.&nbsp; This is contradicted "by Dr.&nbsp; Juan Z. Santa Cruz, a private practising physician, who, testifying for the petitioner&nbsp; Company, stated that&nbsp; Dayao&nbsp; died of "bangungot." However,&nbsp; both&nbsp; agree that&nbsp; the workman's death was&nbsp; caused by the dilatation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the right ventricle the heart. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;There&nbsp; are good and valid&nbsp; grounds and reasons to sustain the conclusion&nbsp; that Dayao's heart failure was&nbsp; due to&nbsp; physical&nbsp; strain&nbsp; or&nbsp; overexertion&nbsp; which&nbsp; the deceased laborer underwent&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Company's hauling&nbsp; work just before he died. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although the enlightening points&nbsp; that Dr. Santa Cruz brought out about the&nbsp; dreaded&nbsp; disease are worthy of note, still the inescapable conclusion&nbsp; is that "bangungot" is still a theoretical disease—whose&nbsp; remote and immediate cause, pathology&nbsp; and&nbsp; cure&nbsp; have&nbsp; not&nbsp; as&nbsp; yet been&nbsp; accurately determined and scientifically established and&nbsp; confirmed.&nbsp; Whether it is a natural phenomenon&nbsp; that by itself&nbsp; can destroy or snuff the life out of a human being is still a question to which medical science has yet&nbsp; to give a more definite and conclusive answer.&nbsp; That "bangungot"&nbsp; is&nbsp; still veiled in its own mystery is openly admitted by Dr.&nbsp; Santa Cruz who, on the witness stand,&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that "until now,&nbsp; the real cause of 'bangungot' is&nbsp; not known and that its pathology cannot be found in any textbook on medicine." And the referee who&nbsp; denied&nbsp; death&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; to Dayao's surviving children&nbsp; shares the&nbsp; same view&nbsp; when&nbsp; in&nbsp; his opinion he says partly that—<br><blockquote>On the other hand, the undersigned (the&nbsp; referee)&nbsp; is more inclined to believe that the opinion, of Dr. Juan Z. Sta.&nbsp; Cruz as explained in detail&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; to the effect that&nbsp; the immediate cause of the acute cardiac failure was the "bangungot", a <i>mysterious disease the&nbsp; cure is which is undiscovered as yet. * * * And&nbsp; since medical sciencehas not up to now discovered the main cause of "bangungot"</i> *&nbsp; * * the undersigned cannot in conscience attribute&nbsp; the death of Antonio Dayao as directly due to the nature of his employment as laborer-carpenter.&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, the government&nbsp; doctor who autopsied the demised laborer testified on&nbsp; the witness stand that the cause of the heart failure of Dayao was&nbsp; his excessive&nbsp; exertion and&nbsp; undue fatigue in hauling and moving from one place to another the heavy pieces of household effects&nbsp; of Mr. Karning or Cummins; that the tuberculosis from which Dayao&nbsp; was suffering for&nbsp; about two years reduced his bodily resistance; and that&nbsp; his lung condition contributed in no small degree to the&nbsp; fatal aftermath of Dayao's. over-exertion and strain.&nbsp; Upon the above categorical testimony of an expert witness based on facts&nbsp; and not upon mere unconfirmed theories, there is little room for doubt that his death arose out&nbsp; of&nbsp; and in the course of&nbsp; his employment.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; being&nbsp; the case, the victim's surviving heirs, are entitled to receive death compensation from the company for which he was working as laborer-carpenter when&nbsp; he died.<br><br>The decision under review is affirmed with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
