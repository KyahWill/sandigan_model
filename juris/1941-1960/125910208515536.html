				<H3>JOSE J. ROTEA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FORTUNATO F. HALILI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On August 17, 1952, while  Angel Bascon  was driving a bus belonging to Fortunato F. Halili along the national road of Makati,  Rizal, it collided  with a Rosado bus as a result of which  Jose Rotea, a passenger  of  the  Halili bus, was  injured.   As a consequence, a criminal  complaint  for  serious physical  injuries  thru  reckless   imprudence was filed in  the Justice  of the Peace Court of Makati  against Bascon,  and the  offended  party having reserved his  right to  file a  separate civil  action, after trial, Bascon was  found guilty of the lesser  crime  of serious  physical in juries thru  simple  imprudence  and sentenced to a penalty of 3 months and 10 days of <em>arresto mayor.</em></p>
<p>Within the reglementary period Bascon appealed to the Court of First Instance of Rizal.  After trial, said court found him also guilty  of the crime  charged sentencing him to  4  months and 1 day  imprisonment.  In addition, the court ordered him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P513.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in  case of insolvency,  to  pay P3,000.00 as  liquidated damages,  P10,000.00 by way  of exemplary or corrective damages,  and the costs.  From this decision  Bascon took steps to appeal to the Court  of  Appeals, but he  later withdrew his  appeal  and served  the sentence  imposed upon him.</p>
<p>The decision having  become  final, a writ of execution was issued upon Rotea's request to enforce the civil liability awarded in his favor,  but the writ was returned unsatisfied because Bascon was insolvent.   Rotea made several  demands upon Halili to make good his subsidiary-liability, he  being the employer of Bascon, and having ignored said  demands,  Rotea  filed  on March  19,  1955 against Halili  the present action  in  the  Court of  First Instance of Manila praying that Halili be declared subsidiarily liable for the indemnity  awarded in his favor In the criminal case consisting in  the sum of P13,513.00 as  liquidated and  exemplary damages,  and that  he be awarded  P2,000.00  as  attorney's  fees  and  the  costs. After trial, the court found for plaintiff  ordering defendant to  pay  an indemnity  in the  amount of P3,513.00, with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint until its  payment,  to  pay  P500.00  as attorney's fees, and the  costs.  The  court   denied  plaintiff's claim for P10,000.00  as  exemplary  damages.  Plaintiff  appealed directly to this Court assigning several errors.</p>
<p>After stating that this action was brought to enforce the indemnity fixed  in the  criminal case taken  against appellee's  driver  based upon the  subsidiary liability  of appellee  under  Articles 102  and  103  of  the Revised Penal Code, which indemnity amounts to  P13,513.00, including the sum  of  P10,000.00  as exemplary damages, appellant contends that the trial court erred in modifying said indemnity by reducing it to P3,513.00 as  actual and liquidated  damages, eliminating  therefrom  the sum of P10,000.00  as  exemplary  damages.   He  contends  that the trial  court cannot make such diminution for  that would  be tantamount  to  an amendment or modification of the decision rendered in the criminal case  insofar as the indemnity  is concerned which  has long  become  final and  executory.  Appellant avers that in the absence of collusion between  the offended party and  the  accused "in the criminal  case, or unless  it is claimed  that the court had  no jurisdiction to  act on the matter, the employer is liable for the  whole amount  of  indemnity awarded to the  offended party in a subsequent civil action  filed to enforce it.</p>
<p>We have no quarrel  with  the  contention that when a civil action is  based upon the subsidiary  liability of an employer under Articles 102 and 103 of the Revised Penal Code resulting  from the indemnity awarded to the offended party  in  a criminal action the  court has no  other function than  to  render  decision based  upon the indemnity awarded in the criminal case and has no power to amend or modify it even if  in its opinion an  error has been committed in the decision.   For, as  this Court has aptly  said: "To allow an employer to dispute the civil liability  fixed in the  criminal  case  would  be to amend,  nullify or  defeat a  final judgment  rendered by a  competent  court"  (Miranda  vs. Malate  Garage  and Taxicab, Inc., 99 Phil., 670; 52 Off.  Gaz. [11] 5145).  But the situation  differs when the court in the criminal case has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, in which case the decision should be ignored because being null and void it never existed  in  contemplation  of law.  This  is the  situation   herein  obtained.  The decision rendered in the  criminal case  insofar as  the indemnity  is  concerned is null and void for  having been rendered without or  in excess of  the jurisdiction  of the court  of first instance,  and this is so because the offended party has made an express reservation  of his  right to institute a separate  civil  action to recover  the indemnity and the amount  awarded is far  beyond  the jurisdiction  of the justice  of the  peace  court  where  the  case  originated. The trial court, therefore,  was justified  in ignoring the decision in the criminal case and  in rendering judgment according to its  discretion  based upon the  evidence on hand.</p>
<p>On the other  hand, the trial  court was justified in not requiring  appellee  to pay exemplary damages  there being no evidence whatever that he had any participation in  the  wrongful  act  committed by his  employee.  The rule  is  that exemplary damages  are imposed primarily upon the wrongdoer as a deterrent  in the commission of similar acts in the  future.   Such punitive damages cannot be  applied to his  master or  employer except only to the extent of  his participation or ratification of  the act because they are penal in  character.  Moreover,  in this jurisdiction, exemplary damages  may  only be  imposed when the crime is committed with one  or more aggravating circumstances   (Article 2230, new Civil  Code), and here the crime being only  qualified by negligence is not accompanied by any aggravating circumstance.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"According  to  the  rule adopted by many courts, a  principal or  master can be held liable for exemplary or punitive damages based upon the  wrongful  act of his agent or  servant only where he  participated  in  the doing of such wrongful act or  has previously authorized or subsequently ratified it  with  full  knowledge of  the facts. Reasons given  for this rule are that  since such damages are  penal in character, the  motive authorizing their infliction will riot  be imputed by  presumption to the  principal when the act  is committed by an agent or  servant, and that since they are awarded  not by way of compensation, but as a  punishment to  the oifender and  as av warning to others,  they can  only be awarded against one  who has  participated in the offense, and the principal  therefore cannot  be held liable  for them merely by reason  of wanton, oppressive, or malicious Intent on the part of the agent."   (15 Am. Jur., 780).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With regard to  the claim  that the  trial  court erred in awarding to appellant only the amount  of P500.00 as attorney's   fees  and  not the  amount  of  P2,000.00  as claimed by  him  considering that  appellee  paid no  heed to his repeated overtures for payment  thus forcing, him to institute  the present action, suffice it to say that this is a matter  addressed to the discretion of the trial court. Considering that the  principal amount  involved is small and appellee's liability is merely subsidiary, we  find  no abuse  of discretion committed by the trial court. Wherefore,  the  decision  appealed from is  affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
