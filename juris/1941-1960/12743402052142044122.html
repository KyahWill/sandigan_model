				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of an order of the Public Service Commission 
denying the petition of Ursula T. Paredes praying that she be granted an 
extension of time within which to effect the registration of certain number of 
busses authorized in the certificate of public convenience granted her in Cass 
No. 34415 which are necessary to operate on the ten lines mentioned in said 
certificate.
<p>Petitioner was the holder of a certificate of public convenience issued by 
the Public Service Commission authorizing her to operate a passenger and freight 
service on several lines in the City of Manila by virtue of a decision rendered 
on April 29, 1950 (Case No. 34415). Before the approval of said certificate, 
petitioner was the holder of other emergency certificates of public convenience 
wherein she was authorized to operate a total of seventeen (17) busses. When the 
decision in said case was rendered, the Commission was of the impression that 
the seventeen busses which were originally authorized were still in operation, 
so that, in addition, she was also authorized to register other three (3) busses 
to complete the twenty authorized in the decision. letitioner, however, was not 
able to register these three additional busses, nor to operate the other busses 
she had been authorized, and so, on February 25, 1953. asha filed a petition 
requesting that she ba allowed to re-register the total twenty units in order to 
enable her to operate the lines granted her by the Commission. To this petition, 
Antonio Heras and Vicente Heras. who are operating under the trade names MD and 
JD Transits respectively, as well as the De Dios Transportation Company, also a 
TPU operator on several lines, objected in writing and joined hands in 
petitioning for the cancellation of the certificate of public convenience 
granted to petitioner for her failure to register the units authorized in her 
certificate.</p>
<p>This petition for re-registration as wall as the written opposition and 
petition for cancellation were set for hearing to give the parties an 
opportunity to substantiate their respective contentions, and, after due 
hearing, the Commission issued an order on July 3. 1953 wherein it not only 
denied petitioner's request but amended its former decision by cancelling all 
the lines granted her with the exception of the line Plaza Miranda-Balara, and 
granting her authority to operate only one unit for that line. Her petition for 
reconsideration having been denied, she interposed the present petition for 
review.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that o.a April 29, 1950 petitioner was granted a 
certificate of public convenience to operate a total of twenty busses on various 
lines within the City of Manila and its suburbs. When said certificate was 
granted, the Commission was of the impression that the seventeen busses which 
were authorized her previously were still in operation so that, in addition, she 
was also authorized to acquire other three busses within a specified period of 
time. It appears, however, that nost of said seventeen busses were no longer in 
operation for, as the record discloses, in 1949 she stored nine of her 
authorized units, in 1950 she placed in storage five more units, and in 1951 she 
stored two additional units, with ohe result that in this latter year sixteen of 
the units she vae required to register and operate were not in operation. It 
father appears that the three additional units petitioner was authorized to 
acquire were never provided for in spite of the many extensions of time granted 
her for that purpose. It vss likewise established that in 1952 petitioner 
registered under her certificate only one bus and in 1953 also one bus. Asked to 
explain why she failed to acouire the required units, petitioner attributed it 
to "severe scarcity of trucks, accessories, tires, and materials as a result of 
the unsettled war conditions", and to prove it she presented a letter of the 
International Harvester Company wherein it appears that she placed an order for 
twenty-five units with which she intended to comply with her commitment but that they were not then available, But this letter shows that while the 
trucks were not then available the company vas however willing to deliver them 
by lots, i.e., nine in March. 1952, ten in April, 1952 and six in May, 1952. And 
petitioner was not able to explain why she failed to avail herself of this offer 
of the company. Upon these facts the Commission concluded that petitioner not 
only failed to cor.ipiy with the conditions set forth in her certificate but 
practically abandoned the service for a period of three years, Consequently, it 
denied her petition for re-registration and cancelled her original certificate 
by limiting her lire to one, with only one unit.</p>
<p>We find no reason for disturbing this finding of the Commission for tha same 
is based on a sound principle. A grantee of a certificate who fails to comply 
with his commitment for reasons which to the Commission do not appear 
justifiable does not merit any grace on grounds of enuity, for he should be 
deemed to have forfeited the privilege he has been granted. A public service 
operator assumes a commitment which cannot be taken lightly, nor be made 
dependent on whim or caprice, for behind it lies the paramount interest of the 
public. Public necessity cannot be made to wait, nor sacrificed for private 
convenience for, as the Commission has aptly said, "an operator who 
unjustifiably abandons his service for two or three years by not registering the 
necessary equipment forfeits his right to said equipment and the service 
authorized to him," Such is the predicament of petitioner. She has neglected her 
duty for three years in disregard of the interest of the public and such neglect 
amounts to a forfeiture.</p>
<p>It is true that petitioner made an attempt to prove at the hearing on her 
motion for reconsideration that the reason for her failure to meet her 
commitment was because ths International Harvester Company was not able to make 
goods its offer to sell her twenty-five units due to circumstances beyond its 
control, but the Commission found the attempt futile not only because it was 
made after the main case hs been submitted, but also because even if it be 
admitted as true it cannot relieve her of her dereliction of duty for the simple 
reason that the Commission found that for two whole years she had withdrawn her 
busses from operation and had placed them in storage without its previous 
authority. Moreover, the failure of one company to furnish petitioner the units 
she needs for her lines does not necessarily mean that she cannot obtain the 
same units from other dealers or companies. And yet this she failed to do. She 
cannot now complain, after jeopardizing public interest, that her request for 
equity has baen denied. She alone is to blame for the consequences of her own 
act.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends that the order authorizing her to prerate only one unit 
out of the twenty she had been previously authorized is unconscionable 
considering the heavy investment sh3 has made which amounts to a total of 
P165,250. And. in this connection, she invokes the various decisions of this 
Court wherein it was laid down as a basis principle underlying transportation 
busines that it is the duty of the Commission to protect rather than destroy the 
investment of an operator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The doctrine adverted to is sound but it has not application to petitioner. 
That refers to operate of good standing and not to those whose investment has 
deteriorated or disappeared through their own fault. In this respect we find 
fitting this comment of the Commission:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x x There can be no investment to protect when tha physical property 
which constituted tha bulk of that investment has already disappeared either 
because the applicant sold that property or because they became obsolete and the 
applicant did not care to replace them at the time when she could have done so. 
If she no longer has the trucks on which that investment was rrade, it is due 
mainly to her own acts. The law requires the Commission to protect an investment 
which still exists but if that investment is inexistent because tha property 
constituting it has been sold or disposed of even to the detriment of the public 
service, then there is no investment to protect." (Order of August 28, 
1953)</p></blockquote>
