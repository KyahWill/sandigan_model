				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Serafin Saldaña is appealing the decision of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo in  Civil Case  No.  2236, dismissing his complaint  against the  City of Iloilo, for  the refund of taxes paid by him under  protest, and upholding the legality of Ordinance No. 28, Series of 1946, as amended by  Ordinance No. 30, same series of the defendant City. <br><br>On  May 25, 1946, the defendant City  of Iloilo promulgated Ordinance No. 28, series of 1946, which for purposes of reference we reproduce  below:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"ORDINANCE  No. 28 "<br></div><br><blockquote>"AN  ORDINANCE  REGULATING THE EXIT OF FOOD SUPPLY AND LABOR ANIMALS AND IMPOSING  PERMIT  FEE THEREFOR. <br><br>"Be it ordained by the Municipal Board of the City of Iloilo, that: <br><br>"ARTICLE 1.—For the purpose of regulating, during this state of emergency, the exit  of  food supply and labor  animals in order to avert shortage of the  same in the  City of Iloilo,  it is  strictly prohibited to send outside of the City of Iloilo,  without first obtaining the necessary license permit from the  Mayor, the following:  <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="90%">Large cattle, pigs,  goats, sheep or the like; </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Domestic fowls, eggs; </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Fish, whether fresh, salted or  dried; </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Milkfish  (semilla), bagoon (guinamos, crabs, prawn or the like); </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Fruits, such as bananas, melon,  papayas or the like.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>"ART. 2.—The  City  Treasurer shall,   for  issuance  of  license permit required in article one hereof, collect a fee as follows: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="90%">Large cattle, whether alive or slaughtered, P10 per head. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Pigs, goats, and sheep, whether alive or slaughtered, P5 each. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Chicken  and other  domestic fowls, whether alive  or dressed—; P0.50 each. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Eggs, P2.00 per hundred or  P0.02 each.

In its  answer,  the  defendant  contended that the imposition  and collection of the municipal licenses were within the power  and duties of the Municipal Board in the exercise  of its police power.  The parties submitted an agreed statement of facts to the effect that during the period above-mentioned, Saldaña had  sent fish out of Iloilo City to Manila, for the sending  of which, the City collected  P1,359.80  under  the two ordinances in  question,  and that  the  payment of said  amount  was made under protest.  On the basis of the agreed statement of facts, the lower court rendered the decision now appealed to us, holding that Ordinance No. 28 as amended was valid  that the purpose of the said ordinances was to regulate the exit of food supply and labor  animals from the city of Iloilo and their sale beyond city limits, and falls squarely within the provisions of  paragraph  (<span style="font-style: italic;">aa</span>),  Section 21 of the Charter of the City, namely, Commonwealth Act No. 158;  that the  ordinance does  not restrict  trade but only regulates  the business of purchase  of foodstuffs  for the purpose of taking them outside, with the purpose of averting  the scarcity of foodstuffs; that  the  imposition  and collection  of the license fees provided in the said ordinance was included within  the police power  and that said  fees were reasonable amounts, necessary to cover the expenses in the issuance of the licenses and the cost of the necessary inspection or police surveillance. <br><br>One question involved in the appeal is whether the license fees  imposed  and  collected were in  reality taxes.   The following authorities are  illuminating:<br><blockquote>"* * *. The differences between the license and the property tax are well established.  The license represents the permission conceded to do an act, is  not supposed to be imposed  for revenue, and is in the main for police purposes.  A property tax, on the  other hand, is a tax in the ordinary sense, assessed according to the value of property."   (City of Manila <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Tanquintic, 58  Phil. 297, 300). <br><br>"* * *. Estos dos ternrinos 'derechos' e 'impuesto' no  entrañan el mismo concepto, porque Impuestos  o  Taxes son, segun todas las autoridades conocidas, 'an enforced contribution of money or other property assessed in accordance  with  some  reasonable  rule  of apportionment by authority of  a  sovereign state, on  persons or property within  its jurisdiction, for the purpose  of defraying the public expenses'  (26 R.  C.  L. par.  2, page 13);  or 'a rate or sum of money assessed on the person or property  of a citizen by government for the use of the nation or state; burdens or charges imposed by the legislative  power upon persons or property to raise money for public  purposes' (61 C. J.,  65); y  Derechos o <span style="font-style: italic;">Fees</span>, son por otra parte, 'a  reward or compensation allowed by law to  an  officer for specific services performed by him in the  discharge of his  official duties;  a  sum certain  given for  a particular  service;  the sum prescribed  by law as charge for services rendered by public officers' (25  C. J., 1009)."  (Manila  Electric  Co.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Auditor  General, et al., 73 Phil. 128,  133). <br><br>"* * *. So-called license taxes are  of  two kinds.  The  one is a tax for the purpose  of revenue.  The other,  which is, strictly speaking, not a tax at all but merely an exercise of the police power, is a fee imposed for the purpose of regulation. * * * But a charge of a fixed sum which bears  no relation to  the cost of inspection and which is payable into the general revenue of the state is a tax rather  than an exercise of the police  power."  (Cooley, Taxation, 4th ed., Vol. I, pp. 97-98).</blockquote> Judging from the amount of the fees fixed in the ordinances in question, we do not hesitate to find and to hold that the so-called fees were in reality taxes for city revenue.   For instance, the P10.00  fee  for  every head  of large cattle, whether alive or  slaughtered,  and the P5.00 fee for every pig, goat, or sheep,  whether alive or slaughtered,  cannot possibly be considered as mere expense incurred for, or the cost of the inspection  of each  animal and the issuance of  the corresponding  permit.   If  a pig, goat, or  sheep costs,  say,  P15 or even  P20,  then the  P5.00 fee would constitute  quite a considerable slice or portion  of said cost; and if the animals and  articles listed in the ordinances were sent out from  the City  of Iloilo in  large  quantities and numbers, there  would be no doubt that the fees collected  would amount to a sizable sum and augment greatly the revenues  of the  municipal  corporation, way in excess of the cost of inspections  and the issuance of the permits. <br><br>Another important question is that Article 1 of the ordinance  also strictly prohibits the sending out of the City of Iloilo, of  the animals and articles  enumerated therein, like large cattle, pigs, fowl,  fish, eggs, fruits, etc., without first obtaining the necessary  license permit from the mayor; and Article 3 declares it unlawful  for any carrier whether land, water or air, to load any of said animals or articles without the corresponding permit.  The ordinance fails to provide for any regulations  or  conditions under  which the permit can be  granted or  denied.   In other words, the mayor has absolute power to refuse to issue any permit, practically making him absolute dictator over the subject matter.  With merely telling the applicant and prospective licensee  that  said animals and articles are needed in the City of Iloilo, the mayor could  refuse to grant the permit <br><br>To realize the danger of the grant of said absolute power is not difficult. <br><br>As to the  reasonableness  of  the prohibition  of selling and taking out of the City of Iloilo of any of the animals and articles enumerated in the ordinance,  appellant asks us to consider or take judicial notice of the fact  that those animals  and  articles are not all produced  in the City of Iloilo, but come from other towns of the  province,  even from other provinces adjacent, and are taken to the City of  Iloilo only for the  purpose of transportation to other places, like Manila.   In other words, they are not brought into the  City of Iloilo for the consumption of the residents thereof,  but for export to other places.  But once inside the city  limits,  under the ordinance, the mayor takes absolute control and  has jurisdiction to  allow or  disallow their being taken out of the city,  and in  case he issues the permit for their being taken away, taxes are imposed thereon  under the guise of license  fees. <br><br>As correctly argued by the appellant, nowhere in the charter of the defendant City is it authorized to  regulate and collect fees  or  taxes for, the  taking out of the city, of  animals and  articles listed in the ordinance.  On the other hand,  a  municipal corporation  like the  defendant City has  no  inherent power  of  taxation.  To  enact a valid  ordinance,  the City must  find  in its charter the power to do  so, for said power cannot be assumed. <br><blockquote>"A  municipal corporation,  unlike a  sovereign state, is  clothed with  no  inherent  power of taxation.   Its charter must  plainly show an  intent to confer that  power  or  the corporation cannot assume it.   And the  power  when  granted  is  to be  construed<span style="font-style: italic;"> strictissimi juris</span>.  Any doubt or ambiguity arising out  of the term used must be resolved against the corporation."   (Santos Lumber Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> City of Cebu, et al.,  102 Phil., 870;  See also Arong <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Raffiñan,  98 Phil., 422). <br></blockquote>Aside from this lack of inherent power of taxation by a municipal corporation, Section 2287 of the Revised Administrative Code provides that municipal revenue  obtainable by  taxation shall be  derived from such sources  only as are expressly authorized by law; and it further provides, and this is very important,  that:<br><blockquote>"It shall not be in the power  of the municipal council to impose a tax  in any form whatever upon goods and merchandise carried into the municipality, or out of  the same, and any attempt to impose an import or export tax upon such  goods in the guise of an unreasonable charge for wharfage,  use  of bridges or otherwise, shall be void."  (Italics supplied).</blockquote>This last provision  is reproduced in Section 2629,  of  the same  Revised  Administrative  Code,  entitled  "General Rules  for Municipal  Taxation and  Licenses."<br><br>In  conclusion, we find that the  ordinance in question as amended,  is ultra vires, enacted  beyond the  general powers of a municipal corporation  and not authorized by the defendant-appellee's charter, and consequently null and void;  that the prohibition  against  taking animals  and articles out  of  the  City of Iloilo without  permit  of  the mayor is in restraint of trade  and a curtailment  of  the rights of  the owners of the said  animals and  articles to freely sell and  of prospective  purchasers to buy and dispose of them without the  city limits in the ordinary course of  commerce and trade;  that the fees  imposed in the said ordinances are in fact taxes not only unauthorized by the law or the  charter of  defendant City,  but also in contravention of the provisions of Sections  2287 and 2629 of the Revised Administrative  Code,  which prohibit municipal corporations from imposing  any tax in any form upon goods  and merchandise  carried  into or out of the town or City. <br><br>In view of the foregoing, the  appealed decision is hereby  reversed and the  City of  Iloilo is hereby  ordered to reimburse plaintiff  the  amount of  P1,359.80,  with legal interest  and costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
