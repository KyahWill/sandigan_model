				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Direct  appeal from  a decision of the  Court  of  First Instance of Manila ordering defendants Catalina V. Yandoc, Bienvenido Yandoc and  Antonia Y. Paez  to reimburse plaintiff Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. the attorney's  fees and other expenses in the amount of P11,554.00  which it had incurred as defendant in a previous suit instituted by Hilaria Uy Isabelo against all the parties herein, with  12 % interest thereon from filing of this suit until full payment, attorney's fees of P2,000.00 and costs.</p>
<p>From the stipulation of facts, it  appears that, for and in consideration of P29,440.00,  Catalina V.  Yandoc,  with the consent of her husband Bienvenido Yandoc, and Antonia Y. Paez contracted to sell to Hilaria Uy Isabelo  a parcel of land in Baguio City.   The vendors  promised that on or  before January 31,  1951, they  would  deliver to the vendee clean  title to the property,  complete construction of the roads and improvements thereon, and comply  with all ordinances of Bagnio City.  To insure compliance  with these three conditions, the vendee required the vendors to post a bond  of P30,000.00.  However, the bond  (Exhibit A)  executed by the surety  company, Malayan Insurance Co., Inc.,  guaranteed solely that clean title to the  property would  be  delivered to the vendee, without specifying the date of delivery. In consideration of the obligation under-taken by the surety company upon  the bond, Paez executed a deed of indemnity (Exhibit C) ; and Yandoc executed a deed  of  counter-guaranty  with mortgage  over  the land subject of the contract to sell (Exhibit B).</p>
<p>At the request  of Uy Isabelo dated January 29, 1951 (Exhibit 3), the surety company  cancelled the  bond and released  the mortgage (Exhibit 6).  Subsequently, in the Court of First Instance of Baguio,  Uy Isabelo sued Yandoc and Paez for rescission of  the contract to sell (Civil Case No. 233).   The surety company was impleaded as defendant, but it  denied liability on the cancelled bond.  After hearing, the court rescinded the contract; declared Yandoc and Paez liable to Uy Isabelo  for the  principal  sum of P29,440.00 and P10,000.00 as liquidated damages, and held the surety company liable on the P30,000.00 bond (Exhibit D).  On appeal, the Court of Appeals absolved the surety company from liability, but affirmed with modifications the judgment against Yandoc and Paez, which  decision is now final  (CA-G. R. No. 8801; Exhibit E).</p>
<p>On October 15, 1956, the  surety company  demanded from Yandoc and Paez reimbursement of its expenses  in the aforesaid litigation  (Exhibit  F).  Upon their refusal to pay (Exhibit G), the  surety  company  filed  the  present suit against them and Bienvenido  Yandoc in  the Court of First Instance of Manila which rendered the appealed decision upon  the stipulation of facts and additional evidence submitted herein.</p>
<p>The appeal turns on  the question  of whether  appellee's expenses in the previous litigation must  be reimbursed by appellants.</p>
<p>Where the indemnity agreement comprehends  attorney's fees, the principal must reimburse  the surety for such fees and other expenses it incurred in  defending a suit arising from the bond, regardless of whether the suit is meritorious or not (42  C. J. S. 586-587; U. S. Fidelity and  Guaranty Co. vs. Garett, et al., 152 S. E. 772).  The attorney's fees to be  incurred  by the surety cannot be limited to suits probably well founded in fact, since legal services are naturally required to ascertain  the  facts and to meet the allegations made; nor are they confined to cases well founded in law, for the surety is entitled to legal advice on the question of his  legal liability on the face of the complaint and to services in presenting  the  proper  issue  of law  in defense  (Kilgore vs. Union  Indemnity Co.,  132 So. 901).</p>
<p>Appellants covenanted "to indemnify the surety company for any damage, prejudice, loss, costs, payments, advances and expenses of whatever kind and nature, including counsel or attorney's  fees, which the surety company may, at any time, Sustain or incur, as a <em>consequence</em> of having executed the abovementioned bond" (Exhibits B and C.)   Appellee is entitled to  be reimbursed  only if the  expenses were incurred as a consequence of the execution of the bond.  When an event is followed in natural sequence by a result which it is adapted  to produce, or  aid in producing, that result is a "consequence" of the event (In re Benson, 62 P 2d 962; Hill vs.  Day,  199 A. 920).  As long as the bond remained valid  and outstanding, any action brought thereon whether meritorious or groundless, is a consequence of the execution thereof, for it can be reasonably anticipated that the creditor might sue on the bond.  And since the surety needs  legal help to determine  its liability  on the bond, it must be reimbursed for attorney's  fees it had incurred.</p>
<p>But  inasmuch as the bond herein was cancelled at the express request of Uy Isabelo,  then there was no longer reason to expect that  she would later on file suit thereon. Her suit against the surety company did not directly result from the execution of the bond, but is attributable purely to her own manifest bad faith.  The appellate  court absolved  the surety  company  from  liability  on  the bond because the same had been cancelled.  Even if the bond was  outstanding, appellants  complied with its  condition when they sent  title to the property by mail to Uy Isabelo on February 22, 1951.  Prior even to this date, Uy Isabelo had requested appellee to  cancel the bond,  informing it that  it  had  no obligations  thereon  (Exhibit 3).   The condition of the bond was fulfilled but  appellants failed to perform all the conditions of the contract to  sell,  so Uy Isabelo filed the  previous action  against them.   But with full knowledge that she had utterly no cause of action against appellee, she still impleaded  it as party defendant.</p>
<p>Appellee was aware that it was Uy Isabelo who should be held liable for its  expenses  in the  suit.  Indeed,  it included in its answer to the complaint, a counterclaim for attorney's  fees of P1,000.00; and, on  appeal, prayed  that Uy Isabelo be ordered to pay it  P10,000.00 as attorney's fees,  which  counterclaim and prayer were not granted. Appellee did not make  a crossclaim against appellants, a circumstance, which though not decisive of appellee's right to reimbursement,  is nevertheless indicative  of its belief that appellants  should  not  be held responsible for  the amounts it spent in the previous suit.</p>
<p>As provided in the indemnity agreement, appellee could cancel  the bond,  "subject to  any liability which might have accrued prior to the date of cancellation."  If no liabilities are outstanding at the time of cancellation, then the surety company cannot be held liable on the bond, and it cannot ask for reimbursement from the principals whose obligation to indemnify the surety company arises only "as soon as demand is received from the  creditor, or  as soon as  it becomes liable to make payment of any sum under the terms of the abovementioned bond."   No demand was made by Uy Isabelo for compliance with the provisions of the bond. On the contrary, when  she asked for cancellation of  the bond, she informed appellee  that "the terms and conditions stipulated in your above bond have been fully and faithfully performed  by the abovebonded principals  and that you, as surety, therefore, have no outstanding obligation or liabilities thereunder" (Exhibit 3).  Because appellee never became liable on the bond,  appellants' obligation to pay the aforesaid indemnities did not mature.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is reversed, and appellee's complaint dismissed, without  pronouncement  as  to costs.</p>
