				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On October 1, 1946, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 37 which 
reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"AN ACT GRANTING PREFERENCE TO FILIPINO CITIZENS IN THE LEASE OF 
PUBLIC MARKET STALLS</p>
<p align="justify">"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the Philippines in Congress assembled:</p>
<p align="justify">"SECTION 1. All citizens of the Philippines shall have 
preference in the lease of public market stalls.</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2. The Secretary of Finance is hereby empowered to 
promulgateathe necessary rules to carry into effect the purposes of this 
Act.</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 3. All existing laws or parts thereof contrary to the 
provisions of this Act are hereby repealed.</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 4. This Act shall take effect on the first - day ..of 
January, nineteen hundred and forty-seven.</p>
<p align="justify">"Approved, October 1, 1946."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Purporting to carry into effect said act, the Secretary of 
Finance promulgated on November 29, 1946, Department of Finance Order No. 32, 
declaring all stalls or booths in all public markets as vacated by their 
occupants and their leases terminated on January 1, 1947. Section 2 of said 
order provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>Vacancy of Stalls; Notice of Application</i>.â€”For the 
purpose of this Order, all stalls or booths in any public market shall be deemed 
to be vacated by their present occupants and their lease terminated on January 
1, 1947, and the same shall be leased to applicants therefor beginning said date 
in the following manner:</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>a</i>) Notice of this general vacancy shall be posted on 
the bulletin, board in each public market and other conspicuous places therein 
immediately upon the promulgation of this Order.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>b</i>) If the occupants or holders of the stalls on 
December 31, 1946 are citizens of the Philippines, and have been occupying or 
holding the same for not less than thirty (30) days before said date, and they 
file their applications to continue occupying the same in the manner herein 
prescribed, they shall be given the lease of their respective stalls, subject to 
the conditions prescribed in these regulations. The application shall be 
substantially in the form prescribed in section 3 (<i>c</i>) hereof and shall 
expressly state that the applicant is the actual occupant on December 31, 1946, 
of the stall applied for.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) If their occupants on December 31, 1946, are not 
Filipino citizens, the stalls affected shall be awarded for occupancy to the 
Filipino applicant who first filed his application therefor in accordance with 
the provisions hereof.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>d</i>) In case two or more applications from Filipino 
citizens are filed at the same time for the same market stall, or it can not be 
ascertained which one of them was filed first, the lease of the stall shall be 
awarded by lot under the supervision of the Market Committee as herein 
provided.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>e</i>) The award of market stalls to an alien applicant 
can be made only in the absence of a Filipino applicant."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On December 27, 1946, petitioners and appellees filed with the 
lower court a petition for prohibition to restrain appellants from enforcing the 
above act and department order, alleging that they are unconstitutional.</p>
<p align="justify">On December 28, 1946, the lower court issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction ordering appellants to desist from ejecting appellees 
from the leased public market stalls mentioned in the petition.</p>
<p align="justify">The writ was dissolved by order of January 7, 1947. Appellees 
filed with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari and mandamus, L-1266,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to annul the order of dissolution of the 
writ of preliminary injunction. The petition was dismissed on August 29, 1947, 
because among other reasons, the Secretary of Finance suspended the operation of 
Department Order No. 32 which respondents were about to enforce.</p>
<p align="justify">Trial was held in the lower court where appellees called to 
testify three market stall holders, Yee Shi, Go Hong and Uy Ho.</p>
<p align="justify">Yee Shi, Chinese, widow, 46, testified that she continuously 
occupied her stalls in Divisoria Market since June, 1932, upon the death of her 
husband, a former lessee thereof; that she signed contracts of lease for the 
occupancy of said stalls, but not copy was given her by the market authorities; 
that on December 24, 1946, she received notice to vacate the stalls not later 
than 4 p.m. of December 31, 1946, that she has no means of livelihood other than 
her business conducted at said stall; that, if ejected, she will have no means 
to support her five children and that there are no other alien market vendors 
than the Chinese.</p>
<p align="justify">Go Hong, 49, Chinese, testified that he has been occupying his 
stalls at Quiapo Market since 1916; that he signed contracts of lease but 
notcopy was given to him by the market authorities; that if ejected, he will 
have no means of supporting his Filipino wife and four children; that there are 
no alien vendors other than the Chinese; and that approximately 50 Chinese 
vendors occupy about 9 per cent of the stalls in Quiapo market.</p>
<p align="justify">Uy Ho, Chinese, 48, testified that he continuously occupied his 
stalls at Divisoria market since 1928, except for a period from 1943 to 1944 
when he joined the Marking guerrillas; that he signed contracts of lease but no 
copy was given him by the market authorities; that, if ejected therefrom, he 
will have no means of supporting his wife and six children; that his youngest 
child is only 10 months old; that on December 21, 1946, he received notice to 
vacate the stalls not later than 4 p.m. of December 31, 1946.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellees also presented the following documentary proofs: 
Exhibit A, Market Code of Manila or Ordinance No. 2898; Exhibit B, Department of 
Finance Order No. 32; Exhibit C, notice given by the City Treasurer to appellees 
to vacate the public market stalls not later than 4 o'clock p.m. December 31, 
1946, pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 37 and Department of 
Finance Order No. 32; Exhibit D, record of Mendoza vs. Nolasco, civil case No. 
72532 of the Court of First Instance of Manila; Exhibit E, opinion of the City 
Fiscal given to the Mayor of Manila dated November 15, 1946; Exhibit F, records

Instance of Manila; Exhibit G, portion of the transcript of the stenographic 
notes taken on December 28, 1946; Exhibit H, Section 653 of Ordinance No. 1600 
of Manila; Exhibit I, Secs. 795, 801, and 809 (<i>c</i>) of Ordinance Order No. 
1600 of Manila; Exhibit J to Exhibit J-19, treaties of the United States with 
several foreign countries; Exhibits K to K-3, opinion of the Atty. General; 
Exhibits L to L-5, decisions of the Supreme Court; Exhibit M, Philippine 
Immigration let of 1940; Exhibit N, order of the Military Governor of September 
20, 1898; Exhibit O, Note of the Secretary of State Hay of December 5, 1898; 
Exhibit O-1, Note of Secretary of State Knox; Exhibit O-2, Lobinger, American 
Courts in China; Exhibit P, Charter of the United Nations; Exhibit Q, 
certificate of the City Treasurer of Manila to show that only 13.02% of the 
public market stalls of Manila are occupied by aliens, herein appellees; 
Exhibits R and S, identification cards issued to Yee Shi; and Exhibit T, 
certificate of delegation of the Republic of China to the Philippines, to show 
that appellees have exhausted all administrative remedies to secure repeal or 
modification of Republic Act No. 37 and Department of Finance Order No. 32.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellants presented as their only evidence Exhibit 1, showing 
that all the market stalls in Manila have already been applied for by citizens 
of the Philippines; that there are 3,479 applications received from Filipino 
citizens, or an average of five applications to every two stalls and almost 
eight Filipinos to every alien occupant; and that these stalls are being awarded 
to the Filipinos pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 37.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court rendered judgment upholding the 
constitutionality of Republic Act No. 37 but voiding the prbvisions of Section 2 
of Department of Finance Order No. 32, as not in conformity with said Republic 
Act No. 37, and commanded appellants to desist from enforcing the provisions of 
Department Order No. 32.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellants assigned in their brief six errors as having been 
committed by the lower court, all relating to the interpretation of Republic Act 
No. 37 and as to the validity of Department of Finance Order No. 32.</p>
<p align="justify">The whole controversy in this appeal can, however, be limited 
to the question as to whether or not Sec. 2 of Department of Finance Order No. 
32 is authorized by Republic Act No. 37.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court answered the question in the negative and, 
therefore, ordered appellant public officers to refrain from executing said 
department order and from ejecting appellees from their respective stalls.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court reasons out that, although the act was approved 
on October 1, 1946, it expressly provides that it shall take effect on the first 
day of January, 1947, and that it does not appear in the text that Congress 
intended to give to the act a retroactive application. Hence, the 
unconstitutionality of Section 2 of said Order No. 32.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellants contend that on the hypothetical assumption that 
awards in public markets are leases, the same had already expired on January 1, 
1947; and that, since the fees of the stallholders are collected either daily, 
weekly or monthly, without definite periods, the leases should be understood as 
being from day to day, week to week or month to month, as the case may be, 
according to article 1851 of the Civil Code, all of them had expired since 
December 31, 1946.</p>
<p align="justify">They allege that on January 1, 1947, all awards to stalls could 
be renewed and reassigned to hold them pursuant to the national policy declared 
in Republic Act No. 37, and the Secretary of Finance, in declaring all stalls or 
booths in any public market vacant and their lease terminated on January 1, 
1947, as provided in Section 2 of Department of Finance Order No. 32, simply 
recognized the day-to-day nature of the leases in question, asidefrom what is 
provided in Section 26 of Ordinance No. 2898 of Manila, known as the Market 
Code, as amended by Ordinance No. 2993, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>Citizenship of Stallholders</i>.â€”No person shall be 
permitted to engage in any form of business in the public markets of Manila 
other than citizens of the Philippines and of the United States, 
<i>Provided</i>, That foreigners having existing business in the said markets 
and duly licensed therefor are hereby given a grace of three years upon approval 
of this Ordinance to vacate the stalls they occupy."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the power granted by 
Section 2 of Republic Act No. 37 to the Secretary of Finance to promulgate rules 
is limited to strict conformity with the requirements of the statute, adding 
that the context of Republic Act No. 37 can be searched in vain for any 
provision authorizing the termination of all existing leases and the possible 
dispossession of all stallholders on January 1, 1947, and that the omission 
cannot be supplied by the Secretary of Finance.</p>
<p align="justify">We hold that the provision of Section 2 of Department of 
Finance Order No. 32 declaring that all stalls or booths in any public market 
shall be vacated by their occupants and their leases terminated on January 1, 
1947, has been issued to make effective the provisions of Republic Act No. 
37.</p>
<p align="justify">The main purpose of said act is to grant to Filipino citizens 
preference in the lease of public market stalls.</p>
<p align="justify">Congress decreed that the act shall take effect on January 1, 
1947, and empowered the Secretary of Finance to promulgate the necessary rules 
to carry into effect the purpose of the act that beginning January 1, 1947, if 
occupancy of any public market stall is applied for by Filipino citizens and by 
aliens, the same shall be awarded to the former. Department of Finance Order No. 
32, in declaring vacated all public market stalls as of January 1, 1947, had 
only made clear the legislative intent that from then on the preference given by 
Republic Act No. 37 to Filipino citizens shall be made effective. As a matter of 
fact, the declaration in said Department of Finance Order can be considered as a 
mere surplusage as, even without it, Filipino applicants would still be entitled 
to lease and occupy, beginning January 1, 1947, public market stalls then 
occupied by aliens.</p>
<p align="justify">Although appellees did not appeal against the trial court's 
decision, wherein the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 37 was upheld, they 
reproduce here their attack against the validity of said act, submitting before 
us long and elaborate printed brief and memorandum.</p>
<p align="justify">Public markets are public services or utilities as much as the 
public supply and sale of gas, gasoline, electricity, water and public 
transportation are. Under the Constitution, the operation of all public services 
are reserved to Filipino citizens and to corporations or associations sixty 
<i>per centum</i> of the capital of which belongs to Filipino citizens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"No franchise, certificate, or any other form of authorization 
for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to citizens of the 
Philippines or to corporations or other entities organized under the laws of the 
Philippines, sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by citizens of 
the Philippines, nor shall such franchise, certificates, or authorization be 
exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. No franchise or 
right shall be granted to any individual, firm, or corporation, except under the 
condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the 
Congress when the public interest so requires."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Foodstuffs sold in public markets demand, at least, as much 
official control and supervision as the commodities sold and distributed in 
other public utilities. They affect the life and health of the people, the 
safeguarding of which is one of the basic obligations of a constituted 
government. Official control and supervision can be exercised more effectively 
if public market stalls are occupied by citizens rather than by aliens.</p>
<p align="justify">In impugning the validity of Republic Act No. 37, appellees 
invoke general guarantees in the Bill of Rights, such as the due process of law 
and the equal protection of the laws. Even if their position could be supported 
under said general guarantees, a hypothesis the validity of which we consider 
unnecessary to decide, said guarantees have to give way to the specific 
provision above quoted, which reserves to Filipino citizens the operation of 
public services or utilities.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, the establishment, maintenance, and operation of 
public markets, as much as public works, are part of the functions of 
government. The privilege of participating in said functions, such as that of 
occupying public market stalls, is not among the fundamental rights or even 
among the general civil rights protected by the guarantees of the Bill of 
Rights. The exercise or enjoyment of public functions are reserved to a class of 
persons possessing the specific qualifications required by law. Such is the case 
of the privilege to vote, to occupy a government position, or to participate in 
public works. They are reserved exclusively to citizens. Public functions are 
powers of national sovereignty and it is elementary that such sovereignty be 
exercised exclusively by nationals.</p>
<p align="justify">Although foreigners are entitled to all the rights and 
privileges of friendly guests, they can not claim the right to enjoy privileges 
which by their nature belong exclusively to the hosts.</p>
<p align="justify">For all the foregoing, holding both Republic Act No. 37 and 
Department of Finance Order No. 32 valid, the appealed decision is reversed, and 
petition dismissed.</p>
