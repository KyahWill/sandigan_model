				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-8558, September 28, 1955</h4>
				<H3>LEODEGARIO BENGA-ORAS, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE EVANGELISTA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, FIRST BRANCH, CAPIZ AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to set aside the order of 
respondent judge entered on September 14, 1954 which denies the motion to 
dismiss filed by petitioner on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
<p>Norma Ballos, a girl fourteen years old, was allegedly abducted against her 
will by petitioner in the night of February 27, 1954 and so her father Silvestre 
filed a complaint for abduction against him before the Justice of the Peace 
Court of Pontevedra, Capiz. When the case was elevated to the court of first 
instance, the fiscal on May 18, 1954, filed an information for the same crime in 
accordance with law.</p>
<p>On August 6, 1954, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss challenging the 
jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the complaint which served as basis 
of the information was not signed by the offended party, who was already of the 
age of discernment, but merely by her father, and as such it did not confer 
jurisdiction upon the court. The fiscal objected to the motion in a well-written 
opposition, and on September 14, 1954, the court denied the motion. Hence this 
petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>The complaint which gave rise to the present case is predicated on Article 
344 of the Revised Penal Code the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall 
not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her 
parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been 
expressly pardoned by the above named persons, as the case may 
be."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the contention of petitioner that under the above legal provision the 
offended party has the preferential right to file the complaint even if she is a 
minor as long as she has the age of discernment and if she fails to do so, 
unless she is otherwise disqualified, the complaint does not confer jurisdiction 
upon the court. In support of his contention, he cites a decision of the Court 
of Appeals wherein this view was expressed: "The right to file is exclusively 
and successively reposed in the persons mentioned in said provision in the order 
in which they are named. The law gives the offended person a preferential right, 
placing him or her in the first rank for the filing of the complaint although he 
or she is not of age." (People <em>vs</em>. Mapotol, CA 35 Off. Gaz. No. 60 p. 
1153)</p>
<p>It appears however that the view above expressed has already been abandoned, 
the correct ruling being the one expressed by this Court in Tolentino 
<em>vs</em>. De la Costa, 66 Phil., 100,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to the effect that the law (Article 344 of 
the Revised Penal Code) "does not state or does not intend to state that the 
right of the offended party to file the complaint against the offender, in the 
cases mentioned, <em>is hers exclusively</em> in the sense that when she does 
not file the same, her parents, grandparents, or guardian cannot file it. What 
it means to say and what it in fact says is, that when <em>the offended party is 
a minor</em> and she does not file complaint, this may be done by her parents, 
grandparents or guardian, in the order named." (Italics supplied) Elaborating on 
this point, the Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code which contains the provisions that: 
'The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall not 
be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her 
parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor in any case, if the offender has been 
expressly pardoned by the above named persons, as the case may be', does not 
state or does not intend to state that the right of the offended party to file 
the complaint against the offender, in the cases mentioned, is hers exclusively 
in the sense that when she does not file the same, her parents, grandparents or 
guardian cannot file it. What it means to say and what it in fact says is, that 
when the offended party is a minor and she does not file the complaint, this may 
be done by her parents, grandparents or guardian, in the order named. It has 
thus been interpreted by this court in the case of United States <em>vs</em>. 
Bautista and in that of People vs. Roa, already cited, it having been held in 
the first of said cases that the preferred right of the offended party to take 
action against the offender, by filing the necessary complaint, is not exclusive 
of that of her parents, grandparents, or guardian, if she does not exercise it 
before reaching the age of majority. * * *</p>
<p>"We see no reason for altering this ruling, all the more so when it is 
considered that the offended party in the case under discussion is still a 
minor. She has not yet reached her 21 years at which majority begins, inasmuch 
as she was only 19 years on October 8, 1936 and, therefore, will not complete 
her 21 years until October, 1938. Alone, therefore, she is without capacity to 
protect herself, being, as she is, subject to the <em>patria potestas</em> and 
legal guardian ship of her parents."</p></blockquote>
<p>The case at bar comes squarely within the doctrine of the Tolentino case 
because here the offended party was still a minor when the complaint was filed. 
Her father was therefore within his right to file the complaint in the light of 
the doctrine we have mentioned. Of course, if she is already of age and is in 
complete possession of her mental and physical faculties no one would dispute 
her paramount right to avenge the wrong done to the exclusion of her parents and 
other relatives mentioned in the law, as was stated in the case of U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. De la Costa, 9 Phil., 22. It is true that in U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Bautista, 40 Phil., 735, this Court declared that a complaint filed by a minor 
confers jurisdiction upon the court, but such ruling merely passed upon the 
issue touching on the validity of a complaint filed by a minor and not on the 
question whether a complaint filed by her parents, she being a minor, is valid 
or not. On the contrary, from the context of the decision it may be inferred 
that if the offended party, who is under age, does not file or does not want to 
file the complaint against her offender, her parents may do so "being under 
obligation to render protection to those under their power and lawful 
guardianship and to represent them in the exercise of all the actions which may 
redound to their benefit."</p>
<p>The right of the parents to take action to vindicate the wrong done to their 
minor children and to 4he whole family is justified by Groizard in the following 
wise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now then, if according to the civil law, it is the father and in his absence 
the mother, and in the absence of both the guardian, to whom belongs the right 
to represent a minor in the exercise of all the actions which redound for his 
benefit; and if, according to the procedural law, a minor cannot appear at the 
hearing without his personal incapacity being substituted by the authority of 
the parents or guardian, how can it be admitted, against what sound principles 
teach, positive legislation has established and science has exalted, that the 
legislator has here intended to make a very serious exception, destitute of all 
foundations and full of dangers and fatal consequences to a minor? This is 
inadmissible, and, therefore, under sound interpretation, the spirit of the law 
must in this case prevail over its letter. If this opinion need greater support, 
it would be found on the very ground that moved our, and almost all foreign, 
legislators to put unsurmountable obstacles to the public prosecution for the 
crime of seduction, subjecting, up to a certain point, by very special reasons, 
the general interest—consisting of the prosecution and punishment of all 
crimes—to the interest of the aggrieved party and her family in that their vice 
or faults, their fame and honor may not be exposed to the public nor to the 
heated controversies before the courts of justice. * * *" (U. S. <em>vs</em>.
