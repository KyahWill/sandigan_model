				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 21 August 1954 Lee Suan Ay, a Chinese&nbsp; citizen, arrived in the Philippines and was&nbsp; admitted and authorized to stay as a temporary&nbsp; visitor for a period of three months, which was extended to 25&nbsp; March 1955.&nbsp; Before her&nbsp; arrival&nbsp; or on&nbsp; 20 July&nbsp; 1954, Lee Chiao, her father, posted a cash bond in the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P10,000 (Annex&nbsp; A) to&nbsp; guarantee&nbsp; the&nbsp; compliance by&nbsp; the&nbsp; temporary&nbsp; visitor and the bondsman with&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms and conditions&nbsp; of her stay in the Philippines, set for in&nbsp; the bondman's written undertaking (Annex B).&nbsp; On 18 March 1955, Alberto Tan (a Filipino citizen) and Lee Suan Ay requested the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; of Las Piñas,&nbsp; Rizal, to join them in marriage but the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; do so, because as she was over 18 but under 23 years of age, she had to obtain parental advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 28 March 1955, the bondsman wrote a letter informing the Commissioner of Immigration that his daughter was ill and confined at the Chinese&nbsp; General Hospital since 21 March 1955 and that as she might collapse&nbsp; during the return trip to Hongkong,&nbsp; she deferred her departure set for 23 March, and requesting that she be granted ten days extension of her authorized period of temporary stay in the Philippines&nbsp; to enable her to rest and&nbsp; recuperate&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; C).&nbsp; On 1&nbsp; April&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; Lee Suan Ay&nbsp; and Alberto Tan were joined in marriage by the Justice of the Peace of Las Piñas,&nbsp; Rizal (Annex D).&nbsp; After their marriage,&nbsp; they received a letter from the Commissioner of Immigration dated&nbsp; 1 April 1955 denying their petition for extension of her temporary&nbsp; stay in the Philippines&nbsp; and declaring the&nbsp; cash bond of P10,000 posted&nbsp; by Lee Chiao&nbsp; forfeited in favor of the Government (Annex E).&nbsp; On 11 April 1955, Lee Chiao asked for reconsideration of the order of forfeiture&nbsp; of the cash bond on the ground&nbsp; that having married a Filipino citizen,&nbsp; Lee&nbsp; Suan Ay follows the citizenship of her&nbsp; husband and ceased&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; an alien temporary visitor, and that for that reason the cash bond filed should be returned to him;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; her failure to present herself to the Commissioner of Immigration within 24 hours from&nbsp; receipt of notice&nbsp; was due to illness&nbsp; and loss of weight&nbsp; (Annex F).&nbsp; The petition for reconsideration&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; G).&nbsp; Notwithstanding repeated demands the defendants, the Commissioner of Immigration, the Accounting Officer of the Bureau of Immigration, the&nbsp; Auditor&nbsp; General&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Treasurer of the Philippines, refused and&nbsp; still refuse&nbsp; to return to the plaintiff Lee Chiao the sum forfeited.&nbsp; Upon the foregoing allegations in their complaint filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of First In stance of Manila on 27 June 1956, the plaintiffs pray that the&nbsp; defendants be ordered&nbsp; to refund to Lee Chiao the sum of P10,000 forfeited to&nbsp; the Government, or to reduce the forfeiture to&nbsp; P1,000; and that they be&nbsp; granted other just and&nbsp; equitable relief (Civil No. 30056).<br><br>On 11&nbsp; July 1956,&nbsp; the defendants moved for the&nbsp; dis missal of the complaint&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground that it states no cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action.&nbsp; In support of their motion they aver that the forfeiture of the cash bond was valid and&nbsp; legal because of the failure of the bondsman to cause or effect the departure of Lee Suan&nbsp; Ay upon termination&nbsp; of her temporary stay&nbsp; (25 March&nbsp; 1955)&nbsp; and to present&nbsp; her to the Bureau of Immigration&nbsp; within 24 hours from&nbsp; receipt of notice, in&nbsp; violation of the terms and conditions of the undertaking on the bond (Annex&nbsp; B).<br><br>On 14 July 1952 the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss; on 19 July the defendants a rejoinder to the plaintiffs' opposition. On 11 November 1956, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, but left the reduction&nbsp; of the bond to the sound discretion&nbsp; of the Commissioner of Immigration.<br><br>The plaintiffs have appealed.<br><br>The pertinent terms and conditions of the bond&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; B), provide:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned has&nbsp; made a cash&nbsp; bond of P10,000.00,&nbsp; Philippine currency with the Bureau of Immigration (O.R. No. 6729734,&nbsp; dated July 20, 1954), which cash bond is subject to the following conditions:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That the undersigned&nbsp; undertakes&nbsp; to make Lee&nbsp; Suan Ay at all times available&nbsp; to and&nbsp; to present&nbsp; her within 24 hours after receipt of notice to produce before the immigration authorities for the investigation of his or her right to further stay in the Philippines.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) That in&nbsp; case&nbsp; Lee&nbsp; Suan Ay, after such inquiry is found to have violated any limitation or&nbsp; condition&nbsp; under which he or she was admitted as non-immigrant&nbsp; and is subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; deportation, the undersigned undertakes to produce him or her for deportation within&nbsp; 24&nbsp; hours after receipt of demand to do so.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>) * *&nbsp; *<br><br>That the undersigned was duly informed&nbsp; and fully understands (1) that no temporary visitor or transient&nbsp; can during&nbsp; the period of her temporary&nbsp; stay request for a change of her status into a permanent&nbsp; one; (2) that no application for extension of temporary stay of said temporary visitor or&nbsp; transient shall be entertained unless&nbsp; the&nbsp; same is filed with the Office in&nbsp; charge at the&nbsp; port of arrival&nbsp; not&nbsp; less&nbsp; than seven (7)&nbsp; days nor more&nbsp; than fourteen&nbsp; (14) days prior&nbsp; to the expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the time fixed for her departure from the&nbsp; Philippines; (3)&nbsp; that,&nbsp; except&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases provided&nbsp; by law, no&nbsp; extension or temporary stay will be granted to a temporary visitor&nbsp; or transient&nbsp; if she&nbsp; has stayed in the Philippines&nbsp; for one year from the date of entry; and that&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; no application for extension shall also&nbsp; be granted unless the temporary&nbsp; visitor's&nbsp; or transient's&nbsp; passport&nbsp; is valid for a period of thirty days after the expiration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; requested extension.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>)*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>That breach of any of the conditions above-mentioned shall entitle the Commissioner of&nbsp; Immigration&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare this cash bond or part thereof&nbsp; forfeited,&nbsp; but shall not release&nbsp; the&nbsp; undersigned from the obligation to produce said Lee Suan Ay for such, action as may be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; against her.&nbsp; No modification of this agreement shall be valid and effective unless made in&nbsp; writing and signed&nbsp; by the Commissioner of Immigration or his duly authorized representatives.&nbsp; (Pp. 10-14,&nbsp; Rec. on App.)</blockquote>In his&nbsp; letter to the appellant Lee Chiao, dated 1 April 1955, the appellee Commissioner of&nbsp; Immigration recites the following facts and circumstances leading&nbsp; to the forfeiture of the cash bond:<br><blockquote>* * * I would like&nbsp; to call your attention to the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; your daughter Lee Suan Ay, arrived in the&nbsp; Philippines on August 21, 1954, as a&nbsp; temporary visitor for a three month stay.&nbsp; On November 5, 1954, you petitioned for&nbsp; an&nbsp; extension&nbsp; and the same was favorably considered by the Honorable, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, granting your daughter an extension up to January 21, 1955, under the conditions that her reentry permit to&nbsp; Hongkong and her cash bond continue to be valid.&nbsp; On January 28, 1955, you again requested&nbsp; for an extension of five more days from the expiration of her stay on January 31, 1955&nbsp; and the&nbsp; same was again granted by the Honorable, the Secretary&nbsp; of Foreign Affairs "provided further that she present a confirmed booking or airline ticket&nbsp; on&nbsp; an airplane which takes her to Hongkong on February 6, 1955."<br><br>In spite of the terms of the above last extension granted your daughter, on&nbsp; February 1, 1955,&nbsp; you again petitioned for&nbsp; a three months extension, counted from February 5, 1955, manifesting that the cash&nbsp; bond of P10,000.00&nbsp; to&nbsp; guarantee her&nbsp; departure&nbsp; will be kept&nbsp; valid and promising&nbsp; that ten&nbsp; days before her scheduled&nbsp; departure to Hongkong, you&nbsp; will present&nbsp; a confirmed booking or air line ticket duly paid for her trip&nbsp; to Hongkong.&nbsp; On February 7, 1955,&nbsp; you were properly notified that&nbsp; they stay up&nbsp; to&nbsp; March&nbsp; 25, 1955&nbsp; was granted by the&nbsp; Department of&nbsp; Foreign&nbsp; Affairs,&nbsp; and as a matter of fact, you&nbsp; presented from the Philippine Airlines&nbsp; (a confirmed booking)&nbsp; dated&nbsp; February 7,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; showing&nbsp; that&nbsp; Lee Suan&nbsp; Ay was booked on Flight No. 304 leaving Manila for Hongkong&nbsp; on March 23, 1955.<br><br>Rather&nbsp; (than)&nbsp; comply with the terms and conditions of the last extension above referred to, on March 1, 1955, you again requested for&nbsp; another&nbsp; extension of three months, which, however, was denied by the&nbsp; Honorable, the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Foreign&nbsp; Affairs, in their&nbsp; indorsement of&nbsp; March&nbsp; 22, 1955.<br><br>It will thus clearly appear that&nbsp; Lee&nbsp; Suan&nbsp; Ay is&nbsp; now illegally in this&nbsp; country for staying beyond her&nbsp; authorized stay.<br><br>In a letter dated March&nbsp; 26, 1955 this Bureau instructed&nbsp; you to present&nbsp; the person of Lee Suan Ay within twenty-four hours after receipt hereof, with the admonition that upon your&nbsp; failure to&nbsp; do so, the cash bond in the amount of P10,000.00 covered by your undertaking&nbsp; for her temporary release will be confiscated.&nbsp; Rather than comply with this instruction, you wrote us on March 28, 1955, informing us that your daughter "has been confined at the Chinese General&nbsp; Hospital since March&nbsp; 21, 1955 and I am afraid&nbsp; she might collapse&nbsp; during her trip to Hongkong so I deferred her leaving scheduled on the&nbsp; 23rd," and&nbsp; requested&nbsp; this Office for&nbsp; a ten-day period within which to prepare for departure.&nbsp; A verification made on your allegation showed, however,&nbsp; that contrary&nbsp; to said&nbsp; allegation&nbsp; that she has&nbsp; been&nbsp; confined at the&nbsp; Chinese General Hospital since March&nbsp; 21, 1955, she was admitted&nbsp; thereat only for one day and&nbsp; that was&nbsp; on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; for&nbsp; some&nbsp; abdominal ailment. The&nbsp; Medical&nbsp; Officer further&nbsp; reported "that Lee Suan&nbsp; Ay is fairly strong and can walk without complaint.&nbsp; Her heart is normal and so is her pulse and that there is no tenderness at the abdomen. There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; jaundice&nbsp; or anemia.&nbsp; She is fairly&nbsp; strong and fit to travel."&nbsp; (Annex E, pp. 19-22, Rec. on App.)<br></blockquote>The foregoing reasons advanced&nbsp; by the Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; justify the order&nbsp; of forfeiture of the cash bond&nbsp; posted by Lee Chiao.<br><br>The appellants claim that "the breach of any condition does not<span style="font-style: italic;"> ipso facto</span> forfeit the cash bond.&nbsp; Or better still, the violation is not the operative act of&nbsp; confiscation." Furthermore, he claims "that a declaration of confiscation is necessary to confiscate the cash bond."&nbsp; Upon expiration&nbsp; of the appellant Lee Suan Ay's authorized period of temporary stay in the Philippines&nbsp; (25 March 1955), on 26 March 1955 the Commissioner of Immigration asked the bondsman to present her to the&nbsp; Bureau of Immigration within 24 hours&nbsp; from&nbsp; receipt of&nbsp; notice,&nbsp; otherwise the bond would be confiscated (Annex 1).&nbsp; For failure&nbsp; of the bondsman to comply with the foregoing order, on 1 April 1955 the Commissioner of Immigration ordered the cash bond confiscated&nbsp; (Annex E).&nbsp; Therefore, there&nbsp; was&nbsp; an order&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the Commissioner of Immigration confiscating or&nbsp; forfeiting the cash bond.&nbsp; Unlike in forfeiture of bail bonds in criminal proceedings, where the Court must&nbsp; enter&nbsp; an order&nbsp; forfeiting the bail bond&nbsp; and the bondsman must be given an opportunity&nbsp; to present his principal or give&nbsp; a&nbsp; satisfactory reason for his&nbsp; inability to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, before final&nbsp; judgment may&nbsp; be&nbsp; entered against the bondsman<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in forfeiture of bonds posted for&nbsp; the temporary stay of an alien in the Philippines, no court proceeding&nbsp; is necessary.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; a breach&nbsp; of&nbsp; the terms and conditions of the&nbsp; undertaking in the&nbsp; bond is committed, the Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; may, under the&nbsp; terms and conditions thereat declare it forfeited in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the Government.<br><br>The fact that Lee Suan Ay&nbsp; was married to a Filipino citizen&nbsp; does not&nbsp; relieve the&nbsp; bondsman from his liability on the&nbsp; bond.&nbsp; The marriage took place on 1 April 1955, and the violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms and conditions of the undertaking in the bond—failure to depart from&nbsp; the Philippines upon expiration of her authorized period of temporary stay in&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; (25 March 1955) and failure to report to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration within 24 hours&nbsp; from receipt of notice—were&nbsp; committed before the&nbsp; marriage.&nbsp; Moreover, the marriage of a Filipino&nbsp; citizen to an&nbsp; alien&nbsp; does&nbsp; not automatically confer Philippine citizenship&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp; She must possess the qualifications required&nbsp; by law to become&nbsp; a Filipino citizen by naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; There is no showing that the appellant Lee Suan Ay possesses all the qualifications and none&nbsp; of the disqualifications provided for by law to become a&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; citizen by&nbsp; naturalization.<br><br>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
