				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">.On July&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1954, Gaudencio Manigbas and eleven others were charged with murder before the Justice of the Peace Court of Rosario,&nbsp; Batangas by&nbsp; Captain&nbsp; Epigenio Navarro, commanding officer of a constabulary&nbsp; detachment stationed in Alangilang, Batangas,&nbsp; Batangas.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint was later amended by including one Miguel Almario.<br><br>Three days after the, filing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; original complaint, counsel for the accused moved that they be granted bail for their provisional liberty&nbsp; and,&nbsp; on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the court issued&nbsp; an order&nbsp; wherein, after reconsidering its previous order denying bail to all, allowed to some the right to bail and denied to others.&nbsp; Both defense and prosecution filed a motion for reconsideration, the&nbsp; former asking that all the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted bail while&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter pleading that all of them be denied because the&nbsp; justice of the peace court has no jurisdiction to grant bail in eases involving, capital&nbsp; offenses.&nbsp; On July 21, 1954, the court&nbsp; entered an order setting aside&nbsp; its order of July 19, 1954.and restoring, its original order denying bail to all the accused for the reason that "in a long&nbsp; series of decisions promulgated by our Supreme Court in connection with&nbsp; the granting of bail to a person charged with a capital offense which were carefully&nbsp; examined&nbsp; by this court,&nbsp; there is not a&nbsp; single case wherein the Justice of the Peace Court entertained a petition for bail for a person charged&nbsp; with a capital offense and thereafter hear the evidence to&nbsp; determine whether the same is strong or not so as to warrant the giving of bail."<br><br>Upon receipt of&nbsp; a copy of the aforesaid&nbsp; order, counsel for the defense filed with the Court of First Instance of Batangas, sitting in&nbsp; Lipa City, a petition for mandamus seeking in effect to compel the justice of the peace court of Rosario to&nbsp; receive evidence to&nbsp; determine if the same warrants the granting of bail&nbsp; to the&nbsp; accused. After the provincial commander and the&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the peace put in their answers, the court on August 24,&nbsp; 1954 granted .the petition holding that respondent justice of the peace court has authority to grant bail&nbsp; even if the charge involves a capital offense and ordering&nbsp; said court to act on the application&nbsp; for&nbsp; bail. Hence&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>Before proceeding&nbsp; to discuss the&nbsp; merits of the presents controversy, there is&nbsp; need to dwell on a point of procedure which came up during the deliberation of this case.&nbsp; This has reference to the fact that, according to the record,&nbsp; the accused who have interposed this&nbsp; petition for mandamus are still at&nbsp; large for so far no order has been issued&nbsp; for their&nbsp; arrest.&nbsp; The record discloses that immediately upon the filing, of the charge against them they applied for bail and their motion was immediately acted&nbsp; upon by the justice of the peace.&nbsp; And the denial of the bail eventually led to the filing of the&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition for mandamus.<br><br>We&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; this petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; premature&nbsp; for&nbsp; its purpose is to compel the performance of a&nbsp; duty whjeh does not exist there being no correlative right&nbsp; the use Sir enjoyment&nbsp; of it has been denied&nbsp; which may be the subject of mandamus&nbsp; (section 67, Rule 3) ;&nbsp; and this is so because the right to&nbsp; bail only accrues&nbsp; when a person is&nbsp; arrested. or deprived&nbsp; of his liberty.&nbsp; The&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; bail&nbsp; is to secure one's release and it would be incongruous to grant bail to one&nbsp; who&nbsp; is.&nbsp; free.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus; "bail is&nbsp; the security&nbsp; required and given for the release of a person who is in&nbsp; the custody of the law"&nbsp; (Rule 110, section 1), and evidently the accused do not come&nbsp; within&nbsp; its&nbsp; purview.&nbsp; We&nbsp; could therefore dismiss this&nbsp; petition on this score alone were it not for&nbsp; the importance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the issue now&nbsp; before&nbsp;&nbsp; us which requires proper&nbsp; elucidation&nbsp; for&nbsp; the guidance of&nbsp; all justices of the peace who may be found in&nbsp; similar predicament.<br><br>The issue to be determined is whether&nbsp; a justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; can, in a&nbsp; case involving a&nbsp; capital offense, act&nbsp; on an application&nbsp; for bail and&nbsp; receive evidence to determine if the evidence of guilt is strong or otherwise grant bail if the evidence so&nbsp; warrants.<br><br>&nbsp;Under our Constitution, all accused persons before conviction are entitled to bail except those charged with capital offenses when&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; guilt is strong&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; III, section 1, paragraph 16).&nbsp; Under our rules, in non-capital offenses, after judgment by a justice of the&nbsp; peace and before conviction by the&nbsp; court of first&nbsp; instance, an&nbsp; accused is entitled to bail as a matter of right (Rule 110, section&nbsp; 3);. but,&nbsp; "after conviction by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance, defendant may, upon application, be bailed at the discretion of the court."&nbsp; (Rule 110, section 4.)&nbsp; And implementing&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision of our Constitution,&nbsp; the rule also provides that "No person in&nbsp; custody for&nbsp; the commission of a capital offense shall be admitted to bail if the evidence of&nbsp; his&nbsp; guilt&nbsp; is strong"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rule 110,&nbsp; section 6). The burden of&nbsp; showing that the evidence of guilt is strong is on the prosecution (Rule 110, section 7).<br><br>While as a general rule it may be stated that an application for bail may be acted upon&nbsp; by the court which has cognizance of the1 case regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; whether it involves a capital&nbsp; offense&nbsp; ,or not, (Peralta vs. Ramos, 71 Phil.,&nbsp; 271) and as a general proposition we may concede that justices of the peace before whom a case&nbsp; is&nbsp; initiated by the filing of the corresponding complaint or information have also authority to&nbsp; entertain petitions&nbsp; for bail in&nbsp; cases involving non-capital offenses as to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; are entitled to bail as a matter of right, however, doubt' is entertained as to whether said justices of the&nbsp; peace can likewise entertain bail while the cases are under&nbsp; their&nbsp; control if&nbsp; they involve&nbsp; capital offenses like the one under consideration. This doubt has arisen&nbsp; because&nbsp; the law&nbsp; and&nbsp; the rules&nbsp; on the matter are not explicit enough and our jurisprudence has&nbsp; not so&nbsp; far&nbsp; laid down a, clear-cut&nbsp; ruling clarifying this point in this jurisdiction.<br><br>In the United States "it may be stated as a&nbsp; general rule that all judicial officers having the power to&nbsp; hear and determine cases have the power to take bail."&nbsp; It is&nbsp; regarded as "a necessary&nbsp; incident to the right to hear and determine the cause"&nbsp; (6 Am. Jur., p. 67).&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; with particular reference to&nbsp; justices of the peace, the general rule&nbsp; is that "where,&nbsp; under the&nbsp; statutes,&nbsp; justices of the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; have power as examining magistrates,&nbsp; with power&nbsp; of commitment, they may in&nbsp; their discretion admit to bail"; except, where their power to "take bail"&nbsp; is limited by the Constitution, or by statute, in which case "they must act within the&nbsp; express&nbsp; or implied limitations thereby laid&nbsp; down" (6 C. J.,&nbsp; 973-974).&nbsp;&nbsp; But the prevailing rule is that "inferior officers vested only with the power to commit cannot, without&nbsp; express&nbsp; legislative enactment,&nbsp; take bail in&nbsp; capital offenses,&nbsp; for the determination of the sufficiency&nbsp; of the evidence in such cases, in order to entitle the accused to bail, is a -matter of the greatest importance both to the accused and to the&nbsp; state and is&nbsp; the&nbsp; appropriate province&nbsp; of the court entrusted with the trial of such cases"&nbsp; (6 Am.&nbsp; Jur., p. 67). <br><br>Considering the general rule that justices&nbsp; of the peace have the&nbsp; power&nbsp; as examining magistrates to commit&nbsp; and in their discretion admit to&nbsp; bail&nbsp; an accused person&nbsp; unless&nbsp; such power is limited by the Constitution&nbsp; or by statute, can&nbsp; we say&nbsp; that in&nbsp; this jurisdiction our justices&nbsp; of the peace&nbsp; have&nbsp; also&nbsp; the power to admit to bail&nbsp; a person accused of a capital offense?<br><br>Our answer must of necessity be in the affirmative not only because there is no such limitation in our Constitution but because the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1948 seems to expressly confer this power&nbsp; upon&nbsp; them.&nbsp; We refer to sections 87 and 91 of said Act relative to the power&nbsp; of justices of the&nbsp; peace to conduct preliminary investigations and&nbsp; the incidental powers they&nbsp; may&nbsp; exercise in relation thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first section provides that the justices of the peace&nbsp; may&nbsp; conduct preliminary&nbsp; investigations&nbsp; "<i>for&nbsp; any </i>offense alleged to have been committed within their respective&nbsp; municipalities *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; without regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the limits of punishment, and&nbsp; may release,&nbsp; or commit and <i>bind over any person charged with such offense to secure his appearance' before&nbsp; the proper court."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; And section 91 provides&nbsp; that the same justices of the peace may "require of any person arrested a bond for good behavior or to keep&nbsp; the peace, or for the further appearance of such person before a court of competent jurisdiction."&nbsp;&nbsp; The only limitation to&nbsp; this power&nbsp; is that the bond must be approved by that court.<br><br>These provisions are broad enough to confer upon justices of the peace the authority to grant bail to persons accused even of capital offenses for such is the only meaning that we can give to the phrase&nbsp; "bind over any person&nbsp; charged with such offense to secure his appearance before the proper court."&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the meaning of bail&nbsp; as defined&nbsp; in section 1 of Rule 110.<br><br>Some apprehension has&nbsp; been expressed by&nbsp; some&nbsp; members of the Court over the fact that if such power&nbsp; is given to justices of the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; in capital cases the power may&nbsp; be abused or improperly exercised considering the fact that some of them are not lawyers or are politicians&nbsp; like the mayors&nbsp; who may&nbsp; act under the law when the incumbent justices are&nbsp; temporarily absent&nbsp;&nbsp; (section&nbsp; B,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 108). While the possibility of abuse cannot be denied such cannot argue against the existence of the power and&nbsp; if there is need&nbsp; for a remedy such devolves upon Congress.&nbsp; But before&nbsp; such curative&nbsp; measure is&nbsp; adopted, our duty is&nbsp; to apply the law as&nbsp; we see it regardless of its implications. And in&nbsp; the event that&nbsp; an&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; is committed, the&nbsp; situation is not without a remedy. The government&nbsp; can immediately take steps to obtain appropriate relief and, we are sure,&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; court will not&nbsp; deny&nbsp; prompt action when necessary to promote the&nbsp; interests of justice. We are therefore&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that respondent justice&nbsp; of the peace can act on&nbsp; the application&nbsp; for bail taking into account the evidence that may be presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; In this respect the order&nbsp; appealed from is correct.<br><br>Considering tl at the&nbsp; petition for mandamus is premature, the&nbsp; same should&nbsp; be&nbsp; dismissed with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against petitioners.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Jugo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><center><br><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING AND&nbsp; DISSENTING:</span><br></center><br><br><b>MONTEMAYOR, J., </b><br><br>In so far&nbsp; as the majority&nbsp; opinion dismisses the petition for mandamus for&nbsp; being premature, I concur&nbsp; in&nbsp; it. But where&nbsp; it holds&nbsp; and&nbsp; lays down the doctrine&nbsp; that a Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; may entertain and. act&nbsp; upon petitions&nbsp; for bail&nbsp; in capital offense&nbsp; cases, I dissent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is that a Justice of the Peace Court has a&nbsp; limited criminal&nbsp; .jurisdiction&nbsp; and&nbsp; is allowed to try and&nbsp; decide only minor or petty offenses; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a court of record; and until the present, in&nbsp; some towns&nbsp; or&nbsp; districts the judicial officer presiding&nbsp; over it,&nbsp; is not even a member of&nbsp; the bar,&nbsp; and&nbsp; although he&nbsp; may&nbsp; have studied law, he has limited legal&nbsp; training,&nbsp; experience&nbsp; and knowledge of the law,&nbsp; especially that of&nbsp; evidence, and is&nbsp; not qualified and in a position to.receive, pass upon and weigh evidence submitted to determine whether the evidence for&nbsp; the prosecution&nbsp; is&nbsp; strong,&nbsp; as provided by law.&nbsp; The very majority opinion in&nbsp; part says:<br><blockquote>"But the prevailing rule is that 'inferior officers vested only with the power&nbsp; to commit cannot, without&nbsp; express&nbsp; legislative enactment, take bait in capital offenses, for <i>the determination of&nbsp; the sufficiency of the evidence</i> in such cases, in order to entitle the accused to bail, <i>is a matter of the greatest&nbsp; importance&nbsp; both to the accused and to the state and is the appropriate province of the court entrusted with the trial of such cases' </i> (6 Am. Jur., 67)." (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)<br></blockquote>That is partly&nbsp; correct. The complete rule&nbsp; seems to be that stated&nbsp; in Ex-parte Kittrel,&nbsp; 20&nbsp; Ark. 400 where the Court&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; * To hear the showing and determine upon&nbsp; the sufficiency in cases of so much magnitude is a matter of the greatest importance, both&nbsp; to&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; and to the state, and would&nbsp; seem&nbsp; to be the appropriate&nbsp; province&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court or&nbsp; judge in trusted, by&nbsp; the Constitution, with the trial of such causes; and in&nbsp; the absence of any <span style="font-style: italic;">clear and&nbsp; explicit act attempting to confer upon inferior </span>officers authority to hear and. determine&nbsp; a matter of so much&nbsp; consequence in&nbsp; the&nbsp; progress of&nbsp; capital cases, we are disposed&nbsp; to&nbsp; doubt that such was the.intention of the legislature."&nbsp; (39 L.E.A. NS 768.) (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Now, is there any law, clear and <i>explicit</i> conferring&nbsp; upon a justice&nbsp; of the Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; and authority to hear&nbsp; and determine&nbsp; applications&nbsp; for bail in&nbsp; cases involving capital&nbsp; offense?&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; majority opinion&nbsp; claims that&nbsp; there is such a&nbsp; law.—sections&nbsp; 87&nbsp; and&nbsp; 91&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Judiciary Act of 1948; and says:<br><blockquote>"* * *. The first&nbsp; section provides that the justices&nbsp; of the peace may conduct preliminary investigations <span style="font-style: italic;">for any&nbsp; offense</span> alleged to have been committed within&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; municipalities * * * without regard to&nbsp; the limits of punishments, and may release, or commit&nbsp; and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">bind over any person charged with such offense to secure&nbsp; his appearance before&nbsp; the proper court.'&nbsp;</span> And section 91 provides that the same justices of the peace may require of any person arrested a bond for good behavior or to keep&nbsp; the peace, o<span style="font-style: italic;">r for the further appearance of such person&nbsp; before a court of competent&nbsp; jurisdiction'</span>&nbsp; The only&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; to this power is&nbsp; that the bond must be approved by that court.&nbsp; These provisions are broad enough to confer upon justices of the peace the authority&nbsp; to grant bail to persons&nbsp; accused even of capital offenses for such is the only meaning&nbsp; that we can&nbsp; give to&nbsp; the phrase&nbsp; 'bind over any person charged with such&nbsp; offense to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; his&nbsp; appearance before the proper court."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; will be&nbsp; noticed that&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority's whole claim or argument by reason of the above provisions rests&nbsp; mainly, if not entirely on the phrase "bind over" which according to&nbsp; Vol.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; Bouvier's&nbsp; Law Dictionary, p. 365,&nbsp; is "the act by, which&nbsp; a&nbsp; magistrate&nbsp; or court&nbsp; hold to bail&nbsp; a- party accused of a crime or misdemeanor". But the phrase "bind over" does not stand alone in section 87 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is connected&nbsp; with the&nbsp; word&nbsp; "commit;", the whole phrase being "commit and bind over".&nbsp; According to Vol. I, Bouvier's Law Dictionary, p. 550, "commitment"&nbsp; is defined&nbsp; as "the&nbsp; warrant or order&nbsp; by which&nbsp; a court or magistrate directs a ministerial officer&nbsp; to&nbsp; take a&nbsp; person to prison," or "the act of sending&nbsp; a person to prison by means of such&nbsp; a warrant or order."&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, the law&nbsp; says that the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; may admit a party accused of&nbsp; a crime or&nbsp; misdemeanor to&nbsp; bail and send that same party to jail. ' If the coordinating word "or"&nbsp; were used&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; word "commit" and&nbsp; the phrase "bind over", then there would be offered an&nbsp; alternative or choice of either, that is to say, a magistrate may commit one to jail or admit him to bail.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the law used the conjunction "and" which would seem to mean that the magistrate must do both and not only one of them.&nbsp; What the Legislature&nbsp; meant by the phrase "commit&nbsp; and bind over" is not only not clear&nbsp; but doubtful&nbsp; and we cannot say that the law is <span style="font-style: italic;">clear</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">explicit</span> in authorizing a Justice of the Peace to grant bail in capital offenses. The majority opinion itself admits "that the law and the rules are not explicit enough".&nbsp;&nbsp; Even assuming that the phrase could be interpreted to mean that the Justice of the Peace may put in jail or admit to bail, it may well be&nbsp; that such authority extends only to non-capital&nbsp; offenses, where the accused is&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to bail as a matter of&nbsp; right and not to cases where admission to&nbsp; bail is a matter of discretion (Rule 110 section 8).&nbsp; The majority claims that the legal provisions&nbsp; are broad enough.&nbsp; Indeed they are broad, too broad and&nbsp; vague, and to me&nbsp; far from clear and explicit. Nowhere in sections 87&nbsp; and 91 of the Judiciary Act can we find a single word, phrase or clause mentioning or referring even remotely to capital offenses.&nbsp; So, under the rule 1 have cited&nbsp; and reproduced,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of a "clear and&nbsp; explicit Act attempting to confer upon inferior officers&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; hear and determine&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp; so much consequence in the progress of capital&nbsp; cases" (petition for bail) the&nbsp; conclusion must be that&nbsp; said inferior officers&nbsp; have not such authority.<br><br>Let us start with the fact that&nbsp; a Justice&nbsp; oi the Peace Court is not a court of record.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; stenographer to take down the evidence submitted before it. So, if said court acting upon a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for bail in a capital offense case grants bail on the&nbsp; ground that the evidence for the prosecution is&nbsp; not strong or, on the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, denies bail on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that said&nbsp; evidence for the prosecution is strong, it would be&nbsp; difficult, if not impossible,&nbsp; to appeal from said order&nbsp; or to correct it thru certiorari proceedings on the ground of abuse of discretion, for the simple reason that the appellate court where the appeal is taken nor where the extraordinary legal&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; is sought, cannot review the&nbsp; evidence received by, the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace&nbsp; Court to determine whether or not it abused its discretion, because there is no&nbsp; record of such evidence.<br><br>It is true that a Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace may conduct preliminary investigation of any criminal case regardless of the&nbsp; seriousness&nbsp; thereof and&nbsp; the penalty attached&nbsp; to&nbsp; it. For that matter even the town mayor may also be' called upon to&nbsp; conduct said preliminary&nbsp; investigation.&nbsp; Section 3, Rule 108&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of Court provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 3. <i>Preliminary&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; by&nbsp; the municipal mayor.</i>-—In case of temporary&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of both the justice of the peace and&nbsp; the auxiliary justice from the municipality,, town, or place wherein they exercise their jurisdiction, the municipal&nbsp; mayor shall make the preliminary investigation in criminal cases, when such investigation cannot be delayed without prejudice to the interest of&nbsp; justice.&nbsp; He shall make a report of any preliminary investigation so made to the justice of the peace or ,to the auxiliary justice immediately upon the return of one or the&nbsp; other. He shall have authority in such cases to order the arrest of&nbsp; the defendant and to grant, him&nbsp; bail in the manner and cases&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; Rule 110." <br></blockquote>Under the above provision, a mayor may conduct&nbsp; a preliminary investigation&nbsp; and may grant bail under Rule 110. But we should bear&nbsp; in&nbsp; mind that in a preliminary investigation said court determines only the&nbsp; existence or&nbsp; absence of probable&nbsp; cause and then decides&nbsp; whether to dismiss the case or to elevate&nbsp; the&nbsp; same to the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to determine whether a person&nbsp; accused of a capital&nbsp; offense is entitled to&nbsp; bail, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; determines not only probable cause but also whether the evidence for the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; is strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; make this&nbsp; determination involves a careful appraisal and weighing of the evidence, not only&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution but&nbsp; also that of the defense, . for the reason that the evidence&nbsp; of the prosecution alone may be strong but when considered and&nbsp; weighed&nbsp; against that of the&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; it. may be&nbsp; weak.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this appraisal and weighing of the evidence the court&nbsp; must pass upon and decide many legal points&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; legal&nbsp; training,&nbsp; experience,&nbsp; and knowledge if&nbsp; not mastery of the law of evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must&nbsp; determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; admissibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; written statements&nbsp; and&nbsp; confessions&nbsp; claimed by&nbsp; the defense&nbsp; to have been extorted thru force, intimidation, torture or promise of&nbsp; reward.&nbsp; It must determine whether statements, verbal or written, made by the murder victim may be considered as a dying declaration, whether or not spontaneous statements or exclamations uttered by him are part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">res gestae,</span> to determine their&nbsp; competence and&nbsp; admissibility. It must be able to tell if the crime committed is murder or simple homicide&nbsp; for&nbsp; if the latter, then it is&nbsp; not a capital offense and so the accused is&nbsp; entitled to bail; but the determination of this important point involves a finding of the existence or absence of qualifying or merely aggravating (generic)&nbsp; circumstances and requires knowledge of&nbsp; the distinction between them.&nbsp; It must pass upon&nbsp; the propriety relevancy and materiality of questions asked and the objections thereto.&nbsp; 'I am not sure that a Justice&nbsp; of the Peace with some exceptions of&nbsp; course, is in a position to do&nbsp; all this.&nbsp; And&nbsp; I&nbsp; greatly doubt&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Legislature by&nbsp; the general, if&nbsp; not vague, terms used&nbsp;&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 87 of&nbsp; the Judiciary Act intended to entrust all this task to a Justice . of the Peace who may not even&nbsp; be a lawyer or to the town mayor who may be a complete stranger to a law book.<br><br>We&nbsp; should also remember that in&nbsp; a position for bail in capital offenses&nbsp; the Provincial Fiscal must be&nbsp; notified and most likely he will appear at the hearing&nbsp; and fight the application&nbsp; every inch of the way,' especially when in his opinion the evidence in his hands is strong and the accused is a dangerous criminal&nbsp; who would likely jump&nbsp; his&nbsp; bail. Now, in such&nbsp; a&nbsp; prolonged and bitter&nbsp; legal fight between the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; and usually a battery of&nbsp; defense lawyers, considerable evidence, parole and documentary,&nbsp; is submitted. One side would be asking questions leading, impertinent or otherwise and&nbsp; the other vigorously&nbsp; objecting to them and vice-versa,&nbsp; and arguing all the&nbsp; way, and the court must decide all said questions and points on the spot.&nbsp; The hearing&nbsp; may last- several days.&nbsp; When the trial is finally ended and the justice of the Peace retires to his room&nbsp; to&nbsp; study the evidence, he has to rely entirely upon his memory unless he has&nbsp; taken down&nbsp; notes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has no record of the evidence&nbsp; such as&nbsp; the transcript of stenographic notes of the testimony of witnesses to refresh his memory, to contrast&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; for the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; with that of the defense and weigh both in the Judicial balance, because as we have&nbsp; already&nbsp; said, this court is not&nbsp; a court of record and there is no stenographer to take down the evidence. Considering all this, can we in conscience say that the Justice of the Peace is in a position to entertain and decide a petition for bail in a ease involving a&nbsp; capital&nbsp; offense?<br><br>There is another important question that bears consideration.&nbsp; Let us suppose that the complaint for a capital offense is&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in a&nbsp; remote municipality&nbsp; far from the capital. A&nbsp; petition for bail is&nbsp; filed.&nbsp; The law says that the Provincial Fiscal must&nbsp; be&nbsp; notified.&nbsp; For him to&nbsp; leave his office and a trial being conducted by him in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance, may not be easy.&nbsp; He may have to ask for postponement of the&nbsp; hearing on the petition for bail.&nbsp; When he finally goes to the remote&nbsp; town&nbsp; for the hearing,&nbsp; he arrives there&nbsp; with no knowledge whatsoever of the case, much less, of&nbsp; the evidence of the prosecution.&nbsp; He would have to call and&nbsp; confer with the Government&nbsp; witnesses, take down&nbsp; their&nbsp; testimonies and otherwise&nbsp; prepare&nbsp; for the hearing.&nbsp; This may&nbsp; require several days and in the meantime the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; is in&nbsp; confinement.&nbsp; The&nbsp; hearing sometimes is&nbsp; a full-dress rehearsal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the regular&nbsp; trial and may take several days, all because, the defense attorneys knowing, that the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; or his&nbsp; assistant had come to attend the hearing, have lined up many defense witnesses and&nbsp; prepared them.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the hearing,&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace or the Mayor acting&nbsp; in&nbsp; his place may also take time to study&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; submitted and decide the petition for bail.&nbsp; All this&nbsp; lapse of time is prejudicial to the accused because in the meantime&nbsp; he is languishing in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; the Court finds&nbsp; that&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; for the prosecution is not strong and&nbsp; grants&nbsp; bail.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case is then&nbsp; set for preliminary investigation.&nbsp; This&nbsp; may have to be done because although the Justice of the Peace found after the hearing on the petition for bail that the evidence for the prosecution was not strong, nevertheless,&nbsp; to send the case up to the Court of First Instance, requires&nbsp; only probable cause if proven at the preliminary investigation. After the preliminary investigation and after&nbsp; the&nbsp; oral arguments by both parties, the Justice of the Peace decides that there is no probable cause arid he dismisses the complaint.&nbsp; It is evident that all the proceedings at the hearing on&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; bail was a waste&nbsp; of time and effort not only on the part of the court but also of the prosecution and the defense, and&nbsp; their witnesses, all&nbsp; because the hearing on the petition for bail was held before the preliminary&nbsp; investigation.&nbsp; It would have been better and more proper and advisable to have awaited the result of the preliminary investigation&nbsp; before filing&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition for bail, and&nbsp; file said petition in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance if the case is finally elevated to it because if after&nbsp; the preliminary investigation the case is dismissed and the accused released, then&nbsp; there&nbsp; would be no reason or occasion for the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for bail.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case&nbsp; or&nbsp; example&nbsp; I&nbsp; have given,&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have lasted more than one or two&nbsp; hours because the Court&nbsp; found not even probable&nbsp; cause, and so the accused would&nbsp; have&nbsp; been released immediately; but because&nbsp; he&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition for bail, he spent many days in jail&nbsp; because the Fiscal had to be notified,&nbsp; the hearing had to be postponed, extensive preparation were made by both sides, a full-dress hearing was had&nbsp; where&nbsp; voluminous&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; was&nbsp; submitted,&nbsp; all to be studied and weighed by the Justice of the Peace.<br><br>Not&nbsp; infrequently, the accused&nbsp; in a capital offense are plain bandits&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with multiple&nbsp; murder, homicide, robbery, even rape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the difficulty of capturing them,&nbsp; a reward&nbsp; of&nbsp; say P20,000 is set upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; head of the leader.&nbsp; After a campaign of months by the Army and the Constabulary&nbsp; with the aid of informers interested in the reward but after the loss of lives of soldiers and guides, ¦ and expense to the Government of hundreds of thousands of&nbsp; pesos, including the&nbsp; payment of rewards, the&nbsp; bandits are finally- captured.&nbsp; The corresponding complaint is filed against them in the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court for multiple murder, homicide, kidnapping, robbery, rape, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; They file a petition for bail.&nbsp; If the Justice of the Peace because of the&nbsp; reasons already given, namely, his limited legal preparation, experience and training, or for complete&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of the same in case the Mayor&nbsp; acts&nbsp; in the&nbsp; absence of the Justice of the Peace and his&nbsp; auxiliary, makes a mistake and grants the&nbsp; petition for bail, then&nbsp; all these defendants captured after so much sacrifice and expenses are set free and most likely&nbsp; would go back to the mountains and forests:. to renew their&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of pillage and banditry. On&nbsp; this particular&nbsp; point the majority&nbsp; frankly&nbsp; admits the, possibility of abuse of such authority to&nbsp; grant bail&nbsp; in capital&nbsp; offense&nbsp; cases&nbsp; when it&nbsp; says;<br><blockquote>"Sonic apprehension has been&nbsp; expressed by&nbsp; some" members&nbsp; of the Court over the&nbsp; fact that if such power&nbsp; is given to justices&nbsp; of the peace in capital' cases the power may be abused or improperly exercised considering the fact that some of them are not lawyers&nbsp; or are politicians like the mayors who may act under&nbsp; the law when the incumbent justices are temporarily absent {section 3, Rule 108).&nbsp; While the&nbsp; possibility of abuse cannot be denied such&nbsp; cannot argue against the&nbsp; existence of the power and if there&nbsp; is need for a remedy such devolves upon Congress.&nbsp; But before such curative measures is&nbsp; adopted,&nbsp; our&nbsp; duty is to apply the law as we&nbsp; see it&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of its , implication."<br></blockquote>But&nbsp; in ease of miscarriage of justice&nbsp; due to abuse, the majority with&nbsp; admirable ingenuousness,&nbsp; and with hope and trust&nbsp; manifestly misplaced, offers a remedy, saying:<br><blockquote>"And in the event »that an abuse is committed, the situation is not without&nbsp; a remedy.&nbsp; The government can immediately take steps&nbsp; to obtain appropriate relief and we are sure, the proper court will not&nbsp; deny prompt&nbsp; action when&nbsp; necessary to promote&nbsp; the interests of justice." <br></blockquote>True, the&nbsp; Fiscal may&nbsp; petition the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; for the&nbsp; cancellation even&nbsp; for the&nbsp; confiscation of the bail bond.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that&nbsp; would&nbsp; be locking the&nbsp; door of the stable sifter the horse is gone.&nbsp; What shall it profit the Government to confiscate&nbsp; said&nbsp; bonds, even get&nbsp; their amounts, assuming that&nbsp; the sureties&nbsp; are&nbsp; all solvent,&nbsp; if after all, the Government&nbsp; will have to&nbsp; renew,&nbsp; even redouble its campaign to recapture the&nbsp; bandits, offer new rewards and&nbsp; lose more soldiers and innocent lives.&nbsp; Why not entrust that&nbsp; delicate&nbsp; and&nbsp; important task of determining in capital offense cases, whether or not the evidence for the prosecution is&nbsp; strong, for purposes of granting or denying bail, which according to prevailing rule&nbsp; cited by Kite majority opinion&nbsp; itself is "a matter of the greatest importance both to the accused and to the state", to the Court of First Instance, where it belongs and where, in the absence of <span style="font-style: italic;">clear&nbsp; and explicit</span> legal provisions to the contrary, the Legislature in my opinion intended it to be?<br><br><i>Labrador, J.,&nbsp; </i>concurs.</div>
