				<H3>THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. MATIAS  H.  AZNAR  AND THE COURT OF  TAX  APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This  is  a  petition filed  by  the  Collector of  Internal Revenue to  review by   certiorari  the resolution of  the Court of Tax  Appeals dated February 8, 1956, in  C.T.A. Case No. 109  enjoining him from enforcing collection of the alleged income tax liability of Matias H. Aznar through summary  administrative method.  The facts  of  the case are as follows: <br><br>In a letter dated November 28, 1952,  the  Collector of Internal Revenue, through the office of the City Treasurer of Cebu, demanded from Matias  H.  Aznar  the  payment of P732,032.66  allegedly representing  the latter's income tax deficiencies for the  tax years 1945 to 1951.  It appears on record that  the Collector  of  Internal Revenue also instructed the City Treasurer of Cebu to place the properties of said taxpayer under constructive distraint to guarantee the satisfaction of the  taxes  thus  assessed (Exh. 9), and this  instruction was supposedly  complied with by  the latter official in virtue  of a warrant  of distraint and levy dated February  17, 1953, and served on  taxpayer  Aznar on February 20, 1953  (Exh. 11).  An exchange of communications between the Internal  Revenue Office and  the taxpayer ensued as a  result of which a reinvestigation of the income tax assessment of the  latter was made and the same was finally reduced from P723,032.66, as originally  demanded,  to P380,999.70.  Aznar  was  correspondingly  informed  of  this  correction in  a  communication dated February  16, 1955, specifically stating that this later figure superseded the previous one sent by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. <br><br>Upon receipt  of the corrected assessment, the taxpayer filed with the Court of Tax Appeals a petition to review the same and  subsequently  an urgent  petition was also filed  to restrain therein  respondent Collector  of  Internal Revenue from proceeding with the  collection of the alleged tax deficiencies  by  means  of the summary  methods  of distraint and levy (Annex B of petition), on the ground that the right of the respondent  Collector to effect the collection of the taxes demanded of  said taxpayer by extrajudicial methods had already prescribed; that the  employment  of these means would cause petitioner injustice and irreparable injury; and that the petition was  not merely intended to delay the payment of the taxes because petitioner stood on  an even chance  of  winning the case  if given  a  day in  court  (Annex B of  the petition).   The Collector of Internal Revenue set up an opposition against the grant  of  this  petition  and consequently,  hearing on the  matter was  duly  conducted  by  the  lower  Court. After  the  parties  had  filed their respective memoranda and rested their  case,  the lower Court,  in  a resolution dated  February 8, 1956, issued the injunction prayed for enjoining the  Collector  of Internal  Revenue from proceeding with the collection  of  the taxes by  means of the summary methods of distraint and levy after finding that the warrant issued by the Treasurer of the City of Cebu dated February 17, 1953,  placing the  properties of  Matias H. Aznar under constructive distraint and levy and which was supposedly received  by said taxpayer  on  February 20, 1953, was not actually served on petitioner Aznar; that the warrant of garnishment served on the  Philippine National Bank in  Manila on  August 14, 1953,  was null and  void  in view of respondent's failure to furnish the taxpayer with  a  copy of the.  same and that the placing of the properties  of the taxpayer under  constructive  distraint  and levy on April  28, 1955, was made beyond the 3-year prescriptive period as provided by Section 51-(d) of the National Internal Revenue Code.   From this resolution, the  Collector of  Internal  Revenue  brought  the matter to this  Court in a petition to  review by certiorari contending that collection of taxes  cannot be restrained by injunction; and that even if the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> could have lawfully  issued the same, said tribunal acted with  grave abuse of discretion when it did not require the taxpayer to file a bond as  exhorted by Section 11  of Republic Act No. 1125. <br><br>There appears  no record as to  when Matias H.  Aznar filed his income tax returns for the years 1945 and 1946, but it  is not controverted that his tax returns  for 1947 was  filed  on March 1,  1948;  for 1948 on February 28, 1949; for 1949 on March 1,  1950; for 1950, on March 1, 1951; and for 1951, on March 1, 1952.   There is likewise no  dispute that  Matias H.  Aznar's alleged  income  tax deficiencies were assessed at P723,032.66 on November 28, 1952, which was reduced to P380,999.70 on March 17, 1955. During the hearing had in the court below, the Collector of Internal Revenue, trying to establish  the fact that the properties of the taxpayer were already placed under constructive distraint and levy as of <span style="font-style: italic;">February 20, 1953</span>, offered in evidence Exhibit 11, purportedly a duplicate of the warrant dated  February  17,  1953,  and allegedly  received by Aznar on <span style="font-style: italic;">February 20 of  the same year.  </span>Aznar, however, disputed the authenticity of  Exhibit 11 maintaining that it was  never served on him.  It appears on record that a  warrant  of  garnishment to  distrain the deposits Mr.  and  Mrs. Aznar  had  with the  Philippine National Bank was  also  served  on  said  banking institution  on August 14, 1953,  but the taxpayer once again interposed an objection to the use of  this measure on the ground that he was not notified thereof pursuant to  the  provision of  Section 319 of the Tax Code and asserted that the issuance of said  warrant was null and void. <br><br>There is likewise no controversy that the City Treasurer of Cebu  levied  upon  certain  real  properties belonging to the taxpayer on May 6, 1955, but Aznar took exception to the employment of this administrative method to effect collection of the taxes allegedly due by him, it having been issued 3 years, 2 months and 5 days after he had filed his income tax returns for the year  1951, and therefore beyond the 3-year prescriptive period required by Section 51-d of the Tax  Code. <br><br>Actually, the questions at issue in the instant case are: whether  the  Collector  of Internal  Revenue  could enforce collection of the alleged deficiency income taxes of Matias H. Aznar through the  summary methods of distraint  and levy  and, consequently,  whether the Court of Tax Appeals erred in  issuing the injunction restraining said  official from employing  the  same;  and granting the Court of Tax Appeals could issue an Injunction, whether said tribunal erred in not requiring the taxpayer to make a deposit. <br><br>We  agree  with  petitioner that  Section  305  of the National Internal Revenue Code precludes the use  of injunction to restrain the  collection of  taxes, but as  this Court  has already pronounced, in view  of the existence of the provisions of Section  11 of Republic Act No. 1125 allowing the Tax Court to issue  said  writ of injunction subject certain  limitations, the former  (Sec. 305)  must be deemed to have been modified by the later enactment—Republic  Act No.  1125  (Collector of Internal Revenue <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Avelino, 100 Phil., 327, 53 Off. Gaz., 645).  And We have, since then and even before,  adhered to the doctrine that the collection of income taxes, after the lapse of three years from the date the income tax return said to be false, fraudulent or erroneous had been filed, may  no longer be effected  by means  of  administrative  methods  but  only through judicial proceedings  (Collectors  of  Internal Revenue  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

Court of Tax Appeals, 101 Phil., 1, 53 Off. Gaz., [15] 4839. <br><br>In the light of the aforementioned ruling, were  We to consider as valid and in order the disputed warrant dated February 17, 1953, placing the properties of the taxpayer under constructive destraint and levy, the collection of the taxes for 1949,  1950 and 1951 by extra-judicial methods would  be  proper and the resolution of the Court of  Tax Appeals as far  as it concerns this later  period would be erroneous, although  summary administrative means would no longer be  the proper  recourse  for the collection of taxes corresponding to  1948 and  the  years previous to that as 3 years, 11 months and 22 days has already elapsed  from the time the  income tax return for that year was filed. <br><br>The respondent Court of Tax Appeals, however, made a finding that while  it may be true that Exhibit 11 could have been prepared at the  time referred  to,  probably through  omission, oversight or negligence, same was not executed and thus actually the properties of the  taxpayer were only placed under constructive distraint and levy on May 6, 1955.  As Republic Act No. 1125 creating the Court of Tax Appeals keep  silent as  to matters left open to Us for review or the issues that  We  may take  conizance of,  and as courts  have to  construe  statutes as they are found and  not to  amend  or change  them under the guise of construction (82 C.J.S.  530), this Court in passing upon petitions  to  review by certiorari  decisions or rulings of the Court of Tax Appeals may review, revise, reverse, amend or modify  not only  the  legal issues involved  therein but also the findings  of fact upon which said  decision  or ruling is based. <br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, it  may  be  stated that any party adversely affected by any ruling, order or decision  of the Court of Tax Appeals has by law two  ways of elevating his case to the  Supreme  Court, i.e.,  <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, by filing in the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a  quo</span> a notice of appeal and with this Court a <span style="font-style: italic;">petition for review </span>within 30 days from the date he receives notice  of said ruling, order or decision adverse to him (Sec.  18, Rep. Act 1125), and <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, by causing such ruling, order or  decision of the Court of Tax Appeals <span style="font-style: italic;">likewise reviewed</span> by Us  upon  a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>in proper  cases  (Sec.   19, R.A.  No. 1125). Premised  on these provisions, it may be  alleged that when a case is taken up to this Court by petition for review, We  could go over the evidence on record and pass  upon the  questions  of fact; but that in cases of review upon  petition for a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, this Court could  only pass  upon issues involving questions of  law.  In  answer to  these possible arguments We may say that when the interest of  justice so demands, We may interchangeably consider petitions for review as petitions for a  writ of certiorari and vice-versa,  and if We  have the power  to consider the evidence to determine the facts in  cases of  review, We find no plausible reason for depriving this Court of such power in petitions for certiorari specially if We consider that  in  the latter  cases  the petitioner  oftenly  charges the respondent Court  with the commission of grave abuse of discretion the determination  of which usually  depends on  the  facts and circumstances of the points in controversy.  Moreover, in  the  case  at bar, We find  that  on March 1, 1956, respondent Collector of Internal Revenue filed  with  the  Court  of Tax Appeals  a notice  of appeal from the resolution of said  Court that is now subject of this recourse  (p. 466, CTA records)  and no matter how inappropriate may be the wording  of the petition filed in this  instance, it could not  conceal that respondent's intention was to appeal the matter to this Court, as otherwise  he  would  not have filed said notice  of appeal which is required in petitions  for review  (Sec. 18,  R.A.  No. 1125) and not in petitions  for  certiorari (Sec.  19,  Id.). It is  also to be noted that in the instant case the Solicitor General  has not filed  any motion for  the reconsideration of said resolution, a requisite that is necessary in petitions for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>. <br><br>Having all these in mind, We are  inclined to consider the question of facts involved in the present controversy, and in  going  over the evidence presented We  find, contrary to the conclusion arrived at by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, that there are proofs supporting petitioner's contention that Exhibit 11 was properly executed.  The respondent  Court refused  to  give  credence  to the employees  of the  City Treasurer's Office who claimed to have served the controverted warrant on the  taxpayer on  February  20,  1953, by reason  of certain inconsistencies  in their declarations during  the  extensive cross-examination  conducted  by counsel  for respondent Aznar.   We  must  remember, however, that considering the time that had  lapsed when the incident  took  place  and the date when  they  were questioned  under  oath  as regard  their affidavits recounting the event,  it is but natural for  the human brain not to pick up certain details of an event that transpired sometime ago and  thus  expect  minor inconsistencies  in  the testimonies of several witnesses.   On substantial points— as to who  and how the warrant  in question was  served, the person receiving the same, and other facts surrounding said service, the witnesses  are in  unison  in their declarations.   It is  true  that Exhibit 11 is merely a duplicate copy of the warrant  and that the original thereof could  nowhere  be found.  But  the personnel of the office of the City Treasurer of Cebu admitted it was lost and for this  reason their affidavits  recounting said  service were  executed (Exhs. 13, 14,  15, 16 and 17-p. 68-79, CTA Records).  Moreover,  We find in the records a decisive factor that props up the contention of petitioner Collector of Internal Revenue, for We  must not lose sight of the fact that Exhibit 11  contains a list  of the properties of Matias  H. Aznar which were  levied upon  by the City Treasurer of Cebu and which the Treasurer in turn placed in the possession of said owner for safekeeping, as acknowledged  by the latter in  said  exhibit,  and  such properties could not  have been mentioned in the document if said properties had not been taken  from and  returned to taxpayer Aznar who has not  denied  that  same were his.  We cannot simply  disregard this form of evidence not only because affidavits are admissible to prove  the service of a summons, notice or other papers in an action or special proceeding (See Wigmore on  Evidence,  Vol. 6, 3rd ed., p. 42-49,)  but also because respondent  taxpayer was given opportunity to cross-examine the affiants before the Municipal Court of Cebu. <br><br>The lower Court also placed much stress on the supposition  that the  Collector  of  Internal Revenue  should  not have sent the communications dated March 15  and March  28, 1955, inquiring as to what action the City Treasurer of Cebu had taken on  the  tax case  of Matias H. Aznar if the latter had really sent the original of  Exhibit  11 to respondent Collector.  A close scrutiny of  the letters referred to reveals that they were in connection  with the <span style="font-style: italic;">corrected assessment </span>sent by the  Internal Revenue Office to Matias H. Aznar dated February 16, 1955 (p.  311, BIR records), of  which the Treasurer's Office was also duly notified (p. 315, BIR Records)  and not in connection with the assessment of November 28,  1952.  The issuance  of another  warrant by the  Treasurer's Office on April 28, 1955  and  which was  admittedly  received  by Aznar  on May 6, of the same year was  likewise taken by the Tax Court  to contradict the  existence of Exhibit 11.  It is correct that  a mistake was committed by said  office  in stating therein that the income tax deficiencies of  Matias H. Aznar amounted to  P723,032.07 because this  figure as corrected should  properly be P380,999.70,  but  it must be noted that this second warrant covers 2 buildings belonging to the taxpayer found in the province of Leyte which were not included among those listed in the first  warrant, Exhibit  11.  As  explained,  this warrant was  issued because the properties covered by the first writ would not be  sufficient  to  satisfy the  amount demanded  by  the Government.   Thus, piecing the  evidence  together,  it is clear to our mind that the warrant placing the properties of Matias H. Aznar under constructive distraint  and levy was served on the latter on  February 20, 1953, which was 2 years,  11 months, and 19 days  after the taxpayer had filed his income tax returns  for the tax year 1949;  1  year 11 months and 19 days after he had  filed his returns for 1950; and 11 months and 19 days after he did so for the tax year  1951. <br><br>Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 contains  the following: <br><br>Sec.  11. WHO MAY APPEAL; EFFECT OF APPEAL.—<br><blockquote>No appeal taken to the Court of Tax Appeals from the  decision of the Collector  of  Internal  Revenue  or the Collector of Customs shall suspend  the payment, levy, distraint and/or sale  of  any property of the  taxpayer for the satisfaction of his  tax  liability as  provided by  existing law:  <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>, That when in the opinion of the Court the collection by the Bureau of Internal Revenue  or the  Commissioner of  Customs may jeopardize  the interest of the Government and/or the taxpayer the Court at any stage of  the  proceeding may  suspend the  said  collection  and require the taxpayer either to deposit  the  amount claimed or to file  a  surety bond  for  not  more thart  double  the  amount with the Court.</blockquote>It may be  seen that the Court  is allowed by law to suspend the collection of taxes subject to  certain limitations. <br><br>The second question posed herein is whether the Court of Tax Appeals could issue an injunction to suspend  such collection without requiring the taxpayer to make a deposit or  file  a bond?  This Court,  resolving the same  question in  a similar case, held  that  the  requirement  of a bond before  a writ  of injunction  could be  issued by  the  Tax Court applies  only to cases  where the  means sought to be employed  for the  enforcement of the collection  of the tax  are by themselves legal  and  not where  same were declared null and void,  as where  the  summary  methods of  distraint  and  levy would  be  utilized in the collection of deficiency income  taxes,  after the  3-year prescriptive period as provided by  Section 51-d of the Internal  Revenue Code has already elapsed  (Collector of Internal  Revenue <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  A. P. Reyes, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>; Sambrano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  CTA, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>).  The Court, in upholding this theory, explains:<br><blockquote>"Section 11 of Republic Act  No. 1125  is  therefore premised on the assumption that the  collection by<span style="font-style: italic;"> summary</span> proceedings is by itself in accordance with  existing  law; and then what is suspended is the <span style="font-style: italic;">act of collecting</span>, whereas, in the case at bar what the  respondent Court suspended was the <span style="font-style: italic;">use of the method employed to verify the  collection  which was evidently illegal after  the  lapse  of the three-year limitation period</span>.   The respondent Court  issued  the injunction in question on  the basis of  its findings that the means intended to be used by  petitioner in the collection of the  alleged deficiency taxes were in violation of  law.  It certainly  would be an absurdity on the part of the Court of Tax Appeals to declare that  the  collection  by  summary  methods  of  distraint and  levy was violative of the law, and then, on the same breath, require the petitioner to deposit or file a  bond as a prerequisite  for the issuance of a writ of injunction.  Let us suppose, for the  sake of argument,  that the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>  would have required the petitioner to  post the  bond  in question and that the taxpayer would refuse  or  fail  to furnish  said bond,  would the  Court  <span style="font-style: italic;">a  quo</span> be obliged to authorize  or allow  the  Collector  to  proceed with the collection from the petitioner of the taxes due by  a means  it previously  declared to be contrary  to law?"  (Collector <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Eeyes, supra).</blockquote>As the Collector of Internal  Revenue, through the Office of the City Treasurer of Cebu,  placed the properties of the taxpayer  under distraint and levy only on February 20, 1953, to  secure  the payment  of alleged  income  tax deficiencies for the tax years  1945 to 1951, and as with respect to the taxes  demanded for the year  1945, 1946, 1947  and 1948,  the said warrant  was issued beyond the 3-year period of limitations as prescribed by Section 51-d of the Tax  Code, and following the ruling adopted by  this Court as regards the issuance by the Tax  Court of writs of injunction, the respondent Court did not err in  enjoining the Collector from using summary administrative methods without requiring  the  taxpayer  to post a bond or make a deposit as far as the  tax  years  1945, 1946, 1947 and 1948 are concerned.  As  regards 1949 to  1951,  the answer is all too obvious, though We must have in mind that the  court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> acted on the erroneous assumption that the period for said summary  administrative methods had already lapsed and that the  effect of its ruling is a<span style="font-style: italic;"> fait accompli</span>. <br><br>Wherefore, the resolution  of the Court of Tax Appeals dated February 8, 1956, is set aside and this case is hereby remanded to the lower Court for further proceedings so  that  it  may determine  the income tax liabilities of Matias H. Aznar that have not prescribed under the terms and period  fixed by Sections 331 and 332 of the National Internal Revenue  Code.  Pending the  disposition of this case  in the lower Court, respondent Matias H. Aznar is ordered to deposit  with said court the amount demanded from him  for  the years 1949 to 1951 or  furnish  a surety bond for  not  more than double said amount.  Costs  are taxed against respondent  Matias H.  Aznar.  It  is  so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.  B.
