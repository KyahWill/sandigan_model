				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action to annul Ordinance No. 3563 of the City of Manila, which 
was enacted in March, 1953, to ban the sale of fresh meat outside of the city 
markets.
<p>Plaintiffs are Chinese citizens doing business in the city, selling both 
fresh and refrigerated meat in their stores outside the city markets. At the 
time the ordinance in question was enacted, there was already an ordinance—No. 
3555 —forbidding the sale of fresh meat around the city markets within 200 
meters from the boundaries thereof, and, to comply with that ordinance, 
plaintiffs had their stores located at more than that distance from any city 
market. But the new ordinance repeals that other ordinance and prohibits the 
sale of fresh meat anywhere outside of the city markets, thus making it illegal 
for plaintiffs to continue vending fresh meat in their aforementioned stores. 
Plaintiffs, therefore, in behalf of themselves and of others similarly situated, 
brought the present action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to have the 
new ordinance declared null and void, to enjoin its enforcement and to compel 
the Mayor to issue licenses permitting them to continue selling meat under the 
terms of the former ordinance.</p>
<p>Upholding the validity of Ordinance No. 3563, the city authorities resisted 
the action, and in this they were joined by the intervenors who, as vendors of 
fresh meat in the city market stalls or as members of trade organizations 
advocating nationalization of the retail trade, claim to have an interest in the 
litigation. After hearing, the lower court rendered a decision declaring the 
ordinance in question null and void, permanently enjoining its enforcement and 
commanding the Mayor to issue licenses to plaintiffs to enable them to "continue 
their business as vendors of fresh meat in the City of Manila outside the 
distance of two hundred (200) meters from any public market." From this 
decision, the city and the intervenors have appealed directly to this Court.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the challenged ordinance reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 1. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale 
fresh meat outside of the city public markets: Provided, That this Ordinance 
shall not apply to cold storage meat imported from foreign countries or from any 
province, town, barrio or other place of the Philippines when such meat is duly 
marked and accompanied by a certificate showing that the animals furnishing the 
meat have been subject to an ante-mortem and post-mortem examination and found 
good for human consumption by a veterinarian of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 
and when said cold storage meat has been kept for not less than twenty days in 
any establishment duly equipped for cold storing meat and other food 
products."</p></blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the defendants the ordinance is sought to be justified as a 
legitimate exercise of the police power to meet the menace posed by the 
clandestine sale of meat from diseased animals. By confining the sale of meat 
within the city public markets, inspection is facilitated and trafficking in 
meat that is unfit for human consumption will be minimized if not totally 
suppressed. Very enlightening is the following letter of the City Health Officer 
to the mayor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"His Honor, the Mayor<br>Manila</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>"In compliance with your instructions given in your memorandum of even date, 
I have the honor to give hereunder comments on the sale of meat outside of 
public markets.</p>
<p>"No animal shall be slaughtered for food without ante-mortem examination. 
(Art. Ill, Sec. 4, Adm. Order No. 9, Dept. of Agriculture and Commerce). It is 
unlawful to sell or offer for sale the meat of animals not slaughtered in the 
City Slaughterhouse. (Ord. 3472). There are, however, many unscrupulous persons 
who, regardless of what happens to public health violate these regulations by 
slaughtering animals privately without the benefit of veterinary inspection and 
sell the meat thereof clandestinely to the public. Very often the 'hot' meat 
sold is unfit for human consumption. This clandestine business therefore poses a 
grave and serious threat to the public health. It thrives, in spite of the 
combined and unrelenting efforts of the Manila Police Department, the City 
Department of Finance and this Department to curb and suppress it, because of 
the circumstance that fresh meat is allowed to be sold anywhere in the city. The 
wide territory to be covered makes it extremely difficult for the few meat 
inspectors of this Office, the fewer policemen assigned to meat apprehension and 
the agents of the City Treasurer to combat this menace.</p>
<p>"If the sale of fresh meat were allowed only in specified places such as in 
public markets (as Ordinance No. 3563 would), it will be much easier to inspect 
and examine meat intended for human consumption. The chances of the public 
buying and consuming diseased meat will be greatly minimized if not totally 
eliminated. Public health will thereby be more thoroughly safeguarded and 
protected.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, as it is the case now, it is extremely difficult to 
examine and inspect all the meat sold by numerous establishments and persons in 
widely scattered places in the city. Under this circumstance, the chances are 
great for diseased and clandestine meat to find its way to the dining tables of 
city residents.</p>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, at least from the standpoint of public health, it 
would be a sound regulatory measure to allow the sale of fresh meat only in 
public markets. As already stated above, this will facilitate meat inspection 
work with the result that the health of the people will be more properly 
safeguarded. It will be easier to apprehend dealers on 'hot' or clandestine 
meat.</p>
<p align="right">Very respectfully,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) M. C. ICASIANO<br><em>City Health 
Officer</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p>The City of Manila is expressly authorized by its charter (Republic Act 409) 
to establish, maintain and regulate public markets and slaughterhouses and 
prohibit or permit the establishment or operation thereof by private persons 
[section 18, paragraph (<em>cc</em>)]. It is also specifically empowered to 
regulate the sale of meat [section 18, paragraph (1) ]. And in addition, it has 
the authority in the exercise of its police power under the general welfare 
clause [section 18, paragraph (<em>kk</em>)] "to enact all ordinances it may 
deem necessary and proper for the sanitation and safety, the furtherance of the 
prosperity, and the promotion of the morality, peace, good order, comfort, 
convenience, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants."</p>
<p>In the case of People <em>vs</em>. Montil, 53 Phil., 580, this Court 
sustained the validity of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the sale of pork 
outside of the public market. Again, in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Sabarre, 
<em>et al</em>., 65 Phil., 684, this Court also upheld a municipal ordinance 
which "prohibits butchers and any other person from selling meat in any place 
except in the public market." Similar ordinances have likewise been declared 
valid in other jurisdictions. [St. Martinville <em>vs</em>. Bugas, 103 S. 761; 
Morano <em>vs</em>. The Mayor, 2 La. 217; New Orleans <em>vs</em>, Faber, 105 
La. 212, and Winnsboro <em>vs</em>. Smart, 11 Rich. (S. C.) 551.] In the last 
case cited, it was held that under the power to make ordinances respecting 
markets, health and good order of the town, a municipal corporation may by 
ordinance prohi- bit the sale of butcher's meat within the corporate limits 
except at the public market and that such an ordinance is not in restraint of 
trade, but in regulation thereof, and does not violate the ordinary rights of 
the citizen.</p>
<p>The trial court declared the ordinance in question void on the theory that a 
legitimate business like that of selling fresh meat may be regulated but not 
entirely prohibited since the power to regulate does not include the power to 
prohibit. But it is obvious that the ordinance does not prohibit the business of 
vending fresh meat. What it does prohibit is the sale of that commodity outside 
of the public markets. In other words, the ordinance merely localizes the sale 
of fresh meat, confining the sale to the city public markets with a view to 
facilitating police inspection and supervision in the interest of public 
health.</p>
<p>It is urged on behalf of the plaintiffs-appellees that the enforcement of the 
ordinance would deprive them of their lawful occupation and means of livelihood 
because they can not rent stalls in the public markets. But it appears that 
plaintiffs are also dealers in refrigerated or cold storage meat, the sale of 
which outside the city markets under certain conditions is permitted. Plaintiffs 
may likewise sell other commodities or engage in other gainful pursuits. And 
surely, the mere fact that some individuals in the community may be deprived of 
their present business or a particular mode of earning a living can not prevent 
the exercise of the police power. As was said in a case, persons licensed to. 
pursue occupations which may in the public need and interest be affected by the 
exercise of the police power embark in those occupations subject to the 
disadvantages which may result from the legal exercise of that power. (City of 
New Orleans <em>vs</em>. Stafford, 27 L. Ann. 417.)</p>
<p>We are not impressed by the plea that there are not enough facilities for the 
sale of fresh meat in the public markets of Manila, apprised as we are that the 
city already has 14 markets and 17 <em>talipapas</em> (temporary markets). 
Moreover, what would constitute sufficient facilities in relation to the 
ever-changing public need is more a matter for legislative determination. And 
considering that stalls in the public markets produce revenue in the form of 
rents paid by their occupants, it is illogical to suppose that the city 
government would not establish additional stalls should there be actual need for 
more.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the ordinance here in question is within the power of 
the City of Manila to enact. The decision appealed from is, therefore, reversed 
and plaintiffs' complaint dismissed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
