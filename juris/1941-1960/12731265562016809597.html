<p>In 1953, the Mayor of Cebu dismissed, among others, twenty (20) of herein 
petitioners, who were subsequently reinstated, however, in compliance with final 
judgments of competent courts, declaring such dismissal illegal, in the

<p>On February 9, 1955, the Municipal Board of Cebu approved Ordinance No. 188 
thereof, appropriating funds for the operation of the City of Cebu during the 
fiscal year 1954-3 955. Items 19 and 28 of said </p>
<p>Ordinance read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"19. Thirty-eight Patrolmen at P1,440 per annum each (transferred from 
Seventy-one Detectives)...........................................P54,720.00</p>
<p>"28. Thirty-three Detectives at P1,440.00 per annum each (from Seventy-one 
Detectives at P1,440.- per annum each)...........47,520.00"</p></blockquote>
<p>Referring to this Ordinance, the Department of Finance in a communication 
dated June 14, 1955, stated; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Likewise, no objection is offered to the changes in designation of certain 
positions and the abolition of sixteen positions of immunization sanitary 
inspectors provided no one, especially a civil service eligible, will be 
prejudiced of Executive Order No. 506, dated September 12, 1932 and provincial 
Circular (Unnumbered) dated January 11, 1952 of the Office of the President, 
both bearing in part on the abolition of positions in an 
office."</p></blockquote>
<p>Owing to the failure of the Municipal Board of Cebu City to enact a new 
budget for the fiscal year 1955-1956, the appropriation incorporated in said 
Ordinance No. 188 was deemed reenacted for that fiscal year (C.A. No. 58, sec. 
15). On May 12, 1956, respondent City Mayor wrote to petitioners herein 
identical letters (Annexes I and I-l to 1-24) advising them that their positions 
as detectives had been abolished by said Ordinance No. 188 "effective 
immediately" and at the same time enclosing therewith their appointments as 
patrolmen, effective May 16, 1956, but "good until revoked" (Annexes J and J-1 
to J-24). Petitioners refused to accept these appointments, in the belief, 
according to their petition (par. 18 of the original petition; par. 17 of their 
amended petition) "that this was another scheme to effect their removal and a 
devise to go around the provisions of Republic Act No. 557 and other laws, 
executive orders, regulations and circulars, since, as already mentioned above, 
20 of said petitioners had already been victims of illegal mass dismissals, but 
were reinstated by judicial authority." However, the City Auditor and City 
Treasurer of Cebu City refused, and still refuse, to authorize payment and to 
pay the salaries of petitioners herein since May 16, 1956, copies of said 
letters Annexes I and 1-1 to 1-24 having been furnished said officers. Inasmuch 
as respondent City Mayor refused to reconsider his action as regards petitioners 
herein, the latter instituted the present case against the City Mayor, the 
Municipal Board, the City Auditor, the City Treasurer and the Chief of Police of 
the City of Cebu, as well as the City of Cebu itself. The latter was, 
subsequently, excluded as respondent, in an amended petition thereafter filed by 
petitioners herein. After setting forth the foregoing facts and alleging that 
their aforementioned dismissal is illegal and violative of Article XII, section 
4, of the Constitution, section 694 of the Revised Administrative Code, 
Executive Orders Nos. 506 (dated September 12, 1934) and 175 (dated November 11, 
1938), and unnumbered Provincial Circulars issued by the President of the 
Philippines on January 11, 1952 and April 3, 1954; that petitioners have thus 
been excluded from the use and enjoyment of their positions; and that 
respondents have unlawfully neglected the performance of an act which the 
aforementioned laws, executive orders and circulars specially enjoin as a duty 
resulting from their office, by separating the petitioners from the service, 
petitioners pray this Court in their amended petition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(A) Pending final determination of this case:</p>
<p>(1) To issue a preliminary mandatory injunction restoring the petitioners to 
their positions, and directing the respondents City Treasurer and City Auditor 
to pay their salaries;</p>
<p>(2) To fix the bond for the preliminary mandatory injunction and to authorize 
any Judge of the Court of First Instance of Cebu to approve said bond in such 
amount as this Honorable Court may determine; and further directing that upon 
approval of said bond, petitioners be restored and their salaries paid; and</p>
<p>"(B) After hearing:</p>
<p>(1) To declare the abolition of the position and/or the removal and/or the 
transfer of said petitioners to the uniformed division as made with grave abuse 
of discretion and/or as null and void and without any force and effect 
whatsoever; </p>
<p>(2) To make the preliminary mandatory injunction permanent and/or order the 
respondents to reinstate the petitioners to their positions as detectives in the 
police department of the City of Cebu with back salaries from May 16, 1956, 
until they are restored to their positions;</p>
<p>(3) To order the respondent City Mayor Sergio OsmeÃ±a, Jr., to countermand his 
advices ANNEXES T to 'I-24' to the petitioners and to restore them to their 
positions;</p>
<p>(4) To order the Municipal Board to set aside such amount as correspond to 
the salaries of petitioners;</p>
<p>(5) To order the City Auditor to pass in audit, and the City Treasurer to 
pay, the salaries due to petitioners from May 16, 1956 until they are 
restored;</p>
<p>(6) To order respondent City Mayor to pay the costs of this action and, in 
the alternative, to order the respondent City Mayor to pay the petitioners their 
back salaries;</p>
<p>(7) To grant petitioners such other remedies and reliefs as are just and 
equitable in the premises."</p></blockquote>
<p>In their answer, respondents alleged that the word "permanent" does not 
appear in the appointments originally extended to petitioners herein; that the 
City of Cebu may validly abolish old positions and create new ones; that 
Ordinance No. 188 had lawfully abolished the old positions of petitioners herein 
as detectives in the Police Department of Cebu City; that petitioners were not 
removed from office, and, hence, may invoke, neither the Constitution, nor 
Republic Act No. 557, nor section 694 of the Revised Administrative Code, which 
are inapplicable; that respondent City Mayor is clothed with authority to freely 
choose the men to fill up the newly created positions of policemen of the City 
of Cebu; that, in the legitimate exercise of such authority, said respondent 
extended new appointments to the petitioners, thus believing his alleged intent 
to circumvent the laws, executive orders and circulars above mentioned; that in 
acting as he did, respondent City Mayor merely followed the opinion given by the 
City Fiscal, the City Auditor and the City Treasurer of Cebu; and that by 
petitioners' failure to accept said new appointments, they had "forfeited and 
tost their new positions in the uniformed division" of the police department of 
Cebu.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Charter thereof (C.A. No. 58, as amended), the City of Cebu 
shall have, and has, a police department, with "a chief of police who shall have 
charge of the police department and everything pertaining thereto, including the 
organization, government, discipline, and disposition of the city police and 
detective force" (Sec. 32), and "an assistant chief of police whose duties shall 
be to act as chief of police in the absence or inability to act of the chief of 
police, and under the direction of such chief of police to look after the 
discipline of the police foi'ce and to perform such other duties as may be 
imposed upon him by the chief of police or prescribed by law or ordinance" (Sec. 
33). There shall, also, be, in the City of Cebu, "a chief of secret service who 
shall, under the chief of police, have charge of the detective work of the 
department and of the detective force of the city, and shall perform such other 
duties as may be assigned to him by the Chief of police or prescribed by law, or 
ordinance" (Sec. 34). The powers and duties of the chief of police, assistant 
chief of police and chief of secret service, as well as those of the members of 
the city police and detective force, are set forth in Section 35, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Mayor, the chief and assistant chief of police, the chief of the secret 
service, and ail officers and members of the city police and detective force 
shall be peace officers. Such peace officers are auhorized to serve and execute 
all processes of the Municipal Court and criminal processes of all other courts 
to whomsoever directed, within the jurisdictional limits, of the city or within 
the police limits as hereinbefore defined; within the same territory, to pursue 
and arrest, without warrant, any person found in suspicious places or under 
suspicious circumstances reasonably tending to show that such person has 
committed, or is about to commit, any crime or breach of the peace; to arrest or 
cause to be arrested, without warrant, any offender when the offense is 
committed in the presence of a peace officer or within his view; in such pursuit 
or arrest to enter any building, ship, boat, or vessel, or take1 into custody 
any person therein suspected of being concerned in such crime or breach of the 
peace, and any property suspected of having-been stolen; and to exercise such 
other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by law or 
ordinance. They shall detain an arrested person only until he can be brought 
before the proper magistrate. Whenever the Mayor shall deem it necessary, to 
avert danger or to protect life and property, in case of riot, disturbance, or 
public calamity, or when he has reason to fear any serious violation of Jaw and 
order, he shall have power to swear in special police, in such numbers as the 
occasion may demand. Such special police shall have the same powers while on 
duty as members of the regular force."</p></blockquote>
<p>Having these provisions in mind, Jet us now consider the main issue in this 
case, namely: Have the positions held by petitioners herein, as members of the 
police department of the City of Cebu, been abolished by Ordinance No. 188?</p>
<p>The 1953-1954 budget of the City of Cebu for the fiscal year 1953-1954, 
Ordinance 167 thereof (Annex 11), contained, under the heading of Police 
Department, the following item:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"22. Seventy-one detectives at P1,440.00 each per 
annum......................................................................................P102,240.00". 
</p></blockquote>
<p>This item was split in Ordinance No. 188 into two (2) items, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"19. Thirty-eight Patrolmen at P1,440 per annum each (transferred from 
Seventy-one Detectives).............................P54,720.00.</p>
<p>"28. Thirty-three Detectives at P1,440.00 per annum each (from Seventy-one 
Detectives at P1.440.- per annum each)....P47,520.00",</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that Item No. 19, for thirty-eight (38) patrolmen at 
P1,440.00 per annum each, explicitly declares that it was merely "transferred" 
from the afore-mentioned Item No. 22 in Ordinance No. 167 for seventy-one (71) 
detectives. Now to "transfer" is to convey something; to transport, to move or 
to cause it to pass from one place to another. That which is transferred must 
be, therefore, something in existence, for that which does not exist cannot be 
transported, conveyed, moved or caused to pass from one place to another. Upon 
the other hand, to "abolish" is to do away with, to annul, abrogate or destroy 
completely. As a consequence, what has been abolished ceases to exist or 
disappears, and, hence, it cannot be "transferred." Prima facie, therefore, said 
Item No. 3 9 of Ordinance No. 188 does not connote abolition of the thirty-eight 
(38) positions of "detectives" therein alluded to. On the contrary, the transfer 
of the item for said positions to another section, branch or division of the 
police department, suggests the retention and preservation of said 
positions.</p>
<p>Does the use of the term "patrolmen" in Ordinance No. 188 in lieu of 
"detectives", indicate the intent to abolish said thirty-eight (38) positions? 
Regardless of the negative implication, of the term "transfer", an affirmative 
answer would, perhaps, have been possible if the powers and duties attached by 
law to the position of patrolmen, were legally different from those vested in 
detectives. However, the above-quoted section 35 of the Charter of Cebu assigns 
the same power and duties to both. Hence, in Mission vs. Del Rosario (supra), we 
declared that "both detectives and policemen perform common functions and 
duties, and both belong to the police department," and the communication of the 
Department of Finance of June 14, 1955 (Annex G) approving Ordinance No. 188, 
referred to Item No. 19 thereof as involving-a "change of designation", as 
distinguished from "the abolition of sixteen (16) positions of immunization 
sanitary inspectors * * *." In other words, the language used in said Item No. 
19 of Ordinance No. 188 indicates the intent to maintain the positions therein 
referred to, although in another branch of the same police department of 
Cebu.</p>
<p>This was, evidently, what the framers of Ordinance No. 188 had in mind, for 
the administration that approved it, in 1955, did not declare that the positions 
held by petitioners had been abolished, and, instead, retained them in their 
aforesaid positions without extending to them new appointments. Such 
contemporaneous interpretation given by those responsible for the enactment of 
said Ordinance is strongly indicative of the intent of its authors and refutes 
respondents' pretense.</p>
<p>The cases of Manalang vs. Quitoriano,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>* </sup></span>G.R. No. L-6898 (decided on April 30, 1954), and Ocampo vs. Secretary of Justice, 
G. R. No. L-7910 (decided on January 18, 1955), cited by respondents, are not in 
point. The last case involved the constitionality of section 3 of Republic Act 
No. 1186, expressly abolishing "all existing positions of Judges-at-Large and 
Cadastral Judges." There is no similar provision in the case at bar. What is 
more, the provision in Ordinance No. 188 transferring the item for thirty-eight 
(38) detectives suggests the retention-not the abolition-of the positions of 
said detectives.</p>
<p>Besides, in the Ocampo case, seven (7) members of tills Court or a clear 
majority thereof voted to declare said section 3 of Republic Act No. 1186 
unconstitutional. Only (3) Justices (the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Reyes [A.], 
and Mr, Justice Labrador) voted to uphold the legality of said provision. Mr, 
Justice Padilla voted with the majority on the lack of power of Congress to 
abolish positions of Judges of First Instance, on which there were, therefore, 
eight (8) votes, or those required to declare a law unconstitutional. However, 
he believed that the law creating the positions of Judges-at-Large and Cadastral 
Judges "offends against section 7, Article VIII, of the Constitution." Being, in 
his opinion unconstitutional, said positions were, from his viewpoint, legally 
non-existent. In other words, he, in effect, maintained that section 3 of 
Republic Act No. 1186 did not abolish any position in the bench, and that it 
merely made a formal declaration of such non-existence.</p>
<p>So, too, the Manalang case involved the interpretation of Republic Act No. 
761, which "expressly abolished the Placement Bureau," of which Manalang was 
Director. As already adverted to, there is, in the present case, not only no 
express abolition, but, also, an implied retention, of the positions in dispute 
herein. Although the functions of the Placement Bureau were transferred to the 
National Employment Service created in said Act, we held that the latter office 
is "different and distinct" from the former, inasmuch as the National Employment 
Service was given some functions not vested in said Bureau or any other office. 
In the case at bar, the powers and duties conferred by law upon the uniformed 
division and the detectives of the Police Department of the City of Cebu are one 
and the same. Furthermore, Manalang admitted-in-fact, he alleged-that the 
position of Commissioner of the National Employment Service necessitated a "new 
appointment", which is denied by petitioners herein.</p>
<p>The local precedent involving a situation analogous to that of petitioners 
herein is that of Brillo vs. Enage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">* </sup>G.R. No. L-7115 (decided on March 30, 
1954), in which we held that the justice of the peace of the municipality of 
Tacloban, which was converted into a city, had a right to preside, without a new 
appointment, the municipal court of Tacloban, there having been, not an 
abolition of the justice of the peace court of Tacloban, but merely a change of 
name thereof. Verily,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A statute, although purporting to abolish municipal office, cannot have the 
effect of removing officers holding under the city charter when the act 
restores the offices under another name." (43 C. J. p. 601, citing Malone vs. 
Williams, 118 Tenn. 390, 108 S.W. 798, 121 Am SR 1002,)</p>
<p>"An ordinance merely changing the name of an incumbent's position in the city 
employ does not create a new position requiring a new appointment." (43 C.J., 
sec. 976, p. 600, citing Gilmur vs. Seattle, 124 p. 919.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, Ordinance No. 188 transferred the item for thirty-eight (38) 
detectives to the patrolmen division, but, it did not particularize what 
positions, from among the seventy-one (71) detectives then in the service, were 
to be affected by the transfer. Respondents seemingly assume that the power to 
identify said positions has been given to the Mayor. This would imply, however, 
a grant of blanket authority to the local executive, without any qualification 
or standard whatsoever to guide him in the exercise of such authority or to 
indicate the limits thereof. Thus, respondents' pretense is premised upon a 
supposed delegation of legislative power which even if meant to be made would be 
undue and illegal.</p>
<p>Assuming, however, that Ordinance No. 188 proposed to abolish the positions 
of thirty-eight (38) detectives whose items were transferred to the division of 
patrolmen, what was the reason therefor?</p>
<p>It will be recalled that, in 1953, the Mayor of Cebu City dismissed a good 
many members of the secret service force thereof, upon the theory that they held 
primarily confidential positions, from which they could be ousted at the 
pleasure of the Mayor. Most of the detectives concerned contested judicially the 
action of the Mayor, and some of these suits reached the Supreme Court which 
consistently sustained the contestants, nullified their dismissal and ordered 
their reinstatement. The first decision of this Court thereon was rendered on 
October 30, 1953, in Rodriguez vs. Del Rosario (supra), which was followed, on 
February 26, 1954, in Mission, et al. vs. Del Rosario, et al. (supra). As a 
consequence, the Court of First Instance of Cebu was constrained to adhere to 
these precedents, in its following cases, namely: Civil Case No. R-3153, 
entitled, "Saavedra vs. Del Rosario," decided on March 22, 1954; Civil Case No. 
R-3161, entitled "Miguel Cabaral vs. Del Rosario", decided on November 26, 1954; 
and Civil Case No. R-3214, entitled "Jose Almeda vs. Del Rosario", decided on 
December 20, 1954. The detectives in whose favor these decisions had been 
rendered had to be, and were, reinstated, as directed thereon. Less than two (2) 
months after the rendition of the last decision, or on February 9, 1955, 
Municipal Ordinance No. 188 was approved, with the item transferring the 
appropriation for thirty-eight (38) detectives, at P1,440 per annum each, to the 
division of patrolmen, this transfer to take effect retroactively on July 1, 
1954.</p>
<p>Why was this transfer made? Was it because the police force needed more 
patrolmen, as respondents say? Such could not be the reason, because the chief 
of police could have assigned thirty-eight (38) detectives to the uniformed 
division, without an amendment to the city budget. As correctly stated by the 
City Treasurer of Cebu, whose opinion is invoked by respondent City Mayor: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The chief of police may assign any member of the police force including 
detectives to any duty whenever the exigency of the service so demands, and 
where in his judgment it is for the good of public service. He has control and 
supervision of the detectives, he may assign them to any duty under his 
department." (See Annex 5 to respondent's answer.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, pursuant to section 32 of Commonwealth Act No. 58, said chief of 
police has "charge of the police department and everything pertaining thereto, 
including the * * * disposition of the city police and detective force." Thus, 
for instance, on May 16, and 21, 1956, former detectives Julian Bercede, 
Celestino Bigno, Lamberto Morre, Emilio Pardinilla and Enrique Pareja, who, like 
petitioners herein, had been given termination orders, after accepting 
appointments as patrolmen, in the uniformed division, tvere reassigned by the 
Chief of Police of Cebu City to the secret service division, together with 
patrolmen Patricio Cabalda, Terencio Garciano and Manuel Lucenario, despite the 
fact that, under Ordinance No. 188, their items belong to the uniformed division 
of said department (see Annexes L and L-l to L-3, to the amended petition).</p>
<p>Was the transfer of item in question made in Ordinance No. 188 because 
respondent City Mayor felt that the need of additional patrolmen was more or 
less permanent? Neither could this be the true reason therefor, because said 
City Mayor may transfer the necessary number of detectives from the secret 
division to the uniformed division, under section 9 (e) of Commonwealth Act No. 
58, reading: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The Mayor may, in the interest of the service and with the approval of 
the Secretary of Interior first had, transfer officers and employees not 
appointed by the President of the Philippines from one section, division or 
service to another section, division or service within the same department, 
without changing the compensation they receive."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the enactment of an Ordinance is, and was, unnecessary, either to 
detail temporarily, or to transfer permanently, a member of the secret service 
division to the uniformed division of the Police Department of the City of Cebu. 
At the same time, the officers of said city must" be aware of this, not only 
because they are presumed to be familiar with the Charter thereof, but, also, 
because said officers have the services of a City Fiscal and a staff of lawyers 
to advise them thereon. Now, then, if knowing that, in order to increase the 
number of patrolmen, by shifting to the uniformed division the corresponding 
number of detectives, an ordinance is unnecessary, what other purpose could 
Ordinance No. 188 have had in providing-for the transfer of item in question-on 
the assumption that the same involves an abolition of positions-than to cloak a 
devise to remove its incumbents (in whom the City Mayor had allegedly lost 
confidence) and to circumvent the constitutional and statutory provisions 
tending to protect their tenure of office, as well as to defeat the final 
judicial decrees directing the reinstatement of petitioners herein, which must 
have caused no little embarrassment to the city officers concerned? In such 
case, the pertinent provision of Municipal Ordinance No. 188 would be null and 
void.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But where an ordinance purporting to abolish such an office is only a device 
for the purpose of removing the incumbent while the office practically still 
remains in existence, it is an evasion of the law, and void." (43 C.J. sec. 978, 
p. 600.)</p>
<p>"But the right to abolish an unnecessary position cannot be used to conceal 
the discharge of an employee in violation of the civil service law or to 
circumvent the effect of a decree of the court restraining the city from 
removing the incumbent." (43 C. J. sec. 979, p. 600.)</p>
<p>"* * * Tenure of office statutes and civil service statutes do not prevent a 
bona fide abolition of the office by the municipality. Moreover, statutes to 
protect the tenure of office of veteran soldiers and sailors will not prevent 
the abolition of municipal offices. In such cases, however, the office must be 
abolished in good faith; and if immediately after the office is abolished 
another office is created with substantially the same duties and a different 
individual is appointed, or if it otherwise appears that the office was 
abolished for personal or political reasons, the courts will interfere." (37 Am. 
Jur., 858; italics ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the item in dispute could not have been prompted by the demands of 
public service, for the communication to the City Mayor of Cebu, attached to 
respondents' answer as Annex 1, shows that the Acting Chief of Police of Cebu 
City considered that the strength of his secret service division-including the 
thirty-eight (38) positions of detectives involved in this case-was not 
sufficient, and that "there is need of having more secret servicemen to take 
charge of the preventive phase" of the police work in said City. In other words, 
instead of more patrolmen, what tlie police department needed was more 
detectives. This explains why, after the appointment of detectives Bercede, 
Bigno, Morre, Pardinilla and Pareja as patrolmen, they had to be reassigned to 
the secret service division, together with patrolmen Cabalda, Garciano and 
Lucenario.</p>
<p>Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered declaring that the positions held by 
petitioners herein on and before May 15, 1956, were not abolished by Municipal 
Ordinance No. 188; that petitioners were entitled to remain in office, after 
said date; that they should be reinstated to their aforementioned positions and 
allowed to continue holding the same, with all rights appurtenant thereto, in 
accordance with law; and that they are entitled to collect the corresponding 
compensation from May 16, 1956, with costs against respondent City Mayor. It is 
so ordered.</p>
