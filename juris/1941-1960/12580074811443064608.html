<p>Petitioners, Norberto Lopez and Gregorio Lopez, Jr., were plaintiffs
in an action for forcible entry, docketed as Civil Case No. 55 of the
Justice of the Peace Court of Alcala, Pangasinan. Respondent herein,
except respondent Judge Honorable Amado S. Santiago, were the defend
ants therein. In due course, said court rendered judgment on July 3,
1958, which was amended on July 16, 1958, sentencing the aforementioned
defendants to vacate the land in dispute and to pay to Norberto and
Gregorio Lopez P100 a month from May 28, 1958 until the return of the
land to the latter, plus P5.00, the value of a tree destroyed by said
defendants, and attorney's fees. The defendants appealed to the Court
of First Instance of Pangasinan, presided over by respondent Judge, in
which the case was docketed as Civil Case No. U-221 thereof. Sometime
before October 14, 1958, Norberto and Gregorio Lopez filed with the
latter court a motion for the execution of the aforementioned judgment,
owing to the failure of the defendants to pay or deposit the amount of
said monthly rental or compensation. By an order dated October 14,
1958, the motion was granted.</p>
<p>Prior thereto, or on October 1, 1958, said defendants had moved for
the dismissal of the case upon the ground that the subject-matter of
litigation is a public land; that an investigation was then being
conducted by the Bureau of Lands, in connection with a free patent
application, filed by said defendants, covering the property in
dispute, and a protest or opposition thereto filed by Norberto and
Gregorio Lopez; and that all administrative remedies should first be
exhausted by the latter before seeking recourse in civil courts. On
November 10, 1958, respondent Judge issued an order denying the motion
to dismiss, but reconsidering and setting aside said order of October
14, 1958 and holding in abeyance the hearing of the case on the merits,
in view of the administrative proceedings pending in the Bureau of
Lands. A reconsideration of his last order having been denied by
respondent Judge, the present case was instituted by Norberto and
Gregorio Lopez, with the prayer that judgment be rendered</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(a) setting aside the order of the respondent Judge
of November 10, 1858, in Civil Case No. U-221 of the Court of First
Instance of Pangasinan, insofar as it reconsider and set aside the
previous order of execution of the judgment of the Justice of the Peace
Court of Alcala, Pangasinan, with respect to the possession of the land
involved in the litigation;</p>
  <p>"(b) ordering the execution of
the judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court of Alcala, Pangasinan in
Civil Case No. 55 of said court, not only with respect to the damages
adjudicated therein but also with respect to the possession of the
parcel of land involved in the litigation;</p>
  <p>"(c) ordering the respondent Judge to proceed with the hearing on the merits of the case; and</p>
  <p>"(d) condemning respondents Jose Nato, et  als. to pay the costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is well settled in this jurisdiction that, when the decision of a
justice of the peace or municipal court in a forcible entry case is
adverse to the defendant, and the Utter has appealed therefrom, but
fails, during the pendency of the appeal, to pay the amount of the
rental due from time to time under the contract or the reasonable value
of the use and occupation of the premises, under the conditions set
forth in Section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, it is the mandatory
duty of the court of, first instance to order the execution of the
judgment appealed from (Arcilla <em>vs.</em> Del Rosario, 74  Phil.,  445; Cunanan  <em>vs.</em>
Rodas, 78 Phil., 800). Yet, respondent Judge revoked the order for the
execution of the aforementioned judgment of the Justice of the Peace
Court of Alcala, despite the failure of the main respondents herein, as
defendants in the case above referred to, to make the payment required
in said section 8 of Rule 72, upon the following ground:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It appearing that an order for the issuance of a
writ of execution was issued by this Court on October 14, 1958, on the
premise that the land in dispute is a private land and in view of the
fact that the attention of this Court was called for the first time in
the instant motion to dismiss that the land is a public land, the
decision of the inferior court can not be executed, although the same
becomes final, because the Director of Lands has direct executive
control of the disposition and management of public lands. (Sec. 4,
Commonwealth, Act No. 141; Hernandez, et al. <em>vs.</em> Clapiz, et
al., No. L-6812, March 26, 1956). Hence, the order, for the issuance of
a writ of execution issued on October 14, 1958 is hereby reconsidered
and set aside insofar as the restoration of the possession of the land
in question is concerned."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondent Judge thus seems to be under the impression that Rule 72
of the Rules of Court, relative to forcible entry cases, is applicable
only to, private lands, and that decisions rendered against the
defendants in such cases may not be ordered executed, the provisions of
said Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, when the property involved
is a public land. This view fails to consider in its true light the
philosophy underlying the law on forcible entry cases. Commenting
thereon, former Chief Justice Moran has the following to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  * *  the action for forcible entry and detainer is of statutory origin.  Its purpose, <em>regardless  of  the  actual condition of the title to the property</em>,
is that the party in peaceable and quiet possession shall not be turned
out by strong hand, violence or terror. In affording this remedy of
restitution <em>the object of the statutes is to prevent breaches of
the peace and criminal disorder which would ensue from the withdrawal,
of the remedy</em>, and the reasonable hope such withdrawal would
create that some advantage must accrue to those persons who, believing
themselves entitled to the possession of property, resort to force to
gain possession rather than to some appropriate action in the courts to
assert their claims. Such is the philosophy at the foundation of all
actions of forcible entry and detainer which are designed <em>to  compel the party  out  of possession to respect  and resort to the law alone</em> to obtain what he claims is his.</p>
  <p>"It has been  held  that <em>the
determination of the respective right of rival claimants to public
lands is different from the determination of who has the actual
physical possession or occupation with a view to protecting the same
and preventing disorder and breaches of the peace. A judgment of the
court ordering restitution of the possession of a parcel of land to the
actual occupant, who has been deprived thereof by another through the
use of fared or in any other illegal manner, can never be 'prejudicial
interference' with the disposition or alienation, of public lands. On
the contrary, courts were deprived of jurisdiction over the cases
involving conflicts of possession, the threat of judicial action
against breaches of the peace committed on public lands would be
eliminated, and a state of lawlessness would probably be produced
between applicants occupants or squatters, "where force or might, not
right or justice would rule."</em>   (Comments  on  the  Rules of Court, by Moran,  Vol. 2 [1957  ed.], pp. 284-285; italics  ours.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, public interest, public policy and public order,
demand that the party in peaceful possession of a land, independently
of whether it is private in nature or part of the public domain, be not
ousted therefrom by means of force, violence or intimidation,
regardless of the quality of his alleged right to the possession
thereof, and that, whoever claims to have a better title or right
thereto should seek, from the proper authorities, the legal remedies
established therefor, instead of taking the law into their hands.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order of respondent Judge, dated
November 10, 1958, insofar only as it reconsiders and sets aside the
aforementioned order of October 14, 1958, directing the execution of
the judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court of Alcala, is hereby
annulled and said order of October 14, 1958, is, accordingly,
reinstated, with costs against the main, respondent herein. It is so
ordered.</p>
