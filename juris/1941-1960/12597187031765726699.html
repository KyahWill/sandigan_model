				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition for writs of prohibition&nbsp; and&nbsp; preliminary injunction.<br><br>In&nbsp; civil case No. 12083 of the Court of , First Instance of Pangasinan where the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; Casimiro&nbsp; Garganta and&nbsp; Catalina&nbsp; Donato are plaintiffs and the respondents, except the Court of Appeals and the Sheriff of the Province of Pangasinan,&nbsp; are defendants, judgment&nbsp; was rendered on 10 April 1956 for the&nbsp; former and against the latter (Annex&nbsp; A).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 18 April notice thereof&nbsp; was received by counsel for the defendants (Annex B).&nbsp; On 16&nbsp; May the defendants filed a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; (Annex B).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 1&nbsp; June the defendants filed&nbsp; a pleading where "arguments to&nbsp; support&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of the decision filed by defendants&nbsp; on&nbsp; May 16, 1956" were advanced&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; C).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 4&nbsp; June the Court denied the motion for reconsideration&nbsp; (Annex D).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 18 June the defendants filed their notice of appeal and&nbsp; record on appeal (Annex H).&nbsp; On 23 June Rufino E. Gonzales, in his own behalf as&nbsp; cross-defendant and&nbsp; as&nbsp; counsel for the other cross-defendants, filed an "objection&nbsp; to the record on appeal and counter petition for writ of&nbsp; execution"" on the ground that the appeal&nbsp; was filed&nbsp; out of time&nbsp; (Annex E).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 27 June&nbsp; the defendants replied&nbsp; to the objection (Annex F).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 24 July&nbsp; the plaintiffs&nbsp; objected to the allowance of the defendants' record on appeal on the same ground invoked by the cross-defendants&nbsp; (Annex G).&nbsp; On 26 July the Court allowed the defendants' record on appeal (Annex H).&nbsp; Motions for reconsiderations&nbsp; (Annexes I &amp; J) were denied on 6 September (Annex J-l).&nbsp; In the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; the appellees reiterated their motion to dismiss the appeal&nbsp; for the same&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; advanced by them in the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below&nbsp; (CA-G.R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 18884-R).&nbsp; On 29 December the Court of Appeals denied&nbsp; their&nbsp; motion for the reason that the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; already had&nbsp; passed upon the same grounds advanced before&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Hence this petition to restrain&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals from proceeding with&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal for want&nbsp; of jurisdiction&nbsp; to entertain&nbsp; it. On 25 March 1957 this Court issued a writ of "preliminary injunction after the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; had filed&nbsp; a surety bond in the sum of P200, enjoining the Court of Appeals from proceeding to consider the appeal in CA-G.R. No. 18884-R.<br><br>On 18 April 1956 notice of judgment of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance was received by counsel for the respondents. The latter had thirty days from notice of&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; to take an appeal, or&nbsp; up to 18 May, pursuant&nbsp; to section 3, Rule&nbsp; 41.&nbsp; On 16&nbsp; May,&nbsp; two days&nbsp; before the end&nbsp; of the thirty-day period,&nbsp; the respondents moved for reconsideration of .the&nbsp; judgment and on&nbsp; 1&nbsp; June&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; pleading where arguments in support of the motion&nbsp; were advanced. On 6 June the postmaster of Lingayen sent&nbsp; to respondents counsel at his address of record the notice to claim within&nbsp; five days&nbsp; from&nbsp; the post office the&nbsp; registered letter containing the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; motion for reconsideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was not until&nbsp; 18 June that counsel&nbsp; actually received notice of the denial&nbsp; of the respondents&nbsp; motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; On the same day, 18 June, the&nbsp; respondents filed their notice of appeal, appeal bond&nbsp; and record on appeal.<br><br>Petitioners&nbsp; contend that being&nbsp; merely&nbsp; <i><i>pro forma</i></i> the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; did not interrupt the&nbsp; running" of the period within which&nbsp; the appeal may&nbsp; be taken.&nbsp; Respondents claim otherwise. Respondents'&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the trial court is as follows:<br><blockquote>Come now the defendants in&nbsp; the above entitled case, thru their undersigned attorney and to this Honorable&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; respectfully pray the reconsideration of the decision of this&nbsp; Honorable Court dated April 10, 1956, a copy of which was received by the undersigned counsel for the defendants on April 18, 1956, on the ground that&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision is completely&nbsp; against the&nbsp; evidence presented&nbsp; during the trial of this case and&nbsp; the same decision is against the law.<br><br>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; respectfully prayed&nbsp; that the decision of this Honorable&nbsp; Court dated April 10, 1956,&nbsp; be&nbsp; reconsidered and&nbsp; set aside&nbsp; and&nbsp; another&nbsp; decision&nbsp; be rendered in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; presented during the trial of this case and in accordance&nbsp; with law.&nbsp; (Annex B.)<br></blockquote>As the motion&nbsp; sought&nbsp; reconsideration of the judgment rendered by&nbsp; the trial court "on the ground that said decision is completely&nbsp; against the evidence presented during the trial&nbsp; of&nbsp; this case&nbsp; and the&nbsp; same decision&nbsp; is against the&nbsp; law,"&nbsp; without&nbsp; pointing out&nbsp; the&nbsp; findings&nbsp; and&nbsp; pronouncements&nbsp; made in&nbsp; the judgment that&nbsp; were allegedly contrary to the evidence and&nbsp; the&nbsp; law, the motion was <i>pro forma</i> and did not stop the running of the period within which&nbsp; to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; on&nbsp; 1&nbsp; June, before entry of the&nbsp; order denying the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration, the respondents filed a pleading where they pointed&nbsp; out fraud on&nbsp; the part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendant Rufino&nbsp; E. Gonzales who on 26 July sold % of the land to the plaintiffs reserving the&nbsp; right to repurchase it,&nbsp; notwithstanding the fact that in civil case No. 16, Marcela Espinosa, et al. <i>vs.</i> Rufino E.&nbsp; Gonzales, et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; a writ of&nbsp; execution was issued against&nbsp; Rufino E.&nbsp; Gonzales,&nbsp; did not&nbsp; cure the&nbsp; defect&nbsp; of the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud&nbsp; committed&nbsp;&nbsp; by Rufino E.&nbsp; Gonzales was not committed by the spouses&nbsp; Casimiro Garganta and Catalina&nbsp; Donato, unless the evidence showed that the latter&nbsp; had knowledge of the fraud&nbsp; being perpetrated by&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the vendors.&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiffs, the herein petitioners, was predicated on the registration of the sale on 26 July 1948 or before the registration of the levy upon execution which was on 4 August 1948.&nbsp; The trial court found that the sale in favor of the plaintiffs was valid as against&nbsp; the&nbsp; levy on&nbsp; execution which brought about&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of the&nbsp; land in litigation by the sheriff&nbsp; to the defendants.<br><br>Granting, however, that the filing of the respondents' motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; on&nbsp; 16 May&nbsp; tolled the&nbsp; period within which an appeal may be taken, still the appeal&nbsp; filed on 18 June was not on time.&nbsp; On 4 June the Court denied the respondents' motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; On 6 June the postmaster of Lingayen sent to respondents' counsel at his address of record the notice to claim&nbsp; within five days from the post office the registered letter containing the notice denying the&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration.&nbsp; Section 8, Rule 27,&nbsp; partly provides that:<br><blockquote>* * * Service by registered mail is&nbsp; complete&nbsp; upon actual receipt by the addressee; but if he fails to&nbsp; claim his mail from the post office within five days from the date of&nbsp; first notice of the&nbsp; postmaster, the service shall take effect at the expiration&nbsp; of such&nbsp; time.<br></blockquote>As counsel for the respondents&nbsp; failed to claim the registered letter from the&nbsp; post office within&nbsp; five days from receipt&nbsp; of the notice, service thereof was&nbsp; deemed to have taken effect&nbsp; five&nbsp; days&nbsp; after its receipt, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup>&nbsp; or on 11 June. From this date the two days remaining out of the&nbsp; thirty-day period resumed to&nbsp; run.&nbsp; The&nbsp; two&nbsp; remaining days ended&nbsp; on&nbsp; 13&nbsp; June.&nbsp; The&nbsp; notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; filed on&nbsp; 18 June&nbsp; were, therefore, beyond&nbsp; the reglementary period, when judgment already had become final&nbsp; and executory.<br><br>The failure of attorney Jose Rivera, respondents' counsel in the court below,&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive the notice sent by the postmaster at&nbsp; his address of record and&nbsp; to&nbsp; claim from the post office the registered letter&nbsp; containing the notice denying the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration,&nbsp; because&nbsp; he&nbsp; was in&nbsp; Alaminos, where&nbsp; he lived with his family,&nbsp; and&nbsp; because he was busy attending to his other cases in court, does not relieve the respondents from the adverse effect of&nbsp; their&nbsp; counsel's negligence.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; incumbent upon an attorney&nbsp; to take such precaution as&nbsp; to receive promptly all&nbsp; judicial notices during&nbsp; his&nbsp; absence from his address of record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Respondents&nbsp; contend&nbsp; further&nbsp; "that&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; the lower court giving&nbsp; due course to the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; of the appellants in Civil&nbsp; Case No. 12038&nbsp; had become final&nbsp; and&nbsp; executory&nbsp; as&nbsp; plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; did not appeal from&nbsp; the said Order and hence the Honorable&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals have no more authority to revoke&nbsp; said&nbsp; Order," and that it cannot be annulled by a writ of prohibition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 14, Rule&nbsp; 41, provides:<br><blockquote>A motion to dismiss&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal on any of the&nbsp; grounds mentioned in&nbsp; the preceding&nbsp; section&nbsp; (failure to file notice, bond, or record on&nbsp; appeal)&nbsp; may&nbsp; be filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance prior to&nbsp; the transmittal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; record to the appellate court.<br></blockquote>Section 1, paragraph (a), Rule 52,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>An appeal may&nbsp; be&nbsp; dismissed by&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds: (a)&nbsp; Failure to file, within the period prescribed by these rules, the&nbsp; notice of appeal, appeal bond&nbsp; or record on appeal;<br></blockquote>The denial by the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiffs' motion to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants appeal&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; preclude&nbsp; the former&nbsp; from renewing&nbsp; or reiterating&nbsp; in the Court of Appeals their&nbsp; motion to dismiss the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; under Rule 52.&nbsp; An allowance&nbsp; by a Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; which&nbsp; was not&nbsp; taken&nbsp; within&nbsp; the reglementary period;&nbsp; a denial by the same Court&nbsp; of a motion to dismiss an appeal taken beyond such period; and a&nbsp; denial by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals to dismiss&nbsp; such&nbsp; appeal, do not render the&nbsp; appeal valid, effective and legal.&nbsp; If an appeal be not taken within the reglementary period, the judgment becomes final, and the legality&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allowance of the appeal&nbsp; and of&nbsp; the denial of the motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss the appeal&nbsp; by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; and the appellate court,&nbsp; to which the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; had been&nbsp; forwarded, may always&nbsp; be raised because it concerns the jurisdiction of the appellate court, a point which may be raised at&nbsp; any stage of the proceedings in the appellate court.<br><br>The writ prayed for is granted&nbsp; and&nbsp; the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made final, with costs against the respondents, except the Court of Appeals and the&nbsp; Provincial Sheriff of Pangasinan.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
