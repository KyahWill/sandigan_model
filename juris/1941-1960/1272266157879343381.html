				<h4>
				G.R. No. 4397, October 24, 1952</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF DELFIN LIMTAO, TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. DELFIN LIMTAO, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the Government from a decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Bulacan, granting the petition for naturalization of 
the petitioner-appellee, Delfin Limtao.
<p align="justify">The only contention raised by the Solicitor General is that the 
appellee lacks one of the qualifications prescribed in section 2, paragraph 4, 
of the Revised Naturalization Law, namely, that "he must own real estate in the 
Philippines worth not less than five thousand pesos, Philippine currency, or 
must have some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation." This 
contention is well taken, it appearing that the appealed decision expressly 
finds that the appellee actually lives with his parents who support him, that he 
does not own any property or business, and that he is a student in the Far 
Eastern University under the support of his parents. Counsel for appellee argues 
that the latter helps in his father's grocery store, and that although the 
appellee does not receive any salary for his work, the support given by his 
father may well be considered as regular compensation. It is obvious that in the 
very nature of things, regardless of the help rendered by the appellee, his 
parents with whom he lives and who know that he has no independent income, are 
morally bound to support him; and there is no showing that, if the appellee does 
not help his father in the latter's grocery store, he would not be 
supported.</p>
<p align="justify">As the appellee does not possess all the qualifications 
prescribed by law for the acquisition of Philippine citizenship, the appealed 
decision will be as it is hereby reversed and his petition for naturalization 
denied. So ordered.</p>
