				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The  ten  petitioners  were   provincial  guards  in  the provincial jail  at Baybay, Leyte, when in January 1955 the respondent Governor Bernardo Torres terminated their services  and replaced  them  with  the other respondents (except Enrique Grandos,  Homobono Bardillon, Esmeraldo Galenzoga, Secretary of the Provincial Board and wardens, respectively). <br><br>Claiming the protection  of Republic Act 65 as amended, and Republic  Act 557 they instituted  this proceeding to test the legality of their ouster.   They alleged they neither resigned  nor gave legal cause  for removal. The case was submitted in the court below, mainly upon a stipulation of facts.   Petitioners won, and respondents appealed to this Court. <br><br>The pertinent portions  of the  said stipulation  read  as follows: <br><blockquote>'That petitioners Alejandro Acedillo, Adriano  Catorce  and Cresencio Bagaslao, are veterans; and Adriano Palugod, Quirino Japon, Diosdado Piastro and Epifanio Enclona are members or enlisted men of  good  standing  of  the  recognized guerilla  under  recognition of  the Republic Act No.  65, as amended by  Republic  Act 154, and were  all appointed  within  the three year  period under  the Republic Act  No. 65,  as amended from  the  date  of approval  of that Act; <br><br>That Adronico Morfe  was  a  member  or enlisted  man  of good standing by the recognized guerilla unit under  Republic Act  No. 65;  * * *; <br><br>That up to  the date  of their  terminations,  the  petitioners Quirino Japon,  Alejandro Acedillo,  Zosimo  Macaraya,  Cresencio Bagaslao,   Epifanio  Enclona,  Adriano Catorce,  Andronico  Morfe, Bernardo  Corsanes,  Adriano  Palugod and Diosdado Piastro, have never  resigned  nor  have been  removed  for  any  cause stated  in Republic Act  557;  * * *;<br> <br>That the respondents guards made applications for their positions to  the respondent Bernardo  Torres,  Provincial  Governor, as evidenced by Exhibits  1, 1-A  to  1-I, and were  duly appointed  to their respective positions  as follows:  * * *; <br><br>That the above  respondents have  asumed office and  have  taken their oaths on the dates following their respective dates  of terminations  of the  petitioners, and  are  still   serving till  at  present; <br><br>That none  of the petitioners  are civil service eligibles, except Alejandro  Acedillo, who  received his report of rating on July 29, 1955, of the examination  of Patrolman Qualifying, taken by him at Tacloban  City on  November  27,  1954, with the rating of 70.68% as evidence by Exhibit "E".  *  *  *."</blockquote>There  was proof that respondents, at the  time  of  their appointments  were civil service eligibles. <br><br>Apparently  the respondents argued that petitioners had no  reason to complain inasmuch as  they were civil service non-eligibles<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[l]</span></sup>  who were substituted  by persons  with civil service  eligibility.  This  was not heeded, and  judgment issued for petitioners. <br><br>We  think  the court erred in so  far  as it  denied the power of appointing officers to replace non-eligibles holding  civil service  positions for more than three months and  in violation of sec. 682 of the  Revised Administrative Code.  Indeed in  Manigbas  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  De  Guzman<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>—replacement of a temporary Chief of Police having no civil service eligibility by another non-eligible—this Court through Mr. Justice Alex.  Reyes applying the three months limitation in said  sec.  682  reiterated the view that "the holding of a position  by  a temporary appointee until  replaced by an  eligible  in disregard  of  the time limitation of three months is  unauthorized and  illegal," the  replacement of non-eligibles  by  non-eligibles  being authorized conformably  to  sec. 682 of same Code.  We further held that "as positions of members of the police  department of a  city  are embraced  within  the  classified  (civil) service,  non-eligibles appointed to these positions cannot continue  in office  for  more than  three  months  and  can therefore, be  thereafter replaced  by other non-eligibles." <br><br>What  was said of members of  the police force equally applies to provincial guards, the tenure of office of both classes  being protected by the  same  civil  service  law and  by Republic Act No. 557.  There is no question that all of the guards herein  replaced had  been  serving for <span style="font-style: italic;">more than three years under</span> appointments temporary in nature because  non-eligible. <br><br>On  behalf  of  eight petitioners who  are  veterans or guerrillas, the  provisions  of  Republic  Act   No.  65  as amended by  Republic  Act 154 are invoked.  Said  Act gives veterans and guerillas "preference in appointments and  promotions in and to any government office *  *  * the  provisions of  law  as  to civil service eligibility notwithstanding."  But that  preference was  to  last  for "three years from the time of the  passage of this  Act" on October 18,  1946.   It lapsed in  October 1949.  These  appointments of their substitutes took place in 1955.  It may not of course be contended that once a non-eligible veteran is appointed to a civil service position pursuant to Act No.  65  he may not thereafter be  changed  even after the expiration of the three-year special privilege. It should be  stated here that these  eight veterans were replaced by civil service eligibles.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup> <br><br>As to Alejandro  Acedillo, his  having passed the Civil Service examination after he had been  replaced  is  immaterial.  It does not render illegal what was  legal when made. <br><br>Respondents,  it appears,  have  filed against  petitioners a counterclaim for damages, which was dismissed by the lower  court.  They  now insist on their right  to recover. However, they failed to  except and appeal from the order of August 17, 1955, dismissing such counterclaim.   They only appealed from the court's judgment  of  September 15,  1955,  declaring the petitioners entitled to resume and hold their positions as guards. <br><br>In view of the foregoing, and applying our  three decisions herein mentioned in the Manigbas,  Orais and Paña cases, we hereby reverse the appealed decision and dismiss petitioners'  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span>  complaint with  costs against them. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J.,  Reyes,  A.,  Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.

Theirs  were temporary appointments  under section 682 of the Administrative  Code. <br><br><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>94 Phil., 245; See also Orais <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ribo, 93 Phil., 985;  Paña <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> City  Mayor, 50 Off.
