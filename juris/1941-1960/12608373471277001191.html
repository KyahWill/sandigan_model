				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal&nbsp; from an order of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of La&nbsp; Union, dismissing plaintiff's complaint.<br><br>The said complaint alleges that plaintiff had become the owner of a piece of land by purchase at an execution sale, the deed of definitive sale having been issued to 'him&nbsp; on July&nbsp; 25, 1947;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on July 81&nbsp; of that year the deputy sheriff,&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; cle Guzman, put&nbsp; him&nbsp; in possession of&nbsp; a piece of land which the barrio lieutenant, Aniceto Zandaga, pointed out as the one&nbsp; described in the deed but which in fact proved to be different; that upon discovering this fact and that the land bought by him and described in the deed was&nbsp; being&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; by Zandaga, plaintiff&nbsp; demanded possession thereof&nbsp; but&nbsp; the demand was&nbsp; refused,&nbsp; Zandaga claiming&nbsp; that he was "the&nbsp; successor in interest" of the judgment debtor; and that by&nbsp; Zandaga's willful&nbsp; and malicious act in concealing the identity of the property covered by the deed&nbsp; plaintiff was deprived of its possession and enjoyment of its fruits.&nbsp; The complaint&nbsp; pray that&nbsp; defendant Aniceto Zandaga be ordered to show his, title to the land and that should his title prove inferior&nbsp; to&nbsp; that of plaintiff, the latter be declared the rightful&nbsp; owner of the property and defendant Zandaga&nbsp; ordered to&nbsp; deliver possession thereof to him, together with his share of the products of the lands, and also, to pay damages, attorney's fee and costs&nbsp; and furthermore to declare the provincial sheriff subsidiarily liable should his co-defendant&nbsp; Aniceto Zandaga be&nbsp; unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay what might be&nbsp; adjudged by the court. <br><br>Instead&nbsp; of answering&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; both defendants moved for dismissal on the ground that the complaint did not state&nbsp; a cause of action, and the motion having been granted, plaintiff&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; directly to this&nbsp; Court as&nbsp; the question involved is&nbsp; purely&nbsp; legal.<br><br>Briefly&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; the case is that of a purchaser&nbsp; of real property at an execution sale already in receipt of a definitive&nbsp; deed, who,&nbsp; having been&nbsp; prevented&nbsp; from taking possession of said property by an alleged successor in interest of&nbsp; the judgment debtor,&nbsp; comes to court for relief, asking&nbsp; that&nbsp; he be&nbsp; declared&nbsp; the rightful&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property and, consequently,, entitled to its possession and to damages.<br><br>It is settled that upon receipt of the definitive&nbsp; deed in an&nbsp; execution sale, legal&nbsp; title&nbsp; over the&nbsp; property&nbsp; sold is perfected&nbsp;&nbsp; (S3&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.&nbsp; S. 654).&nbsp; And this court has&nbsp; also and that the&nbsp; land bought by him and described in the deed deemed within the&nbsp; period&nbsp; allowed for that purpose, its ownership becomes consolidated.in the purchaser,&nbsp; and the latter, "as absolute owner * * * is entitled to its possession and to receive the rents and fruits thereof."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Powell vs.&nbsp; Philippine National Bank, 54 Phil., 54, 63:)&nbsp; As&nbsp; the purchaser in the present case has, according to the allegations of the&nbsp; complaint-—which&nbsp; are&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; hypothetically admitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion to dismiss—already received the definitive deed of sale and become the owner of the property bought, he should be entitled to its possession and cannot be&nbsp; excluded&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; by&nbsp; one, who,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to the same complaint, merely claims to be&nbsp; a "successor in&nbsp; interest of the&nbsp; judgment debtor," unless it is adjudged that this alleged&nbsp; successor&nbsp; has a&nbsp; better right&nbsp; to the property than&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchaser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such adjudication,&nbsp; however, would at this stage of the proceedings&nbsp; be premature&nbsp; and without basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; dismiss the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; now, merely&nbsp; upon motion, is&nbsp; in effect to declare that the judgment&nbsp; debtor's alleged successor&nbsp; has a better right to the property&nbsp; than the purchaser, a legal&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; which cannot be deduced from the facts alleged.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See 44 Am. Jur. 77.)<br><br>It would appear that the trial&nbsp; court dismissed the&nbsp; complaint in the belief that&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; was under , section 32&nbsp; of Rule 39, which reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 32.<i> When purchaser&nbsp; of property may recover&nbsp; price from judgment creditor.&nbsp; When he may have judgment&nbsp; revived.</i>—The purchaser of real property sold on execution, or his successor&nbsp; in interest, who fails to recover possession thereof, or is evicted&nbsp; there from,&nbsp; in consequence of irregularities in the&nbsp; proceedings concerning the sale, or because&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; has been&nbsp; reversed or&nbsp; set aside,&nbsp; or because the property sold was exempt from, execution,&nbsp; or because a third person has vindicated his&nbsp; claim to&nbsp; the&nbsp; property, may in&nbsp; a proper action&nbsp; recover&nbsp; from the&nbsp; judgment creditor&nbsp; the price&nbsp; paid, with interest, or so much thereof as has&nbsp; been&nbsp; delivered to t3ie judgment debtor, or may, on motion after&nbsp; notice, have the&nbsp; original judgment&nbsp; revived&nbsp; in his name for the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; price with interest,&nbsp; or so much thereof as has&nbsp; been delivered to&nbsp; the judgment debtor.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; so&nbsp; revived shall have&nbsp; the same force and effect as would an original&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the revival and no more."<br></blockquote>But while this provision of the Rules&nbsp; gives the&nbsp; purchaser of real property&nbsp; sold&nbsp; on execution who fails to recover possession thereof, or is evicted therefrom, recourse against the judgment creditor or&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; debtor,&nbsp; it&nbsp; does , not bar him&nbsp; from his right&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover possession where that right has not yet been denied&nbsp; by the courts.<br><br>It follows that,&nbsp; at&nbsp; least as against the defendant Aniceto Zandaga, plaintiff's complaint stated a cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the defendant provincial&nbsp; sheriff,&nbsp; there is no sufficient allegation in the complaint-to make him subsidiarily liable.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of dismissal is&nbsp; revoked with respect to the defendant Aniceto Zandaga&nbsp; and the case remanded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the court below for further proceedings.&nbsp; The dismissal. as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; provincial sheriff shall&nbsp; stand unless proper amendment to&nbsp; the complaint is&nbsp; made within the time to be fixed by the lower court.<br><br>The appellee Aniqeto Zandaga shall pay costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L. </i>and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
