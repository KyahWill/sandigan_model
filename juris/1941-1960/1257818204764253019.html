				<H3>JESUS T. QUIAMBAO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT VS. PEDRO R. PERALTA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pedro R. Peralta brought an action against Jesus T. Quiambao (civil No. 1793 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal) to recover from the latter P12,000 interest thereon from 9 February 1949 until paid; P15,000 for thereon for actual, moral and exemplary damages; and P5,200 for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation. After issues had been joined and trial held, the Court rendered judgement, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against  the defendant, ordering the defendant: (1) to pay the plaintiff the sum  of P12,000 plus interest at the legal rate, from  the time of  the presentation of this  complaint up to the time that the said sum of P12,000 is fully paid; (2) to pay  the plaintiff  the sum of P5,000 as moral and exemplary damages because the defendant had taken advantage of the ignorance and lack of education of the plaintiff, and has made  full use of his intelligence to defraud the plaintiff, an old man, of his money;  (3) to pay the plaintiff P1,000 as attorney's fees; and  (4) to pay the costs of this action.  (Annex I, pp. 82, 87,  Record on Appeal.)</blockquote>On appeal by Jesus T.  Quiambao from the judgment, the Court of Appeals affirmed it.   The appellate court ordered the transmittal  of  the  record  of the case  to this Court for whatever action it might deem proper to take against Attorney Jesus  T.  Quiambao  for having committed acts unbecoming a member of the bar.<br><br>Jesus T.  Quiambao brought  an action against Pedro R. Peralta  (civil case No. 2917 of  the same Court) seeking to annul the judgment rendered in civil case No. 1783 and that of the Court  of  Appeals which affirmed it  (CA-GR No. 11104-R), on the ground that the defendant committed fraud upon the plaintiff by concealing material and  true facts;  to suspend the execution  of the  judgment in  said civil case,  or, if already executed, to  recover from  the  defendant the sum  of  P12,000, interest thereon from 30 June 1952,  P5,000  for moral  and  exemplary  damages, P1,000  for attorney's fees, all awarded in the former  case and P10,000  for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation spent and to be incurred in this last case, and costs.<br><br>The defendant moved for the dismissal of the complaint upon the ground that the  cause of  action is barred by a prior judgment; the complaint states no cause  of  action the plaintiff is in estoppel; and the action is not the proper remedy. The plaintiff filed an objection  to the motion  and the defendant a  reply  thereto. <br><br>The Court dismissed the  complaint and  dissolved  the writ  of attachment therefor issued, from which  order the plaintiff  has  appealed.<br><br>The appellant argues and  contends that  as  the motion to dismiss admits the allegations  of  the complaint where it is alleged that the judgment rendered in civil case  No. 1783  by the Court  of  First  Instance of Rizal  and that rendered on appeal in CA-GR No. 11104-R by the  Court of Appeals,  which affirmed  it, are  null and  void, such nullity  should be deemed  admitted.  This  contention is preposterous, because the ground relied upon in the motion to dismiss that the cause of action  is barred  by a prior judgment,  admits only  the  material allegations of  the complaint. The allegation  of nullity of  a judgment in a complaint being a conclusion  and not a material allegation is not deemed admitted by the  party who files a motion to dismiss.  The grounds invoked by the appellant to annul the judgment rendered in civil case No. 1783 by the  Court of First Instance  of  Rizal and affirmed by the  Court of Appeals  in  CA-GR  No. 11104-R cannot  be  availed  of, because the  same are  proper for an appeal, they constitute  a  direct attack  on the judgment  sought  to  be reversed which may not be  attacked collaterally by another action.  In  connection  with  the  judgment rendered  in civil case No. 1783 against  the  herein appellant, then defendant, and affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-GR  No. 11104-R,  the herein appellant sought  a  review thereof by  a petition or  a writ  of certiorari but this Court denied it  for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>A perusal of the judgment rendered in civil  case No. 1783 by the  Court  of  First Instance of Rizal and of that rendered on  appeal in CA-GR No.  11104-R  by the Court of  Appeals  discloses  that  the  facts  alleged by the  appellant in his complaint which he claims constitute fraud committed upon him by the appellee, were considered and passed upon by both Courts; and the fact that the appellant's  claim  was neither given  credence nor sustained  by both Courts is no reason for concluding that fraud was committed by  the  appellee upon the appellant.<br><br>The  order appealed from  is affirmed, with treble costs against the  appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
