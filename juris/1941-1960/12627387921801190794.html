				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner herein, G. B.&nbsp; Inc., is the&nbsp; trustee&nbsp; of Juan Luna Subdivision,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; Allison Gibbs is the&nbsp; President of the petitioner and Manager of&nbsp; Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc.&nbsp; Before December 31, 1953, herein&nbsp; respondent Juan T. Chuidian and Allison Gibbs&nbsp; were partners of the&nbsp; law firm "Gibbs, Gibbs,&nbsp; Chuidian&nbsp; and Quasha", the retainingcounsel of Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc.&nbsp; On June 18, 1948, a loan of F40,000 w'as granted by Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc. to&nbsp; respondent Chuidian,' and an "Agreement to Sell" was executed on that date whereby respondent Chuidian acknowledged&nbsp; the receipt of&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount for which lie&nbsp; ' agreed&nbsp; and promised to transfer within&nbsp; 60&nbsp; days to Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc. the land which he bought from one Florence Shuster with the loan thus&nbsp; obtained.&nbsp; On June 19, 1948; respondent Chuidian addressed a letter to Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc., indicating his intention to secure a loan from the&nbsp; Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation with whicji to pay&nbsp; his&nbsp; debt&nbsp; to&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Luna&nbsp; Subdivision, Inc. On llay, 5, 1953, in hia letter to Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc., respondent&nbsp; Chuidian acknowledged&nbsp; his&nbsp; indebtedness of P53,817.72&nbsp; representing balance of principal&nbsp; and interest.&nbsp; Instead of conveying the land bought from Florence&nbsp; Shuster&nbsp; to Juan&nbsp; Luna&nbsp; Subdivision, Inc.,&nbsp; respondent Chuidian&nbsp; sold&nbsp; the same&nbsp; to Elenita Hernandez for P25,000 in order to pay his&nbsp; wife's&nbsp; gambling debt. On December 1, 1953, Allison Gibbs and respondent Chuidian ceased to&nbsp; be lav partners.&nbsp; On March 4, 1954, the petir tioner filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; complaint against respondent Chuidian&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila, Civil Case No. 22138, for the&nbsp; collection of his indebtedness based&nbsp; on his "Agreement to&nbsp; Sell".&nbsp; At the commencement of the action, the petitioner&nbsp; asked for the issuance<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex parte</span> of a writ. of preliminary attachment which was granted by the court upon the filing by the petitioner of a bond of P57.000.' On March 12, 1954, respondent Chuidian filed&nbsp; a "Motion,to Discharge Attachment"&nbsp; based&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; said attachment was improperly issued, to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the petitioner filed an opposition, on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1954. On March 31, 1964,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed an&nbsp; urgent motion praying that respondent Chuidian's "Motion to Discharge Attachment" be&nbsp; denied or&nbsp; that it&nbsp; be granted after&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; a counter bond or that the hearing of said "Motion to Discharge Attachment" be held&nbsp; after respondent Chuidian shall have filed&nbsp; an answer to the complaint.&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; denied petitioner's&nbsp; urgent&nbsp; motion and&nbsp; set the&nbsp; hearing, of the "Motion to Discharge Attachment" on April 3, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such hearing was held on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 3 and&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; When the hearing in the afternoon of April 6 and was about to end, counsel&nbsp; for petitioner requested that&nbsp; the latter be given a chance to present an&nbsp; absent&nbsp; witness, which the&nbsp; court denied on ¦tjhe&nbsp; ground that it&nbsp; had previously warned the parties that all&nbsp; witnesses should be presented on said date. On&nbsp; April 23,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the respondent Judge&nbsp; issued&nbsp; an order granting respondent Chuidian's "Motion to Discharge Attachment" under section IS of Kule 59 of the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration&nbsp; having Been denied, the petitioner filed the present petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>with preliminary injunction.&nbsp; On May 4, 1984, this Court issued the preliminary injunction prayed&nbsp; for,&nbsp; restraining the respondent Judge and the sheriff of the City of Manila from enforcing the order of April 22, 1945,&nbsp; discharging the writ of attachment. <br><br>The grounds advanced by the petitioner for the issuance of the writ of attachment were (<i>a</i>) that respondent Chuidian converted to his own use the land which he bought in a&nbsp; fiduciary capacity for Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc.; (<i>b</i>) that respondent Chuidian is guilty of fraud in contracting his indebtedness and incurring the obligations&nbsp; upon which the action is&nbsp; brought; and (c) that respondent Chuidian has removed or disposed of his property or is&nbsp; about to do so with intent&nbsp; to&nbsp; defraud his creditor.&nbsp; The petitioner also points out&nbsp; that in addition to the grounds set forth in the&nbsp; motion for the issuance of an <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte </span>writ of preliminary attachment,&nbsp; other&nbsp; grounds contained in. the allegations&nbsp; of the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; were made&nbsp; a part of said <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte </span>motion by reference.&nbsp; Attached to the "Motion to Discharge Attachment" filed by respondent Chuidian, was an affidavit contradicting&nbsp; the grounds alleged by the petitioner.&nbsp; Respondent&nbsp; Chuidian herein&nbsp; stresses the fact that while the writ of attachment was obtained by petitioner ex parte, its discharge was&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; by the respondent Judge after extended hearings and&nbsp; the submission of memoranda.<br><br>Stripped&nbsp; of non-essentials,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner argues that respondent&nbsp; Chuidian converted to his own&nbsp; use the. land which he bought in a fiduciary capacity&nbsp; for&nbsp; Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc., or at least is guilty of fraud in contracting his indebtedness and incurring the obligations upon which the action in Civil Case No. 22138 is brought, reliance being placed on the&nbsp; "Agreement to Sell" executed by respondent Chuidian on June 18, 1948,. and the letter&nbsp; written by him to&nbsp; Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc., on June 19, 1948, herein above already referred to. Respondent Chuidian in his testimony&nbsp; during the&nbsp; hearing of his&nbsp; "Motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; Discharge Attachment"&nbsp; alleged that said "Agreement to Sell" did not express the true intentions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties;&nbsp; that all&nbsp; the papers relied upon by the petitioner were mere formalities to&nbsp; avoid criticisms of the minority stockholders of Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc., conceived by Allison Gibbs; that the&nbsp; real and. true&nbsp; intention of-the parties was&nbsp; that the money would be advanced by Allison; Gibbs to respondent Chuidian&nbsp; and&nbsp; the former would pay the Juan Luna Subdivision, Inc.<br><br>Petitioner also alleges&nbsp; that if it had been&nbsp; allowed to present its&nbsp; absent witness,&nbsp; Efrenita&nbsp; Hernandez,&nbsp; the&nbsp; following facts would have been proven:&nbsp; (1) that Chuidian's wife's indebtedness to Elenita Hernandez&nbsp; was contracted before the "Agreement to Sell"; (2) that such indebtedness has&nbsp; been&nbsp; outstanding for some time before such&nbsp; date (June&nbsp; 18, 1948);&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) that the "Agreement&nbsp; to Sell" dated June&nbsp; 18, 1948 and letter on June 19, 1948, were executed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the preconceived intention of not complying with them.&nbsp; It is therefore obvious that, in order to determine&nbsp; whether or&nbsp; not respondent Chuidian&nbsp; converted to his&nbsp; own&nbsp; use&nbsp; the&nbsp; land which he bought&nbsp; in a&nbsp; fiduciary capacity&nbsp; for the&nbsp; Juan Luna Subdivision,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; or&nbsp; was guilty of fraud in contracting his debt and incurring the obligations upon which the action is&nbsp; brought, considering that respondent Chuidian&nbsp; has alleged&nbsp; that the "Agreement to Sell"&nbsp; executed' t&gt;y him and other&nbsp; papers relied upon by the petitioner,&nbsp; did not express&nbsp; the real&nbsp; intentions of the parties; and considering&nbsp; that the grounds invoked by the petitioner&nbsp; for&nbsp; the issuance of the writ of attachment form&nbsp; the very basis of its&nbsp; complaint in Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 22138, a&nbsp; trial&nbsp; on the merits,&nbsp; after answer shall have been filed by respondent Chuidian, was necessary.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; case the hearings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the "Motion to Discharge"&nbsp; were&nbsp; held before the issues have&nbsp; been&nbsp; joined (respondent&nbsp; Chuidian not having as&nbsp; yet&nbsp; filed&nbsp; his answer, to the&nbsp; complaint),&nbsp; and the order of the respondent Judge discharging the attachment would have&nbsp; the effect of deciding or prejudging the main action.&nbsp; "The merits of the&nbsp; main&nbsp; action are&nbsp; not triable in a motion to discharge&nbsp; an&nbsp; attachment otherwise an applicant for the dissolution could force a trial of the merits of the case&nbsp; on his motion."&nbsp; (4&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Jur.,&nbsp; Sec. 635, 984.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner's case is rather strengthened by the fact that it was not&nbsp; given an opportunity to present an&nbsp; absent&nbsp; material witness,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; person&nbsp; of&nbsp; Elenita Hernandez. <br><br>In holding that&nbsp; there was no fraud on&nbsp; the part of respondent Chuidian, the respondent Judge&nbsp; held&nbsp; as follows: "It must be borne in mind that-defendant did not pocket the money—no money passed hands&nbsp; with&nbsp; that&nbsp; conveyance " to Elenita Hernandez.&nbsp; The conveyance was in the form of a 'dacion en page'&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant was practically driven to the wall, the family name must be preserved.&nbsp; If defendant received actually that sum of P25.000 consideration for the conveyance, perhaps there may yet be reason for branding defendant as a fraud.&nbsp; But such was not the case."&nbsp; It ia evident, however, that the&nbsp; fact that respondent Chuidian . did not pocket the money paid for the conveyance by Blenita Hernandez, is immaterial,&nbsp; inasmuch as the petitioner was deprived of the same amount of P25,000, assuming that under&nbsp; its complaint&nbsp; respondent Chuidian was in&nbsp; fact indebted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; in&nbsp; the manner stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; said complaint. <br><br>We are, therefore, of the opinion&nbsp; that, from what has been said, and in view of the return of the sheriff showing financial&nbsp; instability on the part&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Chuidian, the most&nbsp; that the respondent Judge could have done in his favor—to&nbsp; which the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; has&nbsp; expressed its&nbsp; agreement—was to&nbsp; discharge the attachment in question upon the filing by respondent Chuidian of&nbsp; a counter bond in the sum of P57.000, under section 12 of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 59 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; This would have accomplished respondent Chuidian's purpose of preserving his property and family name, at the same time giving the petitioner&nbsp; security for any judgment that it may obtain against him.&nbsp; We are constrained to hold that the respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge dated April&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; is hereby set aside, and the writ of preliminary attachment issued&nbsp; on March 4,&nbsp; 1954 maintained.<br><br>So&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; T. Chuidian.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Jugo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J,&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L.,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
