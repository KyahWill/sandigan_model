Bienvenido Tan,  presiding,  finding  Ambrosio Lucero guilty of  illegal possession of firearm  and sentencing him accordingly.

So on April 28,  1953, an information for illegal possession of firearm was filed in the  Court of First Instance of Rizal against  him.  At  the trial of  the case  the defendant-appellant admitted having  been arrested  in  Navotas on February 7, 1953,  but through  counsel  explained the  possession  of the firearm in the following manner:<br><br>ATTY. FINEZA: <br><blockquote>Here are the facts the defense is willing to admit:  That on January  6, 1953 the accused was commissioned by Lt. Severino F. de Jesus, Assistant Intelligence  Officer of the  20th B.C.T. stationed at Camp Olivas, to effect the capture of Angel  Aviso <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Commander Mori; that in the performance of this mission the accused Ambrosio Lucero  was temporarily given  the use  of  revolver,  caliber .38, Serial No. 43831 in connection with the performance of the said  mission; that the said  authority to temporarily use the  said revolver  is evidenced by this authority  which we present as Exhibit 1 for the defense."  (pp.  1-2,  t.s.n.)</blockquote>On this  admission the  court found him guilty of illegal possession of firearm and sentenced him accordingly.  The court also declared the firearm  confiscated and  forfeited in favor of the government. <br><br>From the above  decision the defendant has appealed to this Court,  claiming  exemption from  criminal  liability because  of his appointment as civilian  confidential agent, entrusted with  "a  mission to make  surveillance and effect the killing or capture of  Angel  Aviso <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Comdr. Mori", a Huk commander; that  the firearm was given to  him for a lawful purpose  and within the  limits of  the  law  and the  use  thereof was not expressly  confined  to a limited area.  Answering the above contention,  the Solicitor  General argues  that the  defendant-appellant  was merely a "civilian confidential agent", and that the  lieutenant who issued the appointment is not authorized  under the  law to grant said defendant-appellant authority to possess the firearm,  this power being granted under the provisions of Section 887 and 888 of the  Revised Administrative Code to the President of the Philippines. <br><br>This Court  can take  judicial notice of the fact that the practice  of appointing civilians  as informers to help in the apprehension and arrest of  Huks has been  resorted to many times with success.   If a police officer  in  effecting arrest or  in  complying  with his official duties can enlist the aid  of civilians, so should officers of the  Army entrusted with the capture or apprehension of Huks.  The designation and appointment of  the defendant-appellant as informer by the battalion commander  was, therefore, within the latter's lawful authority.  It cannot be denied that the help  expected  from a  civilian  informer  would not be as effective  as when  he is provided with the necessary weapon to defend himself in ease of aggression or enforce capture of offenders or criminals as in the case of the defendant-appellant.   The  right of  the  military commander entrusted with the duty of effecting the arrest or capture of a Huk commander should necessarily include, besides the appointment of  the civilian  informer,  the power to provide the latter with such, weapons as are necessary to  protect the informer  and  help  him carry  out the  mission entrusted to him. Under  the circumstances of the case, therefore, we find that  the granting of  the temporary  use of  the  revolver   to  defendant-appellant, which was a  necessary means to carry out the lawful purpose of the commander, must be deemed incident  to or necessarily included in the duty and  power of the battalion  commander to  effect the capture of the Huk chief. If the government  has  entrusted  military officers  with the capture and apprehension of  offenders, we must presume that they have authority to employ such means as are necessary,  convenient and useful in the accomplishment of their  trust.  We,  therefore, find  that the  contention of the appellant is well-founded. <br><br>The  case cited by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>  of conviction of an employee of the Surplus Property Commission  for illegal possession of firearm, which possession was authorized by the Chairman  of the Commission, has not  been decided by this  Court.  The contention of the Solicitor General that the law which should apply  to  the  case  at bar are Sections 887 and 888  of the Revised  Administrative  Code is beside the point; said provisions refer to  possession of firearms by private persons for personal use,  and not to a license for the temporary use of a firearm for the purpose of effecting the capture and apprehension  of persons engaged in an uprising against the government, as are the Huks. <br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the judgment appealed from is hereby  reversed and the  defendant-appellant acquitted of  the offense charged.   With  costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de  oficio</span>. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor,  Bautista Angelo, Endencia</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, A., J., </span> concurs in the result. <br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</div><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES, J. B. L</span>., <span style="font-style: italic;">J</span>.<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><br><br>I can not assent to  the  majority ruling, for  the reason that a mission  entrusted  by a military  commander  to a civilian secret agent "to effect the killing" of "Angel Aviso, <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Comdr.  Mori" is in  my opinion  patently illegal, and can  not  constitute  valid  authority for  bearing firearms. While Commander Mori may be a rebel, no one may validly authorize another to procure his killing without due process.  It would  be authority to  commit murder. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J.: </span>concurs. <br><br><br><br></div>
