				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>In the general elections of November 11, 194-7, appellant Pacito Abrea and 
appellee Isabelo A. Lloren were the candidates for the office of municipal mayor 
of Inopacan, Leyte. In his certificate of candidacy appellee Isabelo Lloren 
stated that he was also known by the following names Isabelo A. Lloren, Isabelo 
Lloren Abrea, Beloy Abrea,. Beloy Lloren, I. Lloren, I. Abrea, Loy Lloren, and 
Loy Abrea.
<p>The municipal board of canvassers proclaimed Isabelo Lloren 
municipal-mayor-elect with 1,010 votes, which gave him a majority of 198 votes 
over Pacito Abrea, who obtained only 812 votes.</p>
<p>Pacito Abrea protested the election of his opponent on four grounds, only the 
first of which is relied upon by him in this appeal, to with "(a) That a total 
of 417 votes cast in all the precincts in said municipality in favor of one 
Beloy as clearly written in the ballots were credited and read in favor of the 
above respondent."</p>
<p>In the course of the trial the ballot boxes were opened, and it resulted that 
517 votes were cast for the office of municipal mayor in the name of Beloy, 77 
votes in the name of Biloy, and 8 votes in the name of Belog.</p>
<p>The trial court found—and its finding is not questioned in this appeal—that 
it had been clearly proved that the protestee Isabelo A. Lloren was popularly 
and . commonly known in the whole municipality of Inopacan by his nickname Beloy 
or Biloy; and that the protestant himself proved that before and on the day of 
the election the protestee distributed sample ballots on which was written the 
name Beloy on the line corresponding to the office of municipal mayor. The trial 
court also found that in the said elections in Inopacan there was no other 
candidate for mayor or any other office who was known by the name Beloy.</p>
<p>Declaring that the votes for municipal mayor in the names of Beloy, Biloy, 
and Belog had been correctly counted in favor of the protestee, the trial court 
confirmed the proclamation made by the municipal board of canvassers and 
declared the protestee municipal-mayor-elect of Inopacan, ordering the 
protestant to pay the costs. From that judgment the protestant has appealed to 
this court upon the questions of law which we shall now discuss.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Appellant's main contention is that the 602 ballots in -which only the 
nickname Beloy, Biloy, or Belog was voted for municipal mayor should have teen 
rejected, thereby adjudicating only 408 votes to the appellee against the 
appellant's 812 votes. In other words he contends that all ballots in which only 
the nickname of the appellee was written were invalid for said candidate. In 
support of his contention he cites paragraph 9 of section 149 of the Revised 
Election Code (Republic Act No. 180), approved June 21, 1947, which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"9. The use of nicknames and appellations of affection and friendship, if 
accompanied by the name or surname of the candidate, does not annul such vote, 
except when they were used as a means to identify their respective 
voters."</p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing Is one of twenty-three rules for the appreciation of ballots 
contained in section 149 of the Revised Election Code, the first two rules being 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Any ballot where only the Christian name of candidate or only his surname 
appears is valid for such candidate, if there is no other, candidate with the 
same name or surname for the same officej but when the word written in the 
ballot is at the same time the Christian name of a candidate and the surname of 
his opponent, the vote shall be counted in favor of the latter.</p>
<p>"2. A name or surname incorrectly written which, when read, has a sound equal 
or similar to the real name or surname of the candidate shall be counted in his 
favor."</p></blockquote>
<p>Rule No. 9, which is relied upon by appellant, provides only for the 
determination of whether a ballot or vote shall or shall not be annulled on the 
ground that it is marked by means of a nickname. It says that it shall not be 
annulled on that ground unless the nickname, accompanied by the name or surname 
of the candidate, was used as a means to identify the voter. It does not say 
that when a nickname alone is written to identify the candidate voted for the 
vote is invalid. If it had been the intention of the Congress to annul such vote 
it would have preserved in the Revised Election Code the provision of a previous 
election law (Act No. 4203, section 16), which said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Nor shall any vote be counted on which the candidate is designated by 
his nickname or alias, although mention thereof is made on his certificate of 
candidacy."</p></blockquote>
<p>The nonlncorporation of that provision or rule in the evised Election Code is 
indicative of the intention of the Congress to abandon it.</p>
<p>It is not contended by the appellant that the 602 votes fin question should 
be annulled as marked ballots. His contention is that they should not be counted 
in favor of the appellee because the latter was not sufficiently identified by 
his nickname Beloy, Biloy, or Belog.</p>
<p>We agree, however, with the trial court that the appellee was sufficiently 
identified by his nickname Beloy or Biloy, first, because such nickname is a 
derivative, or a contraction, of his Christian name Isabelo; second, because he 
was popularly and commonly known in the entire municipality of Inopacan by that 
nickname; and, third, because there was no other candidate for mayor with the 
same nickname. We do not deem it necessary to decide whether the eight votes for 
"Belog" are valid or not, because they are immaterial to the resuit.</p>
<p>Previous to the enactment in 1938 of the Election Code (Commonwealth Act No. 
357) the rules were: (1) that ballots bearing the Christian name only or the 
Christian name and the initial of the surname of one candidate should be 
rejected as insufficient to identify the person voted for (Cailles <em>vs.</em> 
Gomez and Barbaza [1921] 42 Phil. 496, 533); and (2) that, for the same reason, 
votes cast with only the nickname or the familiar name should not be counted in 
favor of any candidate (Cecillo <em>vs.</em> Tomacruz [1935], 62 Phil. 689). But 
such rules were changed or abandoned by the legislature when it enacted section 
144 of Commonwealth Act No. 357 and, subsequently, section 149 of Republic Act 
No. 180, which provided rules for the appreciation of ballots. Said section is a 
compilation in statutory form of most of the doctrines theretofore laid down by 
the Supreme Court regarding the appreciation of ballots. Rule No. 1 contained in 
section 149 reverses the doctrine or rule laid down by the Supreme Court 
regarding the use of the Christian name alone of a candidate by providing 
that—contrary to said doctrine —any ballot where only the Christian name of a 
candidate or only his surname appears is valid for such candidate if there is no 
other candidate with the same name or surname for the same office. The purpose 
of this new rule is to validate the vote provided the name written on the ballot 
identifies the candidate voted for beyond any question or possible confusion 
with any other candidate for the same office. Hence, conformably to such purpose 
we hold that when the nickname of a candidate is a derivative or contraction of 
his Christian name or of his surname, and if he is popularly and commonly known 
by that nickname, a ballot where only such nickname appears is valid for such 
candidate if there is no other candidate with the same nickname for the same 
office. This ruling is in consonance with the well- known principle of election 
law which this court reiterated in Mandac <em>vs.</em> Samonte, 49 Phil. 284, 
301-302, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A ballot is indicative of the will of the voter. It is not required that it 
should be nicely or accurately written, or that the name of the candidate voted 
for should be correctly spelled. It should be read in the light of all the 
circumstances surrounding the election and the voter, and the object should be 
to ascertain and carry into effect the intention of the voter, if it can be 
determined with reasonable certainty. The ballot should be liberally construed, 
and the intendments should be in favor of a reading and construction which will 
render the ballot effective, rather than in favor of a conclusion which will, on 
some technical grounds, render it ineffective. At the same time, it is not 
admissible to say that something was Intended which is contrary to what was 
done; and if the ballot is so defective as to fail to show any intention 
whatever, it must be disregarded."</p></blockquote>
</li><li>Appellant further contends that "the lower court erred in admitting evidence 
aliunde to determine the intention of the voter." Counsel in his brief does not 
specify what evidence he is referring to, nor does he show that it was admitted 
over his objection and exception. He merely says: "The fact that in its decision 
the lower court makes a conclusion that the protestee is popularly known In his 
place by the nicknames already mentioned, presupposes consideration of 
testimonial evidence to Influence Its mind in making said conclusion." He 
evidently refers to the roof upon which the trial court based its finding that 
the rotestee was popularly and commonly known in the whole municipality of 
Inopacan by the nickname Beloy or Biloy. We do not feel bound to consider the 
admissibility or inadmissibility of such proof in the absence of any showing 
that the adverse party duly interposed an objection to its admission. But we 
think the protestee had the right to prove that he was popularly and commonly 
known by his nickname to overcome the contention of the protestant that the use 
of such nickname on the ballots in question did not sufficiently identify the 
protestee as the candidate voted for.<br>
</li><li>Lastly, appellant contends that the lower court erred in not ordering the 
recounting of all the votes of the contending candidates. </li></ol>
<p>We think the trial court acted properly in limiting the inquiry to the number 
of votes cast for the protestee with only his nickname written on the ballots, 
because the basis of the protest was not that the election inspectors had erred 
in counting all the votes cast for each of the ,two candidates but that they 
erred in counting in favor of the protestee 417 votes in which only his nickname 
was used. No fraud, mistake, or misreading of the ballots was alleged in the 
protest. The issue presented to the court was confined to whether there were 
really 417 votes for the protestee in which the nickname Beloy alone was written 
and whether1 those votes were valid or not. If there were at least 417 of such 
votes and if they were not valid, the protestant should win because the 
protestee's majority was only 198 votes. The inquiry brought out the fact that 
there were more than 417 of such votes; but as a matter of law the court found 
that they were valid. We confirm that finding.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Moran,

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Two candidates ran for mayor of Inopacan, Leyte, in the elections of November 
11, 1947 Isabelo A. Lloren, Liberal, and Pacito Abrea, Nationalista. The Liberal 
candidate was proclaimed elected with 1,010 votes, with majority of 198 against 
the Nationalista who was credited with 812 votes.</p>
<p>The Nationalista protested, seeking the annulment of 417 ballots in which 
Beloy was voted for mayor and were credited as votes for the Liberal 
candidate.</p>
<p>When the ballot boxes were opened, it was found that the names of Beloy, 
Biloy and Belog appeared written in the following numbers of ballots: Beloy 517, 
Biloy 77 and Belog 8. All these 602 ballots were counted among the 1,010 votes 
credited to the Liberal candidate.</p>
<p>The Nationalista candidate contended in the lower court and in this appeal 
that the 602 ballots with the three nicknames should not be counted as votes for 
the Liberal candidate, invoking the numerous decisions of the Supreme Court 
holding that nicknames alone are not sufficient identification of a candidate. 
"(Molina <em>vs.</em> Nuesa, G. R. No. 3058, June 5, 1929, not reported; Alegre 
<em>vs.</em> Perey, G. R. l,o. 3107, March. 26, 1929, not reported; Valenzuela 
<em>vs.</em> Carlos, etc., 42 Phil., 428; Bayona <em>vs.</em> Siatong, 56 Phil., 
831; Marquez <em>vs.</em> Santiago, 57 Phil., 969; Fausto <em>vs.</em> Ramos,.61 
Phil., 1035; Sarenas <em>vs.</em> Generoso, 61 Phil., 459; Cecilio <em>vs.</em> 
Tomacruz, 62 Phil., 693; Coscolluela <em>vs.</em> Gaston, 63 Phil., 41; 
etc.)</p>
<p>Paragraph 9, sec. 149, of the Election Code, taken jointly with the provision 
of section 34 thereof, that provides that "certificates of candidacy shall not 
contain nicknames of the candidates" and the fact that the nicknames alone in 
question are not mentioned by the Liberal candidate among the many names he has 
mentioned in his certificate of candidacy with which he alleged he is known, 
aside from the long line of decisions of the Supreme Court, appear to support 
the contention of the Nationalista candidate. We are of opinion, however, that 
all these legal reasons must give way to the unmistakable expression of the 
popular will.</p>
<p>The record of the case offers conclusive evidence that those voters who cast 
their ballots for the three nicknames in question intended in fact to vote for 
the Liberal candidate who is known by the electorate, friends and opponents, by 
the nicknames in question, derivatives of his Christian name and are among the 
nicknames with which the people call for short those who carry the same 
Christian name.</p>
<p>It is inconceivable to nullify the votes of so many voters, more than 
one-half of those who voted for the Liberal candidate, when there is no possible 
mistake that they have voted for said candidate. While we would not give effect 
to isolated ballots simply in nicknames, that may refer to persons other than a 
candidate, in abidance with the legal authorities above mentioned, in this 
specific case we feel no hesitancy in brushing them aside as ineffective legal 
technicalities for the sake of the fundamental purpose of popular suffrage: that 
of giving effect to the will of the people as freely and clearly expressed in 
the ballots.</p>
<p>Election statutory provisions and judicial doctrines are enacted and laid 
down to insure the determination of the true will of the people and to give it 
full effect, in consonance with the basic principle of the Constitution that 
"sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from 
them". (Section 1, Art. II.) All provisions of law and legal doctrines should be 
interpreted, applied and enforced not to defeat that basic principle but to give 
it full effect. The Constitution is the supreme law and all legal provisions are 
and should give way to its paramount authority.</p>
<p>We concur in the affirmance of the appealed decision.</p>
