				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This&nbsp; is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission ordering the petitioner, Martha Lumber Mill, Inc., to&nbsp; pay to the respondents Romana V. Lagradante and her minor children Pedro,&nbsp; Jr., Palencia and Erlinda Lagradante, as compensation for the death&nbsp; of Felicito Lagradante, the sum of P2,535.52, plus burial expenses&nbsp; amounting to not more than&nbsp; P100,&nbsp; and to the Commission the sum of P26.</p><p>Felicito Lagradante was murdered on the night of March 7, 1951.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioner contends that the deceased was an employee of the Bureau of Forestry, duly appointed by the Department&nbsp; of Agriculture and Natural&nbsp; Resources. It appears, however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment was in virtue of Forestry Administrative Order No. 11 dated September 11, 1934, which provides as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"34 (s) Within thirty&nbsp; (30)&nbsp; days&nbsp; from the date of the&nbsp; issuance of a license, and after the terms and conditions of said license had been&nbsp; duly accepted in their&nbsp; entirety&nbsp; by the licensee concerned, at least one&nbsp; concession guard, if so required in&nbsp; the&nbsp; license, shall be employed&nbsp; by said licensee.&nbsp; The name and address of&nbsp; the concession&nbsp; guard so employed shall be reported&nbsp; to the&nbsp; local forest office&nbsp; under&nbsp; whose&nbsp; jurisdiction the license&nbsp; area falls. The&nbsp; concession guard, whose salary will be paid him direct by the licensee, shall&nbsp; from time&nbsp; to time, report to the herein&nbsp; mentioned forest officer for instruction&nbsp; regarding his duties&nbsp; and obligations to patrol and cooperate with the government in the protection of the area of&nbsp; the licensee employing him.&nbsp; (New&nbsp; subsection added as per section 19, Administrative&nbsp; Order No. 11-7.)"</p></blockquote><p>The petitioner was accordingly&nbsp; required to employ at least one concession guard, whose salary was payable by it;&nbsp; and there is here no pretense that the latter had any such guard other than the deceased Felicito Lagradante. Indeed, in&nbsp; its letter addressed to the Secretary of Labor, dated February 19, 1952, it admitted that the deceased was employed as its concession guard.&nbsp; That the appointment was actually made by the&nbsp; Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources did not affect the status&nbsp; of the deceased as an&nbsp; employee of the petitioner, as&nbsp; the intervention of the Government was a&nbsp; formality undoubtedly designed to insure faithful performance&nbsp; of his&nbsp; duties "to patrol and cooperate with the Government in the protection of the area of the licensee employing him."</p><p>We cannot accept petitioner's argument that the death of&nbsp; Felicito Lagradante&nbsp; did&nbsp; not arise out of and&nbsp; in the course of his&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; having been murdered outside of office hours.&nbsp; It appears that the deceased was required to live and sleep in the quarters provided by the petitioner, and obviously by reason of the nature of his duties&nbsp; as a concession&nbsp; guard, with&nbsp; the result that,&nbsp; although he had to&nbsp; observe&nbsp; certain working&nbsp; hours,&nbsp; he&nbsp; nevertheless&nbsp; was compelled to stay in his quarters, thereby in effect making himself available, regardless of time, for&nbsp; the&nbsp; protection of the rights and interest of the petitioner in its concession.</p><p>The petitioner observes that Felicito Lagradante's killers were finally convicted in G. R. No. L-5512 of this Court and his heirs were awarded&nbsp; indemnity,,&nbsp; and cites&nbsp; the decision in Pascasio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Guido, 38 Off. Gaz., 3156, to the effect that the heirs of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased hacienda, manager, murdered by his predecessor who had been dismissed, were not entitled to the benefit of the Workmen's Compensation Act.&nbsp; In the case cited, however, it was held that the deceased manager was not an industrial employee in the sense contemplated by the law, and therefore it is not controlling. Upon the other hand, in Nava <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Ynchausti Steamship Co., 57 Phil., 751, it was ruled that, although the death of the employee therein involved resulted from a deliberate act of the killer and the latter was convicted of homicide,&nbsp; the said employee died from an accident, and the obligation of the employer to compensate was unaffected by the liability of the killer to indemnify the heirs of the&nbsp; deceased which "is wholly distinct from the&nbsp; obligation imposed by&nbsp; the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Act and the latter, is in&nbsp; no sense subsidiary&nbsp; to the former."&nbsp; While&nbsp; in G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-5512&nbsp; it was found that the motive&nbsp; for the&nbsp; killing&nbsp; of Felicito Lagradante was robbery, we cannot overlook&nbsp; the admission of the petitioner, contained in its&nbsp; letter dated March 24, 1951, and addressed to&nbsp; Ramon&nbsp; Lagradante, father of the&nbsp; deceased Felicito Lagradante,&nbsp; that the mastermind stated in his confession that he bore a grudge against Felicito in view of Felicito's having replaced him in his former job,&nbsp; adding that it was Felicito who&nbsp; was responsible for his ousting."&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p><p>The petitioner also intimates that the respondents who have been awarded&nbsp; compensation by the Workman's Compensation Commission did not file their&nbsp; claim within three months after the death of Felicito Lagradante, in violation of section 24 of Act No. 8428.&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer,&nbsp; it is sufficient&nbsp; to point out, as the Commission&nbsp; did, that after the receipt&nbsp; of the petitioner's&nbsp; letter of March 24, 1951, respondent&nbsp; Romana&nbsp; Lagradante, as early as&nbsp; April&nbsp; 11, 1951, wrote to the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of Labor appealing&nbsp; for help in&nbsp; securing any&nbsp; gratuity or benefit for the death of her husband; and said respondent was prompted to do so, apparently misled by petitioner's letter stating that&nbsp; the deceased assumed the duties of a concession guard duly appointed by the&nbsp; Director of the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Forestry thereby&nbsp; being&nbsp; caused to believe that&nbsp; her husband&nbsp; was an employee of the Bureau of&nbsp; Forestry and not by&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; Such request for help from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of Labor on April 11, 1951, may fairly be held as a substantial compliance with the law or an excuse for the delay in the filing of the formal claim for compensation.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that the petitioner did not submit the required employer's report of accident or sickness, which would have served as petitioner's answer in the compensation proceedings; and such&nbsp; failure may be deemed&nbsp; as a waiver of the defense that the claim for compensation was not filed within the statutory period.</p><p>Apart from what has been said, petitioner's&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to file with&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission any notice of appeal as required by section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of Rule 44 of the Rules of Court which also governs appeals from decisions of the Workmen's Compensation Commission, is necessarily fatal.&nbsp; (Resolution of February 22,1954,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-7355, Manila&nbsp; Electric Company vs.&nbsp; Maximo Cruz.)</p><p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is&nbsp; affirmed with costs against the&nbsp; petitioner.</p><p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
