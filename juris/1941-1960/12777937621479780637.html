				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The present case is pending before this court on appeal by both plaintiff and 
defendant from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu.</p>
<p>Defendant-appellant filed with this court a motion to dismiss the appeal of 
the plaintiff-appellant on the ground that said appeal was not perfected on 
time, because the plaintiff failed to file his notice of appeal and appeal bond 
within the period of thirty days from notice of the judgment.</p>
<p>Counsel for the plaintiff, in his reply to the motion for dismissal of the 
plaintiff's appeal, contends that the filing of the record on appeal within the 
period fixed by the Rules cures the lack of notice of appeal, and that, as the 
plaintiff had filed a motion for reconsideration or new trial as to the second 
cause of action, the running of the period of thirty days as to the whole case 
was suspended by the filling of said motion.</p>
<p>As to failure to file notice of appeal in this case, we have already decided 
that the plaintiff is correct in his contention, and therefore his appeal can 
not be dismissed on that ground. In the case of Lopez <em>vs.</em> Lopez, (p. 
133, ante), this court held that the filling of the record on appeal under the 
Rules of Court (as the presentation of a bill of exceptions under the old Code 
of Civil Procedure) implies necessarily the filling of a notice of appeal, 
because the act of taking or perfecting an appeal is more expressive of the 
intention to appeal than the filing of notice to do so.</p>
<p>But the ground for dismissal on which the defendant relies with insistence in 
his motion for reconsideration is that the appeal bond was filed by the 
plaintiff ten days after the expiration of thirty days from the date the 
plaintiff was notified of the judgment, without counting the period from the 
filing of the motion for new trial to the notice to plaintiff of the order 
denying said motion. According to the certificate issued by the Acting Clerk of 
Court plaintiff received notice of the decision on April 4, 1946; filed a motion 
for new trial on April 29; received copy of order denying said motion on May 7, 
and executed and ratified the appeal bond on May 22, 1946.</p>
<p>Section 13 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court provides that "where the notice 
of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal is filed but not within the period 
of time herein provided, the appeal shall be dismissed." And although, according 
to section 1, Rule 52 of the same Rule, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme 
Court (section 1, Rule 52) <em>may</em>, dismiss an appeal on its own motion or 
that of the appellee, for failure on the part of the appellant to file, within 
the period prescribed by tite Rules of Court, the notice of appeal, appeal bond, 
or record on appeal, as there is nothing in the record to justify the failure to 
file the appeal bond on time in the present case, we have to dismiss the 
plaintiff's appeal.</p>
<p>The filing of an appeal bond is as necessary as the filing of notice of 
appeal and record on appeal for perfecting an appeal and conferring appellate 
jurisdiction upon the appellate court. If we may consider an appeal as perfected 
on time, although the appeal bond has been filed, without justifiable reason, 
ten (10) days after the expiration of the period fixed by law, there would be no 
reason why we should not admit an appeal perfected at any time afterwards, that 
is, one month, three months, etc, after the expiration of the period fixed for 
perfecting the appeal. And to allow the parties to perfect an appeal at any time 
after the rendition of the judgment, would be to put no limit to the courts' 
proceedings,and leave the parties at a loss when they may rest assured of the 
qulfct enjoyment of their property or right after the rendition of judgment in 
their favor.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the appeal of the plaintiff-appellant is dismissed. 
So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</em>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>On September 10, 1946, this court denied the motion of defendant dated August 
6, 1946, for dismissal of plaintiff's appeal. The motion alleged two grounds: 
(1) that plaintiff-appellant did not file any notice of appeal, and (2) that the 
appeal bond, executed and acknowledged by plaintiff-appellant on May 22, 1946, 
was not filed within the 30-day reglementary period which expired on May 12, 
1946.</p>
<p>We concurred in the resolution of denial because the filing of the record on 
appeal, made before the expiration of the 30-day reglementary period, served 
also the purposes of a notice of appeal, and because the requirement to file an 
appeal bond was substantially complied with by plaintiff-appellant with the 
execution of one on May 22, 1946, before the clerk of the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
<p>On a motion dated September 25, 1946, the appellant prayed for the 
reconsideration of the resolution dated September 10, and this time the majority 
voted to grant the motion and to dismiss plaintiff's appeal, because his appeal 
bond was filed 10 days after the expiration of the 30-day reglementary 
period.</p>
<p>We disagree upon two grounds: (1) because plaintiff-appellant was denied the 
right to be heard as provided in section 2 of Rule 54, when a motion for 
reconsideration is granted, and (2) because the fact that the appeal bond had 
been filed 10 days after the 30-day reglementary period is a procedural 
technicality which should not be considered as a sufficient ground for 
dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p>According to section 1 of Rule 54, a motion for reconsideration shall be made 
<em>ex parte</em> and filed within 15 days after promulgation of a final order 
and, according to section 2 of the same Rule, if the motion is granted, as 
happens in the present case, "the adverse party shall be given time to answer, 
after which the court, in its discretion, may set the case for oral reargument." 
This has not been done in this case. Without giving plaintiff-appellant any time 
to answer the motion for reconsideration, the majority granted the motion and, 
by the resolution we are objecting to, ordered the outright dismissal of 
plaintiff's appeal. Evidently, the violation of the rule has affected a 
substantial right of plaintiff-appellant, and we refuse to lend our consent to 
such an unjust action.</p>
<p>The dismissal of plaintiff's appeal is premised on the fact that the appeal 
bond was filed 10 days after the 30-day reglementary period, as provided in 
section 3 of Rule 41. But it appears, upon the records of this case, that the 
violation is a technical one and does not impair or endanger the substantial 
right of any party.</p>
<p>According to section 5 of Rule 41, the appeal bond shall be in the amotmt of 
P60 unless the court shall fix a different amount, which has not been done in 
this case. It shall only answer "for the payment of costs which the appellate 
court may award against the appellant." The appeal bond filed by 
plaintiff-appellant, notwithstanding a 10-day delay, had effectively guaranteed, 
and is guaranteeing, the payment of costs which may be awarded against 
plaintiff-appellant.</p>
<p>And even if no such appeal bond should have been filed, the payment of said 
costs is assured by the fact that there is on deposit with the clerk of the 
Court of First Instance the amount of P240 belonging to plaintiff-appellant, the 
deposit having been made since the complaint was filed on September 8, 1945.</p>
<p>Lastly, it appears that no costs at all are awarded against 
plaintiff-appellant, not even in the majority resolution dismissing his appeal, 
which conclusively shows that in the present case the appeal bond in question 
had no practical pxirpose.</p>
<p>Only on October 25, 1946, in dismissing the petition in Manapat <em>vs.</em> 
De la Rosa, et al., No. L-1075, by unanimous vote of all justices taking part, 
it has been declared that it was "the policy of this court in adopting the Rules 
that cases must not be decided on mere technicalities of procedure but on their 
merits." (<em>See also</em> our decision in Mitschiener <em>vs.</em> Barrios, 
(76 Phil., 55).</p>
<p>In the present case, plaintiff's appeal is based on a mere technicality of 
procedure, empty for all practical purposes of any substantial meaning; while, 
as we have already shown, the procedure adopted in the dismissal was in open 
violation of Rule 54 a violation which impairs a substantial right of 
plaintiff-appellant.</p>
<p>Such is the irony of his fate that, because of an insubstantial technical 
violation of the rules, he is deprived of his right of appeal, and the 
deprivation is effected through a flagrant violation of the same rules. A 
judicial action justifying such an absurd legal situation unfailingly invites 
evisceration with disastrous results to public faith in the efficacy of legal 
procedures.</p>
