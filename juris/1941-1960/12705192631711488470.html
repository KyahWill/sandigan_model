				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1572, November 21, 1947</h4>
				<H3>HANS GALEWSKY AND FRED REDFERN, PETITIONERS, VS. RAMON DE LA RAMA AND EULALIO GARCIA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, PASAY BRANCH, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner against the 
respondents on the ground that the respondent Judge Eulalio Garcia has acted 
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in 
ordering, upon motion of the other respondent, to deposit the monthly rents of 
P450 found to be due from the petitioner to said respondent, during the pendency 
of the appeal taken by the petitioners from the judgment of the justice of the 
peace of Pasay (Rizal City) to the Court of First Instance of Rizal.
<p>The order of the respondent judge which, according to the petitioners, was 
entered by the court without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of 
discretion, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acting upon the motion for immediate execution, dated July 15, 1947, filed 
by counsel for the plaintiff; upon the motion ex-parte for preliminary 
attachment, dated July 16, 1947, filed by counsel for the plaintiff and upon the 
motion for extension of time to deposit the rents due, dated July 15, 1947, 
filed by counsel for the defendants;</p>
<p>"The Court, in the interests of justice and equity, hereby grants the 
defendants, a non-extendible period of five (5) days, counted from tomorrow, 
July 22, 1947, within which to deposit with the Clerk of Court of Rizal, all of 
the rents due in this case.</p>
<p>"The motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment in this case 
is hereby denied. <br></p><p>'It is so ordered.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioners now contend that the requirement that the monthly rental of 
P450 found by the justice of the peace of Pasay (now Rizal City) to be due from 
the petitioners-defendants to the respondent-plaintiff, and which the respondent 
judge ordered the petitioners to deposit during the pendency of the appeal, is 
erroneous or contrary to the provision of section 2 of Act No. 689, as amended 
by Republic Act No. 66, and therefore the respondent judge acted without or in 
excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in ordering the monthly 
deposit of said amount.</p>
<p>There is no question that the justice of the peace of Pasay (Rizal City) had 
jurisdiction to try and decide the action of illegal detainer filed by the 
respondent Ramon de la Rama against the petitioners, and did not act in excess 
thereof or with grave abuse of discretion in rendering judgment in the case. The 
question whether or not the judgment of the said justice of the peace which 
sentenced die petitioners to pay the said amount of monthly rent to the said 
respondent is in accordance with the law of the case, does not involve question 
of jurisdiction or discretion of said justice of the peace.</p>
<p>Appellate court of first instance has the ministerial duty to order the 
execution of the judgment of the inferior court which has jurisdiction to render 
it notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal, should defendant fail to pay 
plaintiff or the court the amount of monthly rent found to be due by the court 
<i>a quo</i> to appellee from appellant under said section 8, Rule 72. The Court 
of First Instance of Rizai presided over by the respondent judge had no power to 
inquire into the merit of the judgment of the inferior court which adjudicated 
the amount of monthly rental due from defendants to plaintiff, before ordering 
the execution of said judgment upon the appellants' failure to make the payment 
or deposit required by law. Only upon deciding the appealed case on the merits 
may the appellate court pass upon whether or not the inferior court erred in not 
applying the provision of section 2, Act No. 689, as amended by Republic Act No. 
66.</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, it is evident that the respondent judge did not 
act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in 
rendering the order quoted above, of which the petitioners complain; the 
respondent judge did not do but comply with the ministerial duty of the court to 
order the execution of the inferior court's judgment upon failure of the 
defendants-appellants to make said deposit.</p>
<p>Therefore the petition is denied with costs against the 
petitioners.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo,</i> and <i>Bengzon, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
