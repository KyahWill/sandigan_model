				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking&nbsp; the annulment of an order of respondent&nbsp; judge dated July 10,&nbsp; 1957 directing petitioners to surrender to the Register of Deeds of Rizal their owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 51585 in order that the&nbsp; attorney's lien of their former counsel Flaviano T. Dalisay, Jr. may be annotated on the back&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>Petitioners are the&nbsp; widow&nbsp; and children of the late Valeriano Caina who was the owner of a parcel of land covered&nbsp; by Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Title No.&nbsp; 21702. A portion of this property was transferred to one&nbsp; Gavina Cierte de Andal and as a result said title&nbsp; was cancelled and&nbsp; a new one issued in their names bearing&nbsp; No. 51585. Respondent Flaviano&nbsp; T. Dalisay, Jr. was the attorney of one of petitioners, Elena&nbsp; Peralta Vda. de Caina,&nbsp; in an action for ejectment filed before the Justice of the Peace of Caloocan, Rizal, against&nbsp; one Ricardo Nabong,&nbsp; which was&nbsp; dismissed and appealed to the Court of First Instance of Rizal.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter court, the&nbsp; case was docketed as Civil Case No. 3875, and&nbsp; because&nbsp; of the non-appearance of defendant, the latter was&nbsp; declared in default and&nbsp; judgment was rendered in favor&nbsp; of plaintiff.&nbsp; This judgment became final and executory for lack of&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>On June 26,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; respondent Dalisay filed a&nbsp; motion in the same ejectment case for annotation of his attorney's lien&nbsp; on the back of Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 51585 claiming&nbsp; that,&nbsp; notwithstanding the services he had rendered to the widow and her children who were represented by him&nbsp; in said&nbsp; case, they&nbsp; have failed to&nbsp; pay him&nbsp; his attorney's fees which he&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; at&nbsp; P2,020.&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion was&nbsp; set for hearing and thereafter the same was granted in an order&nbsp; entered on&nbsp; July 10, 1957 wherein the&nbsp; court ordered petitioners to surrender their duplicate copy of said&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; in order that the&nbsp; annotation requested may be&nbsp; made.&nbsp; Upon receipt of a&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; this order, petitioners filed a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration alleging that they were never furnished with a copy of respondent's motion, nor notified of the date of its hearing, for which reason they were not able to appear to contest the same.<br><br>This&nbsp; motion was opposed by respondent&nbsp; Dalisay who averred that petitioners were&nbsp; furnished with a copy of his motion by registered mail three days before the hearing as shown by the return card attached to&nbsp; his written opposition.&nbsp; And&nbsp; on August 27,&nbsp; 1957, the court denied the motion.&nbsp; Hence the present petition for certiorari.<br><br>This&nbsp; issue, to be determined is whether the attorney's lien of respondent Dalisay for services he had rendered in the ejectment case can&nbsp; be ordered&nbsp; annotated on&nbsp; the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 51585. An attorney's lien is of two&nbsp; kinds: one is called&nbsp; retaining alien and the other charging lien.&nbsp; The retaining lien is the right&nbsp; of the attorney to retain the funds, documents, and papers&nbsp; of&nbsp; his client which have lawfully come into his possession&nbsp; until his&nbsp; lawful&nbsp; fees and&nbsp; disbursements have been paid and to&nbsp; apply such funds to the satisfaction thereof.&nbsp; The charging lien is&nbsp; the right which the attorney has upon all judgments for the payment of&nbsp; money, and executions issued in&nbsp; pursuance of said judgments, which he has secured in a litigation of his client (Section 33, Rule 127;&nbsp; Rustia&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Abeto,&nbsp; 72 Phil., 133).&nbsp; Under this rule,&nbsp; this&nbsp; lien, whether retaining or charging, takes legal&nbsp; effect&nbsp; only from&nbsp; and after, but&nbsp; not before, notice of said lien has been entered in the record and&nbsp; served on&nbsp; the&nbsp; adverse party (Macondray &amp; Company, Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jose,&nbsp; 66 Phil.,&nbsp; 590;&nbsp; Menzi&nbsp; and Company&nbsp; vs. Bastida, 63 Phil., 16).<br><br>It may therefore&nbsp; be seen that the right of a&nbsp; lawyer to insure the payment of his professional fee is&nbsp; either to retain the&nbsp; funds, documents,&nbsp; and&nbsp; papers of his client which may&nbsp; have lawfully come into&nbsp; his possession, or to enforce it upon any judgment&nbsp; for the payment of money he may secure in favor of his client.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; it has&nbsp; been held that the retaining lien is&nbsp; dependent upon possession and does not attach to&nbsp; anything not in attorney's hand3. The lien exists only so long as the attorney&nbsp; retains possession ends (Rustia vs.&nbsp; Abeto, supra).<br><br>In the instant case, the lien which respondent attorney tried to&nbsp; enforce&nbsp; for the satisfaction of his professional fee&nbsp; is charging in the sense that his purpose is to make of record his claim in order that it may be considered in the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment that may be rendered in the&nbsp; case, and this he has already done.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; he had already&nbsp; caused a&nbsp; statement of his claim to&nbsp; be entered in the&nbsp; record of the ejectment case and that is all what the rule requires of him to do.&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp; he cannot go any further, such as&nbsp; what he led&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court to do, that is, to have his lien annotated on the back of the title of petitioners&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; beyond the province of&nbsp; the court. The lien of respondent is not of a nature which attaches to the&nbsp; property in&nbsp; litigation but is at most a personal claim enforceable by a writ of&nbsp; execution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent&nbsp; judge has&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; exceeded his authority in issuing the order subject&nbsp; of the present petition for certiorari.<br><br>Petition is granted.&nbsp; The order of&nbsp; respondent judge dated July&nbsp; 10, 1957&nbsp; is hereby set aside.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against respondent Flaviano T. Dalisay, Jr.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
