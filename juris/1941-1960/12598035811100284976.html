				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition for certiorari to review the decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, modifying&nbsp; the judgment of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Cebu in Civil Case&nbsp; No. R-362, by excluding from the said decision the award of damages in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioners.<br><br>The&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and the facts involved,&nbsp; as well as the&nbsp; different&nbsp; issues raised therein&nbsp; are adequately and&nbsp; correctly narrated in the well-prepared appealed decision, penned by Justice&nbsp; Dionisio&nbsp; de Leon,&nbsp; and we&nbsp; are quoting with favor the pertinent portions thereof:<br><blockquote>"This&nbsp; ejectment case&nbsp; started&nbsp; in the Municipal Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu City&nbsp; on February 28, 1947.&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs are&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of a lot situated at&nbsp; the&nbsp; corner of&nbsp; P.&nbsp; del&nbsp; Rosario and&nbsp; D. Jakosalem Streets Cebu City, and the defendants are&nbsp; the owners of the house built&nbsp; upon an&nbsp; area&nbsp; of&nbsp; 209.89&nbsp; square meters of said lot.&nbsp; The plaintiffs seek the payment&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P19,249.80&nbsp; by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; unpaid rentals from May,&nbsp; 1945, to March, 1947, when they filed&nbsp; an amended complaint,&nbsp; at the rate&nbsp; of P5.00 per square mete.r a month, the rental asked&nbsp; in their letter of demand received by the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; sometime&nbsp; on May 8,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the ejectment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; from the lot. Upon an affidavit of attachment subscribed&nbsp; and sworn to&nbsp; by Filemon&nbsp; K.&nbsp; Perez, one of the plaintiffs,&nbsp; and&nbsp; attached to the original complaint,&nbsp; alleging that plaintiffs, have a cause&nbsp; of action against the defendants&nbsp; and&nbsp; the attachment prayed for comes under one of the cases&nbsp; mentioned in Section&nbsp; 1, Rule 59,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Rules of Court the&nbsp; Municipal Court, issued an <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>&nbsp; order of attachment&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp;&nbsp; the necessary bond,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sheriff's&nbsp; office&nbsp; on March 3, 1947, by&nbsp; attaching a piano,&nbsp; typewriter office furniture, boxes&nbsp; of&nbsp; medicine and other drugs, and&nbsp; the house belonging&nbsp; to the defendants.<br><br>"In&nbsp; their answer and amended answer, the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; alleged, among others,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; of rental fixed&nbsp; by the plaintiffs was illegal,&nbsp; exorbitant&nbsp; and unconscionable,&nbsp; and asked, by&nbsp; way&nbsp;&nbsp; of counterclaim,&nbsp; for damages, caused&nbsp; by the&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; on&nbsp; their properties which was&nbsp; supposedly without justification.<br><br>"On July&nbsp; 9, 1947 the Municipal Court rendered judgment, ordering the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; to vacate&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises,&nbsp; fixing&nbsp; the rental&nbsp;&nbsp; at P50.00 a month from April, 1946,*and at P320.00 a month from the time of extrajudicial demand on May 8, 1946,&nbsp; or&nbsp; a total of P4.469.03 up&nbsp; to&nbsp; June, 1947, and condemning the defendants to pay said sum and the further sum of P320.00 a month as rental from July 1947, until&nbsp; they finally vacate the&nbsp; premises.<br><br>"Defendants&nbsp; appealed to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Cebu. They&nbsp; failed, however, to file the necessary supersedeas bond and&nbsp; to pay either to the plaintiffs or to the Clerk of Court the rentals&nbsp; at P320.00 per month&nbsp; beginning July, 1947,&nbsp; pursuant to&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 8, Rule 72, Rules of Court, Upon&nbsp; application of&nbsp; the plaintiffs, an order of execution was&nbsp; issued by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance on March&nbsp; 15, 1948, and a writ&nbsp; of execution&nbsp; directed against the defendants issued on March 17, 1948, for the total sum of P7,349.03, representing the back rentals of&nbsp; P4,469.03, as fixed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court, and current rentals from July, 1947, to March,&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution&nbsp; was&nbsp; levied on&nbsp; the house&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp;&nbsp; on monthly rentals of said house, a bank deposit&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sum of P300.00, and goods and furniture also&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; More rents were&nbsp; garnished sometime&nbsp; thereafter.&nbsp; On&nbsp; June&nbsp; 19, 1948, the furniture, medicine&nbsp; and other drugs attached by&nbsp; the Sheriff's Office by&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Municipal Court&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 3, 1947, were sold at public&nbsp; auction, for P1,000.00. On&nbsp; June 30, 1948, the house was sold to one&nbsp; Conrado D. Cabuguas for the sum of P200.00. On&nbsp; December 7,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; the Sheriff's Office also garnished the sum of&nbsp; P246.00 deposited by the defendants with the Clerk of Court.<br><br>"In the meantime, the defendants filed an amended answer to the complaint in the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; alleging,&nbsp; among others, that the rate of rental of P5.00 per square meter a month was illegal, excessive&nbsp; and&nbsp; unjust, and, by way of counterclaim asked for&nbsp; damages by&nbsp; reason of the alleged wrongful&nbsp; attachment and sale of their properties.<br><br>"After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; was rendered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; lower court,&nbsp; the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br>'The&nbsp; court&nbsp; awards the following&nbsp; damages&nbsp; to the defendants:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"(1) P1.500.00 value&nbsp; of the piano attached&nbsp; and&nbsp; sold;<br>"(2) P5,000.00 assessed value of their&nbsp; house;<br>"(3) P8,000.00, worth of their stock at the time it was attached;<br>"(4) P246.00,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum deposited&nbsp; in, consignation by&nbsp; the defendants which was later&nbsp; attached and levied upon in the execution.<br></div><br>'The court makes no&nbsp; findings for&nbsp; damages&nbsp; on the loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; the goodwill of the drugstore of the defendants and the alleged&nbsp; resultant mental suffering and illness claimed by them.&nbsp; Also no finding as to costs.<br><br>'The findings of the&nbsp; City Court ordering the defendants to vacate from the premises and remove&nbsp; their house, although having already become academic, is hereby confirmed.<br><br>'The Provincial Sheriff of Cebu is hereby absolved of&nbsp; any&nbsp; responsibility, having performed his duty in&nbsp; accordance with legal&nbsp; orders of this Court<br><br>"The&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; have brought&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal, contending&nbsp; that&nbsp; the lower court erred:<br><br>'1. In holding&nbsp; that the plaintiff-appellants&nbsp; are liable for&nbsp; damages arising from&nbsp; legal orders, executed by the Deputy&nbsp; Provincial Sheriff of Cebu after the&nbsp; said trial court holds that "the&nbsp; Provincial Sheriff of Cebu is hereby absolved&nbsp; of any responsibility, having performed his duty in accordance with legal orders of this&nbsp; Court; and,<br><br>'2. In disturbing the decision of the Municipal Court fixing&nbsp; the1 amount of rentals payable to the plaintiff-appellants by the defendant-appellees, after the&nbsp; said&nbsp; trial court ordered&nbsp; it executed and after&nbsp; the&nbsp; same holds that "the findings of the City Court&nbsp; ordering the defendants to vacate&nbsp; from the premises and&nbsp; remove their house, although&nbsp; having already become academic, is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; confirmed.*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *"<br></blockquote>Petitioners&nbsp; assign&nbsp; eight errors&nbsp; supposedly&nbsp; committed by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the view we take of this case, we find it unnecessary to&nbsp; discuss most of said alleged&nbsp; errors.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first&nbsp; error&nbsp; assigned&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; Honorable Court&nbsp; of Appeals erred&nbsp; in departing from&nbsp; the usual&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; enunciated under the&nbsp; provision of&nbsp; Section 5, Rule 53 of the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court which provides&nbsp; that 'no error which does not affect&nbsp; the jurisdiction over&nbsp; the subject matter&nbsp; will&nbsp; be considered unless stated in the assignment&nbsp; of errors and&nbsp; properly argued in the brief,' when&nbsp; it lengthily justified and delved into the question&nbsp; of whether the attachment levied on the properties of the defendant-appellees&nbsp; was lawful&nbsp; or actionable for damages,&nbsp; a question&nbsp;&nbsp; which was not assigned as error&nbsp; nor argued in the brief&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellants."<br></blockquote>Strictly speaking, petitioners&nbsp; are right in that plaintiffs Mamerta Macasero,&nbsp; et al., respondents herein,&nbsp; in their&nbsp;&nbsp; appeal in the&nbsp; Court of Appeals did&nbsp; not allege&nbsp; or assign&nbsp;&nbsp; as error of the trial court, its holding that the issuance&nbsp;&nbsp; of the writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; attachment by the Municipal Court of Cebu&nbsp;&nbsp; was unlawful.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we should&nbsp; not forget that although under Section 5, Rule 53 of the Rules of Court, "no error which does not affect the jurisdiction over the subject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter will be considered unless stated in the assignment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of errors and properly argued in the brief", nevertheless, the&nbsp; appellate&nbsp; tribunal, under&nbsp; the same rule, may <i>motu proprio </i>consider plain&nbsp; errors, even&nbsp; if&nbsp; not specified and raised by the&nbsp; parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; The award of damages made by the trial court&nbsp; was precisely based on the alleged wrongful issuance of&nbsp; the writ of attachment.&nbsp; Naturally, that question was&nbsp; important and the Court of Appeals was fully justified in&nbsp; discussing and determining that decisive question,&nbsp; though not expressly and&nbsp; specifically assigned by plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals.<br><br>Was the issuance of the writ of attachment by the Cebu City court really wrongful as found by the trial court so as to justify the award of damages&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendants? Ordinarily, damages are awarded by reason of the issuance of a writ of attachment when the party, ordinarily the plaintiff, who&nbsp; had&nbsp; asked for and obtained the writ, loses in the action.&nbsp; In the present case, the plaintiffs won the case in the&nbsp; Municipal Court&nbsp; of Cebu and&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, and yet the latter court ordered them&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; damages to the defendants&nbsp; on the ground that the&nbsp; writ of attachment had wrongfully been issued.<br><br>After carefully&nbsp; studying the record, we&nbsp; agree with the Court of Appeals that the, writ of attachment had not been wrongfully or improvidently&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plaintiffs, respondents herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, it&nbsp; was the fault of the defendants,&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; herein, in&nbsp; not pursuing the&nbsp; remedies available to them,&nbsp; such as the dissolution&nbsp; of the writ of attachment by asking for a hearing and the opportunity to introduce&nbsp; evidence to prove&nbsp; that the petition for the writ of attachment had no basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote the Court of Appeals on this point:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; defendants should have moved&nbsp; to quash the attachment before&nbsp; or even after their properties have been&nbsp; attached (Section 13, Rule 59), by traversing the contents of the affidavit of attachment.&nbsp; A hearing on the motion would be had&nbsp; for the reception of defendants' evidence&nbsp; on the falsity of the recitals of the affidavit, otherwise a denial of such right to hearing would&nbsp; be tantamount to abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; discretion.&nbsp; (National Coconut&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Pecson, 90 Phil., 809)" * * *.<br></blockquote>All&nbsp; the trouble and financial difficulties that visited the appellants herein were mainly due to their&nbsp; own fault and negligence&nbsp; Had they taken the precaution&nbsp; to file a supersedeas bond in their appeal to&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance, and had they religiously paid the rentals for the property they were occupying, as fixed by the court, there would have been no execution, of the judgment&nbsp; against them. As to the alleged wrongful issuance of the writ of attachment,&nbsp; we quote with favor&nbsp; the pertinent&nbsp; portion of the appealed&nbsp; decision with which&nbsp; we are in conformity:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The affidavit was&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the plaintiffs, and it stated that he has personal knowledge of the facts alleged in the complaint;&nbsp; that&nbsp; a sufficient cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action&nbsp; exists; that the case is&nbsp; one of those contemplated in Section 1, Rule 59, Rules of Court; that the plaintiffs have no security&nbsp; for&nbsp; their demand; and, that the amount due&nbsp; the plaintiffs is, over and above&nbsp; all legal counterclaim,&nbsp; as&nbsp; much&nbsp; as&nbsp; the sum for which the attachment is sought. While the affidavit must he criticized as being couched in general terms,&nbsp; as&nbsp; for instance, where&nbsp; it is merely stated that the case is one of those mentioned in Section 1,&nbsp; Rule 59,&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground relied upon for&nbsp; the attachment&nbsp; is&nbsp; readily ascertainable&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; cursory reading of the writ of attachment dated March 3,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; and&nbsp; this circumstance&nbsp; yields&nbsp; to the presumption that the Municipal Court examined&nbsp; and gave full&nbsp; credence&nbsp; to the&nbsp; recitals of&nbsp; the&nbsp; affidavit, verified&nbsp; that a&nbsp; cause of action&nbsp; against&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; existed, and was convinced that the issuance of the attachment falls under Section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; of Rule 59, that is, that the defendants 'are about or are now transferring their properties with the intent to defraud their creditors, especially&nbsp; the herein plaintiffs.'&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no proof that this ground for attachment was untrue.&nbsp; The Municipal Court stated in its judgment that there was justification for the issuance of the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; attachment,&nbsp; while the Court of First&nbsp; Instance merely commented that it was wrong to issue the writ of attachment without conducting a preliminary hearing on the&nbsp; petition for attachment,&nbsp; considering that the basis&nbsp; of the amount of&nbsp; the attachment was&nbsp; the new and&nbsp; increased rate of&nbsp; rental unilaterally fixed by the&nbsp; plaintiffs.&nbsp; The total&nbsp; amount sought in the original complaint&nbsp; was P11,149.80.&nbsp; However, the proceeds of the&nbsp; sale of the house&nbsp; and goods, as well as the amount of&nbsp; the defendants' bank deposit, totalled&nbsp; only&nbsp; P1,500.00, while&nbsp; the total amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; alone was&nbsp; P4,469.03,<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; deem it unnecessary to discuss&nbsp; the other&nbsp; points raised by petitioners-appellants.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the appealed&nbsp; decision is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
