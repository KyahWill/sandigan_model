				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; June&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Insurance Co., Ltd., filed in the Municipal Court of&nbsp; Quezon City Civil Case No. 993, for ejectment, against the&nbsp; herein petitioner Teoflla Salvador, wherein, after&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; against&nbsp; her,&nbsp; the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Procede dietar senteneia en favor de&nbsp; la demandaiite ordenando a la&nbsp; demandada que deje vacante&nbsp; la&nbsp; propiedad deadrita&nbsp; en la demanda y entregue&nbsp; su posesion a la demandante; pague a esta, por el&nbsp; uso y&nbsp; ocupacion&nbsp; de&nbsp; la prbpiedad en cuestion la&nbsp; cantidad de F120 al mes a partir del 26 de Mayo de&nbsp; 1953 hasta&nbsp; la fecha de la entrega&nbsp; de la posesion de dicha propiedad; pague, ademas, las costas del juicio.&nbsp; Se sobresee la reconvencion de la demandada por carecer de merito y falta&nbsp; de&nbsp; substanciacion."<br></blockquote>Not satisfied with the question, the petitioner herein, in due&nbsp; time, filed a notice of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; and the necessary&nbsp; appeal bond together with a&nbsp; supersedeas&nbsp; bond in the&nbsp; sum of P480 for&nbsp; the&nbsp; rentals corresponding&nbsp; to four&nbsp; months from May 26, 1958 to September 26, 1953.<br><br>On September&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1953, and before the case was&nbsp; docketed in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Rizal,&nbsp; the respondent corporation filed an urgent motion&nbsp; for execution of&nbsp; the aforequoted judgment but the same was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; in view of the fact&nbsp; that the herein&nbsp; petitioner was&nbsp; allowed by the Municipal Court to file, and in fact did file, a supersedeas bond to stay the execution of&nbsp; the judgment.<br><br>On&nbsp; September 25, 1953, the case was docketed in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; as Civil case&nbsp; No. Q- 746.&nbsp;&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 12, 1953, the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation again&nbsp; filed an urgent&nbsp; motion for execution on the&nbsp; ground that the&nbsp; September, 1953&nbsp; rental&nbsp; of P120 was&nbsp; not paid or deposited with the Clerk&nbsp; of Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Rizal on or before October 10, 1953 in accordance with&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of section 8, Rule 72&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 3,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal granted&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and on November&nbsp; 17, 1953 a&nbsp; writ of execution was issued.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, or on November 19, 195S, the herein petitioner filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to set aside&nbsp; the order of November 3,&nbsp; 1953 on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; (1) that&nbsp; the rentals for four months from&nbsp; May 26,&nbsp; 1953 to September 25, 1953 were covered by&nbsp; the supersedeas bond in the amount of P480;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that on October&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the defendant deposited with the Clerk of Court the&nbsp; sum of P120 for the rental of the premises for the month&nbsp; of from September 26, 1953 to October 25, 1953; (3)&nbsp; that&nbsp; on November 19, 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; has made another deposit of P120 for the rental&nbsp; corresponding to October 26, 1953 to November 25,&nbsp; 1953; and&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; that pursuant to section 8&nbsp; of Rule 72,&nbsp; the rental for the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; September 26,S1953 to October 25, 1953 could be paid&nbsp; or deposited until November 4,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; and&nbsp; that for October 26, 1953 to November 25,&nbsp; 1953, on December 4,&nbsp; 1953.<br><br>This motion was&nbsp; opposed by the respondent corporation invoking that in the case of Carbungco, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Amparo, et al., <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> L-2245, promulgated on May 20, 1949, it was ruled that the legal provision about the deposit of rental corresponding to&nbsp; the&nbsp; previous&nbsp;&nbsp; month&nbsp; within&nbsp; the first ten days of the next&nbsp; succeeding month is&nbsp; mandatory and that upon&nbsp; violation thereof a writ of execution should be granted upon petition of the plaintiff.<br><br>On&nbsp; January 14,&nbsp; 1954, the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance, denying petitioner's motion'&nbsp; of&nbsp; November 19, 1953, entered the following order:<br><blockquote>"By virtue of&nbsp; the order issued by this Court on November&nbsp; 3, 1953, a writ of execution of the decision rendered by the inferior court ordering the&nbsp; defendant to&nbsp; vacate the&nbsp; property in&nbsp; question and to deliver possession thereof to the herein plaintiff was issued. On&nbsp; November 19, 1953,&nbsp; a motion was presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; counsel for the defendant praying that the said order of November 3, 1953 be set aside and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the writ of execution&nbsp; issued be cancelled. An opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; said motion to set aside&nbsp; was presented&nbsp; by the counsel for the plaintiff.<br><br>"After&nbsp; going over the&nbsp; arguments&nbsp; set forth In both motion&nbsp; to set aside and&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; has&nbsp; arrived at&nbsp; the conclusion that said order of November 3,&nbsp; 1953 ordering the issuance of a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution of the decision&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; inferior court must stand.&nbsp; In the case of Bagtas<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Tan, et al,&nbsp; (L-6050), Our Supreme Court held:<br>'In&nbsp; a forcible entry or detainer case,&nbsp; a supersedeaa bond covers only&nbsp; rentals&nbsp; in arrears,&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; elevation&nbsp; of the case to&nbsp; the court of first instance on&nbsp; appeal, by&nbsp; the perfection&nbsp; of the appeal, and in addition to the&nbsp; supersedeas bond, to stay execution during the appeal, the&nbsp; defendant-appellant&nbsp;&nbsp; should deposit in the&nbsp; court or pay to the&nbsp; plaintiff the current&nbsp; rentals as they&nbsp; become due on or before the&nbsp; tenth' of each calendar month&nbsp; for the&nbsp; preceding month (Rule 72, Sec.&nbsp; 8).'<br><br>From the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; doctrine, it is clear that&nbsp; the&nbsp; mere&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of the supersedeas bond to&nbsp; cover&nbsp; rentals in arrears&nbsp; up to&nbsp; the perfection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal will not&nbsp; relieve the&nbsp; defendant-appellant&nbsp; in the present case from depositing&nbsp; in court or paying to the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; current rentals&nbsp; as they&nbsp; became&nbsp; due&nbsp; 'on&nbsp; or&nbsp; before&nbsp; the tenth&nbsp; of&nbsp; each calendar&nbsp; month&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; month'.&nbsp;&nbsp; As shown by the record of this case, the defendant herein failed to make the necessary&nbsp; deposit or to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; rental due&nbsp; as required by Sec. 8, Rule&nbsp; 72 of the Rules of Court;&nbsp; she only made the first deposit on October 20,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; date is far beyond the period when .she. should have done so as provided by said Rule.&nbsp; Likewise, in the case of&nbsp; Guzman <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Lichauco&nbsp; (42.&nbsp; Phil. 291)&nbsp; it was held that the term 'calendar&nbsp; month' does not mean every&nbsp; period of&nbsp; thirty days beginning from the date&nbsp; of the appeal, but it has reference to the month in the calendar.<br><br>"In view of&nbsp; the foregoing, the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to set aside the order of this&nbsp; Court dated&nbsp; November 3,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; is hereto denied, and let the writ of execution issued&nbsp; be given&nbsp; due course."<br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition for certiorari, injunction, and prohibition.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; contended&nbsp; fey&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; rental&nbsp; of the&nbsp; premises corresponding&nbsp; to the&nbsp; period September&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1953 to October&nbsp; 25, 1953 should be&nbsp; paid or deposited&nbsp; on or before&nbsp; October 10,&nbsp; 1953 and the rental for October 26, 1958&nbsp; to&nbsp; November 25, 1953&nbsp; should be paid on or before November 10, 1953.&nbsp; Petitioner, in turn,&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the first rental in&nbsp; question&nbsp; can be paid until November 4, 1953 and the second, on December 4, 1953.<br><br>In the aforequoted decision of&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Quezon City, the herein petitioner was ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay P120 monthly from&nbsp; May 26, 1953, and&nbsp; not from&nbsp; May 1 to May 30, 1953.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the first rental that the herein&nbsp; petitioner should pay or deposit&nbsp; in this case should mature on June 25, 1953&nbsp; and the&nbsp; second and succeeding rentals would mature every 25th day of the succeeding month.&nbsp; The record disclose&nbsp; that the rentals from May 26, 1953 up to September&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1953 in the sum of . f 480 was covered by the supersedeas&nbsp; bond approved by the Municipal Court&nbsp; and&nbsp; transmitted to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Quezon City; the rent for the month of from September 26,&nbsp; to&nbsp; October 25, 1953 wag deposited on October 20, 1953, as per Official Receipt No. B-4265175; the rent for the month of from October 26, 1953 to November 25, 1953 was deposited on November 19, 1953, as&nbsp; per&nbsp; Official Receipt&nbsp; No.&nbsp; B-4265206; and the rent for one month corresponding&nbsp; to the&nbsp; period&nbsp; from November 26,&nbsp; 1953 to December 25, 1953 was deposited on December 10,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; as&nbsp; per&nbsp; Official Receipt&nbsp; No. B-4265238. Yet, on&nbsp; January 14,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge&nbsp; gave due course to the writ of execution.&nbsp; Certainly,'&nbsp; this is an evident error, for in the present case there has been payment in due time, for the first rent could be paid up to&nbsp; October 25th, the second up to November 25th,&nbsp; and the third up to&nbsp; December&nbsp; 25th,&nbsp; yet said rents were not incurred in the&nbsp; delinquency of payment of the rents in&nbsp; question.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no legal basis&nbsp; for&nbsp; executing the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Court of,&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City which&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the aforecited section 8&nbsp; of Rule 72 of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court should be executed if&nbsp; the defendant fails to deposit in court within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; days of the succeeding month the&nbsp; rental&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; to&nbsp; the previous month.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; reaching the foregoing conclusion, we are not unmindful of the ruling laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of De Guzman <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Liehauco (42 Phil.,&nbsp; 291) which the lower court took&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration in&nbsp; issuing&nbsp; the disputed writ of&nbsp; execution,&nbsp; but the question raised in that case, was&nbsp; whether the starting point for&nbsp; the&nbsp; computation of one month is the date&nbsp; of the appeal&nbsp; and not the&nbsp; calendar month composed of thirty days&nbsp; as&nbsp; denned by Section 18 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thai case&nbsp; therefore has&nbsp; no parity&nbsp; with the present&nbsp; case ^wherein the point in issue&nbsp; is whether the decision of&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City&nbsp; should be executed only&nbsp; because the rent corresponding to September 26,&nbsp; 1958 to&nbsp; October 25, 1953&nbsp; has&nbsp; been paid&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 20&nbsp; and not&nbsp; on&nbsp; or before October 10, 1953&nbsp; and the rent&nbsp; for&nbsp; October 26, 1953 to November 25,&nbsp; 1953 was paid&nbsp; on&nbsp; November 19, 1953 and&nbsp; not on or before November 10,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; It is our considered opinion that in cases of&nbsp; monthly&nbsp; rents&nbsp; which could be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; from a&nbsp; given day of a&nbsp; month&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; a given day of&nbsp; the following month, the&nbsp; calendar month within which the rent could be deposited or paid should be that following the month&nbsp; in which the rent matured, i.&nbsp; e., if the rent matures on any day for the&nbsp; month of October, the calendar month referred to in section 8 of Rule 72 within which the rent should be paid to avoid&nbsp; execution of the decision shall be the month of November,&nbsp; and so&nbsp; on. Wherefore, the petition is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; granted and the preliminary injunction issued in this case made permanent enjoining&nbsp; the respondent judge to execute his&nbsp; Order dated January 14, 1953, without costs.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angela, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Reyes, J.
