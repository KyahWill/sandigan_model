				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal, taken by Rogaciano Cuevas, a decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Batangas, in Criminal Cases Nos. 28 and 29 of said court, 
which, by agreement of the parties, were jointly triad. In case No. 28, the 
court convicted Cuevas of the crime of murder, with which he is charged, and 
sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty (?) of 17 years and 4 months of 
reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua, to indemnify the offended party in the 
sum of P3,000, and to pay the costs. In case No. 29, in which Cuevas was charged 
with frustrated murder, he was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to an 
Indeterminate penalty ranging from 4 years and 2 months of prision correccional 
to 6 years, 1 month and 11 days of prision mayor, and to pay the costs.
<p>The main facts are correctly set forth in the decision appealed from, from 
which we quote;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"About 7:00 o'clock in the evening of March 17, 1950, Julian Masagpag, 
Paulino Abarquez, Florencio Magpantay, Dominador Castillo, Jr., Teofilo Cusi and 
Marcelino Abraham, arrived in a car at the store of Miss Holgado, situated in 
barrio Aplaya, Bauan, Batangas. Into the said store, where they started to drink 
beer and coke, later walked the herein accused Rogaciano Cuavas alias Rohing. 
The latter engaged Dominador, Jr. in conversation which in the end degenerated 
into a verbal altercations As Julian Masagpag tried to pacify them, the accused 
punched Masagpag in the mouth and the two came to blows. Separated, the accused 
left the store ahead of Masagpag and his companions. Half an hour thereafter, 
the latter got into their car and drove towards home. At the wheel was Marcelino 
Abraham, while seated beside him on the front seat were Paulino Abarquez and 
Florencio Magpantay. Occupying the rear seat were Julian Masagpag, Dominador 
Castillo, Jr. and Teofilo Cusi. in the order named. As they were cruising along 
a road called 'Daang Dagat', they were met by a hail of shots from a distance of 
about five armlengths on the right side of the road. The photographs Exhibits B 
and 0 of the car show that it received at least seven bullet holes on its front 
and right side. As a result of the shooting, Julian Masagpag received the 
following wounds from which he died:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Wound, gunshot, with point of entrance at first lumbar one inch lateral 
to spinal column and bullet lodged at the interspace mid-clavicular, left.</p>
<p>(2) Fracture, complete, 8th rib at mid-clavicular line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paulino Abarquez, in turn received the following wounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) Wound, gunshot, thru and thru, foot, right, with point of entrance at the 
planter aspect, one inch from lateral border and exit at 1/2 inch, dorsum of 
lateral border of foot, right."</p></blockquote>
<p>(Appellant's brief, pp.44-45.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The appeal hinges on the sufficiency, of the evidence to the effect that the 
lethal shots were fired by herein appellant. In convicting him, His Honor, the 
trial Judge, relied upon the following (1) Exhibit D, which purports to be the 
dying declaration of Julian Masagpag, naming appellant Rogaciano Cuavaa as his 
assailant; (2) the testimony of Pulino Abarquez to the same effect; (3) on 
cross-examination by the defense, Abarquez testified that, immediately after the 
shooting, his co-passenger, Florencio Magpantay stated that appellant herein was 
the one who fired at them; (4) Josefa Castillo, the widow of Masagpag declared 
that, when she saw her husband, in the hospital, in the evening of the 
occurrence, at about midnight, he said that he had been "held up by Rohing," 
refering to appellant Rogaciano Cuevas, "with a gun;" (5) about thirty (30) 
minutes prior to the occurrence, appellant had a fist fight with Julian 
Masagpag; (6) two attempts were made, on behalf of appellant herein, to settle 
the case with Mrs. Masagpag, one by appellant's mother, and another by his uncle 
and aunt, the spouses Dominador Cuevas and Josefa Bejasa; and (7) the alleged 
flight of defendant-appellant.</p>
<p>As regards Exhibit D, appellant says that it is neither signed nor 
thumbmarked by Masagpag; that it does not appear to have been read by, or to, 
him; and that these omissions have not been satisfactorily explained by the 
prosecution. It appears that Exhibit D was written, with a colored pencil, by 
Sgt. Felix Sistona of the municipal police force of Bauan, Batangas, and that 
the questions appearing therein were propounded by Cesar Arad, Chief of Police 
of said municipality. Both testified that said oue stions were propounded to 
Julian Masagpag in the Batangas Provincial Hospital, in thd evening of March 17, 
1950, and that the answers contained therein were those given by him on that 
occasion, in reply to said questions. Inasmuch as, owing to his serious 
condition, Masagpag could not sign Exhibit D, Sgt. Sistona went around the 
hospital to look for a stamp pad, but found out that there was none. When he 
returned to the room of Masagpag, to make him thumbmark Exhibit D with ink, 
Masagpag had already been brought to the operating room, where he was not 
allowed to enter. Sistona tried to see Masagpag twice the next day, but the 
doctor said that he could not do so, because of the precarious condition of 
Masagpag. Upon inquiry by telephone made by Sistona on March 19 and 20, 1950, he 
was given the same advice. Masagpag died on March 21, 1950, at about 3:00 a.m. 
We agree with the lower court that the foregoing facts, which were established 
by the testimony of Sgt. Sistona. corroborated, as regards the taking of the 
statement Exhibit D, by that of Chief of Police Cesar Arada, satisfactorily 
explain the omissions stressed by the defense. Moreover, it has been proven by 
said testimony that Masagpag made the declarations contained in Exhibit D 
knowing that he was in imminent danger of death, not only because of the nature 
of his injury, but, also, because he told his wife that he was going to die in 
consequence thereof. Hence, Exhibit D partakes of the nature of an ante-mortem 
statement and was properly regarded as such.</p>
<p>The defense brands the testimony of Paulino Abarquez as doubtful and highly 
improbable, as well as unworthy of credence. Besides, it tried to prove, through 
the testimony of Teofilo Cusi, that Abarquez was drunk at the time of the 
occurrence. But this was denied by Abarnuez, and the lower court believed him, 
and, evidently, gave no credence to Cusi. The record before us does not warrant 
interference with the appraisal thus made by His Honor, the trial Judge, who was 
in a better position than we are to gauge the veracity of the opposing witnesses 
indeed, Abarquez had no reason to implicate appellant herein, if he were not the 
real culprit, for his (Abarquez') true assailant would than be relieved from 
responsibility. Again, being on the front seat of the car, which was running 
slowly, Abarquez was favorably situated to recognize, by the beam of the 
headlights, the appellant herein, whom he knew well and was standing on the 
sidewalk, barely five fathoms ahead of said vehicle, when said witness saw him. 
That this was the position of the culprit, in relation to the car, at the 
beginning of the attack, is borne out by the fact that the front part of said 
vehicle was hit by two bullets.</p>
<p>The testimony of Abarquez to the effect that, immediately after the shooting, 
Florencio Magpantay said that their assailant was appellant herein, is now 
contested.as hearsay evidence. It will be recalled, however, that Abarquez gave 
said testimony on cross-examination by defense counsel, who did not object 
thereto, and hence, must be deemed to have waived such right as he may have had 
to comfront Magpantay and cross-examine him. Moreover, the aforementioned 
statement of Magpantay was spontaneously made, without premediation, under the 
influence of the startling event which he had witnessed, and referred to the 
circumstances surrounding the same. It is, accordingly, a part of the res 
gestae, one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>
<p>The defense maintains that "the court a quo committed an error in attributing 
motive to the accused for the shooting of Julian Masagpag and Paulino Abarquez." 
This pretense is clearly devoid of merit, it being admitted that, about thirty 
(30) minutes before the shooting, appellant had had a fist fight with Julian 
Masagpag. Although the former had no motive to try to kill Abarquez, it is 
apparent that the latter was wounded accidentally by a bullet aimed at 
Masagpag.</p>
<p>Contrary to appellant's pretense, the. statement of Masagpag to his" wife, 
concerning the identity af the culprit, is an ante-mortem. declaration, entitled 
to consideration and weight as such, it appearing that Masagpag made it with 
knowledge of his impending death.</p>
<p>The defense would, also, have us believe that appellant had no knowledge of, 
and had not authorized, the attempt of his uncle and aunt, Dominador Cuevas and 
Josefa Bejasa. and than of his mother, to settle the case amicably. However, the 
lower court found his biased testimony to this effect unworthy of credence and 
we do not see why this finding should be disturbed, considering that ha did not 
even data introduce the testimony of said spouses and his mother, to corroborate 
him.</p>
<p>Appellant testified that he was playing mahjong, in a club near the seem of 
the shooting, when the same took place; that he did not leave Bauan, Batangas, 
until March 19th, whan he went to Manila for business purposes, not to escape 
arrest or prosecution; and that, when he learned in Manila, about three (3) 
weeks later, that he was being suspected as the culprit, he returned to Bauan 
and contacted its Chief of Police. This defense cannot aven be considered as an 
alibi, for appellant testified that he heard tha shooting while he was alleged 
ly playing mahjong, so that it was not physically impossible for him to have 
been at the scene of the crime, when it was committed. Furthermore, his 
testimony to the effect that he did not leave Bauan until two (2) days after the 
occurrence, is contradicted by the Chief of Police and Sgt. Sistona, for they 
testified that both repaired to tha place of the shooting, immediately after the 
occurrence; that, upon investigation conducted on the spot, they found out that 
appellant was the culprit and this was confirmed by Masagpag's. ante-mortem 
declare tion, made, in the hospital, later that evening; that, thereupon, they 
tried to apprehend appellant, but,he could not be found anywhere, either in 
Bauan, Batangas, or in Manila, where the Chief of Police want twice, provided 
with a search warrant; and that, about a month later, appellant showed up, ready 
to post the corresponding bail bond. The lower court, did not err in holding 
that appellant's flight had been established and in considering this 
circumstance as indicative of his guilt, which has been proven beyond reasonable 
doubt.</p>
<p>The crime committed, in connection with Criminal Case No. 28 G. R. No. 
L5844), is murder, qualified by treachery. Although the offense was perpetrated 
at night time, this fact should not be considered to aggravate the offense, for 
apart from being, under the circumstances surrounding the case, included in 
treachery, it was not sought purposely, the aggression having been provoked 
evidently by the fist-fight that had preceded the same. No modifying 
circumstance having attended the commission of the offense, the penalty for 
murder should be imposed in its medium period, namely, life imprisonment. Hence, 
appellant should be sentenced to this penalty only. without the benefit of the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, which is not applicable to this case.</p>
<p>As regards Criminal Case No. 29 (G. R. No. L-5845), the lower court 
considered the crime committed as attempted murder, merely because the injuries 
sustained by Paulino Abarquez were not necessarily mortal. This fact, does not 
suffice, however, to warrant tha conclusion drawn by the lower court. It having 
been established that appellant had performed all the acts of execution 
necessary to kill, and yet did not produce the desired result, the crime 
committed is frustrated murder, not attempted murder. Hence, ha should be 
sentenced in Case No, 29 to an indeterminate penalty ranging from four (4) 
years, two (2) months and one (l) day of prision correccional to twelve (12) 
years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal.</p>
<p>Thus modified as to the penalty in both cases, the decision appealed from is 
hereby affirmsd. in all other respects, with costs against appellant Rogaciano 
Cuevas.</p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, Bautista Angelo, Labrador</em>, and
