				<H3>MANUEL R. OLAÃ‘O, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MANUEL BERNARDO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS. MANUEL BERNARDO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>

				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 18, 1956, while Ford automobile plate No. QC 483 (1955), owned by 
Manuel it. Olano, was parked at Georgia Street, Manila, a truck, bearing plate 
No. T-5592 (1955), then being driven by Daniel Morayo and belonging to Deluxe 
Bakery, Inc., of which Manuel Bernardo was the General Manager, bumped into and 
damaged the automobile in an estimated amount of P784.00. Because demands for 
the payment of said amount were refused, on April 5, 1956, a complaint for 
damages was filed in the Municipal Court of Manila, by Manuel Olano, against 
both the driver Morayo and Bernardo, the latter in his capacity as employer of 
Morayo and General Manager of the Bakery, registered owner of the truck. On 
April 24, 1956, the scheduled hearing of the case, not one of the defendants 
appeared. Before plaintiff was allowed to present his evidence, the record was 
consulted to find out whether summons were duly served upon the defendants. The 
record revealed that defendant Bernardo was duly served, but Morayo was not. 
Defendant Bernardo was declared in default. On May 21, 1956, the municipal court 
rendered a default judgment of the following tenor:
<blockquote>
<p>"For failure of the defendant Manuel Bernardo to appear on April 24, 1956, 
judgment by default is hereby entered, ordering the said defendant to pay the 
plaintiff the sum of P784.00; plus the sum of P100.00 as and for attorney fees; 
and the costs of the suit. </p>
<p>On motion of the plaintiff, the case against the defendant Manuel Morayo is 
dismissed without prejudice."</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 30, 1956, defendant Bernardo filed a "Motion to Set Aside Decision" on 
two grounds: (1) that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over his person 
since no summons had been served upon him; and (2) that he was not the employer 
of Morayo, but the Deluxe Bakery, Inc. On June 2, 1956, the above motion was 
denied. No appeal was taken on the order denying the motion to set aside 
decision.</p>
<p>On June 13, 1956, Bernardo presented a Notice of Appeal, stating therein, 
among others, "that he is appealing the decision of this Court to the Court of 
First Instance of Manila". Notwithstanding the opposition of the plaintiff, the 
municipal court gave due course to the appeal.</p>
<p>On October 30, 1956, the plaintiff filed, with the CFI, a "Motion to Dismiss 
the Appeal of the Defendant", alleging that (1) the decision appealed from is 
not appealable; and (2) the CFI has no jurisdiction over the case, since no 
appeal was taken from the Order of the Municipal Court denying defendant's 
motion to set aside the decision. This motion was opposed by Bernardo on the 
same grounds as those he presented in the municipal court. On November 5, 1956, 
without the motion to dismiss appeal having been resolved, Bernardo asked the 
CFI for the dismissal of the complaint, claiming that the same failed to state 
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him, there being no 
showing that he committed any wrong or should be responsible for damages 
occasioned by the acts of the driver Morayo, and that the real party in interest 
is the De Luxe Bakery, Inc. since his personality is separate and distinct from 
the entity he represents as General Manager thereof. The motion to dismiss the 
complaint, was denied for lack of merit. On March 18, 1957, defendant Bernardo 
filed his answer to the complaint and after the customary admissions and 
denials, interposed defenses which were already contained in the previous 
pleadings he presented both before the municipal court and the trial court. On 
August 15, 1957, the trial court promulgated an Order dismissing the appeal, 
stating therein that the procedure undertaken by Bernardo was not that which the 
rules of court provided. This is an appeal from said order.</p>
<p>Whether the steps taken by defendant Bernardo in prosecuting his appeal are 
in accordance with the rules and jurisprudence on the mattter, would seem to be 
the only issue posed. It clearly appears that Bernardo was declared in default 
and a default judgment was correspondingly entered against him in the municipal 
court; that his motion to set aside the decision was denied; that no appeal was 
taken from the order denying the motion to set aside the default judgment, and 
that the appeal to the CFI was on the judgment on the merits. In the case of Lim 
Toco <em>vs</em>. Go Fay, 81 Phil., 258; 45 Off. Gaz., (8) 3350, it was 
held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A defendant in default loses his standing in or is considered out of court, 
and consequently can not appear in court, adduce evidence, and be heard, and for 
that reason he is not entitled to notice. If he is not entitled to notice of the 
proceedings in the case and to be heard, he cannot appeal from the judgment 
rendered by the court on the merits." (See also Gequillana <em>vs</em>. 
Buenaventura, 87 Phil., 300; Tecson vs. Melendres, 88 Phil, 703; Reyes 
<em>vs</em>. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, 88 Phil., 513; Florentino 
&amp; Co. Ltd. <em>vs</em>. Johnlo Trading Co., etc. 108 Phil., 661; 57 Off. 
Gaz., [37] 6608).</p></blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Justice Moran commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defendant who is declared in default can not appeal, unless he files a 
motion under Rule 38 asking that the order of default be set aside upon the 
ground of fraud, accident, error, or mistake, or excusable neglect, and his 
motion is denied, in which case he may appeal from the order denying such 
motion, and he may, in the meantime, apply for a writ of preliminary injunction 
to stay the execution of the judgment rendered on the merits. And if the motion 
for a stay of execution is denied, the motion may be renewed on appeal" (I 
Moran, 1957 Ed. p. 485, and cases cited therein.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to regain his standing in court, appellant Bernardo should have 
timely moved to set aside the order of default on the grounds provided in the 
rules and upon denial thereof, appeal the order of denial. This he failed to do. 
Although the appellant filed a motion to set aside the decision, he nevertheless 
did not appeal the order denying the said motion. Moreover, the grounds upon 
which he based his motion to set aside the default judgment, were not those 
provided for under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, and the motion was not 
accompanied by any affidavit of merit (Vda. de Valdez <em>vs</em>. Farinas, 94 
Phil., 850; Tecson, et al. <em>vs</em>. Melendres, supra).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
defendant-appellant Manuel Bernardo.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
