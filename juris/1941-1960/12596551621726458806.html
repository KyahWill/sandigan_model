A. to cover the full invoice value&nbsp; of certain machineries and their accessories; that&nbsp; on 3 October&nbsp; 1952 the&nbsp; plaintiff approved the application "subject to 30%&nbsp; deposit and the joint and&nbsp; several signatures of Mr. Isidoro Tinoco and Mrs. Soledad&nbsp; L. Basa"&nbsp; which&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; were complied with; that on&nbsp; 8 October&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the plaintiff issued Letter of&nbsp; Credit No.&nbsp; 51469 in favor&nbsp; of the Turner Tanning Machinery Company; that on 15 November&nbsp; 1952 the Turner Tanning&nbsp; Machinery&nbsp; Co., drew upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter of credit the sum of $14,549.17, U.

A.,&nbsp; to pay for the importation of color dye; that the plaintiff approved the application "subject to 30% deposit and the joint and several signatures of Mr. Isidoro Tinoco and Mrs. Soledad L. Basa,"&nbsp; which conditions were complied with; that thereafter&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff issued Letter of Credit No. 53753&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of the Bay State Chemical Co., that on&nbsp; 12&nbsp; March 1953 the Bay State Chemical Co., drew upon the letter&nbsp; of credit the sum of $2,482.40, U.&nbsp; S. currency; that the draft drawn by the Bay State Chemical&nbsp; Co., was presented by the plaintiff to the defendants for&nbsp; payment; that the defendants failed and refused to pay the amount of the draft and the charges due&nbsp; thereon; that because of the&nbsp; failure and refusal&nbsp; of the defendants to&nbsp; pay their obligation, the plaintiff delivered the documents of the shipment&nbsp; to the Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Co., and requested it to claim and store the shipment in its bonded&nbsp; warehouse, for which service and storage the defendants&nbsp; are liable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage Co.; that&nbsp; as of 15 October 1953; the&nbsp; outstanding balance of the defendants on the draft is P4,503.05, Philippine currency, plus interest thereon at the rate of P0.83569 daily until fully paid.<br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiff prays that after hearing judgment&nbsp; be rendered&nbsp; ordering the defendants to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; it the sum of P22,787.79, with&nbsp; daily interest thereon at&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; of P4.89135&nbsp; from 15 October 1953 until&nbsp; fully paid; 10% of the said amount as attorney's&nbsp; fee; P4,503.05,&nbsp; with&nbsp; daily interest thereon at the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; P0.83569 from 15 October 1953 until&nbsp; fully paid; the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; storage and other charges that the Luzon Brokerage Co., would charge the plaintiff for the handling and storage of the merchandise imported&nbsp; by the&nbsp; defendants under Letter&nbsp; of&nbsp; Credit No. 53753;&nbsp; and the costs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the suit.&nbsp; The plaintiff further prays that pending hearing and final judgment, a writ of attachment be issued commanding the Sheriff&nbsp; of the City of Manila to levy upon attachment on the properties of the defendants as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that it may secure against them.<br><br>In their answer filed on 28 December 1953&nbsp; the defendants admit&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; averments&nbsp; except&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the correctness of the amounts&nbsp; due on the two&nbsp; drafts, the correctness of which&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; still&nbsp; checking, and for that reason lacking sufficient knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth and veracity of the amounts due on the two drafts, they deny the amounts claimed by the plaintiff to be due from them.<br><br>On 25 June 1954 the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that since the defendants had admitted the material averments of its complaint except as to the correctness&nbsp; of the amounts due, the defendants' answer did not tender a genuine issue.&nbsp; The plaintiff attached to its motion an affidavit subscribed and sworn&nbsp; to by Ceferino Saavedra, Manager of the Special Assets Department of the&nbsp; plaintiff, in charge of all outstanding&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; of its debtors, stating the payments made by the defendants on their account and the exact total amount due from them. <br><br>On&nbsp; 7&nbsp; October&nbsp; 1954 the&nbsp; Court granted the&nbsp; plaintiff's motion and rendered&nbsp; judgment ordering the&nbsp; defendants, jointly&nbsp; and severally,&nbsp; to pay—<br><blockquote>* * * the&nbsp; plaintiff in the&nbsp; first cause&nbsp; of action,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P22,787.79, with a daily interest of P4.89135 from October 15, 1953 up to full payment&nbsp; thereof; and&nbsp; 10%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the amount due&nbsp; for attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; second cause of action, defendants&nbsp; shall pay,&nbsp; jointly and&nbsp; severally, the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P4,503.05, with a&nbsp; daily interest&nbsp; of P0.83569&nbsp; from&nbsp; October&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; until&nbsp; full payment thereof.<br></blockquote>Defendants shall also pay the costs.<br><br>The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter certified the case&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court for the&nbsp; reason that only questions of law&nbsp; are raised. Rule&nbsp; 36 provides:<br><br>Section 1. <i>Summary judgment for&nbsp; claimant.</i>—A party seeking&nbsp; to recover upon&nbsp; a claim, counterclaim,&nbsp; or cross-claim&nbsp; or to obtain a declaratory relief&nbsp; may,&nbsp; at any time after the&nbsp; pleading in answer thereto has been served, move with affidavits&nbsp; for a&nbsp; summary&nbsp; judgment in&nbsp; his favor upon all&nbsp; or any part thereof.<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Motion&nbsp; and proceedings thereon.</i>—The motion&nbsp; shall be served at least ten days before the time specified for the hearing. The adverse party prior to the day of&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; may serve opposing affidavits.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment sought&nbsp; shall be rendered&nbsp; forthwith&nbsp; if the pleadings, depositions,&nbsp; and admissions&nbsp; or&nbsp; file, together with the affidavits, show&nbsp; that,&nbsp; except as&nbsp; to the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; damages,&nbsp; there is no&nbsp; genuine issue&nbsp; as&nbsp; to any of the&nbsp; material&nbsp; fact&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter&nbsp; of law.<br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Form of affidavits.</i>—Supporting and&nbsp; opposing affidavits shall be&nbsp; made&nbsp; on personal&nbsp; knowledge, shall&nbsp; set forth&nbsp; such&nbsp; facts as would be admissible in evidence, and&nbsp; shall&nbsp; show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies&nbsp; of all papers of parts thereof referred to in&nbsp; an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.<br><br>The defendants'&nbsp; answer that as to&nbsp; the first&nbsp; cause of action they—<br><blockquote>*&nbsp; * * are still&nbsp; checking on&nbsp; the correctness of the alleged balance outstanding against them and in favor of the plaintiff;&nbsp; consequently, for lack of knowledge&nbsp; or&nbsp; information&nbsp; sufficient to form a&nbsp; belief as to the truth and veracity of the averments embodied in paragraph 7 thereof, they hereby specifically deny the allegations therein stated;<br></blockquote>and that as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the second cause of&nbsp; action&nbsp; they—<br><blockquote>* * * are&nbsp; checking on the&nbsp; veracity and correctness&nbsp; of the balance allegedly outstanding in favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff manifested in&nbsp; paragraph 6 of the same, they, by virtue thereof, specifically deny it for lack of knowledge and&nbsp; belief as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth of the allegations embodied in the aforestated paragraph.<br></blockquote>does not&nbsp; tender a genuine issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact they admit that they&nbsp; are&nbsp; indebted to the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; the affidavit&nbsp; subscribed and sworn to by the Manager of the Special Assets Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff, in charge&nbsp; of all outstanding; accounts of its debtors, attached to the motion for summary judgment, furnishes the Court with the payments made by the defendants on their account and&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount due from them,&nbsp; which they failed&nbsp; to oppose by&nbsp; counter&nbsp; affidavits, the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
