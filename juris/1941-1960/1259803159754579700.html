				<H3>THE  PEOPLE OF  THE  PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JOSE DE LARA, ACCUSED AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur certified to us by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals&nbsp; on the ground that it involves only&nbsp; a question of law.<br><br>The appellant Jose de Lara pleaded guilty to an information&nbsp; for robbery committed as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about January 8, 1953, in the City of Naga, Philippines&nbsp; and within&nbsp; the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of this Honorable&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the accused herein,&nbsp; confederating&nbsp; together and mutually&nbsp; helping&nbsp; one another, did then and there&nbsp; wilfully unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously with intent&nbsp; of&nbsp; gain by&nbsp; the&nbsp; use of&nbsp; force upon things, to wit: by cutting the iron&nbsp; chain which was padlocked&nbsp; and fastening&nbsp; the . door&nbsp; of the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega</span>, an&nbsp; inhabited house, which the&nbsp; accused Jose de Lara then and there forcibly opened, and entered and&nbsp; once inside, did, then&nbsp; and there take, steal and carry away therefrom, without the knowledge and consent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the owner and&nbsp; complaining witness, Cipriano Agawa, the following/property,&nbsp; to wit:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"Twelve (12)&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of palay (raminad) at P9.50 each P114.00<br>"Ten&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; empty&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of&nbsp; P0.50 each ........................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.00<br></div><br>valued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the total&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of One hundred&nbsp; and nineteen&nbsp; (P119) pesos, Philippine currency, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner and complaining witness, Cipriano Agawa in&nbsp; the aforementioned amount&nbsp; of P119.<br><br>"That an aggravating circumstance of night&nbsp; time is present in the commission&nbsp; of the offense of robbery."</blockquote>In view of said plea, the trial court, applying Article 299 in relation to Article 303 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, sentenced him to an&nbsp; indeterminate penalty of not less than&nbsp; 6 months and 1 day nor more than 2 years, 11 months and 11 days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prison correctional</span>, and to pay proportionate&nbsp; costs.<br><br>In&nbsp; this appeal counsel for the appellant&nbsp; contends that the trial court should have applied Article 302 instead of Article&nbsp; 299 of the Revised Penal Code, on the ground&nbsp; that, as there is nothing in the record to show that the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega</span> where the robbery was committed was itself an inhabited house or a dependency&nbsp; of an inhabited house, appellant could be&nbsp; convicted of&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; in an uninhabited house and sentenced to a lighter penalty.<br><br>The contention is without merit.&nbsp; A plea of guilty imports unqualified&nbsp; admission of&nbsp; the facts alleged in&nbsp; the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that in the information filed in the&nbsp; present case the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega</span>&nbsp; where the robbery&nbsp; was committed is expressly described as "an inhabited&nbsp; house." The fact that from affidavits of the complaining witnesses, counsel&nbsp; could glean that the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega</span> was uninhabited or that it&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; a dependency of a&nbsp; dwelling&nbsp; house does&nbsp; not detract&nbsp; from appellant's&nbsp; admission in his plea of&nbsp; guilty. Those affidavits were not put in evidence to qualify the plea, and we cannot assume that, had that been done, the prosecution could&nbsp; not have countered with proof that, as it had alleged, the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega</span> was in fact inhabited.<br><br>However, we agree with the Solicitor General that the trial court was in error in applying the lower&nbsp; penalty provided in Article 303 for robbery that consists&nbsp; in the taking of cereals, fruits,&nbsp; or firewood, considering that the appellant, in&nbsp; addition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; palay, <span style="font-style: italic;">also took 10&nbsp; empty sacks valued at 50 centavos each.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; (6 Viada, 5th ed., p. 198, citing sentence of the Supreme Court of Spain of June 5,&nbsp; 1909.)<br><br>Appellant should, therefore, be convicted of robbery in an inhabited house under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, for which offense—in the absence of allegation that he&nbsp; was armed and&nbsp; it appearing that the value of the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos—the penultimate paragraph of that article prescribes the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> in its minimum period.&nbsp; Since the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty is&nbsp; offset by the aggravating circumstance of nighttime alleged in the&nbsp; information, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going down one degree for the purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and following&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling laid&nbsp; down in People <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Gonzales,&nbsp; 73 Phil, 549, and People <i>vs</i>. Mape, 77 Phil., 809, the appellant should be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which shall not be less than 6 months and 1 day nor more than 6 years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional,</span>&nbsp; and the maximum&nbsp; not less than 6 years, 8 months and 1 day nor more than 7 years and 4 months of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>No credit for&nbsp; preventive&nbsp; imprisonment is&nbsp; allowable in view of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime committed.&nbsp; (Art. 29, Revised Penal Code.)<br><br>Consistently with&nbsp; the foregoing, the&nbsp; penalty imposed below should be modified and, in line with the recommendation of the Solicitor&nbsp; General, the appellant&nbsp; is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 2 years, 4 months and 1&nbsp; day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>&nbsp; to 6 years, 8 months and 1 day&nbsp; of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>Modified accordingly, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L., </i>and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
