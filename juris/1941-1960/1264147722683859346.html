				<H3>JUAN V. AGUSTIN,  PETITIONER,  VS. HON. JUDGE PASTOR L. DE  GUZMAN OF THE COURT  OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS AND ROMAN GUERRERO,  RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This  is  a petition  for review of  the decision  rendered by the  Court  of Agrarian Relations, Second  District, presided by Judge Pastor L. de Guzman, at Cabanatuan City dated November  28,  1956. <br><br>According to Annex A of the petition, on  February 13, 1951, respondent Roman Guerrero, owner of Lot  No.  728 of the  Cadastral Survey of Rizal, Nueva  Ecija,  with an area  of about 17 hectares, leased  the  same to petitioner Juan V. Agustin for a period of four years at an annual rental of 400  cavans of palay  at  46 kilos a  cavan.   On December  17,  1952,  by virtue of  Annex B, the  term of the lease was extended to ten years. According to Annex C, dated November 26, 1954, for the reason that the owner, Roman Guerrero, had sold about 5 hectares of the lot to another party, Agustin as lessee relinquished his leasehold right to said 5 hectares, thereby reducing the  area of the land leased to  about 12 hectares, with a corresponding decrease of the yearly rental, as stated in Annex D, at the same time shortening the life of the lease  up to January 30,1958.   According to Annex E, on April 12,1955, in consideration of the sum of P1,000 paid by Guerrero to Agustin, the latter surrendered and  yielded to Guerrero five more hectares  of the parcel under  lease, thereby reducing the  area to  about  7  hectares, the reason  being   that 'Guerrero had sold said 5 hectares  to another  party. <br><br>Thereafter, Roman Guerrero filed a complaint with the Court of Agrarian Relations against Juan Agustin to eject the latter for failure to live up to the terms of the contract of  leasehold tenancy, and to recover back rentals, taxes and irrigation fees.  In the course of the hearing of the case, Agustin filed  a motion to dismiss the complaint on  the ground that the  Agrarian Court had no jurisdiction  over the  subject matter  for  the  reason that  it  was not a tenancy case.   The motion to dismiss was denied and respondent Judge continued  with  the hearing,  at  the termination of which he rendered the decision now sought to toe reviewed, granting Guerrero authority to eject Agustin from the landholding in dispute and to  place other tenants of  his  own choice,  and ordering  Agustin to deliver to Guerrero back rentals for the agricultural years 1953-1954, 1954-1955, and 1956-1957 in the form of cavans of palay and  to  pay the amount of P234 as irrigation  fees of  the  land for  the agricultural  years  1954-1955  and 1955-1956. <br><br>In  his  petition to review, Agustin apparently does not question the correctness of the decision.   He only  impugns the  jurisdiction  of the Agrarian  Court,  claiming that the relation between him and  Guerrero was  not that  of tenant  and landlord, but  that  of mere  lessee  and  lessor.<br><br>Under  Section 4 of  Republic  Act No.  1199,  entitled Agricultural  Tenancy  Act of  the  Philippines,  leasehold tenancy is  defined  as  follows: <br><blockquote>"Leasehold tenancy  exists when  a person who,  either  personally or with the aid of labor  available from members  of his  immediate farm  household,  undertakes to cultivate  a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by  a single person  together with members of his immediate  farm household, belonging to  or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a price certain or ascertainable to  be paid by the person cultivating the land  either  in percentage  of the production  or in  a fixed amount  in  money, or in both."</blockquote> On the basis of the facts of  the case as we  are able  to ascertain, the contract between petitioner and respondent would  appear to be that of leasehold tenancy.  The area of  the  land leased, namely, 17 hectares which by agreement  of  the parties,  had subsequently been  reduced  to 12  and still  later  to  7 hectares, is certainly capable  of being cultivated by one person with the help of the members of his immediate  household.  It is true  that petitioner alleges in his petition that he  himself  did not  work the land, but cultivated the same  through  his own tenants. But  this  is  a  question  of  fact which  he  should have established by means  of evidence.  This contention  or  allegation  is flatly denied  by the  respondent  Guerrero  in his  answer, thus: <br><blockquote>"Petitioner alleges  that  he did not work  the  land but  instead employed his own  tenants to cultivate the same.  This  is  a gratuitious assertion not  supported by the records of the case."  *  * * </blockquote> and on page 3  of his memorandum:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner advanced gratuitously an allegation  without proof in the records  that he did  not personally work on  the leasehold  but employed another as his own tenant on a share tenancy basis. This gratuitous allegation is belied by his  own admission  as shown by the stipulation of facts, as follows: <br><br>"4. That the defendant  during the  terms  of the lease planted onions  on the leasehold after harvest, for  the second, third and fourth  year of the contract' (Decision page  6.)" </blockquote>Furthermore, there  is nothing in  the decision sought to be reviewed to show that petitioner herein did not work the land himself and with  the aid of the members of his immediate household,  but employed tenants.  On the other hand,  when  the Agrarian Court denied the  motion for dismissal  for  lack  of jurisdiction, it  must  have-found as  a matter of fact that the case  was one of  leasehold tenancy, and that  Agustin  was  a tenant  of Guerrero, and that  is probably the  reason why in the dispositive part of the decision, as  already stated, the court authorized Guerrero to eject Agustin from the landholding and to place "<span style="font-style: italic;">other tenants of his own choice</span>."  Furthermore, if as claimed  but not proven by  Agustin, that he worked the  land under lease through his own tenants,  it  is not explained why and  how he could have readily and easily relinquished  more  than half  of the  area  of  the land leased, even shortening  the  period  of  the  lease, thereby substantially affecting  and impairing  the  rights of his alleged tenants. <br><br>In the case of Rural Progress Administration <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rufino Dimson, G. R.  No. L-6068, decision promulgated on April 28, 1955, through Mr. Justice Bengzon, we held that the contract of lease entered into by the Rural Progress Administration and Dimson was not one  of tenancy because the land subject of the lease in said case had an area of about 323 hectares, clearly beyond the physical  capacity of one single person, even with the help of the members of his immediate   household, to  cultivate, and  what  is more, the lessee in said case employed paid laborers working under him and under his  supervision.  As  may  be readily seen, the facts in the present case are far different. <br><br>In view of the foregoing, the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations  over the case is hereby sustained. Petitioner will  pay the costs.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.  J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Reyes,  A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
