				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review an order of the Public Service Commission. <br><br>On January 31,1948, the Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc., which  operates  a fleet of  buses  from  Pangasinan to other  provinces and the  city of Baguio, applied for a certificate of  public  convenience  to operate  a bus  service between Urdaneta and Baguio and  between Dagupan and Baguio, both <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> the Kennon Road.  The  application was published and individual notices were also  served on other operators, and one of  these, the  Dangwa  Transportation Co., actually filed an opposition.  But the opposition was not pressed and the Public Service Commission, after hearing, which began on September 17, 1948, handed down  its decision,  dated June 5, 1955,  granting the  certificate  of public convenience applied for. <br><br>In November,  1958—more  than five months  after the grant of  certificate to the applicant—the Manila Railroad Company filed a motion to have the decision set aside and the case reopened, alleging that despite being an old operator on the lines in question it was not notified of the application,  the hearings thereon and the  orders issued in the case; that the grant of certificate to the application and  its subsequent operation "have been proving to be prejudicial" to its interests; and that it believed the evidence it proposed to adduce at the rehearing would alter the decision already rendered. <br><br>Acting on this motion, the Commission  under  date  of December 8, 1955, handed down an order, which says:<br><blockquote>"Considering the motion of the  Manila Railroad  Company  dated November  25, 1955 asking that the decision entered in this case on June 9, 1955 be set aside and this case reopened to enable the movant to present  evidence in opposition, and finding no merit in the same inasmuch as the original order of hearing in  this case was entered on October 14, 1948, when  the Manila Railroad was not a registered operator in this Commission and it is only lately that the Manila Railroad has asked that it be notified of applications for bus services, for which reason the Railroad  was not included in the list of affected operators;  considering further that all thru the time that this case was pending hearing or pending decision, the Manila  Railroad never asked for permission to intervene in this case, and it would be  manifestly unfair to reopen all cases wherein the Manila Railroad had no  interest at the  time when they were decided simply because it subsequently chose to operate a service on identical lines, it is ordered that the said motion of the Manila Railroad Company be, as it is hereby, DENIED."</blockquote>This is the order now before us  for  review.<br><br>The  Public Service Law authorizes the Public Service Commission to grant, upon proper notice and  hearing, certificate of public convenience for the operation of a public service whenever the said Commission finds that the operation of such service will promote the public interests-in a proper and suitable  manner.  The rules  of  procedure in the Commission  require an applicant for a  certificate to operate a bus or TPU auto-truck service to publish in two newspapers of general circulation the order setting his application for hearing and, in addition, "to, send by registered mail copy of the application and the  order of hearing to all operators who may be affected thereby as appearing in the list furnished by the Commission."  Those  requirements have been  duly complied  with in the present  case, for beside publishing in two newspapers of general circulation the application and the order setting it for hearing, the applicant also sent by registered mail copies of the said application and order to <span style="font-style: italic;">all operators appearing in the list furnished by the Commission.</span> And as the Commission found after hearing that the operation of the service applied for would promote the public interests, the  grant of the certificate to the applicant would appear  to be in accordance with law and the regulation. <br><br>The Railroad company complains that it was not notified of the hearing and takes the Commission to task for not including it in  the list of operators that should be notified. But for all that the company had  only itself to blame.  For, as explained in the order under  review, the company was not a  registered  operator in the Commission and  only lately had it asked "that it be notified of  applications for bus services." Moreover, as the order  also points  out, "all thru the time that this case was pending hearing  or pending decision,  the Manila Railroad never asked  permission  to  intervene" and  this, we  may add,  notwithstanding the fact that both the  application and the order setting it for hearing were duly published. Not only that, but it  also appears that rehearing  was  not asked until more than five months after the decision granting the certificate was  handed down. Having all  those things  in mind we think the  Commission was right when it  said that "it  would be manifestly unfair to reopen all cases wherein  the Manila Railroad had no interest at the time when they were decided simply  because it subsequently chose to operate  a service on identical  lines." <br><br>We also note that the motion for reopening is not even under oath.   And while it alleges that the grant  of the certificates to the applicant and its subsequent operation on the lines applied  for  "have  been proving  to be greatly prejudicial to the interest" of the movant and that the latter has evidence sufficient to "alter the decision", it does riot specify in what that prejudice consists or the kind of evidence  the movant proposes to introduce. An unverified motion containing such generalities cannot, in our opinion, justify the setting aside of a decision handed down in response to a clear  public need—the need  for additional service on the lines herein applied for—there being evidence that the  buses operated by the Railroad company  cannot accommodate  all the  passengers  on  those  lines. <br><br>Wherefore, the order under  review is affirmed with costs against the  Manila  Railroad Company. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,  Reyes, J.
