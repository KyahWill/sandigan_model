				<H3>SANTIAGA BLANCO, ET AL.., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. FRUCTUOSA ESQUIERDO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS. DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES (FORMERLY REHABILITATION FINANCE CORPORATION), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>

				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental ordering the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6582 
issued in the name of Fructuosa Esquierdo on the ground that it was procured 
thru fraud, including the registration of a mortgage annotated on the back 
thereof which was constituted on the land by said Fructuosa Esquierdo as 
security for the loan obtained by her from the appellant Development Bank of the 
Philippines.
<p>It appears that the land covered by the certificate of title above-mentioned 
was originally registered in the name of the "Heirs of Maximiano Blanco" as 
evidenced by Original Certificate of Title No. P-268 of the land records of 
Negros Occidental. The latter certificate was issued pursuant to the homestead 
application of Maximiano Blanco, who died on June 15, 1930 before the 
corresponding patent could be issued. After his death, his common law wife, 
Fructuosa Esquierdo, and his surviving brothers and sisters took joint 
possession of the land in question.</p>
<p>On July 24, 1950, Fructuosa Esquierdo made an extra judicial adjudication in 
her favor of the entire land, claiming in an affidavit filed by her with the 
Register of Deeds that she was Maximiano Bianco's widow and only heir. In 
accordance with said adjudication, the Register of Deeds, on the following day, 
cancelled Original Certificate of Title No. P-268 and in lieu thereof issued 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6582 in her name.</p>
<p>On August 3, 1956, after learning of the transfer of title, Santiaga, 
Meycala, Facunda, Florencia, Mamerta, Teodora, Fabian and Juan, all surnamed 
Blanco, filed the present proceedings with the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental, praying for the annulment of the affidavit executed by Fructuosa 
Esquierdo and the cancellation of the certificate of title issued in her name. 
The complaint, in substance, alleged that the deceased Maximiano Blanco died 
single without leaving any descendant, ascendant or forced heir, except the 
plaintiffs who are his brothers and sisters, and that defendant Fructuosa 
Esquierdo, through the inducement of her nephew and co-defendant Fabio Silva, 
secured the issuance of the certificate of title in her name thru fraud, or by 
means of false and fraudulent representations made by her in the affidavit 
adjudicating the entire property to herself. Included as party defendant was the 
Development Bank of the Philippines (formerly Rehabilitation Finance 
Corporation) to which the property was alleged to have been mortgaged by 
defendant Fructuosa Esquierdo.</p>
<p>In due time, the defendants Fructuosa Esquierdo and Fabio Silva filed their 
answer, which was subsequently amended. In a separate answer, the Development 
Bank of the Philippines admitted that a mortgage was constituted on the land by 
the defendant Fructuosa Esquierdo as security for the loan obtained by her from 
the said bank, and as special defenses alleged that the complaint did not state 
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as against it and that it is a 
mortgagee in good faith.</p>
<p>After trial, the lower court, on December 11, 1958, rendered judgment 
declaring the certificate of title issued in the name of Fructuosa Esquierdo 
invalid, and ordering its cancellation and the restoration of Original 
Certificate of Title No. P-268 in the name of the Heirs of Maximiano Blanco, or 
the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in the name of said heirs. 
The court, likewise, ordered the cancellation of the registration of the 
mortgage deed annotated on the back of the certificate of title.</p>
<p>Arguing that it is an innocent mortgagee for valuable consideration and as 
such it is fully protected by law in its rights in the mortgage, regardless of 
whether the title to the land has been secured fraudulently or not by the 
defendant mortgagor Fructuosa Esquierdo, the defendant bank moved for a 
reconsideration of the decision. The court below, however, after opposition to 
the motion has been filed by plaintiff, denied the same. Hence, this appeal by 
the defendant bank.</p>
<p>That the certificate of title issued in the name of Fructuosa Esquierdo is a 
nullity, the same having been secured thru fraud, is not here in question. The 
only question for determination is whether the defendant bank is entitled to the 
protection accorded to "innocent purchasers for value", which phrase, according 
to sec. 38 of the Land Registration Law, includes an innocent mortgagee for 
value. The question, in our opinion, must be answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The trial court, in the decision complained of, made no finding that the 
defendant mortgagee bank was a party to the fraudulent transfer of the land to 
Fructuosa Esquierdo. Indeed, there is nothing alleged in the complaint which may 
implicate said defendant mortgagee in the fraud, or justify a finding that it 
acted in bad faith. On the other hand, the certificate of title was in the name 
of the mortgagor Fructuosa Esquierdo when the land was mortgaged by her to the 
defendant bank. Such being the case, the said defendant bank, as mortgagee, had 
the right to rely on what appeared in the certificate and, in the absence of 
anything to excite suspicion, was under no obligation to look beyond the 
certificate and investigate the title of the mortgagor appearing on the face of 
said certificate. (De Lara, et al. <em>vs</em>. Ayroso, 95 Phil., 185; 50 Off. 
Gaz., [10] 4838; Joaquin <em>vs</em>. Madrid, et al., 106 Phil., 1060). Being 
thus an innocent mortgagee for value, its right or lien upon the land mortgaged 
must be respected and protected, even if the mortgagor obtained her title 
thereto thru fraud. The remedy of the persons prejudiced is to bring an action 
for damages against those causing the fraud, and if the latter are insolvent, an 
action against the Treasurer of the Philippines may be filed for the recovery of 
damages against the Assurance Fund (De la Cruz <em>vs</em>. Fabie, 35 Phil., 
144; Blondeau <em>vs</em>. Nano, 61 Phil., 625; Sumira et al. <em>vs</em>. 
Vistan et al., 74 Phil. 138; Raymundo et al. <em>vs</em>. Afable, et al., 96 
Phil., 655; 51 Off. Gaz. [3] 1329; Domingo, et al. <em>vs</em>. Mayon Realty 
Corp., et al., 102 Phil., 32; 54 Off. Gaz., [17] 4954; Avecilla <em>vs</em>. 
Yatco, et al., 103 Phil., 666; 54 Off. Gaz. 6415.)</p>
<p>In this connection, it will be noted that the deceased Maximiano Blanco died 
way back in 1930 and the certificate of title pursuant to his homestead 
application was issued in the name of his heirs sometime in 1934. Plaintiffs, 
however, took no steps for the settlement of their late brother's estate, and 
instead merely took possession of the land in question jointly with Fructuosa 
Esquierdo. They also appear to have entrusted the owner's certificate to said 
Fructuosa Esquierdo thus making it possible for, her to fraudulently secure a 
transfer certificate of title in her name. This should be emphasized, for in 
several cases it is what impelled this Court to apply the principle of equity 
that "as between two innocent persons, one of whom must suffer the consequences 
of a breach of trust, the one who made it possible by his act of confidence must 
bear the loss." (De Lara et al. <em>vs</em>. Ayroso, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby modified in the sense that 
the annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6582 and the issuance of a 
new one in lieu thereof in the names of the heirs of Maximiano Blanco shall be 
without prejudice to the rights of the defendant-appellant bank as an innocent 
mortgagee for value. So ordered without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment modified.</em></p></div>
