				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In the justice of the peace court of Bocaue, Bulacan, 
plaintiffs filed on June 14, 1947 a complaint for ejectment against defendant 
Eusebio Castillo. In due time the latter interposed a written answer; and on 
July 12, 1947, he got a favorable decision. Plaintiffs appealed to the court of 
first instance. Later, <i>i.e.</i>, on September 18, 1947, they submitted to 
that court a motion asking that defendant be declared to be in default, 
because—according to the motion—he having been notified by the clerk of the 
docketing of the appeal, he neglected to file within fifteen days a written 
answer in accordance with section 1, Rule 9 and section 7, Rule 40 of the Rules 
of Court.
<p align="justify">Denial of such motion and of a subsequent motion to reconsider, 
gave rise to this appeal, which we find to be premature, the appealed order 
being interlocutory or incidental (sec. 2, Rule 41) because it leaves something 
to be done in the trial court with respect to the merits of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">The trial judge opined that the answer submitted by the 
defendant in the justice of the peace court may be considered reproduced in the 
court of first instance, and denied the motion for default. Whether erroneous or 
not, the order did not dispose of the case. The next step was the hearing; and 
if after such hearing the plaintiffs found themselves on the losing end, they 
could then appeal, and assign as error the denial of the motion for default.</p>
<p align="justify">In Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. 4, p. 252, it is stated that 
"except as it may be (specially) permitted by particular statutes, no appeal 
lies from an order refusing judgment by default". That text is supported by 
decisions from California, Ohio, Colorado, Arkansas, Iowa and Oregon. 
(<i>See</i> also notes in 1948 Cumulative Annual Pocket Part).</p>
<p align="justify">In Brockway vs. W. &amp; T. Smith Co., 66 Pac. 1073, the 
plaintiff appealed (by writ of error) to the Court of Appeals of Colorado from 
an order denying his motion to declare defendant in default. The appeal was 
dismissed, the court saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"But the cause is still pending below. While the court quashed 
the return of service, and denied the motion for a default, it entered no 
judgment against the plaintiff. All proceedings in the case stopped with the 
denial of the default. With that order, the record before us ends. Our statute 
permits the review in appellate courts of final judgments only. Sections 388, 
406, 406d, Mills' Ann. Code. Let the writ of error be dismissed. " 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In Brown vs. Sterling Fixture Co., 166 Pac. 323, it was 
held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The appeal from the courts order refusing to enter defendant's 
default requires but the briefest notice. It is not an appealable 
order."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">For the satisfaction of appellants it should be stated that 
before coursing this appeal, they applied to this Court for a writ of certiorari 
to review the order of denial of default, and that such petition, was summarily 
dismissed by a resolution saying "the proper remedy being by appeal". Apparently 
plaintiffs merely followed the course indicated in our said resolution. But it 
must be clear that we meant an appeal at the right time—not an immediate 
appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Appeal dismissed. No 
costs.</p>
