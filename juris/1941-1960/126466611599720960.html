				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Simeon Villanueva, et&nbsp; al., twenty-eight&nbsp; (28) in&nbsp; number, tenants of&nbsp; Hacienda Galvan,&nbsp; situated in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, filed&nbsp; a petition with the Court of Agrarian Relations praying for authority to choose a rice thresher to thresh their harvest during the agricultural year&nbsp; 1957-1958,&nbsp; paying&nbsp; a fee&nbsp; of&nbsp; 3½,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; charge reaping expenses at&nbsp; 10% on&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; produce making&nbsp; as respondents Serafin David, lessee of the hacienda, and Pedro David, his overseer.<br><br>Respondents opposed the petition alleging, among other things, that they had entered into&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; with one Amando&nbsp; de&nbsp; Guzman to&nbsp; thresh&nbsp; their&nbsp; palay harvest&nbsp; for the agricultural&nbsp; year 1957-1958 charging a threshing fee of 4% on condition that De Guzman shall allow the&nbsp; use of&nbsp; his tractor or&nbsp; bulldozer&nbsp; to level down the dikes&nbsp; of the hacienda and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pump water from&nbsp; the river to irrigate the land&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of drought, which contract was entered&nbsp; into with the&nbsp; conformity of petitioners, and that the reaping fee of 10%&nbsp; being claimed by petitioners is exorbitant and unreasonable.<br><br>After&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties had&nbsp; submitted a&nbsp; partial stipulation of facts&nbsp; and additional evidence in support of their contentions, the court rendered decision granting the authority requested and ordering that the reaping fee that may be&nbsp; charged&nbsp; in the liquidation of the present crop&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; 10%&nbsp; of the gross&nbsp; produce.&nbsp; Respondents interposed the present petition for&nbsp; review.<br><br>It appears that Serafin David is a lessee of Hacienda Galvan comprising the adjacent barrios of Partida, San Agustin and Escaño, Guimba, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; Pedro David is his&nbsp; overseer.&nbsp; The hacienda consists of 517&nbsp; hectares. There&nbsp; are 150 tenants working thereon, 28 of whom are the petitioners whose&nbsp; landholdings&nbsp; lie within the barrio of&nbsp; San Agustin.<br><br>Sometime in June, 1957, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; the beginning of the agricultural year 1957-1958, respondents entered into an&nbsp; agreement with Amando&nbsp; de&nbsp; Guzman whereby&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to thresh the palay&nbsp; harvest of the entire Hacienda Galvan for that&nbsp; agricultural year charging a fee of 4% on condition that he would allow the use of his tractor&nbsp; or bulldozer to level down the&nbsp; dikes of the hacienda and&nbsp; pump the water from the river to irrigate the same during&nbsp; dry&nbsp; season&nbsp; without&nbsp; any extra&nbsp; charge except the cost of crude oil&nbsp; that&nbsp; may be used and the salary of the&nbsp; operator.&nbsp; In October, 1957, the tractor of De Guzman was actually&nbsp; used to pump water to irrigate the land&nbsp; worked on&nbsp; by&nbsp; petitioners.<br><br>After&nbsp; the crop&nbsp; was harvested,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; stacked&nbsp; into <i>mandalas</i> ready to be&nbsp; threshed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; requested respondents&nbsp; on various occasions to&nbsp; have the crop threshed in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; the&nbsp; damage&nbsp; it may suffer due&nbsp; to long exposure if&nbsp; not&nbsp; immediately threshed, informing them&nbsp; at&nbsp; the same&nbsp; time that they&nbsp; have already&nbsp; selected a rice thresher who was willing to thresh the&nbsp; crop&nbsp; at the rate of 3½%&nbsp; as threshing fee, but respondents&nbsp; did not agree&nbsp; to such selection&nbsp; alleging that they had already contracted&nbsp; the services of&nbsp; De&nbsp; Guzman&nbsp; to do&nbsp; the job.&nbsp; Because&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; refusal,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; initiated&nbsp; the present proceedings.<br><br>The issues to the determined are: (1)&nbsp; Has the agrarian court acted correctly when it authorized the tenants to choose their own rice thresher charging a&nbsp; fee of 3½% under the facts obtaining in this case?; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Was its ruling that respondents should pay a reaping fee of 10% to the tenants justified? <br><br>The&nbsp; law invoked by&nbsp; the agrarian&nbsp; court&nbsp; in making its adjudication as regards the first&nbsp; issue is&nbsp; Section 36&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1199, which in part&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 36. <i>Further&nbsp; Rights of the Tenant.</i>—In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to the provision of Section twenty-two, the tenant shall have the right to: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"2. Choose&nbsp; the&nbsp; thresher&nbsp; which&nbsp; shall thresh&nbsp; the harvest whenever it is the best available in the locality and the best suited to the landholder's and tenant's needs and provided the rate charged is&nbsp; equal to or lower than&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; charged by&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of other threshers under&nbsp; similar circumstances:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, further,</span> That&nbsp; in cases where there&nbsp; are more than one tenant the selection of the majority of the tenants shall&nbsp; prevail:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,&nbsp; finally,</span> That&nbsp; if the landholder is the owner of a thresher and is ready and willing to grant equal or lower&nbsp; rates under the same conditions,&nbsp; the use of the landholder's thresher shall be&nbsp; given preference."<br></blockquote>It appears that <i>generally</i> a tenant is given the right to choose the thresher of his harvest whenever one is available in the locality who is willing to charge a rate equal or&nbsp; lower than&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate charged&nbsp; by other&nbsp; threshers under similar circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is&nbsp; more than one tenant, then the choice is given to the majority.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the landowner has a thresher of his own and is willing to&nbsp; charge&nbsp; equal or&nbsp; lower rates, he shall be given the preference.&nbsp; Here respondents do not&nbsp; have a&nbsp; thresher&nbsp; of their own. so much so&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; had to enter into a contract with Amando de Guzman to thresh the harvest in question.&nbsp; Here, also,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is more than one tenant involved as in fact petitioners are 28 in&nbsp; number.&nbsp; The question that now arises&nbsp; is:&nbsp; Do petitioners&nbsp; form&nbsp; the majority of the tenants&nbsp; to entitle them to choose their own thresher within the purview of the&nbsp; law?<br><br>Respondents contend that&nbsp; they (petitioners)&nbsp; do&nbsp; not form the majority in contemplation of law because there are&nbsp; 150 tenants working in the&nbsp; Hacienda Galvan and only 28 of them have signified their&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; make&nbsp; the choice.&nbsp; The tenants, on the other hand, sustain the contrary view contending that in barrio&nbsp; San&nbsp; Agustin where they&nbsp; are working,&nbsp; there&nbsp; are only 41 tenants&nbsp; in all&nbsp; of which 28 form the majority, and so they are&nbsp; entitled to make the choice under the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention&nbsp; of the tenants was upheld&nbsp; by the agrarian&nbsp; court,&nbsp; making on this point the following comment: "While&nbsp; it is true that&nbsp; Hacienda&nbsp; Galvan comprises the&nbsp; barrios&nbsp; of San Agustin, Partida I and Escaño, it should&nbsp; be noted that the set of&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; for each of said barrios act independently of&nbsp; each&nbsp; other as regards their&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; affairs with&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact,&nbsp; CAR&nbsp; Case No. 32-Nueva Ecija '56, a tenancy&nbsp; case which involved most of the parties to this&nbsp; case and wherein&nbsp; a reaping&nbsp; fee of 5%&nbsp; plus&nbsp; 2% for miscellaneous expenses were fixed in the amicable&nbsp; settlement of&nbsp; the parties (See&nbsp; Annex 'A'&nbsp; of Annex 'B' of petition,&nbsp; involved tenants&nbsp; only&nbsp; at San&nbsp; Agustin, Guimba, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija."<br><br>We are not inclined to agree to this ruling.&nbsp; It must be noted that Hacienda Galvan is one compact mass&nbsp; of land consisting of&nbsp; 517&nbsp; hectares which is&nbsp; owned by one person,&nbsp; Dionisio&nbsp; Galvan,&nbsp; and&nbsp; is leased to only&nbsp; one&nbsp; individual, Serafin David,&nbsp; who has only one overseer, Pedro David.&nbsp; In fact, the entire hacienda&nbsp; is under one single administration, proof of&nbsp; which is the; contract&nbsp; entered into&nbsp; by respondents with&nbsp; Amando de Guzman relative to the threshing ***the harvest of the <span style="font-style: italic;">whole </span>Hacienda charging a fee of 4% because of the&nbsp; free use of his tractor or bulldozer&nbsp; for levelling the&nbsp; dikes&nbsp; and pumping water for irrigation&nbsp; purposes.&nbsp; This&nbsp; fee&nbsp; may appear&nbsp; a little higher than what the tenants&nbsp; would like to&nbsp; pay if&nbsp; they were&nbsp; to&nbsp; have their own thresher, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; difference is offset by the free use of the bulldozer&nbsp; for the purposes above-mentioned.&nbsp; This arrangement appears to have been approved&nbsp; by all the tenants of&nbsp; the hacienda with&nbsp; the exception of&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; who form a small minority,&nbsp; and in fact De Guzman has actually used his bulldozer to irrigate the land&nbsp; during the past dry season. <br><br>It is true&nbsp; that the hacienda comprises three&nbsp; barrios, namely,&nbsp; Partida,&nbsp; San Agustin and Escaño,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that herein petitioners are&nbsp; working&nbsp; only on the portion of the hacienda comprised in&nbsp; barrio San&nbsp; Agustin,&nbsp; but the fact that the hacienda comprises three barrios does not mean that it is divided for purposes of administration, or that administration of one barrio is different from the administration&nbsp; of the other two.&nbsp; Nor can the setup be materially altered simply because there had&nbsp; been&nbsp; incidents that reached the agrarian court involving only the tenants working in the individual barrios&nbsp; for&nbsp; they&nbsp; may merely refer to questions concerning agrarian relations that affect them&nbsp; individually.&nbsp; It is therefore incorrect to say that to&nbsp; determine the majority of the tenants of Hacienda Galvan the number of the tenants working in a particular&nbsp; barrio would suffice to determine its sufficiency within&nbsp; the&nbsp; purview of&nbsp; the law.&nbsp; Consequently, we&nbsp; are persuaded to conclude&nbsp; that the tenant-petitioners cannot exercise the right of selection they are claiming to have because they&nbsp; do not form&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority in contemplation of law.<br><br>With regard to the issue of reaping fee, the agrarian court ruled that the fee that shall be paid by the landholder to the tenants&nbsp; is 10%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the gross produce,&nbsp; and not 5%&nbsp; as claimed by the landowner, for the" reason that,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; its&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; knowledge,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is&nbsp; the prevailing reaping&nbsp; fee&nbsp; in the&nbsp; province of Nueva Ecija. This ruling&nbsp; is now&nbsp; disputed because it lacks factual basis. It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; a previous case had&nbsp; between&nbsp; the tenants of&nbsp; the&nbsp; hacienda and&nbsp; the management wherein one of the issues raised was the reaping fee to be charged whenever harvest&nbsp; should&nbsp; occur, an amicable settlement was entered into between the parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effect that the reaping fee should&nbsp; be&nbsp; 5% on the&nbsp; gross&nbsp; produce, and that&nbsp; agreement has been followed not&nbsp; only&nbsp; in&nbsp; the agricultural years 1955-1956, 1956-1957, but also in&nbsp; the agricultural year&nbsp; 1957-1958 by all the tenants&nbsp; of&nbsp; the hacienda,&nbsp; with the exception&nbsp; of the 28&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; herein involved who refused to abide by the&nbsp; agreement insofar as the crop for the last agricultural year is concerned. And when&nbsp; said agreement was presented in this&nbsp; case by&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; to show the&nbsp; inconsistent stand&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tenants, the agrarian court ruled that the same has no binding effect on&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; crop without&nbsp; stating any plausible reason therefor.<br><br>We&nbsp; believe&nbsp; that this agreement&nbsp; which was approved by the agrarian court and to which some of the tenants now involved in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; were&nbsp; signatories should be given due weight more so when the tenants only presented one witness in&nbsp; support of their claim whose testimony appears to be sufficiently refuted by the evidence of&nbsp; the respondents.&nbsp; This is more so&nbsp; when it is considered that the very agrarian court stated in its decision that the claim of the&nbsp; tenants that the reaping fee should be 5 cavans per hectare is excessive.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; that this&nbsp; matter&nbsp; has already been determined in a previous case and the ruling has been followed in previous agricultural years, we find no plausible reason for&nbsp; reopening the same question there existing no special reasons or circumstances that may justify a deviation&nbsp; from&nbsp; what had been&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is reversed. Judgment is hereby rendered&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the petition of the tenants insofar as their&nbsp; request for authority&nbsp; to choose&nbsp; a thresher is concerned,&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordering that the reaping fee to&nbsp; be charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the crop year&nbsp; in&nbsp; question should&nbsp; be&nbsp; 5% on the gross produce, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
