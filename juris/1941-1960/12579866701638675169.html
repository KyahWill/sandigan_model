				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Rosalio Pancho was charged with murder before, the Court of First Instance of 
Cebu for the death of Nicolas Anero and frustrated murder for the: injuries 
inflicted on the person of Esteban Anero in separate informations. The same 
having arisen out of a single incident, the two charges were, by agreement of 
the parties, tried jointly. For the crime of murder, he was found guilty and 
sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, with the accessories of the 
law, to indemnify the heirs, of the deceased in the sum of P4,000.00, and to pay 
the costs; while for the second charge, he was found guilty of serious physical 
injuries and sentenced to suffer 8 months of <em>prision correccional</em> and 
to pay the costs. In both cases, the accused has appealed.
<p>At about 6:30 o'clock in the evening of August 19, 1956, while Nicolas Añero 
was walking along the road in the municipality of Ginatilan, Cebu, he was 
suddenly hacked by Rosalio Pancho with a sharp bolo. Having been hit on the 
right shoulder, Añero raised his hands, covered his head and ran towards the 
store of Catalino Duterte, but Pancho followed and continued hitting him with 
the bolo inflicting on him 11 wounds on the neck, breast, thigh, back, spinal 
column, forearm, and on the abdominal region, as a result of which Añero died 
instantly due to heart failure secondary to profuse hemorrhage.</p>
<p>After wounding and killing Nicolas Añero, Pancho met Esteban Añero, Nicolas' 
brother, in the store of Fabing Asion situated 20 meters away and struck him 
with the bolo on the left face causing him to fall to the.ground unconscious. 
Esteban was treated by the sanitary inspector and transferred to the Southern 
Hospital where he was released on September 9, 1956, showing permanent deformity 
on his face.</p>
<p>Rosalio Pancho admits that he was the one who inflicted the wound in the 
persons of Nicolas and Esteban Añero, but explained that the same were inflicted 
as follows: that at about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the day in question 
he was oniis way to the <em>poblacion</em> because he was called by Roberto 
Tacao to prepare a coffin for a child who died; that he carried with him a bolo 
in going to the house of Tacao; that when he was near the house of Catalino 
Duterte, Nicolas Añero, who was then holding a stone in his left hand and a 
Batangas knife in his right, approached him and all of a sudden stoned him on 
the left breast; that after throwing the stone Añero immediately stabbed him 
with the knife but he was able to parry the blow; that Añero stabbed him again, 
and it was at this juncture that he was able to pull out his bolo and hit Añero 
on the forearm; that when he was about to hack him again, Añero stooped down and 
was hit on the head; that Anero continued to stab him several times but he was 
able to parry all the blows, while he inflicted 11 wounds on Anero; that Esteban 
Añero, Nicolas' brother, who was armed with a hunting knife and a stone, also 
approached and threw a stone at him; that Esteban also stabbed him and it was 
then that he struck and wounded Esteban on the face, causing him to fall to the 
ground unconscious; that thereafter he went home; and that the motive why 
Nicolas Añero attacked him was that he refused to settle a case of physical 
injuries Añero filed against him in May, 1955 which resulted in his acquittal, 
and from that date on the Añeros harbored a grudge against him.</p>
<p>We agree with the finding that in the evening in question while Nicolas Añero 
was walking along the road in the <em>poblacion</em> of Ginatilan, Cebu, he was 
suddenly attacked by appellant and that despite the fact that Añero ran away 
with his raised hands, appellant pursued him and continued slashing him in 
different parts of his body causing his instant death, and that thereafter upon 
meeting Esteban Añero appellant also hacked him on his left face which almost 
caused his death though it left a scar which caused his deformity. And we are 
persuaded that such is the true version because it finds support not only in the 
testimony of Delfin Gravamen, who was present when Nicolas Añero was assaulted 
on the fateful evening, but also in the testimony of his brother Esteban who 
survived the attack, corroborated by the rural health nurse who performed the 
autopsy of the deceased and by Dr. Jorge Espina who treated the wound of Esteban 
Añero. The trial court found these witnesses trustworthy and deserving of 
credit.</p>
<p>The effort made by appellant to show that he inflicted the wounds on the two 
brothers in self-defense is of no avail, for if it were true that he was 
attacked by the Añeros while he was allegedly on his way to the house of Roberto 
Tacao to make a coffin for his dead child it is strange that he came out 
unscathed while the two received serious wounds which caused death to one and 
deformity to the other. Indeed, according to the autopsy performed on the body 
of Nicolas Añero, the latter received 11 wounds in different parts which do not 
jibe with the manner the same were inflicted according to the theory of the 
defense. This is more so when, according to appellant, the incident happened 
when he and the two brothers were close to each other and all were armed with 
deadly weapons. And while we may grant <em>arguendo</em> that when appellant met 
Nicolas Añero the latter immediately threw a stone at him hitting him on the 
breast and that right after the incident he went direct to the rural health 
nurse for treatment who promised to give him a certificate to attest to his 
wound, he, however, never made any attempt to obtain such a certificate, nor has 
he presented the health officer as a witness to corroborate his claim that he 
merely acted in self-defense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the nature, location and number of wounds sustained by the 
deceased tend to prove that it was appellant who really started the aggression 
in the manner testified to by Delfin Gravamen whose testimony was given credence 
by the trial court because he was found to be disinterested and without motive 
to testify falsely against him. And with regard to the claim that the two 
brothers were the ones who ambushed and attacked appellant on one single 
occasion thus implying that appellant merely acted in self-defense, the defense 
has failed to explain the vital fact that Nicolas Añero died near the store of 
Catalino Duterte while his brother Esteban fell unconscious near the store of 
Fabing Asion, the two stores being quite apart from one another, which 
unmistakably shows that they were indeed attacked in the manner proven by the 
prosecution.</p>
<p>The contention that all the elements of self-defense are here present cannot 
also be sustained, it appearing, as already shown, that the aggression did not 
come from the deceased nor from his brother but rather from appellant. As a 
matter of fact, the evidence shows that it was appellant who started the 
aggression with evident treachery when he attacked Nicolas Añero suddenly and 
without any warning.</p>
<p>The law and the evidence sustain the findings that the crime committed 
against Nicolas Añero is murder, and there being present the aggravating 
circumstance of recidivism,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> without 
any mitigating circumstance to offset it, the penalty that should be imposed is 
death. However, for lack of sufficient number of votes, he should only be 
sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p>
<p>With regard to the second crime, we also agree that the act committed is 
merely one of serious physical injuries because it does not appear clear that 
appellant attacked Esteban Añero with intention to kill him. However, the 
penalty imposed by the trial court should be modified to make it conformable to 
the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Following, therefore, the 
recommendation of the Solicitor General, appellant should be sentenced to suffer 
for the second crime an indeterminate penalty of not less than 4 months and 21 
days of <em>arresto mayor</em> and not more than 2 years 4 months and 11 days of 
<em>prision correctional</em>.</p>
<p>Wherefore, modifted as above indicated, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed in .all other respects, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed with modifications.</em></p>

integral element of the offense charged, but it may be proven at the trial, and,
