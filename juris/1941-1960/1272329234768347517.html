				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 20 September 1951, a criminal complaint charging Damaso Quedes, Nemesio Pradas,&nbsp; Victoriano&nbsp; Pradas and five other unidentified&nbsp; persons&nbsp; with robbery in band was subscribed and sworn&nbsp; to by the sergeant&nbsp; of police of tlje municipality of Ligao, province of Albay, before the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; (criminal case No.&nbsp; 438).&nbsp; As the defendants waived their right to preliminary investigation the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court forwarded the case to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance.&nbsp; On 29&nbsp; October 1951 the corresponding information charging the defendants with robbery in band was filed by the Provincial Fiscal in the Court of First Instance of Albay.&nbsp; The information reads, as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about 2:30&nbsp; o'clock in the&nbsp; morning of&nbsp; September&nbsp; 15, 1951, in the municipality&nbsp; of Ligao, province of Albay, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring together and helping one another for a common purpose and&nbsp; all armed with bolos, by&nbsp; means of violence&nbsp; and&nbsp; intimidation, did then and there willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously, take and carry away with intent&nbsp; of gain and against the will of the&nbsp; owner thereof, ten (10)&nbsp; sacks of copra&nbsp; valued at&nbsp; P200.00, belonging to Jesus Alsua,&nbsp; to his damage and prejudice&nbsp; in the said sum of P200.00, Philippine currency.&nbsp; (Criminal case No. 1070.)<br></blockquote>Upon&nbsp; arraignment the defendants entered a&nbsp; plea&nbsp; of not guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 10 January 1952&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; filed a motion to dismiss the information for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that after a&nbsp; thorough reinvestigation he&nbsp; found out that,&nbsp; with the exception of&nbsp; Damaso Quedes, the other defendants charged in the information did not take part&nbsp; in the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; and that an information for theft charging the&nbsp; real offenders including Damaso&nbsp; Quedes had been filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of Ligao, Albay. On 12 January 1952 the Court dismissed the case.<br><br>On 28&nbsp; November 1951&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chief of Police&nbsp; of Ligao, Albay filed&nbsp; a sworn complaint in the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace Court charging Silvino Mendoza, who on the day of trial had not been apprehended and is still at large, Hilario Oropesa,&nbsp; Glicerio Alferez and Jose Planviergen with&nbsp; theft of ten sacks of copra belonging to Jesus Alsua.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 20 December 1951 the compliant was amended to include&nbsp; Damaso Quedes&nbsp; as accessory&nbsp; after the fact," and&nbsp; the amendment reads, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>That the said Damaso Quedes having knowledge of the commission of the crime as alleged and described above unlawfully, illegally and feloniously, subsequently took part in&nbsp; its execution by helping in disposing of&nbsp; the fruits of the crime thereby assisting the said Silvino Mendoza, Hilario Oropesa, Glicerio Alferez and Jose&nbsp; Planviergen to&nbsp; profit By the effects of&nbsp; the above described crime and to prevent&nbsp; its discovery.&nbsp; (Criminal Case No. 451.)<br></blockquote>The defendant&nbsp; Damaso&nbsp; Quedes filed a motion to quash on the ground that he had been put once&nbsp; in jeopardy of punishment for&nbsp; the same&nbsp; offense.&nbsp; Motion to quash was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 29&nbsp; December 1951,&nbsp; after&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace Court found Hilario Oropesa guilty&nbsp; of theft as principal; Damaso Quedes guilty of theft as accessory after&nbsp; the fact and sentenced him&nbsp; to&nbsp; suffer 2 months and 1 day of&nbsp; <i>arresto mayor,</i> to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P121.20, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of&nbsp; insolvency, and to pay 2/5 of the costs; and dismissed the case against Jose Planviergen and Glicerio Alferez.&nbsp; The defendant Damaso Quedes appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Albay.&nbsp; On 15 January&nbsp; 1953 the Assistant Provincial Fiscal filed an information charging Damaso Quedes with theft&nbsp; as accessory after the fact. The information reads:<br><blockquote>That on&nbsp; or about the&nbsp; 15th day of September, 1951,&nbsp; in the municipality of Ligao, province of Albay,&nbsp; Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused,&nbsp; having full knowledge&nbsp; of the commission of the crime of theft of ten&nbsp; sacks of copra&nbsp; from&nbsp; the hacienda&nbsp; of Jesus Alsua by Silvino Mendoza who&nbsp; is still&nbsp; at&nbsp; large,&nbsp; Hilario&nbsp; Oropeza&nbsp; who had been convicted in the lower court but did not appeal, Glicerio Alferez and Jose Planviergen whose case against them was dismissed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; without having participated therein either as principal or accomplice, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take part&nbsp; in said crime after the commission thereof, to wit: by then and there buying from the aforementioned&nbsp; persons&nbsp; the stolen ten&nbsp; sacks of copra which amount to ONE HUNDRED TWENTY&nbsp; ONE PESOS&nbsp; AND TWENTY CENTAVOS (P121.20), Philippine Currency, thereby profiting himself and assisting the offenders to profit by the effects of the said crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Criminal case No. 1276.)<br></blockquote>The defendant filed a motion to quash the information on the ground that he was being put twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.&nbsp; On 12 January 1955 the Court dismissed the case&nbsp; against the defendant&nbsp; with costs <i>de oficio.</i>&nbsp; The State has appealed.<br><br>The first information charging the defendant and seven others with robbery in band&nbsp; alleges that "conspiring together and helping one another for a common purpose and all armed with bolos, by means of violence and intimidation,&nbsp; (they)&nbsp; did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, take and carry away with intent of gain and against&nbsp; the will of the owner thereof, ten&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; sacks of copra&nbsp; valued&nbsp; at P200.00 belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; Jesus Alsua."&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other hand, the second information&nbsp; charging the defendant with&nbsp; theft as accessory after the fact recites that "having full knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the commission of the crime of theft of ten sacks of copra from the hacienda of Jesus Alsua" he "did then and there&nbsp; willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take part in said&nbsp; crime after the commission thereof,&nbsp; to wit: by then and there buying from the aforementioned persons the stolen&nbsp; ten sacks of&nbsp; copra* * *." The first information charges&nbsp; the defendant with&nbsp; taking and&nbsp; carrying away unlawfully by means of violence and intimidation ten sacks of copra; whereas the&nbsp; second information charges the defendant with&nbsp; taking part in the crime&nbsp; after the commission thereof by then&nbsp; and there buying the ten sacks of copra /rom the persons who he knew had stolen the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence necessary to support a conviction for robbery in band is different from that which&nbsp; is required to sustain a conviction&nbsp; for theft as accessory after&nbsp; the fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first information the defendant Damaso Quedes&nbsp; could not have been convicted as&nbsp; accessory after the fact of robbery in&nbsp; band, because the defendants&nbsp; charged with having&nbsp; committed&nbsp; it did not in fact commit the crime.&nbsp; Evidence to&nbsp; show his part&nbsp; in the crime after the&nbsp; commission thereof would have&nbsp; no support, because the persons who committed the crime and from whom he bought&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of copra knowingly that it was robbed or&nbsp; stolen were not brought to court&nbsp; charged with the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp; Timely objection&nbsp; on proper ground&nbsp; to&nbsp; the introduction of evidence tending to show that he purchased the ten sacks of copra from persons other than his co-defendants would&nbsp; be sustained. Hence the defendant Damaso Quedes was not placed nor could he be deemed to have been put in danger of being convicted of the crime of robbery in band either as principal or as accessory after the fact under the first information.<br><br>The order&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; case remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accord with&nbsp; law.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.

Victorio&nbsp; Jabajab, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; on a question of jeopardy based practically on similar facts.&nbsp; In the case at bar,&nbsp; however, the defense of jeopardy is predicated on two counts.<br><br>The facts of the case, as correctly narrated in the majority decision, are as follows:<br><blockquote>"On 20 September 1951, a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; complaint charging Damaso Quedes, Nemesio Pradas, Victoriano Pradas and five other unidentified persons with robbery in&nbsp; band was subscribed and sworn to by the sergeant of police of the municipality of Ligao, province of&nbsp; Albay, before the&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace Court of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said municipality (criminal case No.&nbsp; 438).&nbsp; As&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants waived&nbsp; their right to preliminary investigation the&nbsp; Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Court forwarded the case to the&nbsp; Court of First Instance.&nbsp; On 29 October 1951&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding information charging the defendants with robbery in&nbsp; band was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Albay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The information reads, as follows:<br><br>"That&nbsp; on or&nbsp; about&nbsp; 2:30&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; in the morning&nbsp; of September 15, 1951,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; municipality of Ligao, province of Albay,&nbsp; Philippines, and&nbsp; within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the said accused,&nbsp; conspiring&nbsp; together and helping one another for a common&nbsp; purpose and&nbsp; all armed with bolos,&nbsp; by means of violence and&nbsp; intimidation, did&nbsp; then and&nbsp; there&nbsp; willfully, unlawfully and feloniously,&nbsp; take&nbsp; and carry away with intent of gain and&nbsp; against the&nbsp; will of the&nbsp; owner thereof, ten&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of&nbsp; copra&nbsp; valued at P200.00,&nbsp; belonging to Jesus Alsua, to his&nbsp; damage&nbsp; and prejudice in the said sum&nbsp; of P200.00, Philippine&nbsp; currency.&nbsp; (Criminal&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 1070).<br><br>Upon&nbsp; arraignment the <span style="font-style: italic;">defendants&nbsp; entered a&nbsp; plea&nbsp; of not&nbsp; guilty.</span> On 10 January 1952 the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal filed a motion to dismiss the information for the reason that&nbsp; after a thorough reinvestigation he found&nbsp; out that, <span style="font-style: italic;">with the exception of Damaso Quedes,</span> the other defendants&nbsp; charged&nbsp; in the&nbsp; information did&nbsp; not&nbsp; take part&nbsp; in&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of the crime and that&nbsp; an information for theft charging the real&nbsp; offenders including Damaso Quedes&nbsp; had been&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Justice of the Peace Court of Ligao,&nbsp; Albay.&nbsp; On' 12 January 1952 the Court dismissed the&nbsp; case.<br><br>"On 28 November 1951 the Chief of Police of Ligao, Albay filed a sworn&nbsp; complaint in&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace Court charging Silvino Mendoza, who on the&nbsp; day of trial had&nbsp; not been apprehended and&nbsp; is still at large, Hilario Oropesa, Glicerio Alferez and Jose Planviergen, with theft of ten sacks of&nbsp; copra belonging to Jesus&nbsp; Alsua. On 20 December 1951 the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; was amended to&nbsp; include Damaso Quedes as accessory after the&nbsp; fact, and the amendment reads, as follows:<br><br>"That&nbsp; the said Damaso&nbsp; Quedes&nbsp; having knowledge of the commission of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; as alleged&nbsp; and described&nbsp; above&nbsp; unlawfully, illegally&nbsp; and&nbsp; feloniously, subsequently took&nbsp; part&nbsp; in&nbsp; its execution by helping in&nbsp; disposing of the fruits of the crime&nbsp; thereby assisting the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Silvino&nbsp; Mendoza,&nbsp; Hilario&nbsp; Oropesa,&nbsp; Glicerio Alferflfc and Jose&nbsp; Planviergen to&nbsp; profit by the&nbsp; effects of the above described crime and to prevent&nbsp; its discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Criminal case No. 451.)<br><br>"The defendant Damaso Quedes&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion to quash&nbsp; on the ground that he had been put once in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.&nbsp; Motion to quash was denied. On 29 December 1951, after trial, the Justice of the Peace Court found Hilario Oropesa guilty of theft as principal; Damaso Quedes guilty of theft as accessory after the fact and sentenced him to suffer 2 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P121.20, with&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment in case of insolvency,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay 2/5 of the costs; and dismissed the case against Jose Planviergen and&nbsp; Glicerio Alferez.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; Damaso&nbsp; Quedes appealed to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Alhay.&nbsp; On 15 January 1953 the Assistant Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal filed an information charging Damaso Quedes&nbsp; with theft as accessory after the fact.&nbsp; The information reads:<br><br>"That on or about the 15th day of September, 1951, in the municipality of Ligao,&nbsp; province of Albay,&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; and within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of ths Honorable&nbsp; Court, the said&nbsp; accused, having full knowledge of&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of theft of ten sacks of copra from the hacienda of Jesus Alsua by Silvino Mendoza who is still&nbsp; at&nbsp; large, Hilario&nbsp; Oropesa who had been&nbsp; convicted in the lower court but did not appeal, Glicerio Alferez and Jose Planviergen whose case against them was&nbsp; dismissed, and without having participated&nbsp; therein&nbsp; either as&nbsp; principal or accomplice, did&nbsp; then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take part in&nbsp; said crime after the commission thereof, to wit: by then and&nbsp; there&nbsp; buying from the aforementioned persons the stolen&nbsp; ten sacks&nbsp; of copra which amount to ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PESOS AND TWENTY&nbsp; CENTAVOS&nbsp; (P121.20), Philippine Currency, thereby profiting himself and assisting the offenders to profit by&nbsp; the effects of the said crime.&nbsp; (Criminal case No. 1276).<br><br>"The defendant&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion to quash&nbsp; the&nbsp; information on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; being put&nbsp; twice&nbsp; in&nbsp; jeopardy of punishment for the&nbsp; same&nbsp; offense.&nbsp; On 12 January 1955&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dismissed the case against the defendant with costs <i>de oficio.</i>&nbsp; The State has appealed."<br></blockquote>Acting&nbsp; on this matter, the majority&nbsp; of this Court reversed&nbsp; the order appealed from and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law, for the reason that in&nbsp; the information for&nbsp; robbery, Damaso Quedes was charged as<i> principal of robbery in band,</i> for having conspired with his named&nbsp; co-defendants who had not participated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; commission of said offense, while in the second information, he was charged as accessory after the theft for having bought the same sacks of copra involved in the first case from&nbsp; persons who had really stolen said copra on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same date, September 15, 1951, from the same owner Jesus Alsua. I cannot agree with such&nbsp; decision of the majority of this Court.<br><blockquote><i>First count.</i>—The Rules of Court&nbsp; provide the following; "SEC. 9. <i>Former Conviction or Acquittal or&nbsp; Former&nbsp; Jeopardy.—</i> When a defendant shall have been&nbsp; convicted or acquitted, or <i>the case&nbsp; against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent&nbsp; of the defendant,</i> by&nbsp; a&nbsp; court&nbsp; of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to sustain&nbsp; a conviction, and after the defendant had pleaded to the charge,&nbsp; the conviction&nbsp; or acquittal of the defendant or <i>the dismissal of&nbsp; the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense&nbsp; charge,</i> or for any attempt to commit the&nbsp; same or frustration thereof,&nbsp; <i>or for any&nbsp; offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or information".</i>&nbsp; (Rule 113).<br></blockquote>The crime for which Damaso Quedes was charged in the informations filed in both&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; were allegedly committed&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; day—September 15,&nbsp; 1951—in&nbsp; the municipality of Ligao, province of Albay, and referred to the taking of&nbsp; the same property&nbsp; of 10 sacks&nbsp; of copra belonging to the same owner—Jesus Alsua.<br><br>It goes without&nbsp; saying—and there&nbsp; can be no question about it—that the crime of robbery<i> includes</i>&nbsp; the crime of theft, either consummated, frustrated&nbsp; or attempted, and this is so common that it comes within the realm of judicial knowledge, that many persons who had been accused of robbery in court have been&nbsp; finally sentenced for theft, in any of its various&nbsp; degrees&nbsp; of development when.the evidence produced at the hearing showed that the&nbsp; defendant was guilty of the lesser offense.&nbsp; The majority argues, however,&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; first information Damaso&nbsp; Quedes was accused as principal when he was&nbsp; merely an accessory after the crime, and that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had robbed&nbsp; said copra in conspiracy with his co-accused therein who&nbsp; had not committed the crime of robbery or theft of said .property and, therefore, that he could not. be convicted of the crime he really committed, that is, accessory after the theft.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; obviously untenable,&nbsp; because&nbsp; under the Revised Penal Code in&nbsp; order to establish one's guilt of being an accessory after a theft, it is enough that it be proven that the offender, **having knowledge&nbsp; of the&nbsp; commission of the&nbsp; crime, and&nbsp; without having&nbsp; participated&nbsp; therein either as principal or accomplice,&nbsp; <i>take&nbsp; part Subsequent to its commission by profiting himself</i>&nbsp; or assisting the offenders&nbsp; (whoever they may be) to profit by the effect of the crime" (Art. 19, No.&nbsp; 1, R. P. C).&nbsp; Under this article it is&nbsp; not essential&nbsp; that Quedes would have assisted his co-accused&nbsp; in&nbsp; the first information to&nbsp; profit by the effect of the crime if he had profited himself by the purchase of said copra.&nbsp; And that is precisely&nbsp; what happened in the case at bar, because&nbsp; Damaso&nbsp; Quedes knew that said 10 sacks of copra had been stolen from Jesus Alsua and&nbsp; by whom&nbsp; (though there&nbsp; was error in&nbsp; the&nbsp; designation of&nbsp; the culprits made in the&nbsp; first infromation), and yet, and&nbsp; despite&nbsp; said knowledge he bought the same with intent to&nbsp; gain. <br><br>For the purpose of determining the existence of jeopardy, the fact that the evidence&nbsp; necessary to support a conviction&nbsp; for robbery in band&nbsp; might be different&nbsp; from that required&nbsp; to sustain&nbsp; a conviction as accessory after the&nbsp; theft is entirely immaterial IF the higher offense for which&nbsp; Quedes was charged with<i> included</i> the offense actually committed&nbsp; by him.&nbsp; The Court of First Instance of Albay&nbsp; having acquired jurisdiction over said case of robbery, it could have rendered judgment therein not only for robbery but&nbsp; for whatever&nbsp; other&nbsp; lesser offense included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; charge of robbery, such as accessory after the theft if the evidence produced at the hearing&nbsp; before the Justice of the Peace of Ligao, would have been presented in the case of robbery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, when the Fiscal of Albay <i>moved</i> for the dismissal&nbsp; of said robbery case and when the Judge of First Instance of said province <i>granted</i> said motion, <i>despite the manifestation of the former ,that after a re-investigation of the case it was found out that the accused, except Damaso Quedes, were not guilty of the crime charged therein,</i> they placed said Damaso Quedes in jeopardy and barred him&nbsp; from being&nbsp; prosecuted anew&nbsp; for&nbsp; the same offense or for any. other included in the same (Section 9, Rule 113&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Rules of Court).&nbsp; In&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of these reasons I maintain that the error committed by the Provincial Fiscal in moving for the dismissal of the robbery case&nbsp; against all&nbsp; the accused including Damaso Quedes, and by the lower court in granting that motion can&nbsp; not redound to the damage and prejudice&nbsp; of this defendant, for&nbsp; it would be&nbsp; in open disregard of his constitutional rights.<br><br><i>Second count</i>.—But this is not&nbsp; all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The record shows that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of the Peace of Ligao had jurisdiction to&nbsp; entertain the&nbsp; second&nbsp; case where&nbsp; defendant Damaso Quedes was charged with being an accessory, to the crime of theft, and pass judgment thereon.&nbsp; As a matter&nbsp; of fact said Court, after proper proceedings, found Damaso&nbsp; Quedes guilty of said offense and sentenced him to suffer 2 months and 1 day of&nbsp; <i>arresto mayor,</i> to&nbsp; indemnify the offended party in&nbsp; the sum of F121.20, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 2/5 of the costs. Quedes appealed&nbsp; from this verdict to the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Albay where the case was&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp; The question&nbsp; of&nbsp; jeopardy based on the facts on which this second count is predicated is not touched or considered at all in&nbsp; the decision of the majority.&nbsp; In my&nbsp; dissenting opinion in the case of&nbsp; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Jabajab,<i> supra, </i> I have already stated, <i>mutatis&nbsp; mutandis,</i> the following:<br><br>Under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 28 of the Code of Criminal&nbsp; Procedure (now section 9, Rule 113 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court), a defendant is in legal jeopardy&nbsp; when placed on trial under the&nbsp; following&nbsp; conditions:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; in&nbsp; a court of&nbsp; competent jurisdiction; (2)&nbsp; upon&nbsp; a valid complaint or information; (3)&nbsp; after he has been arraigned; and (4) after&nbsp; he&nbsp; has pleaded to the information.&nbsp; This&nbsp; overrules the&nbsp; case of United States<i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Ballentine (5 Phil. 672) which required the investigation of the charges by the calling of a witness in&nbsp; order that&nbsp; a&nbsp; legal jeopardy&nbsp; may&nbsp; attach.&nbsp; The mere calling of a witness would not&nbsp; add a particle to the danger, annoyance and vexation suffered by the accused, after going through&nbsp; the process of being arrested, subjected to a&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; arraigned,&nbsp; and&nbsp; required to plead and stand trial.<br><br>"Without the consent of the accused" used in section 28 of the Code of Criminal&nbsp; Procedure does not mean "over the objection of the accused" or&nbsp; "against the will of the accused."&nbsp;&nbsp; The.sound rule is, that the mere silence of the defendant or his failure to object to the dismissal of the case&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; constitute a&nbsp; consent within the&nbsp; meaning of .said section.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; right not to be&nbsp; put in jeopardy a&nbsp; second time for the same offense is&nbsp; as important as the other constitutional rights of the accused in a criminal case.&nbsp; Its waiver&nbsp; cannot,&nbsp; and&nbsp; should not,&nbsp; be predicated on mere silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ylagan, 58&nbsp; Phil. 851).<br><br>That is the reason why in the case of People <i>vs.</i> Daylo, 54 Phil. 862, this&nbsp; Court held that:<br><blockquote>"This dismissal of&nbsp; a criminal case of <i>estafa,</i> which has been appealed from a Justice of the Peace to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance, the former being vested with jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; try and&nbsp; decide, is equivalent to&nbsp; an&nbsp; acquittal of the defendant&nbsp; in said case, <span style="font-style: italic;">and the filing: of a new information, in which the&nbsp; case dismissed is included,</span> exposes said defendant to&nbsp; a second conviction of one and&nbsp; the same offense,&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore constitutes double jeopardy."<br></blockquote>In the case of People <i>vs.</i> Fajardo, 49 Phil. 206, the same principle was upheld:<br><blockquote>"The justice of the peace having, as&nbsp; he had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint tor <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; filed in the case, the trial court committed an error of law in holding that&nbsp; it had no jurisdiction to try the case on appeal; but&nbsp; its judgment, however,&nbsp; in dismissing the case&nbsp; and releasing the accused is&nbsp; unappealable for the reason that he was already&nbsp; in jeopardy,&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore the&nbsp; motion for dismissal must be granted."<br></blockquote>The case&nbsp; at bar falls squarely by all fours within the scope outlined in our jurisprudence defining double jeopardy.&nbsp; With respect to this second count, we see that the defendant was&nbsp; (1) prosecuted&nbsp; in a court&nbsp; of&nbsp; competent jurisdiction; (2) upon a valid complaint or information; (3)&nbsp; after he had been arraigned and after he had pleaded to the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, he&nbsp; has been convicted in the Justice of the Peace Court of&nbsp; Ligao.&nbsp; It m true that he has appealed from the decisions of the Inferior Court to the Court of First Instance and that in&nbsp; virtue of his appeal the decision of the Court <i>a quo</i> was vacated, but this effect provided for in the law cannot produce at the same time and by the same stroke the wiping&nbsp; out of the vivid facts&nbsp; of defendant's prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint and&nbsp; of his arraignment and conviction therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; only effect of defendant's appeal in said case was merely to make 'the proceedings in the court <i>ad quern</i> a continuation and extension of the proceedings in the court <i>a quo.</i>&nbsp; But when for whatever reason,&nbsp; rightly or wrongly, the case on appeal is dismissed, either&nbsp; before or after&nbsp; defendant's arraignment in the appellate&nbsp; court,&nbsp; such dismissal becomes final&nbsp; and unappealable by the State, because it is up to that moment that the defendant has been placed in jeopardy,&nbsp; and&nbsp; no&nbsp; other charges, could be later&nbsp; preferred against him, for the.same offense, for it would be tantamount and equivalent to placing the defendant in <i>double</i> jeopardy.<br><br>In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Martinez, 55 Phil. 6&nbsp; this Court held that:<br><blockquote>"The test for&nbsp; determining&nbsp; whether or not prosecution for one crime constitutes&nbsp; an obstacle to a subsequent action for&nbsp; another distinct crime upon the same&nbsp; facts, is to inquire whether the facts alleged in the subsequent information,&nbsp; if proven,&nbsp; would have acquitted or convicted. The test of the question is whether or not the same evidence supports the 2 actions. If it does, the trial and conviction in the former action would&nbsp; constitute double&nbsp; jeopardy in the latter case."<br></blockquote>We see, therefore', that the case at bar was finished after the conditions required in the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

No. L-1567 promulgated on October 13,&nbsp; 1949, with Chief Justice Paras and associate Justices&nbsp; Bengzbn and Montemayor dissenting.&nbsp;&nbsp; In said case of Bangalao&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court, through&nbsp; Mr. Justice Labrador, dismissed a similar appeal on the part of the Government stating the following:<br><blockquote>"We&nbsp; are therefore, . constrained&nbsp; to&nbsp; hold that His Honor committed an error in holding that the court had no jurisdiction, simply because it charges the accused with&nbsp; having committed the crime on a demented girl, instead of through the use of force and intimidation. However, <i>we» find the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants-appellees that the appeal can not prosper because it puts them in double jeopardy,. must be sustained.</i>&nbsp; .Under section 2, Rule 118 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, the people of the Philippines&nbsp; can not&nbsp; appeal if the accused or defendant is&nbsp; placed thereby in double jeopardy.&nbsp; As the court&nbsp; below had jurisdiction to try the case upon the filing of the complaint by the mother of the offended party, the defendants-appellees would be placed in double jeopardy if the appeal&nbsp; is allowed."<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center></blockquote>As contended by the majority of&nbsp; tins&nbsp; court, the trial Judge might have&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; dismissing the&nbsp; case against Damaso Quedes, but his error does not wipe out the fact that the defendant has already been placed once in jeopardy, and such being the case, We cannot, much against our wish, deprive the defendant of his constitutional right of not being placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense.<br><br>Wherefore, and on the strenght of the&nbsp; foregoing considerations, I am of the opinion and&nbsp; so hold that the present appeal of the Government must be dismissed without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C, J.,</i> concurs.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> Supra,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 307<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 94 Phil., 364.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 84 Phil., 722. <br></div>
