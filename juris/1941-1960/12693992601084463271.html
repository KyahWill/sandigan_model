				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On June 22, 1942, Jesusa Barrioso executed a deed of sale of 
two lots or parcels of land described in transfer certificates of title Nos. 175 
and 176 of the Province of Iloilo, together with the improvements thereon, in 
favor of Emilio Garcia in consideration of the sum of P10,000 which the vendor 
acknowledged to have received from the vendee. The deed was signed and 
acknowledged before three instrumental witnesses but was not authenticated by a 
notary public, it being stated therein that in view of the then existing war 
conditions when there was no notary public duly authorized in the town of 
Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, the vendor promised to subscribe to any other document 
that may be necessary as soon as normal conditions returned, to enable the 
vendee to secure the transfer of the certificates of title in his name, and in 
case she, the vendor, did not survive, she enjoined her heirs and successors in 
interest to ratify and confirm the document in due form and have it 
registered.
<p align="justify">The vendor Jesusa Barrioso died without having ratified the 
said deed of sale before a notary public. On October 25, 1945, the vendee Emilio 
Garcia presented the deed of sale to the Register of Deeds of Iloilo with the 
request that transfer certificates of title Nos. 175 and 176 be cancelled and 
new ones issued in his name. That request was denied by the register of deeds on 
the ground that the deed of sale had not been ratified before a notary public, hereupon the purchaser Emilio Garcia filed a petition in the cadastral case 
wherein the said certificates of title had been issued, praying that the 
Register of Deeds of Iloilo be ordered to register the deed of sale Exhibit A on 
transfer certificates of title Nos. 175 and 176, to cancel said certificates of 
title and issue new ones in his name.</p>
<p align="justify">To that motion Mercedes J. de Belzunce, administratrix of the 
estate of Jesusa Barrioso, and the heirs of the latter filed oppositions on the 
following grounds: (1) That the Court of First Instance of Iloilo as a cadastral 
court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of said petition; (2) that the deed 
of sale Exhibit A, being a mere private document, cannot transfer real rights; 
that the proper remedy for the purchaser, had Jesusa Barrioso not died, would 
have been an ordinary action to compel her to execute the deed of sale in due 
form as required by law and not a mere petition in the cadastral case; and (3) 
that the execution of said deed of sale by Jesusa Barrioso was tainted with 
fraud, undue influence and false representations, if not force and violence on 
the person of Jesusa Barrioso; and that the supposed transaction was not 
supported by a valid consideration, Jesusa Barrioso not having received the 
price mentioned in the deed of sale.</p>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from denies the petition of Emilio Garcia, 
"without prejudice to such other proper remedy or remedies as may be available 
to him under the law with respect to the deed of sale in question."</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the opposition to appellant's petition filed in the 
cadastral proceedings, whereby the intrinsic validity of the private deed of 
sale sought to be registered is impugned or put in issue, we think the lower 
court did not err in denying said petition without prejudice to a proper action 
wherein the issue can be litigated and determined. The remedy provided in 
section 112 of Act 496 is summary and not adequate for the litigation of issues 
pertaining to an ordinary civil action. We have so decided in Irineo Castillo 
vs. Hon. Anacleto B. Ramos et al., G.R. No. L-1031, promulgated July 31, 1947 
(78 Phil., 809) </p>
<p align="justify">In that case the petitioners were the registered owners of 
certain cadastral lots, covered by a certificate of title, which they mortgaged 
to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank in 1940. During the Japanese occupation 
they paid the loan secured by said mortgage as shown by a receipt issued by the 
bank in favor of the petitioners, but due to the condition of things then 
prevailing the bank could not execute the proper deed of release or cancellation 
of the mortgage. The petitioners prayed the cadastral court to declare said 
mortgage cancelled and of no force and effect, and that the bank be ordered to 
return to the petitioners the owner's duplicate of the original certificate of 
title of the mortgaged property. The bank opposed the petition alleging that the 
payment of the mortgage during the war in Japanese military notes was not valid. 
Judge Anacleto B. Ramos acting as cadastral judge denied the petition on the 
ground that he had no jurisdiction to order within the cadastral case what was 
sought by the petitioners "because the question involved in their petition 
should rather be the subject of an ordinary case to compel the Agricultural and 
Industrial Bank to execute a deed of release of the above-mentioned mortgage." 
This Court denied the petition for mandamus to compel Judge Ramos to grant the 
relief prayed for and sustained the order of the respondent judge denying said 
Petition. Citing the case of The Bank of the Philippine Islands vs. Ty Camco, 57 
Phil. 801, wherein this Court said that land registration proceedings are as 
separate and distinct from ordinary civil actions as are the latter from 
criminal actions, we held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If there is such a clear separation and distinction between 
land registration proceedings and ordinary civil actions, what properly pertains 
to the general jurisdiction of the courts in ordinary civil actions should not 
be brought to them as courts of land registration with the limited and special 
jurisdiction characteristic of such courts. When our land registration laws were 
enacted our Courts of First Instance already possessed jurisdiction over cases 
such as that which has arisen between the parties herein respecting the validity 
of an alleged payment by a debtor of his debt to his creditor. Specifically, if 
a case of the nature of the one now existing between the instant litigants had 
arisen just before the enactment of Act No. 496, there could be no doubt that it 
would have come under the original jurisdiction of the proper Court of First 
Instance. And there is absolutely nothing in said Act nor in the subsequent ones 
amending or supplementing the same to divest such court of that original 
jurisdiction in order to transfer it to the Court of Land Registration 
established by said Act No. 496, later to the Court of First Instance acting as 
such court by virtue of the provisions of section 10 of Act No. 2347.</p>
<p align="justify">"We are clearly of opinion that the respondent court rightly 
refused to grant the aforesaid petition within the cadastral proceeding.</p>
<p align="justify">"However, where a petition concerning the cancellation of any 
encumbrance noted on a Torrens certificate of title is filed within the record 
of the land registration case in which the basic decree was entered and there is 
no substantial controversy in regard thereto between the petitioner and any 
other interested party, such petition may be considered as a mere incidental 
matter in such land registration case and may therein be acted upon by the 
proper court."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</p> MORAN, C. J.:<p></p>
<p align="justify">Mr. Justice Bengzon voted for affirmance. </p></div>
