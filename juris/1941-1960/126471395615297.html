				G.R. No. L-7746, May 23, 1956</h4>
				<H3>FRANCISCO PULUTAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. HONORABLE TOMAS DIZON, AS MAYOR, THE MUNICIPAL BOARD, CITY OF  SAN  PABLO,  AND  SIMON  MAGPANTAY,  CITY TREASURER OF SAN  PABLO CITY,  RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>JUGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner Francisco  Pulutan is the incumbent Detective Second Lieutenant of the Secret Service Unit of the San Pablo Police Department of the Province of Laguna with a compensation of P1,680  per  annum.  He  is duly qualified civil service eligible.</p>
<p>On January 11, 1954, respondent mayor  Tomas Dizon of San  Pablo City, Laguna,  addressed  a letter to the petitioner, requesting him to resign voluntarily from the service.   The  petitioner answered  on January  12,  1954, in a letter in  which  he stated the reasons why he  could not resign. </p>
<p>On January 14, 1954, the Municipal  Board of the City of  San  Pablo passed  and approved Resolution No. 19, current series, abolishing the position of Detective Second Lieutenant held  by the petitioner in order to economize, and also  on account of the alleged unbecoming record of Pulutan  which,  consisted  of  an act for which he had already been punished  with a  30-day suspension without pay, which he had suffered.</p>
<p>It is evident that the mayor could not legally  remove the petitioner  without  cause, for being a member of the Civil Service,  his tenure of office  is protected by  Section 4, Article XII of the Constitution, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No officer or  employee in the Civil Service shall  be removed or suspended  except for  cause as provided  by  law".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Committee on Civil Service  of  the Constitutional Convention,  in recommending said provision, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * The merit system will the ineffective if no  safeguards are placed around the  separation  and removal  of  public employees. The Committee's report requires that removal shall be made only for  'cause' and in  the manner provided by law. This means that there should be  bona  fide  reasons and action may  be  taken only after the  employee shall have been given a fair  hearing.  This affords to public  employees  reasonable security of tenure."  (Aruego, The Framing of the Philippine Constitution, 1949 ed., p. 567)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  should be  considered, in  this connection that  the petitioner had already been punished for his irregular act, and had  suffered  said punishment.  There appears no reason why  he should  be punished  again.  Consequently, the abolition of  his  position  on  account of  said act is unjustified.</p>
<p>The abolition of  positions in the municipal police  force for reasons of economy, which results in the separation of incumbents may  be effected by complying with the provisions of the Provincial Circular of April 3,  1954, which says  that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * II (<em>d</em>) Separations  through  abolition  of  positions.â€”The local legislative bodies have authority to abolish, for lack of funds and other valid grounds, positions which they  are  authorized by law  to  merge or  abolish including  those  created  by ordinance. Abolition of positions duly made necessarily results in the  separation of the incumbents.  However,'in order to safeguard the tenure of officials  and employees who are civil service eligibles  and to prevent injustices to employees whose positions are abolished or suppressed  for personal  motives,  Executive Order No.  506, series of 1934, requires  that no reduction of personnel may  be  effected without the previous approval of  the Department Head concerned. With  respect to the local  police forces and provincial guard organizations, paragraph 18 of Executive Order No.  175, series of 1938, provided that  no  position therein shall be abolished without the approval of the President of the Philippines.  Abolitions of positions  consummated in violation of the requirements of said executive orders  shall have no force and effect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  appears that neither the Department Head nor  His Excellency, the  President of the  Philippines, has approved the  suppression  or  abolition  of  the position  of the petitioner,</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision  of  the Court of First Instance  of Laguna is hereby  reversed,  and  the respondents are ordered to reinstate petitioner  Francisco Pulutan in the  office  of Detective Second Lieutenant,  and to pay him the salary at the rate of P1,680 per  annum, which  he  failed to receive during the  period  of  his removal,  with  costs against  the  respondents.   It  is  so ordered.</p>
