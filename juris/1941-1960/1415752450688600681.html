				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CESAR LUNETA ET AL., DEFENDANTS. CESAR LUNETA, APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of
 Capiz finding the appellant, Cesar Luneta, guilty of robbery with rape,
 and sentencing him to an indeterminate prison term ranging from 8 years
 and 1 day to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day, to indemnify the offended 
spouses, Leon Gonzales and Segunda Fuentes, in the sum of P375, with the
 accessories of the law, and to pay one-half of the costs.
  <p> At about three o'clock in the afternoon of January 5, 1946, while 
Leon Gonzales and his wife Segunda Fuentes were walking along an 
uninhabited place in the sitio of Mahayag, barrio of Malocloc, 
municipality of Ivisan, Province of Capiz, they were stopped by the 
appellant and one Dominador who is still at large. The appellant and his
 companion were both armed with revolvers and represented themselves as 
MP soldiers. Leon Gonzales was asked whether he was an army man to which
 he answered in the negative, whereupon appellant's companion gave him a
 fist blow on the stomach and another blow with his revolver. In the 
meantime the appellant was an onlooker with his revolver pointed at the 
spouses. Dominador ordered Leon and his wife to take off their clothes, a
 command which was obeyed. Dominador thereupon asked the appellant to 
take away and kill Leon Gonzales, and after the two had gone, Dominador,
 by means of force, succeeded in having carnal intercourse with Segunda 
Fuentes. Leon Gonzales, however, was able to escape from the appellant 
who then returned to the place where Dominador and Segunda Fuentes were.
 Upon learning that Leon Gonzales had fled, Dominador went to look for 
him, whereupon the appellant, left alone with Segunda Fuentes, and also 
by means of force, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with the 
woman. The appellant and Dominador thereafter left the scene, carrying 
with them the clothes of Leon Gonzales and Segunda Fuentes and several 
other articles having a total value of P375. The spouses did not meet 
each other again until the next day and, in their scanty clothes, they 
proceeded to the municipality of Ivisan and reported the incident to the
 chief of police. Accompanied by the latter and two policemen, the 
spouses went around in the hope of meeting their assailants. The search 
proved to be successful, as they were able to recognize the appellant in
 the house of a lady doctor. Thus identified, the chief of police 
arrested and investigated him. Appellant's defense consisted of a denial
 and of the allegation that he was on the day in question in the house 
of his relative in the municipality of Ivisan.
  </p><p> We have no hesitancy in concluding that the appellant 
committed the offense for which he was sentenced in the appealed 
judgment. The promptness with which the offended spouses reported the 
incident to the authorities, and the short interval between the time of 
the commission of the offense and the time when said spouses identified 
the appellant, readily lead us to the belief that they were not 
concocting an imaginary story. They would not, to say the least, 
complain of acts that would bring disgrace on their honor, and 
considering the facts that the offense was committed in full daylight 
and that the outrage lasted long enough for the appellant and his 
companion to have left a good impression of their identity, said spouses
 could not have possibly made a mistake in recognizing the appellant. It
 is noteworthy that there is absolutely no showing that the offended 
spouses could have any motive for testifying falsely against the 
appellant. Upon the other hand, their testimony coincides essentially 
with their statements before the chief of police, a circumstance lending
 force to the theory of the prosecution. Much less could the chief of 
police have any reason for incriminating the appellant who admitted 
before said officer that the wound on appellant's forehead resulted from
 a quarrel with his companion over the division of the spoils. At any 
rate, we are not inclined to disregard the advantage of the trial judge 
in hearing and seeing the witnesses for both sides testify.</p><p> 
Contrary to the contention of appellant's counsel de oficio, the weight 
of the evidence for the prosecution has not been adversely affected, 
much less overcome, by the circumstance that the offended woman did not 
submit herself to a physical examination and that her soiled chemise was
 not presented in evidence. While said details are useful, they are not 
essential, especially where, as in this case, there is already 
sufficient evidence establishing appellant's guilt.</p><p> We cannot, 
however, agree with the Solicitor General in his contention that the 
offense is aggravated by the circumstance that it was committed in an 
uninhabited place, because it has not been proved that the appellant and
 his companion purposely chose said place as an aid either to an easy 
and uninterrupted accomplishment of their criminal designs or to a surer
 concealment of the offense. (U. S.<em> vs</em>. Vitug, 17 Phil., 1.) On
 the contrary, it is not improbable that the offended parties were 
casually encountered, there being no evidence that the accused had 
previously sought the former for any purpose whatsoever (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Vitug, <em>supra</em>), or that said offended parties were known by the accused to be habitual travelers in that vicinity.
  </p><p> The offense committed is robbery with rape and penalized under article 294, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code with <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
 In the absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstance, said 
penalty should be imposed in its medium degree, or from 17 years, 4 
months and 1 day to 20 years. The maximum of the indeterminate sentence 
imposed by the trial court is below this range.
  </p><p> It being understood, therefore, that the appellant shall 
suffer an indeterminate prison term carrying a maximum of 17 years, 4 
months and 1 day, <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the appealed judgment is in all other respects affirmed, with costs. So ordered.
  </p><p> <em>Moran, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon,  Briones, Padilla</em>, and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur.
