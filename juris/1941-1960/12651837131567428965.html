				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners,&nbsp; Candido&nbsp; Pancho&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; seek&nbsp; a review&nbsp; by certiorari&nbsp; of a decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals.&nbsp; The pertinent facts are set forth in&nbsp; said decision, from which we quote:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"Flaviano Villanueva and Aniceta&nbsp; Limbungac were husband and wife.&nbsp; Anacleta had a son by her previous marriage named Patricio Pancho.&nbsp; During their lifetime,&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; acquired a parcel&nbsp; of land with&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of&nbsp; fourteen hectares,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the corresponding Original Certificate&nbsp; of Title&nbsp; No. 3769&nbsp; was issued in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of the husband.&nbsp; Flaviano died on December 11, 1931, and&nbsp; on October 26,&nbsp; 1937, his wife executed a public instrument wherein-she stated, among&nbsp; other things,&nbsp; that&nbsp; she was&nbsp; the only forced heir of her husband, who&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; died&nbsp; without any&nbsp; ascendant or&nbsp; descendant or&nbsp; any collateral heir, and asked&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; be adjudicated to her&nbsp; extra-judicially.&nbsp; Aniceta died&nbsp; on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 6, 1939,&nbsp; and on March 4,&nbsp; 1948, her aforementioned son executed an affidavit stating that he was the sole heir&nbsp; of the property left by&nbsp; his&nbsp; deceased mother and adjudicating&nbsp; the&nbsp; same to him. "However, contrary to the allegations of&nbsp; Aniceta and&nbsp; Patricio Pancho, the late Flaviano&nbsp; Villanueva&nbsp; is survived&nbsp; by&nbsp; his brother and sister by the name of Manuel and Marta.&nbsp; Thus, on March&nbsp; 12 1951,&nbsp; they&nbsp; asserted their rights to one&nbsp; of the property left by their brother&nbsp; by filing a&nbsp; complaint against&nbsp; Patricio Pancho&nbsp; who, upon his death on Febuary 15,&nbsp; 1952, was&nbsp; substituted&nbsp; by his heirs,&nbsp; the herein defendants, pursuant to the order of the court of October 6, of the same year, praying the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, thus—<br></p><blockquote><p>(<em>a</em>) To order the revival of Original Certificate of Title No. 3769 (Homestead Patent) and once revived,&nbsp; to&nbsp; order the immediate partition of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; law, one-half to the plaintiffs and the other one-half&nbsp; to the defendant herein&nbsp; of the above&nbsp; described&nbsp; land;</p><p>(<em>b</em>) To&nbsp; declare as null and void<em> ab initio</em>&nbsp; Annexes&nbsp; 'B' and 'C, as contrary to the&nbsp; existing laws of heirship&nbsp; and succession in relation&nbsp; to the facts of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; once declared&nbsp; null and&nbsp; void, to&nbsp; order the&nbsp; cancellation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. (12359) and No. 104 in the name of Aniceta Lim bungac and Patricio Pancho, respectively, of the City of Cabanatuan land&nbsp; records:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>(<em>c</em>)&nbsp; To order&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; the sum of Fl,500 as damages as a result of the lawful deprivation of plaintiffs'&nbsp; legal and&nbsp; lawful participation to the above described land; </p></blockquote><p>"On April 5, 1951, defendants filed a motion for the dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; it&nbsp; states no cause&nbsp; of action and&nbsp; that&nbsp; their cause of&nbsp; action was barred&nbsp; by&nbsp; the statute of limitations.&nbsp; Acting upon this motion and&nbsp; the opposition&nbsp; thereto, the trial court issued an order denying&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion and directing defendants to file their answer.&nbsp; Consequently, defendants filed their answer&nbsp; with&nbsp; affirmative&nbsp; defenses&nbsp; and&nbsp; counterclaim,&nbsp; praying&nbsp; for judgment dismissing plaintiffs'&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordering them&nbsp; to jointly and severally pay the former the sum of P3,000,00 upon their counterclaim.</p><p>"After due trial, the lower court&nbsp; rendered decision, the dispositive portion of which is&nbsp; as follows—</p><p>"POR&nbsp; LAS&nbsp; CONSIDERACIONES ARRIBA EXPIJESTA, el Juzgado&nbsp; dicta decision en&nbsp; esta causa declarando nulos y de&nbsp; ningun valor ni efecto legal&nbsp; los certificados&nbsp; de Titulo Nos. 103&nbsp; (12359) y 104, ordenando a los&nbsp; demandados a entregar dichos&nbsp; certificados de titulo al Registrador de&nbsp; Titulos de Nueva Ecija para&nbsp; que&nbsp; los cancele, y expide nuevos titulos a&nbsp; favor de los&nbsp; demandantes&nbsp; y&nbsp; demandados&nbsp; despues de que el terreno sea medido y divido en partes iguales entre dichas partes de acuerdo con las&nbsp; disposiciones de la&nbsp; Ley No. 496.&nbsp; No ha lugar a los danos reclamados por no&nbsp; haberse&nbsp; probado. 'Se&nbsp; sobresee la&nbsp; contrademanda de los&nbsp; demandados.&nbsp; Sin&nbsp; especial pronunciamiento en&nbsp; cuanto&nbsp; a las costas.'</p></blockquote><p>'From the aforesaid judgment, defendants appealed and now maintain that the&nbsp; lower court erred—</p><ol><li>"In&nbsp; not dismissing the&nbsp; appellees complaint&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of improper&nbsp; venue;<br>&nbsp; </li><li>"In&nbsp; not finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; have no cause&nbsp; of action, or that&nbsp; their complaints&nbsp; states no&nbsp; cause of action, against&nbsp; the appellants;<br></li>&nbsp; <li>"In&nbsp; not finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action the appellees might have had against the appellants the same is&nbsp; already barred by the statute of limitations;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>"In not finding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; appellees have failed to&nbsp; prove their right to succeed to the&nbsp; property in question, and thus dismissing appellees' complaint;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>"In declaring null&nbsp; and void&nbsp; certificates of title&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 12359 and 104 and&nbsp; in ordering&nbsp; the partition of the property in equal parts; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>"In rendering judgment in favor of appellees and not in favor of the defendants-appellants."</li></ol><p>The Court of Appeals found no merit in&nbsp; these assignments of&nbsp; error and, hence, it affirmed the decision of the court of first instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their petition&nbsp; for certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, the defendants—now petitioners —reiterate said assignments of error. The first deals with venue.&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; contend that the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Nueva Ecija had no authority to hear&nbsp; the case, both parties being residents of&nbsp; the province of Bulacan,&nbsp; where,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is claimed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; action should&nbsp; have been brought.&nbsp; Such pretense&nbsp; is&nbsp; absolutely untenable, this being an action for partition, for plaintiffs pray in their complaint that the&nbsp; court</p><blockquote><p>" * * * order the&nbsp; revival of&nbsp; Original Certificate of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; No. 3769 (Homestead Patent) and once revived, to order the&nbsp; immediate partition of the same in accordance with the law * * *".</p></blockquote><p>and pursuant to section 3,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 5 of the Rules of Court</p><blockquote><p>"Actions affecting&nbsp; title to, or for recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession, or for partition&nbsp; or condemnation of, or foreclosure of mortgage on,&nbsp; real property, shall be commenced and tried in the province&nbsp; where the property or any part thereof lies."</p></blockquote><p>Referring to the second assignment of error, petitioners maintain that there is nothing in the transfer certificates of&nbsp; title covering&nbsp; the land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; or&nbsp; in&nbsp; any&nbsp; other document&nbsp; to show that said land "was being held in common&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; * * * Aniceta&nbsp;&nbsp; Limbungac&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and/or&nbsp;&nbsp; Patricio Pancho with respondents,"&nbsp; or that respondents had ever been considered by Aniceta and/or Patricio as co-owners of&nbsp; said property,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no&nbsp; allegation in respondents'&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that the land had ever been held by Aniceta, and/or Patricio&nbsp; or by petitioners herein "in common ownership with respondents"&nbsp; (pp.. 11 and&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; Petitioners' Brief).&nbsp; It is, however,&nbsp; averred in the complaint that said property was part of the conjugal partnership of&nbsp; Aniceta Limbungac and her deceased husband Flaviano&nbsp; Villanueva; that, as&nbsp; brother and&nbsp; sister of the latter, who was not&nbsp; survived by any ascendant or descendant, plaintiffs&nbsp; (respondents herein)&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; and Marta Villanueva are&nbsp; the sole heirs of his share in said property; that,&nbsp; as Aniceta's son by a previous marriage, Patricio&nbsp; is the&nbsp; successor to her share in the land in&nbsp; dispute; and that&nbsp; neither Aniceta nor Patricio had ever been in possession of said land.&nbsp; These allegations are sufficient to show&nbsp; that plaintiffs&nbsp; (respondents' herein),&nbsp; as heirs of Flaviano&nbsp; Villanueva,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Patricio Pancho,&nbsp; as&nbsp; heir of Aniceta Limbungac, were co-owners of said property.</p><p>It appearing that Aniceta and Patricio&nbsp; had never been in possession of said&nbsp; property,&nbsp; it follows that neither could have' acquired it by acquisitive prescription&nbsp; and that the action of&nbsp; plaint iff s—respondents herein—as co-owners of said property, to demand its partition, has not prescribed.&nbsp; Accordingly, the third assignment&nbsp; of error is, also,&nbsp; devoid of merit.</p><p>Being&nbsp; corollaries&nbsp; of those already disposed of, the other assignments of error need no further discussion.</p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioners herein.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista, Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B. L.</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
