				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; from&nbsp; the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila in its Civil Case No. 20008, admitting petitioner Ramon Cheng Quioc Too to Philippine citizenship.<p>The Solicitor General, who opposed the petition below, argues in this appeal that petitioner&nbsp; has not sufficiently proved that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; born in the Philippines and so was not exempt from filing a declaration of intention,&nbsp; since his alleged birth certificate&nbsp; (Exhibit "C"), stands in the name;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; naturalization&nbsp;&nbsp; was prompted&nbsp; mainly&nbsp; by&nbsp; reasons of&nbsp; business conveniences rather than a desire to live the life of a Filipino. Petitioner,&nbsp; on the other hand, contends that he was really born at 719 Sto.&nbsp; Cristo, Manila on August 24, 1927; that the discrepancy in the name in&nbsp; said birth certificate ;was due only to&nbsp; a mistake&nbsp; on&nbsp; the part of the&nbsp; midwife who, in reporting&nbsp; petitioner's birth,&nbsp; gave the name of a girl, Ching Sui Keng,&nbsp; instead of petitioner's name Cheng Quioc Too, which is the name of a boy; that the date and place of birth appearing on the birth certificate (Exhibit "C") are those of petitioner; and that the names of the parents entered thereon are those of petitioner's parents, and petitioner was their only child.</p><p>It also claimed that petitioner discovered&nbsp; the mistake in the entry&nbsp; of his name in his birth certificate only in 1952, when he filed in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; a petition for the correction&nbsp; of said entry&nbsp; (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 22344), but the decision&nbsp; directing&nbsp; the&nbsp; Local Civil Register to&nbsp; make the necessary correction&nbsp; on petitioner's birth&nbsp; certificate from the reported name of Ching Sui Keng to Cheng Quioc Too (Appendix "A", to Appellee's brief) is now&nbsp; pending in the Court of Appeals upon appeal by the&nbsp; Solicitor General (C. A.-G. R.&nbsp; No. 16688-R).</p><p>As we see it, the main obstacle to the grant now of the petition&nbsp; is that&nbsp; to admit&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; to citizenship&nbsp; <em>as&nbsp; a Philippine&nbsp; born alien</em> would be completely&nbsp; at variance with the official record of births.&nbsp; If it be true that&nbsp; there was error in said&nbsp; records, the petitioner should first take the proper steps to have that error corrected; a naturalization proceeding is not the right action to attain that result, since rectification of official&nbsp; records is an&nbsp; issue foreign to the purpose for which naturalization was established.&nbsp;&nbsp; If,&nbsp; as alleged, petitioner has&nbsp; already asked&nbsp; the&nbsp; Courts to order a&nbsp; correction of the entry in his record of birth, the final action on that petition&nbsp; should be awaited.&nbsp; To grant him naturalization now would be premature.</p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from&nbsp; is set aside and these proceedings are ordered dismissed, but without prejudice&nbsp; to the petitioner's renewing his&nbsp; application&nbsp; for naturalization after&nbsp; correction&nbsp; or&nbsp; rectification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the official record of his birth, if proper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without costs.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia, </em>and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
