				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission on&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim for compensation filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; the Blue Bar&nbsp; Coconut Company by one of its&nbsp; laborers.<br><br>The&nbsp; facts&nbsp; as found&nbsp; by the Commission are set&nbsp; out in the following excerpt from its&nbsp; decision:<br><blockquote>"A perusal of the records reveals that claimant was first employed by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; in 1947 as&nbsp; a&nbsp; thread&nbsp; carrier,&nbsp; and&nbsp; remained employed as such up to June&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1952; that as a&nbsp; thread&nbsp; carrier, he received a daily wage of P4.20 when working on the day shift and P4.24 when on&nbsp; the night shift; that as a thread carrier, his work was to carry coconut&nbsp; threads loaded in a 'banera' from the grinder (molino)&nbsp; to the dry feeders, a distance&nbsp; of&nbsp; about 12 meters;&nbsp; that said 'banera' alone weighs from 16 to 20 kilos&nbsp; and, when loaded, it weighs&nbsp; 50 kilos more&nbsp; or less; that upon reaching the dry feeders claimant had to raise or&nbsp; lift the&nbsp; loaded&nbsp; 'banera' and deposit the desiccated coconut threads in the platform of the dry feeders which is knee-high&nbsp; from the&nbsp; floor;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; repeated&nbsp; this process more than&nbsp; 100&nbsp; times during&nbsp; his 8 hours' work in a&nbsp; day; that&nbsp; because the temperature in the&nbsp; dry feeders&nbsp; is hotter than in&nbsp; the&nbsp; grinder he&nbsp; was exposed to continuous&nbsp; changes of temperature&nbsp; during his eight hours of work; and that on June&nbsp; 5, 1952, due to said exposure and the&nbsp;&nbsp; effort he&nbsp; exerted&nbsp; in carrying&nbsp; the loaded 'banera' and lifting it to the platform of the dry feeders to deposit the desiccated coconut threads, he felt&nbsp; back and chest pains and general weakness of the body, and when he spat due to&nbsp; coughing there was blood in his&nbsp; sputum.<br><br>"Records also disclose that&nbsp; prior to his admission&nbsp; in&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; company,&nbsp; claimant was&nbsp; examined by&nbsp; Dr. Artemio U. Masangkay&nbsp;&nbsp; (respondent's&nbsp; physician)&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; was&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be physically fit for work; that on June&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1950, claimant was&nbsp; hospitalized&nbsp; at the San Pablo Hospital&nbsp; for one month and four days due to a&nbsp; stab&nbsp; wound about&nbsp; 2&nbsp; inches wide; that said&nbsp; wound was completely healed at the time he was discharged&nbsp; from the hospital; that in the yearly&nbsp; examination of&nbsp; laborers&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; by Dr. Masangkay&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; always&nbsp; found&nbsp; physically fit&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed to continue working;&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was only in the&nbsp; periodical examination in&nbsp; December,&nbsp; 1951 when he was&nbsp; found a TB&nbsp; suspect&nbsp; by Dr. Masangkay; that notwithstanding this finding, claimant was&nbsp; allowed to continue&nbsp; working;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; after&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; had&nbsp; informed Mr. Smiley, plant manager of the respondent company&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 5, 1952 of the pains he&nbsp; was suffering he (claimant) was given by respondent a leave of absence for one year.<br><br>"Records further show that claimant was again examined by Dr. Masangkay on October 14, 1952 and was found to be suffering from an impairment of the vesicular breathing; that because claimant was&nbsp; then under&nbsp; the&nbsp; personal&nbsp; care of&nbsp; Dr. Manzanero,&nbsp; a private practitioner,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Masangkay began treating&nbsp; him only from&nbsp; July 17, 1953 to August 31, 1954;&nbsp; that upon&nbsp; suggestion of Dr. Masangkay, claimant entered&nbsp; and was confined&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Quezon Institute under the care of Dr. Juan T. de Jesus and Dr. Reyes; that he underwent two operations while in said&nbsp; hospital,&nbsp; one for&nbsp; bronchoscopy and another for decortication; that claimant left&nbsp; the&nbsp; Quezon Institute on January 4, 1956;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Physician's&nbsp; Report of Sickness or Accident accomplished by Dr.&nbsp; de Jesus&nbsp; (Exhibit 'B' for claimant) dated July 23, 1955, states among other things:<br><br>'Diagnosis:<br><ol><li>Pulmonary&nbsp; tuberculosis&nbsp; chronic, Moderate, right;&nbsp; Minimal, left,&nbsp; active.</li><li>Endobrochial tuberculosis, second&nbsp; degree.</li><li>Spontaneous pneumothorax with fluid, right.<br></li></ol>'General Remarks—Sputum is&nbsp; still positive tuberculosis; operated (decortication) for&nbsp; thickened pleura, right, March 1, 1955'; and that the X-ray examination (Film No. 79390) of the claimant at the National Chest Center,&nbsp; Division&nbsp; of Tuberculosis, dated August 23,&nbsp; 1955, reveals the&nbsp; following:<br><br>'R. Lung:&nbsp; Hemogenous density&nbsp; extending from apex laterally downward to the base&nbsp; with diffused density scattered rest of lung field&nbsp; and ares or rarefaction apex 2nd interspace.<br><br>'L. Lung:&nbsp; Essentially negative.<br><br>'Impression:&nbsp; Suggestive&nbsp; of PTB&nbsp; (mod. advanced)".<br></blockquote>On the theory that the laborer's&nbsp; ailment resulted from the nature of his employment, the Commission ordered the company to&nbsp; pay him compensation,&nbsp; reimburse his&nbsp; medical expenses and furnish him&nbsp; treatment&nbsp; till his tuberculosis was&nbsp; arrested.<br><br>The petitioner tried to establish that&nbsp; respondent's sickness&nbsp; was produced by causes not&nbsp; connected with his work with the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Commission found this claim not established and,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the other hand, declared&nbsp; it sufficiently proved "that claimant prior to and during the yearly examination of laborers of respondent company had always been found physically fit&nbsp; and allowed to continue his work; that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; only in December, 1951 when claimant was found in the course of said periodical examinations to be a TB suspect by respondent's physician, Dr.&nbsp; Masangkay; that in spite of this state of health of the claimant, he was permitted to continue&nbsp; working; and that on June 5, 1952 while claimant was in actual&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of his work as thread carrier, he&nbsp; felt back and&nbsp; chest pains and general weakness of the body and when he spat due to his coughing, there was blood in his sputum."&nbsp; The Commission,&nbsp; therefore, concluded that&nbsp; respondent's tuberculosis "was&nbsp; the result of the nature of his employment".<br><br>Petitioner cannot say that there is no evidence to support that&nbsp; conclusion, and its claim that respondent's work was not so heavy and could not have caused or aggravated his illness&nbsp; because in&nbsp; his&nbsp; five years with the company&nbsp; "he worked only 238½¸ days or 1/5 of the total working days", is&nbsp; obviously untenable.&nbsp; From&nbsp; the description, given&nbsp; and as found by the Commission, respondent's job would appear to be not only strenuous but&nbsp; also performed&nbsp; under&nbsp; conditions conducive to lung disease.&nbsp; As thread carrier, respondent had to lug the <span style="font-style: italic;">bañeras&nbsp; </span>containing shredded coconut meat from the grinder to the&nbsp; dry feeders,&nbsp; a distance of about 12 meters,&nbsp; and lift them and dump their&nbsp; contents into&nbsp; a platform about knee-high from the floor.&nbsp; According to him, wheelbarrows were not yet being used&nbsp; when he was&nbsp; with the company.&nbsp; The <i>bañeras</i> were made of steel and iron.&nbsp; Each weighed from 15 to 20 kilos when&nbsp; empty and&nbsp; 50 kilos more or&nbsp; less (about the weight of a sack of rice) when filled with coconut shreds.&nbsp; On top of that the Commission found that the temperature at&nbsp; the&nbsp; place of the dry feeders was much hotter than at the place&nbsp; of the grinder.&nbsp; And while&nbsp; taking note of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the claimant worked&nbsp; only 39 days in&nbsp; 1951&nbsp; and 12&nbsp; days in 1952 or a total of 51 days before he felt pains in the chest and spat blood while working, the Commission also&nbsp; points out that the claimant "had to handle the 'banera' and bring it from the grinder to the dry feeders 100&nbsp; times a day, working 8 hours, or 5,100 times during the period above- mentioned."&nbsp; In&nbsp; the circumstances, we think the Commission was justified in concluding that&nbsp; "the&nbsp; efforts exerted by him in dragging the 'banera' and lifting the same from the floor, coupled with his unavoidable exposure to continuous changes of temperature in the performance&nbsp; of his assigned task as thread carrier, have contributed to the lowering&nbsp; of his resistance, thereby setting in motion the tuberculosis in&nbsp; his system which might&nbsp; have remained&nbsp;&nbsp; latent and inactive but for his aforementioned employment."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Not much importance could be given to&nbsp; the suggestion of the&nbsp; company&nbsp; physician&nbsp; that&nbsp; the empyema for&nbsp; which&nbsp; respondent was treated&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1952 was&nbsp; probably caused by the infection of the wounds received by him in 1950.&nbsp; The doctor admitted that empyema, which usually is a collection&nbsp; of pus in the pleural cavity, could also be caused by tuberculosis.&nbsp; Moreover, respondent was examined by the company physician before his admission to the service and every&nbsp;&nbsp; year thereafter until&nbsp; 1951, and was always found in good&nbsp; health,&nbsp; although in his last examination, he was found to have&nbsp; "coarse vesicular&nbsp; breathing, left lung * *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; not, however, separated from the service but was allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering his heavy task&nbsp; and the fact that he was stricken with the sickness&nbsp; while&nbsp; in the performance of his work and there being no showing&nbsp; that before he felt chest pains and spat blood he was already suffering from advanced tuberculosis, the natural and reasonable inference is&nbsp; that his disability was either&nbsp; the immediate result of the nature of his employment or caused by a sickness then latent but aggravated by his work and therefore compensable.&nbsp;&nbsp; All&nbsp; doubts in this regard&nbsp; must be resolved&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; in accordance with the established policy of liberal construction of the Workmen's Compensation Law in favor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; laborer or employee.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Ramos <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Poblete and Jarin, 73 Phil., 241: Francisco <i>vs.</i> Consing, 63 Phil., 354.)<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
