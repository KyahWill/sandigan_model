				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>The case</i>.&nbsp; The Wack Wack&nbsp; Golf and&nbsp; Country Club, Inc. has brought up&nbsp; for&nbsp; review the award&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Commission requiring it to&nbsp; compensate its&nbsp; former chief&nbsp; cook,&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; G.&nbsp; Valentin,&nbsp; for&nbsp; disability&nbsp; resulting from illness contracted and/or aggravated while&nbsp; working&nbsp; in&nbsp; its employment. <br><br><i>The issue</i> is mainly whether Republic Act 772 governs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; situation, or whether, as petitioner contends, the&nbsp; applicable statute is Act No. 3428 as&nbsp; amended by Commonwealth Act&nbsp; 210.<br><br><i>The facts</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Antonio G.&nbsp; Valentin&nbsp; entered petitioner's employ in 1935 and worked as cook until December 1941.<br><br>In May 1947 he was re-employed and continued rendering service up to April 15, 1952, when because of illness (tuberculosis) he was told to go on leave and was given four month's vacation with pay.&nbsp; His salary was P200 a month or P46.62&nbsp; a&nbsp; week.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; end of his leave,&nbsp; his&nbsp; ailment had&nbsp; not yielded to the medical treatment and attendance provided him by the Club.&nbsp; So he was dismissed in August 1952 even as&nbsp; he&nbsp; received the&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; of two months' salary as&nbsp; separation pay. <br><br>Thereafter,&nbsp; in&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; he filed a&nbsp; claim with the&nbsp; respondent Commission.&nbsp; The&nbsp; disease was&nbsp; not compensable, asserted the Club,&nbsp; because it&nbsp; did not&nbsp; arise&nbsp; out of and in&nbsp; the course of&nbsp; employment.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; it&nbsp; added, the&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; include&nbsp; this&nbsp; employee because&nbsp; he was receiving a&nbsp; weekly salary of more than 42 pesos, and&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Act excluded from&nbsp; its operation those "whose&nbsp; remuneration&nbsp; paid by an employer, exclusive of&nbsp; overtime pay,&nbsp; is in&nbsp; excess of P42&nbsp; per week."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 39&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; as amended&nbsp; by&nbsp; Commonwealth Act 210.) <br><br>After considering the&nbsp; testimony of several physicians, the&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; declared that&nbsp; "claimant's illness&nbsp; (tuber- culosis)&nbsp; was&nbsp; caused or aggravated by the nature&nbsp; of his employment" and inasmuch as his separation&nbsp; was&nbsp; due to such illness he should be awarded&nbsp; disability benefits.&nbsp; As to the alleged exclusion&nbsp; based on&nbsp; the employee's weekly pay,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission declined&nbsp; to follow the&nbsp; above&nbsp; statu- tory&nbsp; provision&nbsp; (section 39&nbsp; [6])&nbsp; because&nbsp; it had&nbsp; been re- pealed by Republic Act&nbsp; 772 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> which took&nbsp; effect on June&nbsp; 20, 1952,&nbsp; and because this employee was separated from the service&nbsp; on August 16, 1952, i.e., after the approval and passage of said Republic Act. <br><br>We&nbsp; gave due course to&nbsp; this petition&nbsp; for certiorari, mainly because&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; insisted, and&nbsp; argued, that Republic&nbsp; Act 772&nbsp; had no application, inasmuch as Antonio Valentin had contracted pulmonary tuberculosis sometime prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; April 17,&nbsp; 1952 i.e. before the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of said' law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> <br><br><i>Discussion</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is no dispute about&nbsp; the dates&nbsp; of employment, leave&nbsp; on account of&nbsp; illness, and&nbsp; separation. There&nbsp; is also&nbsp; no question&nbsp; that Republic&nbsp; Act 772 contains no provision making it applicable to claims, the causes&nbsp; of action&nbsp; of which&nbsp; accrued prior to&nbsp; its&nbsp; enactment. <br><br>Now then, it is&nbsp; clear that if&nbsp; Valentin should be com- pensated&nbsp; it is because he contracted&nbsp; tuberculosis,&nbsp; or&nbsp; it was aggravated,&nbsp; during his employment and on account&nbsp; of his work.&nbsp; But when did he contract such illness or when was it&nbsp; aggravated?&nbsp; Obviously <i>before</i> April 17, 1952 when he went&nbsp; on leave owing to his illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could not have been aggravated by his work <i>after that date</i>,&nbsp; because&nbsp; he never&nbsp; worked in petitioner's establishment after April. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; injury or&nbsp; event&nbsp; on which&nbsp; this&nbsp; claim for compensation rests, happened on&nbsp; or before April 17, 1952. <i>From&nbsp; that time he was disabled</i>; evidently a man&nbsp; afflicted with phthisis&nbsp; couldn't or&nbsp; shouldn't continue&nbsp; cooking for the Club.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time employees receiving weekly com- pensation of more&nbsp; than 42 pesos were expressly excluded from the&nbsp; benefits of the(&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation Act. The elimination&nbsp; of such exclusion from the statutes&nbsp; on June 20, 1952 can not render compensable facts or events which were&nbsp; not compensable when&nbsp; they happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nonretroactivity of Republic Act 772 was noted in Amedo&nbsp; vs. Olabarrieta, 95 Phil.,&nbsp; 33. <br><br><blockquote>"In harmony with the established principle&nbsp; that legislative&nbsp; en- actments, in the absence of a clearly expressed intent to the contrary, will be&nbsp; deemed to be prospective, and net retrospective, workmen's compensation acts have&nbsp; been&nbsp; held not&nbsp; to apply to injuries which occurred before the law went into effect."&nbsp; (58 Am. Jur. "Workmen's Compensation", section 33.) <br><br>"With respect to time, the right for compensation for an injury, under the workmen's compensation acts is governed, in the absence of any provision to&nbsp; the contrary, by the&nbsp; law in force&nbsp; at the time of the&nbsp; occurrence&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; injury." (58&nbsp; Am. Jur.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Workmen's Compensation", section 78.) </blockquote><br><br>The ruling must therefore be issued that, inasmuch as the law in April 1952 excluded from the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Act&nbsp; those employees receiving&nbsp; more than&nbsp; 42 pesos per week, Valentin's claim should have been rejected. We are not called upon&nbsp; to discuss&nbsp; the reasons for such exclusion,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify&nbsp; it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; words&nbsp; being&nbsp; definite, we have to&nbsp; follow the statutory directive. Nevertheless let it be&nbsp; noted that the&nbsp; Club&nbsp; extended valuable assistance to its&nbsp; employee&nbsp; in his misfortune.&nbsp; It spent more&nbsp; than 2,000 pesos for his medicine and&nbsp; laboratory and doctor's&nbsp; fees, besides&nbsp; giving him vacation and separation pay amounting to P1,200. <br><br>Judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore in line with our ruling we here- by reverse the Commission's award&nbsp; and&nbsp; absolve the petitioner from all liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L,, Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> "It is to be noted that under the old law, if the remuneration of an employee or laborer, exclusive of overtime pay, is&nbsp; in excess of forty two pesos a week, such employee or laborer is not deemed an "employee" or "laborer" under&nbsp; the Act and, therefore,&nbsp; the employer is not&nbsp; liable for&nbsp; injuries or&nbsp; death suffered&nbsp; by&nbsp; such&nbsp; employee or laborer. This provision of the old law&nbsp; was&nbsp; amended by Republic Act No. 772&nbsp; so as to&nbsp; make all employees or&nbsp; laborers, irrespective of tbe amount of&nbsp; remuneration, entitled to the benefits of the Act." (Francisco Labor&nbsp; Laws p. 821,&nbsp; 822.)<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> It urged other grounds, which need not be mentioned. <br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> It seeing that "aggravation"&nbsp; of&nbsp; illness&nbsp; was for the first time inserted in the statute by Republic&nbsp; Act 772 (Francisco op. cit. p. 842.)&nbsp; We will not now comment on the point. </div>
