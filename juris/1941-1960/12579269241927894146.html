				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition filed by the Sampaguita Shoe &amp; Slipper Factory seeking  to review  the resolution of the Court  of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No. 59 dismissing the petition filed therein on the ground that  said Court  has  no jurisdiction to entertain the same. The facts of the case  may be stated as follows: <br><br>In the latter part of 1953, the  Sampaguita Shoe &amp; Slipper Factory, a business concern in the city of Cebu, ordered from the Colonial Tanning  Company of Boston,  Massachusetts,  U.S.A.,  10,000  square  feet  of patent  leather valued at $3,300. On March 30,  1954, said goods arrived at the port of Cebu. The papers necessary for its  release (Import  Entry No. 1548-C,  Consular Invoice B-14877 and  Central Bank Release  Certificate  No.  1088) were found in order, but when the shipment,  contained in  5 cases, was  opened for examination and  appraisal,  and samples  of  the materials were shown  to  the customs authorities, they were declared to be upper leather and not patent leather;  thus seizure proceedings were  instituted (Cebu Seizure Identification No. 154)  although the goods were released  upon  the  consignee's  filing  a  bond for P10,000. <br><br>Hearing was duly conducted and  on  May  19, 1954, the Collector of Customs of the port of Cebu rendered decision holding that in view of the difficulty in determining the purposes for which the leather  in  question would be utilized  and  in the absence  of  specific  law or regulation prohibiting the importation  of  such kind of leather, the 5 cases  of  leather  should be  released to  the  importer upon payment of the taxes and other charges thereon. Said decision was  sent by the Collector of Customs to the manager of the factory on May 21,  1954, with a letter  of transmittal  informing  the  latter  that  same  shall not become final and executory until  approved by the Commissioner of Customs. <br><br>On June of  the same  year, however, the  Collector  of Customs amended  his  previous decision by reversing the ruling laid down therein  and this time holding that the imported  leather  was primarily  intended as uppers  of shoes and should not be  classified as patent leather. The 5  cases  covered by Import Entry No. 1548-C,  s.  1954, were thus declared confiscated and forfeited to the Government pursuant to the provisions of Section 1363 (f)  of the  Revised Administrative Code and  paragraph  9  of Central  Bank Circulars Nos.  44  and 45. This amended decision  was likewise sent by registered mail to the manager  of the establishment with  the notice that appeal, if any, from said decision should be interposed with the  Commissioner within 15 days from  receipt of said communication, otherwise the said decision would become final and executory.  Said  registered mail appeared  to have  been received  by an employee of the establishment on June 10, 1954, as evidenced by the registry return card.  At  the same time,  the Commissioner  of Customs was furnished a copy of the amended decision, which was  affirmed by said official. <br><br>On September 14, 1954, the  importer received a letter from the Collector  of Customs demanding the surrender of the goods subject of the proceedings or  the payment of the sum of P10,000 in  cash,  which prompted the  filing of a petition to set aside  the  amended decision referred to therein on the ground that the employee  of said establishment  who received the copy of said decision failed to give the  same to the manager, who at that time  was in Mindanao; that the  latter actually got hold of the amended decision  only on September 14, 1954, upon receipt of the letter of  demand of the Collector; and that  the attorney who appeared for  the  importer  in the proceedings  was not notified  of said decision. It was thus prayed that the amended decision of June 1, 1954, be set aside  and the respondent (Sampaguita Shoe &amp; Slipper Factory) be given a chance to appeal from the  same.  This  petition   was again referred by the Collector of Customs  to the Commissioner who in a 2nd indorsement dated  December 3, 1954 reiterated his  concurrence to the amended decision. Copy of the denial of its petition was received by the importer on December 29, 1954.   The importer then filed a notice of appeal with  the Court of Tax  Appeals and the petition for review was actually sent on January 28,  1955. This petition, which was later  amended  on July 6,  1955, presented among other things the questions of  (1)  whether or not the evidence  on record warranted the finding that the leather in question was upper and not patent leather; (2)  whether the reversal by the  Collector of Customs  of his decision was lawful;  (3)  whether the service of a decision upon a person other than  petitioner or  his attorney of record commence  the running of the period to appeal;  and (4) whether an appeal from a decision  of the Collector to the  Commissioner of Customs who had already prejudged would  still be necessary  and  might not be considered as academic. <br><br>The Commissioner of Customs, represented by the Solicitor  General,  filed  a  motion to  dismiss contending that the decision  of the Collector of Customs of Cebu was already final in view of petitioner's failure to appeal therefrom within  15  days  from receipt thereof pursuant  to the provisions  of Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code; and that even granting that the 2nd indorsement of the Commissioner,  dated December 3, 1954, might  be treated as  a ruling or decision of said official,  the petition for review  was likewise filed beyond  the 30-day period prescribed  by law. <br><br>On October  17, 1955, the Court of Tax Appeals issued a resolution holding that  said tribunal  had no jurisdiction to entertain the case by reason of petitioner's failure to appeal  to the  Commisioner of Customs. The motion for the reconsideration  of said  ruling  filed  by the importer having  been denied, the  matter was brought  to Us in  a  petition  to  review by certiorari,  petitioner  maintaining that the lower Court erred: <br><ol><li>In holding that only decisions of the Commissioner of Customs, in cases involving customs laws, may be brought on appeal to said court;<br><br> </li><li>In holding that the opinion of the  Commissioner of Customs or his  approval  of the Collector's decision  in a case is not a decision which  may be appealed to said court; and<br><br> </li><li>In holding  that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review and  in dismissing the same.</li></ol>There  is  no question  that petitioner did  not interpose any appeal  to the  Commissioner of Customs but instead resorted  to  the Court of Tax Appeals upon the denial of its petition  to set aside the amended  decision  of the Collector  of Customs, supposedly  in  its  conviction that  an appeal would  only be futile because the Commissioner already  prejudged  the  case  when he took a hand  in the seizure of the imported goods and  influenced  the amendment  of  the  decision appealed from.  Furthermore, said official already manifested  his stand  by  signifying his conformity with said  amended decision in the 2nd Indorsement  dated  December 3, 1954. <br><br>Section 1380 of  the Revised Administrative  Code explicitly provides:<br><blockquote>Sec.  1380. REVIEW BY  COMMISSIONER.-The person aggrieved by the decision of  the  Collector of  Customs in any matter presented upon protest  or  by  his  action  in  any  seizure may, within  fifteen days after notification in writing by the  Collector of his action or decision, give  written  notice to the Collector signifying his desire to have the matter reviewed  by  the  Commissioner. <br><br>Thereupon,  the collector of customs shall  forthwith transmit all the papers in the cause  to the  Commissioner, who shall  approve, modify, or reverse  the  action  of his subordinate  and shall take such steps and make such order or orders as may  be necessary to give effect  to his decision.</blockquote>Petitioner, however, asserts that Section 11 of Republic Act No.  1125, which  reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec.  11.  WHO  MAY APPEAL; EFFECT OF  APPEAL.-Any person, as sociation or corporation  adversely  affected by a decision or ruling of the  Collector of Internal Revenue, <span style="font-style: italic;">the Collector of Customs,</span> or any provincial or city Board of  Assessment  Appeals may file  an appeal  in the Court of Tax Appeals within thirty days after receipt of such decision or ruling. </blockquote>speaks of appeals  from decision of the Collector of Customs and thus concludes that an appeal may be brought directly  to the Court of Tax Appeals without the  necessity of first bringing the matter to the attention of the Commissioners.  On the  other  hand, Section  7  of the same statute  conferring jurisdiction  on the  said Court of Tax Appeals  prescribes the  following:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7.  JURISDICTION.-The Court of Tax: Appeals  shall exercise exclusive  appellate jurisdiction   to review by appeal,  as herein provided-<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*       *         *       *       *       *       * <br></div><br>(2) Decisions of  the <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Customs</span> in cases involving liability for customs  duties,  fees or  other money charges; seizure, detention  or release of property affected; fines,  forfeitures or other penalties imposed in relation thereto,  or other matters arising1 under the Customs Law or  other law or part of law  administered by  the Bureau of Customs;</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*       *         *       *       *       *       * <br></div><br>Respondent Court of Tax Appeals in trying to offer an explanation on this apparent inconsistency in  the wording of  the Law,  expresses its  belief that  such was  brought about by an oversight on the part of the Legislature and contends that the phrase "Collector of Customs"  appearing in section 11 should properly be read as Commissioner of  Customs".  In  disputing this line of argument of the Tax Court, petitioner  contends  that there  is  no need for such  interpretation  because the language  of the law  is clear  and that even granting that there exists an inconsistency  Section  11 must  prevail over  Section  7  because the former provision  is  latest in the order of  position.   It  is likewise intimated that Republic Act No. 1125 opens  2 recourses for aggrieved parties, one under Section 7 and another falling under Section 11 thereof.  We cannot countenance this argument because while it is true that where the language of a statute  is plain  and unambiguous  there  is no  occasion for construction, even though other meanings could be found (Crawford,  Statutory Construction, sec. 162, p. 250-251), yet, considering that in the instant case, the apparent inconsistency already pointed out creates  a certain degree of vagueness that may likely result in confusion in  the  application of the law, the  court, must  of necessity step in and exercise its duty to interpret it and determine the intent of Congress in enacting the same.  An examination of the Congressional Record bearing the discussions on H. Bill No. 175, which eventually became Republic Act No. 1125, in  the hope that it could shed light on the matter, elicits no result.   It is significant, however, that in  the explanatory  note of the bill and the discussions that  ensued  following the presentation of the same for the consideration  of the lawmaking body, reference was consistently made to cases  arising from decisions  of the Collector of Internal  Revenue,  <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Customs</span> and Boards  of Assessment Appeals.   It must also be remembered that the Court of Tax Appeals merely took over  the  functions  previously  exercised by  the  defunct Board of  Tax Appeals and the  Courts of  First Instance, which then had jurisdiction to  review decisions of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Customs</span> and  pass upon matters arising under the  Customs  Laws (Executive Order No. 401-A, Jan.  5,  1953,  Sec. 1380, Revised Administrative Code). Moreover,  in the  case of Rufino Lopez &amp; Sons, Inc.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Court of Tax Appeals,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 53 Off. Gaz., No. 10, p. 3065, this Court, resolving the  same question  herein involved, has already pronounced through Mr. Justice Marceliano Montemayor that the Legislature must have meant and intended to say Commissioner of Customs  instead  of  Collector  of Customs in the framing of Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125, and in effect rectified said clerical error.  It would really seem illogical that  in laying down the jurisdiction of the  Tax Court, the law  would confine the  same to  the review of decisions of the Commissioner of  Customs and then in the same breath  allow aggrieved parties to appeal directly from decisions of the Collector to the same Court.<br><br>Petitioner, however,  advanced the theory that the respondent Commissioner's  concurrence to the amended decision of the Collector of Customs embodied  in the  2nd Indorsement dated December 3,  1954, may be considered a decision  from which appeal may be interposed.  It is an elementary  rule in procedure that a decision must be in writing, personally  and directly prepared by the judge (or person or body lawfully authorized to issue the same), signed by him, stating clearly and distinctly the facts  and the law on  which it is based  (Sec.  1,  Rule 35,  Rules of Court).  In expressing his conformity  with the  amended decision, it  may be argued that the findings of  fact  and the ruling  of the Collector of  Customs had been adopted by the Commissioner and thus the 2nd Indorsement containing said conformity  meets the  requirements  of  the Rules of Court.  We must remember,  however,  that  the Commissioner of Customs, as  head of that Bureau  (Insular Collector  of Customs), exercises the power  of supervision and control over his subordinates (Sec. 1152, R.A.C.). It will be observed that in the instant case the  action of the Commissioner as regards matters referred to him by the Collector was only supervisory in nature and his conformity or disagreement  to  the rulings of the latter  did not transform  said  decisions  into  that  of the  Commissioner.  Independently of the opinion of the Commissioner on matters brought to  his attention for advise  by the Collector, the  parties therefore still have the right to appeal the controversy to him for the  proper determination of his office.   As the law on the  matter actually  stands,  We find that the appeal made available to an importer or person aggrieved by a decision or ruling of any  collector of customs of  the Philippines  has  2 phases: <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, the  one provided for in Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative Code, i.e.,  such party is  given 15  days  from receipt of the adverse ruling or  decision of  the Collector to give notice  in  writing to  the  latter  signifying his desire to have the matter reviewed by  the Commissioner of Customs, and <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, if still dissatisfied, his appeal could be projected to the Court of Tax Appeals pursuant to Section 7 of Act 1125 by filing with said tribunal a petition within 30 days from receipt of notice of the decision or ruling sought to be reviewed. <br><br>In the case at bar, it appears that the importer failed to observe the procedure laid down  by Section 1380 of the Revised Administrative  Code  aforementioned, thus,  the lower Court acted properly in dismissing the petition filed therein in view of petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.   The doctrine of exhaustion  of administrative reliefs is indeed a sound rule for it provides for a policy of  orderly  procedure which favors a preliminary administrative sifting  process, and serves to  prevent attemps to  swamp  the courts by a resort to them in the first instance  (United  States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sing Tuck, 194 US 161. 48 L ed 917, 24 S Ct 621; Oklahoma Pub. Welfare Commission vs. State 186 Okla. 654, 105 P. (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) 547, 130 ALR 873).  As  already ruled  in the  aforementioned  case of Rufino Lopez &amp; Sons, Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. The Court of  Tax Appeals, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, "it is a sound rule that before one resorts to the Courts, the administrative remedy provided by law should first be exhausted".  As petitioner herein did not interpose an appeal to the Commissioner of Customs from the decision of the Collector of Customs of Cebu within  the period of 15 days prescribed by law, said decision of  the latter became final and executory; hence, petitioner cannot take its case on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.  Anyway, and even if We would  consider that it could, We find that petitioner has also failed to appeal from any Commissioner of Customs' decision on the matter to the Court of Tax Appeals within the time prescribed by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125. <br><br>As the third issue raised by petitioner necessarily rests on the soundness  of the first 2 questions already discussed, and  considering the conclusions thus  arrived at, there is no need for US to pass  upon the same. <br><br>Wherefore, the resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals in Case No. 59  submitted  to Us for  review,  is hereby affirmed,  with costs against petitioner.   It  is so ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes,  A., Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,  J.  B.
