				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1953, Chua Chian,&nbsp; in behalf of&nbsp; Ng Siu Hong, Marcelino Ng Siu Lim, and herself, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the reconstitution of the record of&nbsp; a&nbsp; naturalization&nbsp; case entitled "In the Matter of the Petition for .Naturalization of Ng Yoc Siu, Case No.&nbsp; 681" alleged to have been decided in 1941.&nbsp; The record,&nbsp; so&nbsp; it is&nbsp; alleged, was destroyed during the war.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting on the&nbsp; petition, the court declared the record of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; reconstituted with the&nbsp; admission of the following exhibits:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"A—A notice sent to Attorney&nbsp; Mendoza by the&nbsp; Clerk of&nbsp; Court advising the&nbsp; former that&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of the decision of the Court&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Citizenship Case&nbsp; No. 681&nbsp; was&nbsp; furnished the Office of the Civil Registrar;&nbsp; </p><p>"B—A&nbsp; letter sent by&nbsp; the local&nbsp; civil&nbsp; Registrar requiring Ng Yoc Siu to pay the amount of F20&nbsp; for the registration&nbsp; of the copy of the decision;</p><p>"C—Official&nbsp; Receipt for P20&nbsp; for&nbsp; 'registration for petition for. Philippine citizenship&nbsp; Case No. 681';</p><p>"D—A&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; a page of a&nbsp; Docket&nbsp; book&nbsp; for&nbsp; Naturalization Case No'&nbsp; 681."</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp; a subsequent&nbsp; petition filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same&nbsp; case,&nbsp; Chua Chian prayed&nbsp; that she&nbsp; be allowed&nbsp; to take&nbsp; the&nbsp; oath of allegiance&nbsp; for&nbsp; the said Ng Yoc&nbsp; Siu and that&nbsp; thereafter the court order the issuance of the corresponding certificate of naturalization of said Ng Yoc Siu&nbsp; for the benefit of his widow and children.&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of this&nbsp; prayer,&nbsp; Chua Chian alleged that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the naturalization case above&nbsp; mentioned a decision&nbsp; was rendered&nbsp; on November 28,&nbsp; 1941, granting Philippine citizenship to Ng&nbsp; Yoc&nbsp; Siu but that due to the outbreak of the&nbsp; last war Ng Yoc Siu was not able&nbsp; to&nbsp; take&nbsp; the required&nbsp; oath&nbsp; of&nbsp; allegiance;&nbsp; and that before a certificate&nbsp; of naturalization&nbsp; could&nbsp; be issued to him,&nbsp; he died on&nbsp; December 28, 1944, leaving a widow, who is herself,&nbsp; and&nbsp; two minor children, the aforementioned Ng Siu&nbsp; Hong&nbsp; and&nbsp; Marcelino&nbsp; Ng&nbsp; Siu&nbsp; Lim.</p><p>The second petition was opposed by the Solicitor General on various grounds, and the court having denied it,&nbsp; Chua Chian and her two alleged children filed the&nbsp; present petition for&nbsp; "certiorari and&nbsp; mandamus,"&nbsp; praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; this Court order the&nbsp; judge below—</p><p></p><blockquote>"to immediately&nbsp; issue an order allowing the&nbsp; petitioner, as widow of the deceased Ng&nbsp; Yoc&nbsp; Siu,&nbsp; to give&nbsp; the oath of allegiance in his behalf in Case No. R-681, entitled 'In&nbsp; the Matter of the Petition for Reconstitution&nbsp; of the Case Entitled "In the&nbsp; Matter of the Petition for Naturalization&nbsp; of Ng Yoc Siu,&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 681," Chua Chian, Petitioner', and after giving&nbsp; said oath of allegiance, to order issuance of the&nbsp; corresponding certificate of&nbsp; naturalization of Ng Yoc Siu, for the benefit of the&nbsp; widow and her children above-named."</blockquote><p></p><p>Without need of going&nbsp; into&nbsp; all of the questions raised by the parties, we think that the petition must be denied.</p><p>The taking of an oath is a personal matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of those things which by their very&nbsp; nature cannot be done by one person for another.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; the one required to take the oath in this case&nbsp; is already dead, it would be absurd to allow any other person to take&nbsp; it for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; becomes more apparent when one examines the&nbsp; form of oath provided&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Naturalization&nbsp; Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; that oath the candidate&nbsp; for&nbsp; naturalization solemnly declares that he renounces&nbsp; his&nbsp; allegiance and&nbsp; fidelity&nbsp; to&nbsp; his former sovereign, accepts the supreme authority&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Government of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; and&nbsp; promises to&nbsp; support&nbsp; and defend its constitution and observe its laws.&nbsp; How, we may ask, could a dead&nbsp; person be bound to do the things stipulated in the above oath?</p><p>The petition asks that the court below allow&nbsp; petitioner to do that&nbsp; which, it&nbsp; is obvious, cannot legally be done. The petition must be,&nbsp; as it is hereby, denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; With costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em>&nbsp; and<em> Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div><p></p>
