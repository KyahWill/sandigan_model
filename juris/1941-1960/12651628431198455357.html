				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal&nbsp; interposed by the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration&nbsp; against the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila, enjoining him from proceeding with the&nbsp; arrest and investigation of Tan Soo <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>So Wa, for purposes of deportation.<br><br>On December&nbsp; 8, 1954, Olegario&nbsp; Brito, a&nbsp; citizen of the Philippines, married&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Soo alias So Wa&nbsp; in the British Crown&nbsp; Colony&nbsp; of Hongkong.&nbsp; The latter came to&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; on February 9, 1955.&nbsp; After due investigation, the&nbsp; Board of Special Inquiry rendered&nbsp; a decision dated February 18,&nbsp; 1955, finding Tan Soo alias So Wa to be the lawful wife of a&nbsp; Filipino citizen,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereby admitted her&nbsp; as&nbsp; a Philippine&nbsp; citizen.&nbsp; As this decision was&nbsp; confirmed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board of Commissioners,&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Soo&nbsp; was accordingly allowed to&nbsp; land.<br><br>On January 16, 1957,&nbsp; however, the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration issued a warrant of arrest against Tan Soo alias So&nbsp; Wa, on account of the discovery of the marriage contract&nbsp; between Olegario Brito and one Narcisa Maya entered into in Manila on July 17,&nbsp; 1943,&nbsp; before Municipal Judge&nbsp; Mariano-Nable.&nbsp; To prevent her arrest upon a warrant&nbsp; issued in order to show&nbsp; cause why she should not be deported, Tan Soo alias&nbsp; So Wa,&nbsp; jointly with her husband,&nbsp; brought&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; prohibition, mandamus&nbsp; and&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; with preliminary injunction against&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Immigration&nbsp; before the; Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; On January 23 1957, the lower court issued a writ of preliminary injunction, ordering the respondent Commissioner of Immigration to desist and refrain from arresting and/or molesting petitioner Tan&nbsp; Soo alias So Wa.&nbsp; On March 27, 1957, after the respondent Commissioner had&nbsp; filed&nbsp; his answer&nbsp; and the petitioners presented their reply, the lower court rendered judgment in favor of the petitioners, requiring the respondent&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; to refrain from arresting or deporting petitioner&nbsp; Tan Soo alias So Wa until a final decision has been rendered by&nbsp; a competent&nbsp; court&nbsp; on the issues raised in said proceeding.&nbsp; Hence, this appeal.<br><br>The pivotal issue is whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Commissioner of Immigration has the power to determine the validity of the marriage contracted by the petitioners for the purpose of arresting and deporting Tan Soo <i>alias</i> So Wa.&nbsp; There is no question that the power to deport is limited to aliens, that the citizenship of the respondent in deportation proceedings is determinative of the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Immigration, and that the, power to deport carries that of determining the respondent's nationality.&nbsp; But if&nbsp; the question of nationality is dependent upon the validity of the respondent's marriage, may the&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration pass judgment thereon?<br><br>The lower court ruled against&nbsp; appellant Commissioner of Immigration.&nbsp; The latter, however,&nbsp; drew a distinction between&nbsp; a voidable&nbsp; marriage and one which is void&nbsp; <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp; He argues that in the first case the court may be correct, but in the second, where the marriage&nbsp; is void <i>ab initio</i>, the Commissioner of Immigration may pass upon the validity&nbsp; of said&nbsp; marriageâ€”no judicial decree being necessary to establish its nullity.<br><br>It is true that in relation to the marriage of&nbsp; petitioners no assumption' can arise&nbsp; or should be&nbsp; made from the mere discovery, of a marriage contract between Olegario Brito and Narcisa Maya executed&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1943, without proof that the first wife was still alive or that said first marriage was otherwise still subsisting in&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a matter of fact, it is to be supposed that&nbsp; the marriage between the herein petitioners in 1954 is&nbsp; valid, altho this is only a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> presumption which may be overcome by evidence that it was contracted during the lifetime of Narcisa&nbsp; Maya and before&nbsp; the first marriage of Olegario Brito was annulled or dissolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, these considerations going into the validity of the marriage of petitioners are not&nbsp; an obstacle to the&nbsp; preliminary proceedings to be conducted in this&nbsp; particular case&nbsp; by the appellant Commissioner of Immigration pursuant to Sec. 37 (a)&nbsp; of the Philippine Immigration Act, as amended, to determine whether or not a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case exists against appellee Tan Soo alias So Wa to warrant her deportation.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is reversed, without&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera, </i> and <i>Gutirrez&nbsp; David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
