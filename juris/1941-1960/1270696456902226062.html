				G.R. No. L-1225, December 17, 1947</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PIO ANULAT, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>HILADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a well considered decision the Fourth Division of the People's Court under 
date of November 12, 1946, convicted appellant Pio Anulat of the high crime of 
treason without any modifying circumstance, and imposed upon him the penalty of 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>, with the accessories of the law, and a fine of 
P10,000, plus the costs of the action.
<p>About midnight of July 8, 1943, appellant, a Filipino citizen, unexpectedly 
and in company with two Japanese soldiers in plain clothes, entered a building 
called "nepa" in Biñan, Laguna, where people who had access therein used to 
gamble. Each of the three carried a revolver. Upon entering the building, 
revolver in hand, appellant asked the crowd. "Is Amado de Ocampo here? Don't run 
all of you, or else you would be killed." Amado de Ocampo, who was there, in 
turn inquired: "Why will you apprehend me? I have not done anything wrong." To 
which appellant retorted: "You are needed by our captain in Garrison No. 2," 
making evident reference to the schoolhouse in the poblacion of Biñan, which was 
then being utilized as a Japanese garrison. Forthwith, appellant and his 
Japanese companions arrested Ocampo and took him away. Ocampo was a member of 
the local ROTC guerilla unit, and of him nothing has ever seen or heard again. 
These facts have been duly and beyond reasonable doubt established under count 
1.</p>
<p>Under count 2, the evidence proves also beyond reasonable doubt that in the 
month of December, 1944, a unit of the Makapili was organized in Biñan, Laguna, 
among the purposes of which the prosecution in this case specifically points to 
the following: "* * * to fight the common enemies side by side with * * * Asians 
on any front of the present war;" "to collaborate unreservedly and unstintedly 
with the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in the Philippines in such ways and 
means as may in the joint judgment of the Imperial Japanese Forces and the 
Association be deemed necessary and fruitful", and otherwise to give every 
possible moral, material and military aid to the enemy for the attainment of his 
victory in the last war. (<em>See also</em> Exhibit A-1.) Appellant was one of 
the organizers of that unit, the headquarters of which was located in the old 
municipal building. He was the head of that unit and was called "captain" by his 
men, who were mostly recruited from the different barrios of the municipality. 
He conducted their military drills and exercises, giving his commands in the 
Japanese language. Armed with a revolver, he was constantly in the company of 
Japanese soldiers, some of whom would visit the Makapili headquarters, or of 
other Makapili members, armed like him, going around confiscating foodstuffs and 
other supplies from the civilians. He lead and accompanied patrol units for the 
apprehension and arrest of guerrilla suspects, among whom were Segundo 
Pagtakhan, Martin Austria, Gaspar Peña, and Martin Castila. And when the arrival 
of the American liberation forces in Biñan became imminent, appellant, with 
other Makapili members, retreated with the Japanese forces to the mountains.</p>
<p>In view of the above facts, which the Fourth Division of the People's Court, 
whose members saw and heard the witnesses for the prosecution as well as those 
for the defense testify, found to have been established beyond reasonable doubt, 
with full compliance with the two-witness rule as regards the overt acts, said 
court passed sentence as above mentioned.</p>
<p>The defense, in our opinion, has not succeeded in showing any error of fact 
or of law in the judgment appealed from, and we find none in the record.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>In the result. Appellant is co-responsible for 
the disappearance of Amado de Ocampo.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>We concur in the decision in so far as it finds appellant guilty of treason 
under count No. 1 of the information, for his intervention in the arrest of 
guerrilla Amado de Ocampo. His guilt under said count is enough under the law to 
justify the sentence of the lower court, which we affirm.</p>We are not, 
however, in a position to agree with the majority decision finding appellant 
guilty under count No. 2 of the information, as the evidence on record is not 
sufficient to prove, beyond all reasonable doubt, that he joined the 
<em>Makapili</em> in December, 1944, as one of the organizers thereof, and as to 
his retreating with the Japanese forces to the mountains upon arrival of the 
American forces of liberation, the only evidence on record is the hearsay 
testimony of one witness.</div>
