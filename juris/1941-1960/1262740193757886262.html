				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal is taken from a decision&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila, in its Civil Case No. 21049, dismissing&nbsp; the action upon plea&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>. ,By&nbsp; complaint of October 27,&nbsp; 1953, plaintiff sought&nbsp; to recover&nbsp; from defendant, a former selling agent, (1) the sum of P700 allegedly misappropriated by said defendant; (2) P3,033.53 as the total amount corresponding to the face value&nbsp; of and interests&nbsp; on a promisorry note in plaintiff's favor, secured by a chattel mortgage; and&nbsp; (3) P2,000&nbsp; by way of&nbsp; damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant pleaded <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> on the basis of a&nbsp; prior&nbsp; final judgment rendered.in 1949 by the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Legaspi&nbsp; City (Case No. 8) in favor of defendant and against plaintiif; and another judgment rendered in 1952 by the Court of First instance of Manila (Case No.&nbsp; 9991)&nbsp; acquitting&nbsp; defendant of&nbsp; the charge&nbsp; of estafa by misappropriation brought by the plaintiff Company&nbsp; and counterclaimed for P3,500 attorney's fees and moral damages.<br><br>The case&nbsp; was submitted to the Court of First Instance upon the following stipulation of facts:<br><blockquote>"1. That the defendant had been an accredited agent of the plaintiff in&nbsp; the sale of the Matter's, machineries in the Bicol region and entitled as such to a five (5%)&nbsp; per cent commission on all sales made&nbsp; by him.<br><br>2. That while still an agent of&nbsp; the plaintiff, the defendant made several sales among which was one in favor of Masculo' Calpe.&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; likewise purchased for&nbsp; himself a&nbsp; set&nbsp; of&nbsp; engines&nbsp; and accessories.&nbsp; These&nbsp; two accounts&nbsp; are the principal&nbsp; subject-matter of the present action.<br><br>3. That on March 3, 1949, the defendant commenced an action (Exhibit "1")&nbsp; against herein&nbsp; plaintiif with&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Legaspi City (Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 8)&nbsp; for the recovery of unpaid commission from sales made by him to his various customers, including that in favor of Masculo&nbsp; Calpe,&nbsp; heretofore mentioned, and that in his own&nbsp; favor likewise&nbsp; adverted&nbsp; to in the preceding- paragraph.<br><br>4. That herein plaintiff, as defendant in the said Civil Case, filed an answer dated March 14, 1949&nbsp; (Exhibit "2")&nbsp; setting up therein affirmative defenses and&nbsp; counterclaims which&nbsp; had something to do with the various&nbsp; collections allegedly made, by herein defendant from the&nbsp; different customers enumerated in the answer as&nbsp; already mentioned among which was that supposedly paid by Masculo Calpe and&nbsp; the obligation personally incurred by herein defendant himself— the&nbsp; same accounts&nbsp; made&nbsp; the subject-matter of the&nbsp; claims set forth in the&nbsp; complaint in this case,&nbsp; particularly in&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (3) to (6)&nbsp; thereof. &nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; That instead of' personally&nbsp; appearing during the trial of the case, herein plaintiff,&nbsp; thru ¦ counsel,&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; 'Constancia'&nbsp; (Exhibit "3")&nbsp; waiving appearance and submitting&nbsp; the case&nbsp; on the&nbsp; answer filed. &nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; That after receiving the evidence'adduced by herein&nbsp; defendant as plaintiff, the trial court&nbsp; rendered judgment (Exhibit "4") granting the principal demand- of the&nbsp; herein plaintiff&nbsp; and dismissing the counterclaims pleaded by therein&nbsp; defendant for lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence,<br><br>7.&nbsp; That herein&nbsp; plaintiff failed to'perfect an appeal on time from the&nbsp; said decision but&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; to&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; (Exhibit "5"), later&nbsp; amended,&nbsp; (Exhibit "6")&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by herein&nbsp; plaintiff with the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance, of&nbsp; Albay, docketed as case&nbsp; No. 584,&nbsp; on the grounds&nbsp; therein plaintiff&nbsp; stated namely among others, ¦ (a)&nbsp; that a&nbsp; criminal case for estafa filed against&nbsp; herein&nbsp; defendant involving the same claims set up as affirmative defenses and counter-claims was&nbsp; then&nbsp; pending before this&nbsp; Court .in&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 9991, (6) if given a chance to&nbsp; be heard on the merits, herein plaintiff can prove its good and&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; defense and its&nbsp; counterclaim,; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Legaspi City had&nbsp; no jurisdiction over its counterclaims&nbsp; and it had always been&nbsp; the intention of said&nbsp; plaintiff to have, the case elevated&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance' of Albay. &nbsp;<br><br>8.&nbsp; That the said&nbsp; petition was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Hermogenes Caluag of the Court of First&nbsp; of Instance of Albay in his order dated October 3,&nbsp; 1949&nbsp; (Exlhibit "7").&nbsp; Thus, the case was elevated to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Albay and bore&nbsp; docket&nbsp; number 684&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Court.<br><br>9.&nbsp; That having been&nbsp; set for trial, herein plaintiff filed a&nbsp; motion for continuance&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "8")&nbsp; insisting&nbsp; on&nbsp; a suspension&nbsp; of&nbsp; said proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; view of the pendency&nbsp; of Criminal Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 9991 heretofore referred&nbsp; to. &nbsp;<br><br>10. That said&nbsp; motion was denied in an&nbsp; order&nbsp; (Exhibit "9") issued by the&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Juan R.&nbsp; Liwag dated&nbsp; August&nbsp; 9, 1951, and, in the same order, for failure to&nbsp; proseucte' its&nbsp; appeal, the' same was dismissed and the judgment of the Municipal&nbsp; Court in Case No. 8. was&nbsp; thereby revived.<br><br>11. That&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order of dismissal was denied fay the same Judge&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "10").<br><br>12. That&nbsp; a petition for certiorari later amended.&nbsp; (Exhibit "11") was filed with the Supreme Court assailing, the validity of the order of .dismissal.&nbsp; Said case was docketed as G. R. No. L-5135 of the Supreme Court.<br><br>13. That&nbsp; respective memorandum by the parties—(Exhibit "12"— herein defendant)&nbsp; and-(Exhibit "13"—herein&nbsp; plaintiff) together with a reply memorandum by herein defendant (Exhibit "14") were filed with the . Supreme Court, after which&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; resolved to&nbsp; deny the writ applied&nbsp; for&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "15"). ,<br><br>14. That&nbsp; judgment was rendered in Criminal Case No. 9991&nbsp; (Exhibit "16")&nbsp; acquitting the herein defendant from the offense of estafa charged in&nbsp; the information&nbsp; (Exhibit "17").&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ree,&nbsp; App., pp. 19-23.)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint stating:<br><blockquote>"Be los hechos arriba admitidos por las partes salta a la vista, el hec-ho de que esta causa es res judicaia y,&nbsp; por tanto, impide la incoacion de la presente causa, porque las sentencias arriba referidas son finales y han sido ya ejecutadas; porque los tribunal esque habian rendido&nbsp; las citadas. sentencias, tenian juiisdiccion&nbsp; sobre la njateria y las&nbsp; partes; porque las eitadas sentencias se habian basadoen los ) meritos,&nbsp; y&nbsp; porque hubo identidad de partes, causa&nbsp; de&nbsp; aecifai y la . niisma materia litigiosa.'<br><br>Por tanto, el Juzgado sobresee esta causa con las costas a la parte demahdaiite."&nbsp; (Rec.&nbsp; App.,&nbsp; pp. 23-24.)'</blockquote>The plaintiff&nbsp; then appealed to this Court&nbsp; upon questions of law, assigning the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DOCTRINE OF, RES&nbsp; ADJUDICATA&nbsp; OBTAINS&nbsp; IN THE ABOVE-ENTITLED&nbsp; CASE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE TRIAL,&nbsp; COURT ERRED IN&nbsp; NOT&nbsp; AWARDING TO HEREIN&nbsp; APPELLANT, AS PLAINTIFF&nbsp; IN THE&nbsp; APPEALED CASE NO'. 21049, THE AMOUNT OF&nbsp; P5,733;SS WITH INTEREST THEREON FROM OCTOBER 27/ 1953."&nbsp; (Appellant's Brief, p. 1')<br></blockquote>We agree that&nbsp; the court&nbsp; below erred&nbsp; in holding that plaintiff's action herein was barred by<i> res judicata</i>&nbsp; With regard to the judgment&nbsp; of acquittal in the criminal&nbsp; case, No. 9991 of the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila, the decision&nbsp; (Exhibit "16")'clearly expresses that the acquittal was for the reason that "the&nbsp; evidence presented is not sufficient to establish his guilt&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt," and because—<br><blockquote>"this court is inclined to&nbsp; sustain the theory laid down by the accused, to&nbsp; the effect that the complainant should have&nbsp; first required of him a&nbsp; liquidation of the&nbsp; accounts under his&nbsp; control in1 order to determine the amount&nbsp; due the complainant and that of the accused as agent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; believes and so holds that in the absence of such an accounting1 and the&nbsp; demand&nbsp; thereafter, the crime&nbsp; of estafa does not He."&nbsp; (Exhibit "16", pp. 6-7.)<br></blockquote>As can be seen, the decision of acquittal does not negate the fact&nbsp; alleged in&nbsp; the present&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; that defendant, as&nbsp; agent of the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; withheld part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; moneys that he&nbsp; received for his principal.&nbsp; On the contrary, the decision, Exhibit&nbsp; 16, expressly finds—<br><blockquote>"(2) that there is no question&nbsp; also&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused has retained certain sums of money as appearing: in the documentary evidence presented."&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "16",&nbsp; p. 4.)<br></blockquote>It follows that the right&nbsp; of the principal to recover in a civil action the moneys retained by the agent&nbsp; has not been&nbsp; barred by the acquittal in the&nbsp; criminal case, since the&nbsp; latter was acquitted upon reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; (New Civil&nbsp; Code, Article 29)., and the judgment does not declare that the basis&nbsp; of the civil action (retention by the agent of the moneys belonging to the principal) does not&nbsp; exist (Rule 107, section&nbsp; 1, paragraph. d) Precisely, the existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; such basis&nbsp; for the&nbsp; civil action was expressly recognized.<br><br>Nor is the&nbsp; action of&nbsp; the plaintiff-appellant precluded by&nbsp; the 1949 judgment of the Municipal Court of&nbsp; Legaspi City&nbsp; in its&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; S (Exhibit 4), for the reason that the counterclaim&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; appellant in said case was to recover the sums allegedly&nbsp; retained by defendant Quintano as its&nbsp; agent totalling P6,178.98 plus P8,500' as damages (Exhibit 2).&nbsp;&nbsp; Award of that amount was clearly beyond the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court; hence, its&nbsp; dismissal of the counterclaim was inoperative to bar a subsequent&nbsp; suit to enforce the same.&nbsp; (Pamintuan&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tiglao, 53 Phil. 1; Yu Lay <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Calmes, 40 Phil. 660; Bernardo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Genato, 11 Phil. 603.)&nbsp; The want of jurisdiction was not cured&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of plaintiff's&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance, since the latter merely revived the appealed&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; Legaspi&nbsp; Municipal Court.&nbsp; The revival could not validate&nbsp; that portion of the appealed judgment which was void for want of jurisdiction.<br><br>It can not be contended that by submitting the counter-claim of P14.678.98&nbsp; to the Municipal Court, plaintiff conferred upon it jurisdiction over the claim, or that plaintiff became estopped from contesting such jurisdiction, since it is elementary that jurisdiction over the subject matter is only conferred by law.<br><br>For the above reasons, we&nbsp; hold that&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of the present&nbsp; action by the trial court on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of <i>res judicata </i>was improper and erroneous. As defendant relied solely on the defense of r<span style="font-style: italic;">es judicata</span> and submitted the&nbsp; case for decision on that issuse, he is deemed&nbsp; to have admitted&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; material allegations&nbsp; of the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, judgment may&nbsp; be rendered, as&nbsp; it is hereby rendered, in favor of plaintiff-appellant for all amounts claimed in&nbsp; its complaint, i.e.,&nbsp; P3,733.53 under its first cause of&nbsp; action, and P2,000 under&nbsp; its second cause .of action, plus&nbsp; interests.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from is reversed and defendant-appellee is hereby ordered to pay plaintiff-appellant the total of P5,733.53, with&nbsp; legal interest from the time of the filing of the complaint&nbsp; up to full payment.
