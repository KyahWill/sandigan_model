				G.R. No. L-919, November 28, 1946</h4>
				<H3>ELENA GONZALES, PETITIONER, VS. BONIFACIO YSIP, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, AND ADELA VELASQUEZ, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Among the records of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan which were lost 
prior to the liberation of the Philippines is that of civil case No. 118, Elena 
Gonzales vs. Adela Velasquez. In a petition dated April 27, 1946, filed in said 
court by the attorney for the plaintiff (petitioner herein), it was prayed that 
the documents accompanying the petition—complaint dated July 21, 1943; answer 
dated August 30, 1943; motion for postponement dated January 28, 1944; minutes 
of the session of November 27, 1944; testimony of the plaintiff and her 
witnesses duly subscribed and sworn to by them; decision dated December 14, 
1944,— be admitted, and that thereafter the case be declared duly reconstituted. 
The attorney for the defendant (one of the respondents herein) interposed an 
opposition to the admission of the minutes, testimony, and decision on the 
ground that the proceedings evidenced thereby were illegal, it being alleged in 
this connection that the deputy clerk of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan 
was not authorized to receive the evidence, that the said respondent or her 
attorney never received any notice of the trial supposed to have been held on 
November 27, 1944, or of the decision dated December 14, 1944. In his order 
dated August 2, 1946, Judge Bonifacio Ysip (another respondent herein) rejected 
the documents thus objected to and ordered the parties to again adduce their 
respective evidence.</p>
<p>This order is being complained of in the present petition for certiorari and 
mandamus as being in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent Judge or 
constituting an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>The only purpose of the reconstitution of a case is to restore its record in 
its status QUO and, therefore, in the proceedings for reconstitution, the court 
and the parties should concern themselves solely with the question of whether 
the documents presented for purposes of reconstitution are authentic and really 
formed part of the original record.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the attorney for the respondents did not impugn the 
correctness of the papers in question and iimited his objection to their binding 
or legal effect. Indeed, the authentic character of the documents could not be 
seriously doubted, because they were certified under oath by the attorney for 
the petitioner, in his petition dated April 27, 1946, as being true copies, and 
because the decision in dispute was further certified by the deputy clerk of the 
respondent court. Hence, the latter was bound, under the provision of Act No. 
3110, to admit the same. Whether the proceedings purported to be shown by said 
documents are valid, or not, is a question which the attorney for the 
respondents may raise in due time after the case shall have been declared duly 
reconstituted. In other words, the reconstitution of a case does not preclude a 
party from seeking, in the manner indicated by the Rules of Court, relief from 
the effects of any judgment, order or other proceeding.</p>
<p>The order of the respondent judge of August 2, 1946, is hereby set aside and 
he is ordered to admit the documents specified in the petition dated April 27, 
1946, and thereafter to declare civil case No. 118 duly reconstituted. So 
ordered, with costs against the respondent Adela Velasquez.</p>

Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
