				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This appeal is from the Court of First Instance of Misamis 
Occidental, which found the appellants guilty of the crime of murder 
qualified by treachery and sentenced them to 20 years of imprisonment 
and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P2,000.  
Credibility of the witnesses is the sole issue.
  <p>    Two eye-witnesses testified for the prosecution and their 
testimony may be condensed as follows:</p>
  <p>    On May 12, 1948, at about two p.m., Atanacio Otom and Demetria 
Otom, father and daughter, on their way to their farm stopped at the 
house of Faustino Segovia, one of the defendants, whose common-law wife 
was Atanacio's niece.  Demetria, after asking permission from Faustino, 
walked straight to the kitchen upstairs to get rife which she intended 
to take along, leaving her father and Faustino in the yard.  Needing a 
receptable on which to put lighted charcoal, she came back to the portal
 of the house and requested her father to hand her a coconuthusk or 
shell.  As Atanacio stooped to pick one from the ground, Faustino 
suddenly and treacherously hacked him with a bolo in the nape, knocking 
him down.  When the deceased was stretched on the ground on his stomach,
 the two defendants, who are brothers and were each armed with a bolo, 
cut him up.  Atanacio sustained eleven ghastly wounds all in the back 
from the base of the head to the thighs.</p>
  <p>    The two witnesses referred to above were Demetria Otom and her 
cousin, Francisco Otom, who lived near by in a house from which he said 
he could see the attack.</p>
  <p>    These witnesses' testimony, which the trial court believed, 
appears forthright and natural and leaves no room for reasonable doubt 
as to its veracity.  It is otherwise with respect to the defendants' 
evidence which suffers from serious flaws.</p>
  <p>    The defense version of the occurrence in a nutshell was that 
Anatacio Otom slapped Faustino's wife (concubine), Feliciana Otom, in 
the face when she reminded Atanacio of his debt; that Feliciana upon 
being struck called out for her husband who was then tending his carabao
 in the field not far away; that Faustino Segovia thinking from his 
wife's screams that his house was on fire because he saw smoke, ran to 
his house only to find not fire but Atanacio as a man of violent temper,
 he climbed up the steps and closed the door but Atanacio with his bolo 
followed him breaking or pulling the frail shutter; that inside the 
house Faustino was cornered behind the altar and tried the best he could
 to defend himself with his own bold; that from the house he escaped to 
the yard whereupon Atanacio lept from the kitchen and tried to wrest his
 (Faustino's) weapon; that at this stage of the fight, "the husky 
aggressor," in the words of counsel, "found the fatal end of his 
turbulent life in the hands of a small and weak husband of the very 
woman whom he had just slapped." Julian Segovia, on his part, denied any
 part in the killing except to snatch Atanacio's bolo from his waist as 
Atanacio was going up the house chasing Faustino.</p>
  <p>    The defendants' story was contradicted by Lt. Camilo Alegarme 
of the Philippine Constabulary, who proceeded to the scene of the crime 
late in the afternoon of the day in question after the defendants 
presented themselves at the constabulary headquarters and told him that 
they had slain "somebody."  The officer stated that the household 
articles in the dwelling were not in disorder, nor did he find any blood
 inside.  The supposed bloodstains splattered on the sidings of the 
house, he said, were dry black saliva.  He declared that it was only on 
the spot where Atanacio fell dead where he came upon blood â€” pools of 
it.</p>
  <p>    The latter statement is mute evidence of the prosecution's 
theory that the shocking incident occurred entirely outside the house, 
and in the manner narrated by Demetria and Francisco Otom.  The absence 
of any injury on Faustino while Atanacio sustained eleven long and deep 
cuts all in the back or the side, inspite of the great disparity in 
height, weight and strength between the two men, disparity which the 
defense unwittingly stresses, is not quite consistent with the 
appellants' story but does dovetail with Demetria's to the effect that 
the first blow was dealt while her father was bent forward and the 
succeeding ones when he was sprawled on the ground face down.  The 
admitted fact that Atanacio's bolo was never used is further 
confirmation of the prosecution's theory and belies at the same time the
 defense version that the deceased provoked and started the aggression 
and had the upper hand until he was felled down.  Julian stated that he 
grabbed and got Atanacio's bolo with its scabbard from Atanacio's waist 
when its owner was running up the steps in pursuit of Faustino, 
although, according to Demetria, whose testimony tallies with the 
court's finding, Julian removed her father's knife from Atanacio's waist
 when Atanacio was already dead, by cutting the string with which it was
 fastened to Atanacio's belt.  The trial Judge, who examined the knife 
which was exhibited in court, verified the truth of Demetria's 
testimony, having noticed that the string still attached to the sheath 
bore clear signs of having been cut with a sharp instrument.</p>
  <p>    Coming to the denial by Julian Segovia of any participation in 
the crime, Lt. Alegarme declared that both defendants admitted to him 
having slain the deceased.  The surrender of this accused to the 
constabulary when the authorities were not looking for him is clear 
proof of consciousness of wrong-doing.  It would be extraordinary that a
 man who, in his conscience, has done no wrong and for whom there was no
 order of arrest would give himself up to the police of his own 
violation.</p>
  <p>    What transpired before Demetria came back to the doorway and 
saw her father butchered is not shown.  But it can be surmised, in the 
light of the known strained relationship between Atanacio and Faustino, 
that during the brief moments that the girl was in the kitchen, 
Atanacio, who was said to be impulsive, did or said something which 
taxed Faustino's patience.  It would appear that Atanacio did not look 
with favor upon his niece's cohabitation with Faustino without benefit 
of clergy and that the latter resented the old man's meddling or 
attitude.  It is admitted that about two years before, there was a fight
 or near-fight between the now deceased and Faustino Segovia.  And 
according to Demetria, Faustino, in the course of a quarrel with his 
concubine not long before the murder, told her, "Have your relatives 
defend you, I am not afraid of them."</p>
  <p>    The crime committed was murder as charged mitigated by the 
circumstance of voluntary surrender with no aggravating circumstance to 
offset it.  The confinement to which the trial court sentenced the 
defendants is therefore correct except that its denomination should be <i>reclusion
 temporal</i> instead of plain imprisonment.  There is a difference 
between the two terms in the matter of legal accessories.  And as to the
 indemnity, the amount should, in the interest of uniformity, be raised 
to P6,000, to be paid jointly and severally by the appellants.</p>
  <p>    With the above changes, the appealed sentenced will be 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, 
Reyes, Jugo,</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>
    Bautista Angelo, J.,</i> no part.</p>
