				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by  certiorari under Rule 46 by the Republic  of the Philippines to set aside a  judgment rendered by the Court  of Appeals which  reversed that of the Court  of First  Instance  of  Manila,  declaring  forfeited  the surety bond in the sum of P30,000 filed by the respondent Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Company, Inc. for the  provisional release of  Chung Kiat  Kang  whose  deportation as an undesirable alien  had been ordered by the President of the Republic. <br><br>On 27  June 1947 the President ordered the deportation of Chung Kiat  Kang as an  undesirable  alien.  The  latter moved for reconsideration of the deportation order, and pending  action thereon he was allowed to  be  at liberty upon the filing of a  surety bond,  the  pertinent parts  of which will be mentioned in the course of this opinion.  On 3 July 1947  the Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Company, Inc. filed the bond.  The  other  two respondents  are sureties of  the  counterbond.  On 3  May  1949 the petition for reconsideration  of the  deportation  order  was  denied. Thereupon, the Commissioner of Immigration required the alien to  appear and report to him but  he failed to do so. On 16 May  1949 the Commissioner  declared  the  surety bond forfeited, of  which forfeited the surety  was  notified the following day, and demanded  from it the payment of the  amount  of the surety bond within 24 hours.  The surety having  failed  to pay the amount of the bond  as demanded by  the  Commissioner of Immigration,  on   1 August 1949 a complaint  was filed in the  Court of  First Instance of Manila for  the forfeiture of the surety  bond. <br><br>After trial, on  5 January 1952  the Court  of  First Instance of Manila rendered judgment declaring forfeited the surety bond of P30,000  filed by the  Manila  Surety &amp;  Fidelity Company,  Inc. for  the  provisional release  of Chung Kiat  Kang  pending action on his petition for reconsideration of the deportation order, 6 per cent interest thereon from the date of the filing of the  complaint  until paid, and costs; and ordering Cheng Ban Yek &amp; Company, Ltd. and Chung Liu,  the  sureties of the counterbond, to pay the  Manila Surety  &amp;  Fidelity Company, Inc. any amount the latter  shall have paid  unto the Republic  of the Philippines,  6  per cent interest thereon, 15 per cent on  the amount  as  attorney's  fees, and  costs.  From that judgment all the defendants  appealed. <br><br>At the hearing in the Court  of Appeals  counsel for the appellants, the surety  and the counter sureties, filed copies of official documents marked  as Exhibits "1-AppeaI" and "2-Appeal" for admission as additional evidence  to  show that the  Chairman of the Deportation Board authorized the release and/or cancellation  of  the cash and surety bonds filed in behalf of Chung Kiat Kang by the Manila Surety  &amp; Fidelity Company, Inc. for  his temporary release in  connection with deportation case  No. R-13.  On the strength of  the two exhibits,  especially of Exhibit "2-Appeal", the Court of Appeals rendered judgment reversing that of the Court of  First Instance, because  it  is of the opinion  that the  release and/or cancellation authorized by  the Chairman of  the Commission  of Immigration is tantamount to  a release  of the surety  bond  filed in behalf of the alien. <br><br>The petitioner submits that the Court of Appeals  erred in- <br><blockquote>* * *  stating that  the counsel for the petitioner-appellant Republic of the Philippines  made no objection when counsel for other respondent-appellees presented as additional evidence copies of official documents marked Exhibits "1-AppeaI" and "2-Appeal." <br><br>* * * finding that the  release  of  the cash and surety  bonds of the principal Chung Kiat Kang in the instant case was authorized by  the Chairman of  the Commission of Immigration as  shown, according to the  respondent  court,  by Exhibit  "2-AppeaI." *  <br><br>* * *declaring "that  the  Commissioner of Immigration  or his duly authorized  representative, has  the inherent  discretionary  power to discharge or lift the forfeiture which he himself declared of the surety bond which he himself required to be filed in a deportation case," because Exhibit "2-Appeal" was not signed by the Chairman of  the Immigration Commission and that  the  surety  bond was required by the President. <br><br>* * * lifting the forfeiture of the surety  bond of P30,000 in its  entirety  in the exercise  of  its inherent  discretionary  power, even after final judgment, and even when  the  principal was  not produced before the Commissioner of Immigration and he did  not voluntarily appear before the trial court of first instance of Manila. <br><br>* * * holding that  the  revocation  of  the order  of  deportation, even if it was issued after the court had already assumed jurisdiction of the confiscation of  the bond and in fact it had already declared said bond forfeited could still have the  effect of  remitting the said  bond.</blockquote>Laying  aside the  question of whether the admission of Exhibits  "1-Appeal"  and "2-Appeal"  was legally correct, the only question  which requires determination  by  this Court is whether the  Chairman of the Deportation  Board was  authorized to  release or cancel  the cash  and surety bonds filed in  behalf  of the alien whose  deportation had been ordered.   By the failure of the alien to appear before the Commissioner  of Immigration  and to report to  him once a week as stipulated in  the surety bond, the  terms thereof were breached not only by the  principal but also by the surety, which  justified  the forfeiture of the bond by the Commissioner of  Immigration  and by  the Court. The reversal of the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila  by the Court of Appeals is predicated upon  a document  signed by  the  Chairman  of the  Deportation Board, where after reciting  that the  order of  deportation dated 27 June 1947 having been revoked by an order of the President dated 29 December 1953, and Chung Kiat Kang having been allowed to reside in the Philippines, the release&nbsp; and/or cancellation of the cash  and surety bonds filed in his behalf with the Bureau of  Immigration and the Deportation Board  for  his  temporary release in connection with  deportation case No. R-13  was authorized.  This is a misapprehension.  The Chairman of the Deportation Board is not clothed with authority to release  or  cancel the bonds.   The  revocation of  the order of  deportation does not have the effect  of setting" aside or annulling the forfeiture of the bond  ordered by the Commissioner of Immigration and by the Court of First Instance of Manila, because  the  terms of the  surety  bond  had already been breached by the  failure of the principal to appear  at the Immigration Commission when  required and  to  report to the Commissioner once a week as stipulated in the  surety bond.  The  revocatory order of  the  President  does not cancel or release  the principal and the surety from their recognizance or undertaking.  A contrary  view  would encourage aliens and their sureties to take lightly,  if not flout, their undertakings.  The  reversal of the  judgment of the Court of First Instance being predicated upon a misapprehension, to wit: that the Chairman of the Deportation Board is authorized to release the  principal and the  surety from their  undertaking, the  same  should be  reversed. This  conclusion  is arrived at  despite the provisions of section 1, paragraph (c), Executive Order No. 398, dated 5 January 1951,  47 Off.  Gaz., 6, thatâ€” <br><blockquote>Any respondent may file a bond with the Deportation Board in such amount and containing such conditions as the Chairman  of the Board may approve and prescribe: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>,  That if at any stage of the  proceedings it appears to the Board that there is strong evidence  against the respondent or there  is  strong probability of his escaping or evading the proceedings of  the Board, it may  order his  arrest and commitment.</blockquote>The  Chairman of the Deportation Board may  prescribe and approve the amount and terms of the bond that may be  filed by  any  respondent for his  release but nowhere in  the  aforesaid  executive order  is  he authorized  to  release the principal and the surety from a bond filed, especially after the terms thereof had been violated by both the principal and the  surety. <br><br>The judgment under review is reversed and the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila  rendered  in  the case is revived, with costs against the respondents  except the Court of Appeals. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
