				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for&nbsp; certiorari filed by Victor R. Potenciano,&nbsp; as&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Administrator of the Testate&nbsp; Estate of Conrado Potenciano,&nbsp; to&nbsp; review&nbsp; the resolution&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals&nbsp; of November&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1956, and December 10, 1956, in CA—G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. 13314—R.&nbsp; The facts&nbsp; of the case are as follows: <br><br>Sometime prior to February, 1954, Alfredo D. Benipayo instituted a civil action with the Court of First Instance of Manila against&nbsp; Conrado R, Potenciano for recovery&nbsp; of a sum of money (Civil Case No. 7173).&nbsp; The claim was duly&nbsp; set for hearing and after the parties had adduced their respective evidence, the Court rendered&nbsp; judgment dated February 19, 1954,&nbsp; dismissing the complaint as well as the counterclaim of&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; From&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision, plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA—G. R. No. 13314—R). <br><br>On August 6, 1954, and while the appeal was pending in said court, defendant&nbsp; Conrado Potenciano died and on November 10, 1954, Victor R. Potenciano, duly appointed special administrator of&nbsp; the estate of the deceased,&nbsp; filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">motion to dismiss</span> contending that the claim therein was not&nbsp; one that survives&nbsp; the decedent and as pursuant to Section 5, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court, said claim must be filed in the testate proceeding, it was prayed that "the CASE&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">be dismissed,&nbsp; without&nbsp; prejudice to the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant filing&nbsp; his claim with the Probate Court</span>". This motion which was not opposed by appellant Benipayo, was granted by the Court of Appeals in its order of November 13, 1954, which reads as follows: <br><br><blockquote>"Upon consideration of the motion&nbsp; filed by counsel&nbsp; for defendant-appellee in case CA-G. R. No. 13314r-R, Alberto Benipayo vs. Conrado&nbsp; Potenciano, etc., for the <span style="font-style: italic;">dismissal of the appeal</span>;&nbsp; and&nbsp; it appearing that the subject matter involved in the&nbsp; above-entitled case is a money claim against the appellee who died already,&nbsp; and testate proceedings has been filed for the settlement&nbsp; of the estate of the deceased;&nbsp; the Court RESOLVED to grant&nbsp; the motion".</blockquote> <br><br>Accordingly, appellant Benipayo presented&nbsp; his claim&nbsp; in Special&nbsp; Proceedings No.&nbsp; 23875 of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; The special&nbsp; administrator,&nbsp; however, filed&nbsp; an opposition to the introduction&nbsp; of evidence&nbsp; to support&nbsp; Benipayo's claim against the estate on the ground that for&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; to render&nbsp; decision based on&nbsp; such evidence would&nbsp; amount&nbsp; to&nbsp; a review&nbsp; of Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 7173 which was&nbsp; already passed&nbsp; upon and decided by&nbsp; a court of equal jurisdiction. <br><br>On July 19, 1956, the probate court issued&nbsp; a resolution holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of Alberto Benipayo could&nbsp; not be allowed in&nbsp; said proceedings&nbsp; for the reason that as the Court of Appeals&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">dismissed the appeal</span> in CA-G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. 13314-R, it worked as&nbsp; if no appeal had been interposed and&nbsp; the judgment of the lower court in&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 7173, therefore,&nbsp; could be enforced.&nbsp; Claimant&nbsp; Benipayo thus filed with the Court&nbsp; of Appeals a motion&nbsp; praying for a clarification&nbsp; of its order of November 13, 1954, as a result&nbsp; of&nbsp; which, said&nbsp; appellate court&nbsp; issued&nbsp; a resolution dated <span style="font-style: italic;">November&nbsp; 19, 1956</span>, to this wise:<br><br><blockquote>"Upon consideration of the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; filed by counsel&nbsp; for plaintiff-appellant in Case CA—G. R. No. 13314—R, entitled Alberto Benipayo vs. Conrado Potenciano,&nbsp; substituted by Dr.&nbsp; Victor L. Potenciano, praying, on the grounds therein alleged, that this&nbsp; Court issue an order clarifying its resolution dated November 13, 1954, the Court Resolved to clarify said resolution in the sense that&nbsp; the Case is dismissed without&nbsp; prejudice to the plaintiff-appellant filing his claim with&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; court in the testate proceedings of the estate of the defendant-appellee.&nbsp; Let the&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; this Court, dated November 13,&nbsp; 1954, stand thus CQrrected and clarified".</blockquote> <br><br>As&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of said&nbsp; resolution filed by&nbsp; defendant appellee&nbsp; was denied, Victor R. Potenciano, as special administrator of the estate of&nbsp; Conrado Potenciano, filed the instant petition for certiorari alleging that the appellate court acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the resolution of November 19, 1956, as affirmed by&nbsp; its resolution of December 10, 1956. <br><br>The records&nbsp; show that although defendant-appellee, in praying for the dismissal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; action&nbsp; then pending in the Court of Appeals, asks for the dismissal of the <span style="font-style: italic;">case</span>, the resolution of said Tribunal granting the same referred to the motion as one for the dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the <span style="font-style: italic;">appeal</span>.&nbsp; The significance&nbsp; of&nbsp; these terms in the case at bar&nbsp; lies in&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; claim which&nbsp; herein&nbsp; respondent Benipayo seeks&nbsp; to present and establish in the probate&nbsp; court was already&nbsp; the subject matter of Civil Case&nbsp; No. 7173, which was dismissed&nbsp; by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila and subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It is clear,&nbsp; therefore, that if what was dismissed by the Court of Appeals was the appeal,&nbsp; it would have the effect&nbsp; as if no such appeal&nbsp; has been interposed&nbsp; and the decision of the&nbsp; lower court in Civil Case No. 7173 had become&nbsp; enforceable; in which event, as correctly&nbsp; observed by&nbsp; the probate court, the presentation of the claim in the intestate proceedings&nbsp; would be&nbsp; improper.<br><br>However, if the dismissal referred to the case, as it was prayed by the very Special Administrator Victor&nbsp; R. Potenciano&nbsp; (the petitioner&nbsp; herein), because&nbsp; Benipayo's&nbsp; claim was not one that survived the decedent Potenciano and as <span style="font-style: italic;">pursuant to Section S, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court, said&nbsp; claim must be filed in the testate proceeding</span>—Special Proceedings No. 23875 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila—(as&nbsp; Benipayo did&nbsp; following&nbsp; the&nbsp; procedure outlined by said&nbsp; administrator), such&nbsp; dismissal would then have the effect of nullifying&nbsp; the entire proceedings in Civil Case No. 7173 and the&nbsp; decision thereon would not be a bar to the filing of the claim with the probate court.&nbsp; For this&nbsp; reason when the attention of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals was&nbsp; called&nbsp; to this fact,&nbsp; it&nbsp; issued a&nbsp; resolution clarifying the matter in&nbsp; order that&nbsp; the&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; in&nbsp; question may properly read as a motion to dismiss the <span style="font-style: italic;">case</span>. <br><br>Now, considering that the&nbsp; aforesaid resolution correcting its order of <span style="font-style: italic;">November 13, 1954</span>, was issued on <span style="font-style: italic;">November 19, 1956</span>, the question presented&nbsp; by the instant action is whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to effect such&nbsp; amendment&nbsp; long after&nbsp; said&nbsp; resolution has reached its&nbsp; finality. <br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; an elementary&nbsp; rule of&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; that&nbsp; after a decision, order or ruling has&nbsp; already become&nbsp; final, the court loses jurisdiction over the&nbsp; same and can no&nbsp; longer be subjected to any modification or alteration, <span style="font-style: italic;">except&nbsp; to correct misprints or clerical&nbsp; mistakes</span>.&nbsp; In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals granted the motion filed by defendant-appellee for the dismissal of the case, because "the subject matter involved in the above-entitled case is a money claim against the appellee&nbsp; who died already,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">and testate proceeding has been filed for the settlement of the estate&nbsp; of the deceased</span>".&nbsp; Said Tribunal, therefore, could&nbsp; not&nbsp; have dismissed the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; which was not asked&nbsp; for, because although a&nbsp; court&nbsp; may grant any relief allowed&nbsp; by law, said prerogative is delimited by the cardinal principle that it cannot grant anything more than what is prayed for by the movant.&nbsp; Certainly, the relief to be dispensed cannot rise above its source.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the circumstances&nbsp; of the instance case, the resolution in question should properly refer to the motion as one for the dismissal of the case, as prayed for, and not of the appeal alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inclusion of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">appeal</span> is to Our mind a clerical mistake on the part of the&nbsp; appellate court which could be&nbsp; corrected even after it had become final.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, there is no question that even during the lifetime&nbsp; of the deceased,&nbsp; Benipayo already ventilated Tiis claim in&nbsp; court&nbsp; and&nbsp; although for some undisclosed reason it was dismissed,&nbsp; this fact does not militate against the merit of his&nbsp; aforesaid claim.&nbsp; To bar him on technical grounds from establishing&nbsp; whatever right he may have in the intestate proceedings&nbsp; after the case was thrown out of court upon the administrator's own motion ostensibly to afford&nbsp; said claimant ample opportunity to present his claim in&nbsp; the probate court, would amount to a sacrifice of substantial rights of a litigant in the altar of&nbsp; sophisticated technicalities with impairment of the sacred principles&nbsp; of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; This We would like to avoid as&nbsp; much as possible, for rigid specifications set by the human mind may at times be relaxed so as to give way&nbsp; to the&nbsp; sense&nbsp; of&nbsp; fair play as recognized by&nbsp; equity when the peculiar circumstances of a case so warrant.&nbsp; As this Court has aptly said:<br><br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; litigation&nbsp; is not a. game of technicalities in which&nbsp; one, more deeply schooled&nbsp; and skilled&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; subtle&nbsp; art of&nbsp; movement and position, entraps and destroys the other" (Alonso vs.&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; 16 Phil. 315).</blockquote><br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; resolutions of, the Court of Appeals of November 19,&nbsp; 1956, and&nbsp; December 10, 1956, in CA-G. R. No. 13314-R, are affirmed and&nbsp; consequently, the writ of certiorari applied for is hereby denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; With costs against petitioner.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
