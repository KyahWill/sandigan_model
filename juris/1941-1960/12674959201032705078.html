				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellants instituted this <em>quo warranto</em> proceedings to seek 
reinstatement in the positions of police officers they were occupying in the 
Manila Police Department at the time the Pacific War broke out.
<p>At the time this case was decided in the lower court on September 30, 1947, 
with the exception of Bias Pineda and Wenceslao Ealdama, appellants had already 
been reinstated in the service and appointed to the respective offices they were 
occupying prior to the outbreak of the war. According to the lower court, Pineda 
and Ealdama were denied reinstatement for they had been removed from the service 
for cause.</p>
<p>This case was heard on January 10, 1948, on which date the city fiscal and 
assistant fiscals appearing for appellees filed a petition for the dismissal of 
the case upon the fact that all petitioners have been reinstated and are now 
occupying the respective positions they had at the outbreak of the war, 
including Bias Pineda and Wenceslao Ealdama, as certified in the accompanying 
sworn statement of Florencia Catindig, Major and administrative officer of the 
Manila Police Department, and supported by the joint affidavit of Pineda and 
Ealdama, where both asserted that they had been reinstated, except that their 
salaries have not been adjusted because of lack of appropriation and that, on 
account of the willingness of the administration to restore them to their 
previously held ranks, obstructed only by the absence of the corresponding 
appropriations, they are no longer interested in this <em>quo warranto</em> 
proceedings.</p>
<p>Appellants' lawyers filed on January 19, 1948, manifestation to the effect 
that, according to a letter they received from Ealdama, Pineda and Ealdama did 
not sign voluntarily their affidavit of January 10, 1948.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the letter of Ealdama alone cannot nullify the affidavit that he 
and Pineda have subscribed and sworn before a notary public on January 10, 1943. 
Ealdama's allegation that he signed the affidavit very reluctantly and that he 
did not sign it under oath cannot be taken seriously, not being supported by his 
oath nor corroborated by Pineda, his co-signer of the affidavit, aside from the 
consideration that a police officer, such as Ealdama, trained to face all kinds 
of dangers in the performance of his official duties, cannot be believed to have 
succumbed to an alleged fear of future consequences so as to sign an affidavit 
against his will.</p>
<p>Furthermore, appellants have not disputed appellee's allegation that Pineda 
and Ealdama have also been reinstated.<br><br>The reinstatement of all of the 
appellants has made this proceedings academic.</p>
<p>Appellants alleged that the lower court erred in not declaring 
unconstitutional Commonwealth Act No. 698.</p>
<p>The lower court, invoking the provision of Sec. 10 of Article VIII of the 
Constitution, expressed the opinion that the Constitution has lodged the power 
to declare law unconstitutional exclusively upon the Supreme Court, and 
consequently, refrained from passing upon the constitutionality of Commonwealth 
Act No. 698. There is nothing in section 10 of Article VIII of the Constitution 
from which it can be concluded that the power to declare a law unconstitutional 
belongs exclusively to the Supreme Court. The section provides only for the 
procedure that the Supreme Court should follow when such a question is presented 
before it.</p>
<p>Appellants adduced strong arguments against the constitutionality of 
Commonwealth Act No. 698, but now the question has become moot, because of the 
enactment on June 15, 1948 of Republic Act No. 271, expressly repealing 
Commonwealth Act No. 698.</p>
<p>The case is dismissed without costs.</p><em>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, 
Briones,</em> and <em>Montemayor, JJ.</em>, concur.<br><em><br>Moran, C. J.</em>, 
concurs in the result.<em><br><br>Pablo, M.</em>, conforme con la parte 
dispositiva.

<p><strong>Tuason, J.:</strong></p>I concur in this decision except the 
statement that "appellants adduced strong arguments against the constitutionality 
of Commonwealth Act No. 698." Althought this Act has been repealed it is 
inadvisable to express an opinion on its constitutionality as similar legislation 
might be enacted or contemplated. </div>
