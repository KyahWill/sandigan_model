				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for unlawful detainer&nbsp; filed by plaintiff against defendants before the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila. Judgment was rendered therein ordering defendants and all persons claiming under them to vacate the&nbsp; property described in&nbsp; the complaint and sentencing&nbsp; them to pay&nbsp; the plaintiff the&nbsp; sum of P153.60 monthly as&nbsp; reasonable value of the use and occupation thereof&nbsp; from&nbsp; January 1, 1954 until plaintiff is restored to its&nbsp; possession, plus the costs of action.&nbsp; Defendants have appealed.<br><br>When the&nbsp; case was called for trial, counsel for defendants&nbsp; asked for postponement on the ground&nbsp; that their witnesses did&nbsp; not show up.&nbsp; They&nbsp; also invited the attention of the court to the fact that a&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; suspension of the proceedings was mistakenly&nbsp; filed in the municipal court and to&nbsp; rectify the error they were&nbsp; refiling&nbsp; it in&nbsp; the court of first instance praying&nbsp; that it be favorably considered.&nbsp; The court denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; postponement as well as&nbsp; the motion for suspension for&nbsp; the following reasons:&nbsp; (1) defendants failed&nbsp; to comply with the Rules of Court&nbsp; concerning notice,&nbsp; (2) the answer has&nbsp; not been amended&nbsp; to&nbsp; set up Republic Act No. 1162&nbsp; as&nbsp; a defense, and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; said Act&nbsp; cannot, affect the lot and&nbsp; contract of lease&nbsp; in question without rendering it unconstitutional.<br><br>After plaintiff had rested its case, counsel for defendants asked for a&nbsp; brief&nbsp; recess.&nbsp; Thereafter, counsel asked for postponement to have time to prepare their evidence but in view of plaintiff's opposition it&nbsp; was denied.&nbsp; However, counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; voluntarily&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; certain&nbsp; facts which defendants wanted to prove and the case was submitted for decision.&nbsp; Thereupon, the court rendered judgment&nbsp; which is practically of the same tenor as that rendered by&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, but the case was certified to us on the ground that only questions of&nbsp; law are involved.<br><br>One of the issues raised&nbsp; refers to&nbsp; the denial&nbsp; by the trial court of the motion filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendants to suspend the present&nbsp; ejectment case&nbsp; invoking in&nbsp; their favor the provisions of Republic Act No. 1162,&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; Section 5, which&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that "From&nbsp; the approval of this&nbsp; Act, and until&nbsp; the expropriation herein&nbsp; provided, no&nbsp; ejectment proceedings shall be instituted or prosecuted,&nbsp; against any tenant or&nbsp; occupant of any landed estates or&nbsp; haciendas herein authorized to be expropriated if he pays his&nbsp; current rentals."&nbsp; It is&nbsp; claimed that said&nbsp; Act&nbsp; was approved on June&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1954 and since this action&nbsp; was instituted on March 31, 1954, and remained pending&nbsp; when said Act was approved, it was the duty of the court to&nbsp; suspend the case in order that the purpose of said Act may be carried out which is to expropriate the land and subdivide it into small lots for sale&nbsp; at cost to its bonafide tenants or occupants.<br><br>Appellee, on&nbsp; the other hand, contends that said Act is inapplicable to the present case for the reason that there is no evidence&nbsp; showing that&nbsp; the property&nbsp; in&nbsp; question forms part of a landed estate within the&nbsp; meaning of said Act, and even if it were&nbsp; so,&nbsp; still the Act cannot apply because there is no showing that the Government has&nbsp; ever taken any step relative to the expropriation of the&nbsp; property.<br><br>We are&nbsp; inclined to agree to appellee's contention&nbsp; for it can not be supposed that Congress in approving Republic Act No. 1162 had intended to actually suspend the prosecution of an ejectment proceeding even before any definite step or action is taken by the Government relative to&nbsp; the expropriation of the property, for to hold otherwise would be&nbsp; to deprive a landlord of his right to protect his&nbsp; interest by merely claiming that the Government may someday act on the matter thereby placing him at the mercy of&nbsp; an unscrupulous&nbsp; tenant.&nbsp; While&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; laudable&nbsp; and proper that a landed estate be expropriated in order that it&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; subdivided&nbsp; and sold to&nbsp; <i>bonafide</i> tenants or occupants,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same should be&nbsp; undertaken in a&nbsp; manner not repugnant&nbsp; to&nbsp; law or to the&nbsp; Constitution.&nbsp; In other words, the suspension of an ejectment proceeding should only be made&nbsp; after the&nbsp; Government has taken&nbsp; step or action relative&nbsp; to the expropriation&nbsp; of the property in accordance with the procedure laid down by law, otherwise the action would&nbsp; place&nbsp; the&nbsp; interest of&nbsp; the&nbsp; landlord in jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such cannot be the intendment of the law. As&nbsp; aptly explained by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals in several cases involving the applicability of Republic Act No. 1162, to which we agree, "until such a proceeding&nbsp; is&nbsp; actually commenced the right of a landowner to prosecute an action for ejectment under existing laws&nbsp; cannot be deemed suspended&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 5 of Republic Act No. 1162.&nbsp; To hold otherwise, that is, to deprive a landlord of his remedy because of the&nbsp; possibility that the&nbsp; Government may some day, in the near or distant future, act to expropriate his property, would be to place him at the mercy of a thoroughly uncertain&nbsp; contingency. * * * We&nbsp; think&nbsp; that&nbsp; the prohibition against the institution or&nbsp; prosecution of ejectment proceedings&nbsp; applies only when&nbsp; expropriation&nbsp; has actually commenced."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Barcelon&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Isip, CA-G. R.&nbsp; No. 13650-R, Oct. 14, 1954; See also Cacho <i>vs.</i> Tan, CA-G. R. Nos. 13888-R to 13891-R, Dec. 10, 1954;&nbsp; Antonio Tuason, Jr. <i>vs.</i> Narvasa, CA-G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; 14479-R, July 30, 1955).<br><br>In the case of&nbsp; Republic <i>vs.</i> Cirilto P. Baylosis,&nbsp; 96 Phil., 461, this Court,&nbsp; speaking of the effect&nbsp; of an attempt to expropriate&nbsp; certain property by the Government on the right of a landlord to protect his interest, made the following pronouncement:<br><blockquote>"* * * We hold that mere notice of the intention of the Government to expropriate lands in the future does not and cannot bind the landowner&nbsp; and&nbsp; prevent him from&nbsp; dealing with&nbsp; his&nbsp; property. To&nbsp; bind the&nbsp; land to&nbsp; be expropriated and the owner thereof, the expropriation must&nbsp; be commenced in court and&nbsp; even then we are not certain that the owner&nbsp; may not&nbsp; deal with his&nbsp; property thereafter, mortgage or&nbsp; even sell it if he can find persons who would step into his&nbsp; shoes and deal with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government, either&nbsp; resist the expropriation if in their opinion it&nbsp; is illegal&nbsp; or accept the expropriation and remain with what&nbsp; is left&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property if the entire property is not needed by the Government."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is obvious from the foregoing that the trial&nbsp; court did not err in holding that&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1162&nbsp; is inapplicable to this case&nbsp; for there&nbsp; is no&nbsp; showing&nbsp; that an expropriation&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; has&nbsp; actually&nbsp; been&nbsp; commenced by the Government which would give defendants the right to demand&nbsp; the suspension of the ejectment case within the meaning of said Act.<br><br>The next issue&nbsp; raised&nbsp; by appellants refers to the rental of P153.60&nbsp; a month which&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; ordered said appellants to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; as reasonable&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; use and occupation of the property in question, which rental they claim to be unfair and excessive.<br><br>It should&nbsp; be noted that defendants have&nbsp; occupied the property under lease for thirty&nbsp; years&nbsp; or more until&nbsp; 1953 when&nbsp; plaintiff, upon the expiration of the contract of lease, made a re-appraisal of the rental and fixed a new rate on the basis&nbsp; of 12% of the current assessed&nbsp; value of the property.&nbsp; This rental can&nbsp; hardly be considered excessive considering that Section 3&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; 1162 expressly provides that "in the&nbsp; event of lease, the rentals that may be charged by the Government shall not exceed twelve per&nbsp; cent <i>per annum</i> of the assessed valuation of the property leased."&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an express&nbsp; recognition that a&nbsp; rental not exceeding 12%&nbsp; <i>per&nbsp; annum</i>&nbsp; of the&nbsp; assessed value of the property is not excessive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, defendants can not pretend to pay the same or similar rentals to what they had paid&nbsp; during the 30-year&nbsp; period covered&nbsp; by their contract of lease.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp; general knowledge that the values of real estate have steadily gone&nbsp; up with the passing of the years and&nbsp; it is but fair that their productivity be correspondingly increased.&nbsp; The error&nbsp; assigned has therefore no&nbsp; merit.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
