				<H3>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC ADMINISTRATOR OF DAVAO, INC.,  PETITIONER,  VS.  THE  LAND REGISTRATION  COMMISSION AND THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF DAVAO  CITY, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition&nbsp; for mandamus filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Roman Catholic&nbsp; Apostolic Administrator&nbsp; of Davao&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; the reversal of a resolution issued by the Land Registration Commissioner in L.R.C.&nbsp; Consulta&nbsp; No. 14.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts of the&nbsp; case are as follows:<br><br>On October 4, 1954, Mateo&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Rodis, a&nbsp; Filipino citizen and resident of&nbsp; the City of Davao, executed a deed of&nbsp; sale of a parcel of land&nbsp; located in the same city&nbsp; covered by Transfer&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2263,&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Roman Catholic&nbsp; Administrator of Davao, Inc., a corporation sole organized and existing in accordance with Philippine laws, with Msgr. Clovis Thibault, a Canadian citizen, as&nbsp; actual&nbsp; incumbent.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; presented to the Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Davao for registration, the latter<br><blockquote>having in mind a previous resolution of the Fourth Brunch of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila wherein the Carmelite Nuns of Davao were, made to prepare an affidavit to the effect that 60 per cent of&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of their&nbsp; corporation were&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; citizens when they 'sought to register in favor of&nbsp; their congregation a deed of donation&nbsp; of a parcel of land— </blockquote>required said&nbsp; corporation sole&nbsp; to submit&nbsp; a similar affidavit declaring that 60 per cent&nbsp; of the members thereof were Filipino citizens.<br><br>The vendee&nbsp; in a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; dated&nbsp; June 28, 1954, expressed willingness to submit an&nbsp; affidavit,&nbsp; but&nbsp; not in the&nbsp; same tenor as that made&nbsp; by the Prioress of the Carmelite Nuns because the two cases were not&nbsp; similar, for whereas&nbsp; the congregation of the&nbsp; Carmelite&nbsp; Nuns had five incorporators, the corporation sole has only one; that according to their articles of incorporation, the organization of the Carmelite Nuns became the owner of properties donated to it, where as the case at bar,&nbsp; the totality of the Catholic population of Davao would become the owner of the property sought to be registered.<br><br>As the Register&nbsp; of Deeds&nbsp; entertained some doubts as to&nbsp; the registerability of&nbsp; the&nbsp; document, the matter&nbsp; was referred to the Land Registration Commissioner <i>en&nbsp; consulta</i> for resolution in accordance with section 4 of Republic Act No. 1151.&nbsp; Proper&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter&nbsp; was&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Commissioner and&nbsp; after&nbsp; the petitioner corporation had filed its memorandum,&nbsp; a&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; was rendered on&nbsp; September 21,&nbsp; 1954, holding that in view of the provisions of Sections 1 and 5 of Article XIII&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Constitution, the&nbsp; vendee was not&nbsp; qualified to acquire private lands in the Philippines&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of proof that at least 60 per&nbsp; centum of the capital,&nbsp; property, or assets of the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Administrator of Davao, Inc., was actually owned or controlled by Filipino citizens, there being no question that the present incumbent of the corporation sole was a Canadian citizen.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also the opinion of the Land Registration Commissioner that section 159&nbsp; of the Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; relied&nbsp; upon by the vendee was rendered inoperative by the aforementioned provisions of the Constitution with respect to real estate, unless the precise condition set therein—that at least 60 per cent of its capital is owned by Filipino citizens—be present, and, therefore, ordered&nbsp; the Register of&nbsp; Deeds of Davao to deny registration&nbsp; of the deed of sale in&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; proof of compliance with such condition.<br><br>After the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to reconsider&nbsp; said&nbsp; resolution was denied, an action for mandamus was instituted with this Court by said corporation&nbsp; sole,&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; that under the Corporation&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Canon&nbsp; Law as well as the&nbsp; settled jurisprudence on the matter, the deed of sale&nbsp; executed by Mateo L. Rodis in favor of petitioner is&nbsp; actually a deed of sale in favor of the Catholic Church which is qualified to acquire private&nbsp; agricultural lands&nbsp; for the establishment and maintenance of places of worship, and prayed that judgment&nbsp; be rendered&nbsp; reserving&nbsp; and&nbsp; setting&nbsp; aside the resolution of the Land Registration Commissioner in question.&nbsp; In its resolution of&nbsp; November 15, 1954, this&nbsp; Court gave due course to this petition&nbsp; providing&nbsp; that the procedure prescribed&nbsp; for&nbsp; appeals from the Public Service Commission&nbsp; or&nbsp; the Securities&nbsp; and Exchange&nbsp; Commission (Rule 43), be followed.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 5 of Article XIII&nbsp; of the Philippine&nbsp; Constitution reads as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. Save in cases of hereditary succession,&nbsp; no private agricultural land shall be&nbsp; transferred or assigned except to&nbsp; individuals, corporations, or&nbsp; associations qualified to&nbsp; acquire or&nbsp; hold lands&nbsp; of the public domain in the&nbsp; Philippines.</blockquote>Section 1 of the same Article also provides the following:<br><blockquote>Section 1.<i> All&nbsp; agricultural, timber, and mineral&nbsp; lands&nbsp; of&nbsp; the public domain,</i> waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all&nbsp; forces of potential&nbsp; energy, and&nbsp; other natural&nbsp; resources of the Philippines belong to the State, and&nbsp; their&nbsp; disposition, exploitation, development,&nbsp; or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, <i>or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital&nbsp; of which in&nbsp; owned&nbsp; by&nbsp; such citizens</i>, SUBJECT TO ANY EXISTING RIGHT, GRANT, LEASE, OR CONCESSION AT THE TIME OF THE INAUGURATION OF&nbsp; THE&nbsp; GOVERNMENT&nbsp; ESTABLISHED&nbsp; UNDER THIS CONSTITUTION.&nbsp; Natural&nbsp; resources,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception of&nbsp; public agricultural land,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not be alienated, and no license, concession, or&nbsp; lease&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; exploitation,&nbsp; development,&nbsp; or&nbsp; utilization&nbsp; of&nbsp; any of the natural&nbsp; resources shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted for a period&nbsp; exceeding twenty-five&nbsp; years,&nbsp; renewable for another&nbsp; twenty-five years,&nbsp; except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial&nbsp; uses other than the development of water power, in which cases&nbsp; beneficial&nbsp; use may be&nbsp; the measure and&nbsp; limit&nbsp; of the&nbsp; grant</blockquote>In virtue of the&nbsp; foregoing mandates of the Constitution, who are considered "qualified"&nbsp; to acquire and hold agricultural lands&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines?&nbsp; What is&nbsp; the effect&nbsp; of these constitutional prohibition on the right&nbsp; of a religious corporation&nbsp; recognized by&nbsp; our Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; and&nbsp; registered as&nbsp; a <i>corporation&nbsp; sole</i>, to&nbsp; possess,&nbsp; acquire and register real estates in its name when the Head, Manager, Administrator or&nbsp; actual&nbsp; incumbent&nbsp; is&nbsp; an alien?<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; consistently maintained&nbsp; that a corporation sole,&nbsp; irrespective&nbsp; of&nbsp; the citizenship&nbsp; of&nbsp; its incumbent,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; or&nbsp; disqualified&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire&nbsp; and&nbsp; hold&nbsp; real properties.&nbsp; The Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Canon Law are explicit&nbsp; in their&nbsp; provisions that&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; sole or "ordinary" is not the owner of the properties that he may acquire but merely the administrator thereof.&nbsp; The Canon Law&nbsp; also&nbsp; specified that&nbsp; church temporalities are owned by the&nbsp; Catholic Church&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; "moral person"&nbsp; or&nbsp; by the dioceses as&nbsp; minor&nbsp; "moral&nbsp; persons"&nbsp; with the ordinary or bishop&nbsp; as administrator.<br><br>And&nbsp; elaborating on&nbsp; the&nbsp; composition of&nbsp; the Catholic Church&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines, petitioner&nbsp; explained&nbsp; that as a&nbsp; religious&nbsp; society or&nbsp; organization,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is made up&nbsp; of 2 elements or&nbsp; divisions—the&nbsp; clergy&nbsp; or&nbsp; religious members and the faithful or&nbsp; lay members.&nbsp; The 1948 figures of the Bureau of Census and Statistics showed that there were 277,551 Catholics in&nbsp; Davao&nbsp; and aliens&nbsp; residing therein numbered 3,465.&nbsp; Even granting that all&nbsp; these foreigners are&nbsp; Catholics,&nbsp; petitioner contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; citizens form more than 80&nbsp; per cent of the entire Catholics population of that area.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; to&nbsp; its clergy and religious composition,&nbsp; counsel for petitioner&nbsp; presented the&nbsp; Catholic Directory of the Philippines&nbsp; for 1954&nbsp; (Annex A)&nbsp; which revealed that as&nbsp; of that year, Filipino clergy&nbsp; and women novices comprise already&nbsp; 60.5&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; group. It was, therefore, alleged that the&nbsp; constitutional requirement was fully met&nbsp; and satisfied.<br><br>Respondents, on&nbsp; the other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; averred that&nbsp; although it might be true that petitioner is&nbsp; not the owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land purchased, yet&nbsp; he&nbsp; has control over&nbsp; the&nbsp; same, with full&nbsp; power&nbsp; to administer,&nbsp; take possession of,&nbsp; alienate, transfer,&nbsp; encumber,&nbsp; sell&nbsp; or&nbsp; dispose of any or all lands and&nbsp; their improvements&nbsp; registered in the name of&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; and can collect, receive,&nbsp; demand or&nbsp; sue for all money or values of&nbsp; any kind that may become due or owing to said corporation,&nbsp; and vested with authority to&nbsp; enter&nbsp; into agreements&nbsp; with any&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; concerns or&nbsp; entities&nbsp; in connection with&nbsp; said&nbsp; real properties,&nbsp; or in other words, actually exercising all rights of ownership over the properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; their stand&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory that properties registered in&nbsp; the name of the&nbsp; corporation sole&nbsp; are held&nbsp; in trust&nbsp; for&nbsp; the benefit&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Catholic population of a&nbsp; place, as of Davao in the case at&nbsp; bar, should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; sustained because&nbsp; a&nbsp; conglomeration&nbsp; of persons cannot just be pointed out as the&nbsp; <i>cestui que trust</i> or recipient&nbsp; of the benefits&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; allegedly administered in their behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; can it be said&nbsp; that the mass of people referred to as such beneficiary exercise any&nbsp; right of&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; over&nbsp; the same.&nbsp; This set-up, respondents argued,&nbsp; falls short of&nbsp; a trust.&nbsp; Respondents instead tried to prove that in reality, the beneficiary&nbsp; of ecclesiastical&nbsp; properties are not&nbsp; the members or faithful of&nbsp; the church&nbsp; but&nbsp; someone&nbsp; else,&nbsp; by&nbsp; quoting a&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the oath of fidelity subscribed by&nbsp; a bishop upon his elevation to the episcopacy wherein he&nbsp; promises to&nbsp; render to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Pontifical&nbsp; Father or&nbsp; his successors an account of his <i>pastoral</i> office and&nbsp; of&nbsp; all things appertaining&nbsp; to the <i>state</i> of this church.<br><br>Respondents likewise advanced the opinion that in construing&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional&nbsp; provision&nbsp; calling for&nbsp; 60&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; citizenship,&nbsp; the criterion&nbsp; is&nbsp; not membership&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; society&nbsp; but ownership of&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; or assets thereof.<br><br>In&nbsp; solving the&nbsp; problem&nbsp; thus submitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; our&nbsp; consideration, We can say&nbsp; the&nbsp; following:&nbsp; A corporation sole is a&nbsp; special&nbsp; form of corporation usually&nbsp; associated&nbsp; with the clergy.&nbsp; Conceived&nbsp; and&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; common law by&nbsp; sheer necessity, this&nbsp; legal&nbsp; creation&nbsp; which&nbsp; was referred to as "that unhappy freak of English law"&nbsp; was designed&nbsp; to&nbsp; facilitate the&nbsp; exercise of the functions&nbsp; of ownership carried on by the clerics for and&nbsp; on&nbsp; behalf of the church which was&nbsp; regarded as the property&nbsp; owner (See&nbsp; I Bouvier's Law&nbsp; Dictionary, p.&nbsp; 682-683).<br><br>A corporation sole&nbsp; consists of one person only, and his successors (who will&nbsp; always be one at a&nbsp; time),&nbsp; in some particular station, who&nbsp; are&nbsp; incorporated by law in order to give them some&nbsp; legal capacities and advantages,&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; that of perpetuity, which in&nbsp; their&nbsp; natural&nbsp; persons&nbsp; they could&nbsp; not&nbsp; have&nbsp; had.&nbsp; In this sense,&nbsp; the&nbsp; king is a sole corporation; so is a bishop,&nbsp; or deans, distinct from&nbsp; their several chapters&nbsp; (Reid vs. Barry, 93 Fla.&nbsp; 849, 112 So.&nbsp; 846).<br><br>The provisions of&nbsp; our&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; law&nbsp; on&nbsp; religious corporations&nbsp; are&nbsp; illuminating&nbsp; and&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; the&nbsp; stand&nbsp; of petitioner.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 154 thereof provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 154.—<i>For the administration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; temporalities&nbsp; of&nbsp; any religious denomination,&nbsp; society or church and the&nbsp; management of the estates and properties thereof</i>, it shall be&nbsp; lawful for the bishop, chief&nbsp; priest,&nbsp; or presiding elder of any&nbsp; such religious&nbsp; denomination, society or&nbsp; church to become&nbsp; a corporation sole, unless&nbsp; inconsistent with the rules, regulations or discipline of his religious denomination, society, or church or forbidden by competent&nbsp; authority thereof. </blockquote>See also the pertinent provisions of the&nbsp; succeeding sections of the same Corporation Law copied hereunder;<br><blockquote>SEC. 155. In order to&nbsp; become a corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; the bishop, chief priest, or presiding- elder of any religious denomination, society, or church&nbsp; must&nbsp; file with&nbsp; the Securities&nbsp; and Exchange&nbsp; Commissioner articles of incorporation setting forth the following facts:<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>(3)&nbsp; That as such bishop,&nbsp; chief priest, or&nbsp; presiding&nbsp; elder&nbsp; he is charged with the&nbsp; administration of the temporalities and the management&nbsp; of the&nbsp; estates and properties of&nbsp; his religious&nbsp; denomination, society, or church&nbsp; within its&nbsp; territorial jurisdiction, describing&nbsp; it;<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (As&nbsp; amended by&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 287).<br><br>SEC. 157. From and&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Securities &amp;&nbsp; Exchange&nbsp; Commissioner of the&nbsp; said articles of&nbsp; incorporation, verified by&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; or&nbsp; affirmation as aforesaid and&nbsp; accompanied by&nbsp; the copy of the commission,&nbsp; certificate of election, or letters of appointment&nbsp; of the bishop, chief priest, or&nbsp; presiding&nbsp; elder,&nbsp; duly certified as&nbsp; prescribed in the section immediately&nbsp; preceding such <i>bishop</i>, chief&nbsp; priest, or&nbsp; presiding elder, as the&nbsp; case&nbsp; may&nbsp; be, shall become a corporation sole, and&nbsp; all <i>temporalities, estates, and properties of the religious denomination, society, or church therefore administered or managed by him as&nbsp; such bishop</i>,&nbsp; chief priest, or presiding elder <i>shall&nbsp; be held hi, trust&nbsp;&nbsp; by him as a&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; use, 'purpose,&nbsp; behalf,&nbsp; and sole benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; religious&nbsp; denomination, society,&nbsp; or church</i>,&nbsp; including&nbsp; hospitals, schools,&nbsp; colleges, orphan asylums, parsonages, and cemeteries thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the filing of such articles of incorporation, the&nbsp; Securities &amp; Exchange&nbsp; Commissioner shall&nbsp; collect twenty-five&nbsp; pesos.&nbsp;&nbsp; (As amended by Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 287) ;&nbsp; and<br><br>SEC. 163. Tho right to&nbsp; administer all temporalities and&nbsp; all property held or owned by&nbsp; a religious order&nbsp; or society, or by&nbsp; the diocese, synod, or&nbsp; district&nbsp; organization&nbsp; of any&nbsp; religious&nbsp; denomination or church shall,&nbsp; on&nbsp; its incorporation, pass&nbsp; to the corporation and shall be&nbsp; held&nbsp; in trust for the use, purpose,&nbsp; behoof, and benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the religious&nbsp; society, or order&nbsp; so incorporated&nbsp; or of the&nbsp; church of which the diocese, synod,&nbsp; or&nbsp; district organization is&nbsp; an organized and constituent part.</blockquote>The&nbsp; Canon Law contains&nbsp; similar&nbsp; provisions regarding the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; or&nbsp; ordinary as&nbsp; ad- ministrator of the&nbsp; church properties, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Al Ordinario local&nbsp; pertenence&nbsp; vigilar&nbsp; diligentemente&nbsp; sobre&nbsp; la <i>administracion</i> de&nbsp; todos los bienes eclesiasticos que se hallan en&nbsp; su territorio y&nbsp; no&nbsp; estuvieren&nbsp; sustraidos&nbsp; de&nbsp; su jurisdiccion,&nbsp; salvas las proscripciones legitimas que le concedan&nbsp; inas amplios&nbsp; derechos,<br>"Teniendo an cuenta los derechos&nbsp; y&nbsp; las&nbsp; legitimas . eostumbres y circunstancias, procuraran los Ordinarios&nbsp; regular todo&nbsp; lo coneer- niente&nbsp; a la <i>administracion</i> de&nbsp; los bienes eelesiasticos,&nbsp; dando laa oportunas instrucciones particulares dentro del&nbsp; marco del derecho comun",&nbsp; (Title XXVIII,&nbsp; Codigo&nbsp; de Derecho&nbsp; Canonico,&nbsp; Lib. Ill, Canon 1519).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup></blockquote>That leaves no&nbsp; room for doubt that the&nbsp; bishops or archbishops, as&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; may&nbsp; be,&nbsp; as&nbsp; corporation's&nbsp; sole&nbsp; are merely <i>administrators</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the church properties that come to their possession, and which they&nbsp; hold&nbsp; in trust for the church.&nbsp; It can also&nbsp; be&nbsp; said that&nbsp; while&nbsp; it is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that church&nbsp; properties&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; administered&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; natural person, problems regarding&nbsp; succession to said properties can&nbsp; not be avoided&nbsp; to&nbsp; rise&nbsp; upon&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this legal fiction, however, church&nbsp; properties acquired by the incumbent of a corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; pass, by operation&nbsp; of law, upon&nbsp; his death not&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; personal&nbsp; heirs but to his successor in&nbsp; office.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could&nbsp; be seen,&nbsp; therefore, that&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; is created&nbsp; not only to&nbsp; administer&nbsp; the temporalities of the&nbsp; church&nbsp; or religious&nbsp; society&nbsp; where he belongs&nbsp; but also&nbsp; to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; and&nbsp; transmit&nbsp; the same&nbsp; to his successor in said&nbsp; office.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the ownership or&nbsp; title&nbsp; to the properties do not&nbsp; pass to the administrators, who are the owners of&nbsp; church properties?<br><br>Bouacaren and Elis, S. J., authorities on canon law, on their treatise&nbsp; comment:<br><blockquote>"In matters regarding property belonging to the Universal Church and to&nbsp; the Apostolic&nbsp; See, the&nbsp; Supreme Pontiff exercises his&nbsp; office of&nbsp; supreme administrator through the Roman Curia;&nbsp; <i>in matters regarding other&nbsp; church&nbsp; properly</i>,&nbsp; through&nbsp; the administrators of ths individual moral persons in the Church according to that norms, laid&nbsp; down ia the Code of Cannon Law.&nbsp; <i>This does&nbsp; not&nbsp; mean, however, that the Roman Pontiff is this owner of ad church property; but,&nbsp; merely&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; the supreme guardian</i>"&nbsp; (Bouscaren&nbsp; and Ellis, Canon&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; A&nbsp; Text and Commentary, p.&nbsp; 764). </blockquote>And this Court,&nbsp; citing Campos y&nbsp; Pulido, Legislation y Jurisprudencia&nbsp; Canonica, ruled&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Trinidad vs.&nbsp; Roman&nbsp; Catholic Archbishop of Manila, 63&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 881, that:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; second question&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; decided is&nbsp; in whom the ownership of the properties&nbsp; constituting&nbsp; the endowment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; ecclesiastical or collative chaplaincies&nbsp; is rested.<br><br>'Canonists entertain different opinions as to the person in whom the ownership of the&nbsp; ecclesiastical properties is vested, with&nbsp; respect to which&nbsp; we&nbsp; shall,&nbsp; for&nbsp; our purpose, confine ourselves&nbsp; to&nbsp; stating with&nbsp; Donoso&nbsp; that,&nbsp; while many doctors cited by Fagnano&nbsp; believe that it&nbsp; resides in&nbsp; the Roman&nbsp; Pontiff as Head of the Universal Church, it is&nbsp; more probable that&nbsp; ownership,&nbsp; strictly speaking,&nbsp; does not reside in&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; and, consequently, ecclesiastical properties are&nbsp; owned by churches, institutions and canonically&nbsp; established private&nbsp; corporations to which said properties have been donated'."</blockquote>Considering&nbsp; that nowhere can We&nbsp; find&nbsp; any provision conferring ownership&nbsp; of church properties on&nbsp; the Pope although he appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; the&nbsp; supreme&nbsp; <i>administrator</i> or guardian of&nbsp; his nock, nor on the corporations sole or&nbsp; heads of&nbsp; dioceses&nbsp; as&nbsp; they are&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; mere administrators of&nbsp; said&nbsp; properties,&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; these&nbsp; temporalities logically&nbsp; fall and&nbsp;&nbsp; devolve&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; church,&nbsp; diocese or congregation&nbsp; acquiring the same.&nbsp; Although this question of ownership&nbsp; of ecclesiastical properties has&nbsp; off&nbsp; and&nbsp; on been mentioned in several decisions of this Court yet in no instance was the subject of citizenship of this religious society been passed&nbsp; upon.<br><br>We&nbsp; are not&nbsp; unaware of&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; by the late Justice Perfecto in his dissent in the case of Agustines vs.&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Bulacan,&nbsp; 80 Phil. 565, to the effect that&nbsp; "the Roman Catholic Archbishop&nbsp; of Manila is only&nbsp; a&nbsp; branch&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; universal&nbsp; church&nbsp; by ' the&nbsp; Pope, with&nbsp; permanent&nbsp; residence in Rome,&nbsp; Italy".&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no question&nbsp; that the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Church existing in the Philippines is&nbsp; a&nbsp; tributary and&nbsp; part of that international religious&nbsp; organization, for the word&nbsp; "Roman"&nbsp; clearly expresses its unity with and recognizes the authority of the Pope in Rome.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, lest We become hasty in drawing conclusions, "We&nbsp; have to analyze and take&nbsp; note&nbsp; of the nature of the government established in the Vatican&nbsp; City, of which it was&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"GOVERNMENT. In&nbsp; the Roman Catholic Church supreme&nbsp; authority and jurisdiction over clergy and laity alike is held by the&nbsp; pope who (since&nbsp; the Middle Ages) is elected&nbsp; by the cardinals assembled&nbsp; in conclave, and holds office until&nbsp; his&nbsp; death or legitimate abdication, * * *.&nbsp; While the pope is obviously independent of the laws&nbsp; made, and the officials appointed, by&nbsp; himself or his predecessors, he usually exercises his administrative authority according to the code of&nbsp; canon law and through the&nbsp; congregations,&nbsp; tribunals and&nbsp; offices of&nbsp; the Curia&nbsp; Romana.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; territories&nbsp; (called&nbsp; generally dioceses)&nbsp; and over their respective&nbsp; subjects, the&nbsp; patriachs, metropolitans or archbishops and&nbsp; bishops exercise&nbsp; a jurisdiction&nbsp; which is called&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; (as&nbsp; attached by law&nbsp; to&nbsp; an office and so distinguished&nbsp; from&nbsp; delegated jurisdiction which is given to&nbsp; a person, * * *" (Collier's Encyclopedia,&nbsp; Vol. 17, p. 93.)</blockquote> While&nbsp; it is&nbsp; true and We have to concede&nbsp; that in the profession of their faith, the Roman Pontiff is the supreme head;&nbsp; that in&nbsp; religious matters,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; their belief, the Catholic&nbsp; congregation of&nbsp; the faithful throughout&nbsp; the world seeks the guidance and&nbsp; direction of their Spiritual&nbsp; Father&nbsp; in the Vatican, yet it cannot be said that there is a merger&nbsp; of personalities resultant therein. Neither can it be said&nbsp; that the political and civil rights of the faithful, inherent or acquired under the laws&nbsp; of their country,&nbsp; are affected by that relationship with&nbsp; the Pope.&nbsp; The fact that the Roman Catholic Church in&nbsp; almost every&nbsp; country springs from that society that saw&nbsp; its beginning in&nbsp; Europe&nbsp; and the fact that the clergy&nbsp; of this faith derive&nbsp; their authorities and receive orders from the Holy See do not give&nbsp; or bestow the citizenship&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Pope upon these branches.&nbsp;&nbsp; Citizenship&nbsp; is a political right which&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; acquired by a&nbsp; sort of&nbsp; "radiation".&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to realize that although there is a fraternity&nbsp; among all the catholic countries and the dioceses therein all over the globe, this universality that the word "catholic" implies, merely characterize their faith,&nbsp; a&nbsp; uniformity&nbsp; in&nbsp; the practice&nbsp; and&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; dogma&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exercise of&nbsp; their&nbsp; belief, but certainly they&nbsp; are separate and independent from one another in jurisdiction, governed by different laws&nbsp; under&nbsp; which they are&nbsp; incorporated, and entirely independent of the others in the management and ownership&nbsp; of their&nbsp; temporalities.&nbsp; To allow theory that the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Churches all over&nbsp; the world&nbsp; follow the&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; Supreme Head,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Pontifical Father, would lead to the absurdity of finding the citizens of a country who embrace the Catholic&nbsp; faith and become members&nbsp; of that religious&nbsp; society,&nbsp; likewise citizens&nbsp; of the Vatican or of Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is&nbsp; more so if We con- sider that the Pope&nbsp; himself may be an Italian or national of any other country of&nbsp; the world.&nbsp; The same thing may be said with&nbsp; regard to&nbsp; the&nbsp; nationality or citizenship&nbsp; of the corporation sole&nbsp; created under the laws of the Philippines,&nbsp; which is not&nbsp; altered by&nbsp; the change of citizenship of the incumbent bishops or heads of&nbsp; said&nbsp; corporations sole.<br><br>We must, therefore, declare that although a branch of the Universal&nbsp; Roman&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Apostolic&nbsp; Church, every Roman&nbsp; Catholic Church in different countries, if it exercises its mission and is lawfully incorporated in accordance with the laws&nbsp; of the country where it&nbsp; is located, is&nbsp; considered&nbsp; an entity&nbsp; or&nbsp; person with all the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; and privileges granted to such artificial being under the laws of that&nbsp; country, separate and distinct from the personality of the Roman&nbsp; Pontiff or the Holy See,&nbsp; without prejudice to its religious relations with the&nbsp; latter which are governed by the&nbsp; Canon&nbsp; Law or their rules and regulations.<br><br>We certainly are&nbsp; conscious&nbsp; of the fact&nbsp; that whatever conclusion&nbsp; We&nbsp; may draw on this matter will&nbsp; have&nbsp; a far-reaching influence,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; can We&nbsp; overlook&nbsp; the pages of history&nbsp; that arouse&nbsp; indignation&nbsp; and&nbsp; criticisms&nbsp; against church&nbsp; landholdings.&nbsp; This&nbsp; nurtured feeling&nbsp; that snow- balled into a&nbsp; strong nationalistic sentiment&nbsp; manifested itself when&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; on&nbsp; natural resources&nbsp; to be embodied in the Philippines&nbsp; Constitution were framed, but all&nbsp; that has&nbsp; been&nbsp; said on&nbsp; this&nbsp; regard&nbsp; referred&nbsp; more particularly&nbsp; to&nbsp; landholdings&nbsp; of&nbsp; religious&nbsp; corporations known&nbsp; as&nbsp; "Friar Estates" which have already been acquired by our&nbsp; Government, and&nbsp; not&nbsp; to properties held by corporations sole which, We repeat, are&nbsp; properties&nbsp; held in trust for the benefit of the faithful residing&nbsp; within its&nbsp; territorial&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though that&nbsp; same&nbsp; feeling probably precipitated and influenced to&nbsp; a large extent the doctrine laid down&nbsp; in the celebrated&nbsp; Krivenko&nbsp; decision, We have to take this matter in the light&nbsp; of&nbsp; legal provisions and jurisprudence actually obtaining, irrespective of sentiments.<br><br>The question now left for our determination is whether the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in the&nbsp; Philippines, or better&nbsp; still, the corporation&nbsp; sole named&nbsp; the&nbsp; Roman Catholic Apostolic Administrator of&nbsp; Davao, Inc., is qualified to acquire private agricultural&nbsp; lands in&nbsp; the Philippines pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII of the Constitution.<br><br>We&nbsp; see&nbsp; from&nbsp; sections 1 and 5 of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Article quoted before, that only persons or corporations&nbsp; <i>qualified</i> to acquire or hold lands of the public domain in the Philippines may acquire or be assigned and hold&nbsp; private agricultural lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the decisive factor&nbsp; in the&nbsp; present controversy hinges on the&nbsp; proposition&nbsp; of whether or not the petitioner&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case can&nbsp; acquire&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; lands of the public domain.<br><br>From the data&nbsp; secured&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Securities and Exchange Commission,&nbsp; We find&nbsp; that the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Bishop of Zamboanga was incorporated (as a corporation sole)&nbsp; in <i>September,&nbsp; 1912, principally&nbsp; to&nbsp; administer its temporalities&nbsp; and&nbsp; manage its&nbsp; properties</i>.&nbsp; Probably due to the&nbsp; ravages&nbsp; of the last war, its articles of incorporation were&nbsp; <i>reconstructed</i> in the Securities&nbsp; and Exchange&nbsp; Commission on <i>April 8,&nbsp; 1948</i>.&nbsp; At first, this corporation sole administered all the <span style="font-style: italic;">temporalities</span> of the church existing or located in the island&nbsp; of Mindanao.&nbsp; Later on, however, new dioceses were formed and new corporations sole were created to&nbsp; correspond with the territorial&nbsp; jurisdiction of the new dioceses, one&nbsp; of&nbsp; them being&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein, the&nbsp; Roman&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Apostolic&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; Davao, Inc., which&nbsp; was registered&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Securities and Exchange Commission on September 12, 1950, and succeeded in&nbsp; the&nbsp; administration of all&nbsp; the "<span style="font-style: italic;">temporalities</span>"&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Roman Catholic Church existing in Davao.<br><br>According&nbsp; to&nbsp; our&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; Law,&nbsp;&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1459,&nbsp;&nbsp; approved&nbsp; April&nbsp; ],&nbsp;&nbsp; 1906,&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; sole <br><blockquote>is organized and composed&nbsp; of a single individual, the&nbsp; head of any religious society or church,&nbsp; for the administration of the&nbsp; temporalities of such society or church.&nbsp; By "temporalities" is meant estates and properties not&nbsp; used&nbsp; exclusively for' religious&nbsp; worship.&nbsp;&nbsp; The successors in office of such&nbsp; religious head or chief priest incorporal&nbsp; as a corporation&nbsp; sole shall&nbsp; become&nbsp; the corporation solo on to office, and&nbsp; shall be permitted to transact business as such on filing with, the Securities and Exchange Commission a copy of bis&nbsp; commission, certificate of election or letter of appointment duly certified by any&nbsp; notary&nbsp; public&nbsp; or&nbsp; clerk of&nbsp; court of record (Guevara's The&nbsp; Philippine Corporation Law, p. 223). </blockquote>The Corporation Law&nbsp; also contains the follojwing&nbsp; provisions :<br><blockquote>SECTION 159.&nbsp; Any&nbsp; corporation sole&nbsp; may&nbsp; <i>purchase&nbsp; and hold&nbsp; real estate and personal property for its&nbsp; church, charitable, benevolent, or educational purposes, and may receive&nbsp; bequests or gifts for suck purposes.</i>&nbsp; Such, corporation may mortgage op sell real property held by it upon obtaining an order for&nbsp; that purpose from the Court of First Instance of the province&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; property is situated; but before making the order proof must ho made to the satisfaction of the&nbsp; Court that&nbsp; notice of the application for leave to mortgage or sell&nbsp; has been&nbsp; given&nbsp; by&nbsp; publication&nbsp; or otherwise&nbsp; in such manner and for such time as&nbsp; said Court&nbsp; or&nbsp; the Judge&nbsp; thereof may&nbsp; have directed, and that it is&nbsp; to the interest of the corporation that leave to mortgage&nbsp; or sell should&nbsp; be granted.&nbsp; The application for leave to mortgage or sell must be made by&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; duly&nbsp; verified&nbsp; by&nbsp; the bishop,&nbsp; chief priest, or presiding elder, acting as corporation&nbsp; sole, and may be&nbsp; opposed by any member&nbsp; of: the religious denomination, society or church&nbsp; represented by the corporation sole: <i>Provided, however, That in cases where the rules,&nbsp; regulations, and discipline of the religious denomination, society&nbsp; or&nbsp; church concerned, represented by such corporation sole regulate the methods of acquiring, holding, selling and mortgaging real estate and personal property, such rules, regulations, and discipline&nbsp; shall&nbsp; control and the interventdtm of the Courts shall not he necessary</i>.</blockquote>It can, therefore,&nbsp; be noticed that the power of&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; <i>sole to purchase</i>&nbsp; real property,&nbsp; like the&nbsp; power exercised in the case at bar,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; restricted&nbsp; although the power&nbsp; to&nbsp; <i>sell or mortgage</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes&nbsp; is, depending upon the rules, regulations, and&nbsp; discipline of the church concerned represented by said corporation&nbsp; sole.&nbsp;&nbsp; If corporations sole&nbsp; can&nbsp; purchase and&nbsp; sell real&nbsp; estate for&nbsp; its church,&nbsp; charitable,&nbsp; benevolent,&nbsp; or educational purposes, can they register&nbsp; said&nbsp; real properties?&nbsp; As provided&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; lands&nbsp; held&nbsp; in&nbsp; trust for&nbsp; specific purposes&nbsp; may&nbsp; be subject of&nbsp; registration (section&nbsp; 69, Act 496),&nbsp; and the capacity of a corporation sole, like&nbsp; petitioner herein, to register lands belonging to&nbsp; it is&nbsp; acknowledged, and title thereto may be issued in its name&nbsp; (Bishop of Nueva Segovia vs. Insular&nbsp; Government, 26&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 300-1913). Indeed it is absurd to conceive that while the corporations sole that might be in need&nbsp; of acquiring&nbsp; lands for the erection of temples where the faithful can pray, or schools and cemeteries&nbsp; which&nbsp; they are expressly&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; by law to acquire in connection with the&nbsp; propagation of the Roman Catholic Apostolic faith or in furtherance of their freedom of religion, they could not register said properties in their name.&nbsp; As&nbsp; professor Javier&nbsp; J. Nepomuceno very well says "Man&nbsp; in&nbsp; his search for the immortal&nbsp; and imponderable, has, even before the dawn of&nbsp; recorded history, erected temples&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Unknown&nbsp; God, and&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no doubt that he will continue to do so&nbsp; for&nbsp; all time&nbsp; to come, as long as he continues 'imploring the&nbsp; aid of Divine Providence' "&nbsp; (Nepomuceno's&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; Sole,&nbsp; VI Ateneo Law Journal, No. 1, p. 41,&nbsp; September,&nbsp; 1956).&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the circumstances of&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, We might safely&nbsp; state that even before the&nbsp; establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth and of the Republic of the Philippines&nbsp; every corporation sole then organized and registered had by express provision of law the necessary power and qualification to purchase in its name private lands&nbsp; located in the territory in which&nbsp; it exercised its functions or ministry&nbsp; and for which it was created,&nbsp; independently of the&nbsp; nationality of its&nbsp; incumbent unique&nbsp; and single&nbsp; member and head, the bishop of the diocese.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be also maintained without fear of being gainsaid that the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Apostolic Church in the Philippines has no nationality and that the framers of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitution,&nbsp; as&nbsp; will&nbsp; be hereunder&nbsp; explained, did not&nbsp; have&nbsp; in mind the religious corporations sole when they provided that 60 per centum of the capital thereof be&nbsp; owned by Filipino citizens.<br><br>There could be no controversy as to the fact that a duly registered corporation sole is an&nbsp; artificial being having the&nbsp; right of&nbsp; succession and the power, attributes,&nbsp; and properties expressly authorized by law or incident&nbsp; to ita existence (section 1, Corporation Law).&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; outlining the general&nbsp; powers&nbsp; of a&nbsp; corporation. Public Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1459 provides&nbsp; among&nbsp; others: <br><br>Sec.&nbsp; 13. Every corporation has the&nbsp; power: <br><blockquote>* * *<br>(5) To purchase, hold, conyey, sell, lease, let, mortgage, encumber, and otherwise deal with such real and personal property as the purposes&nbsp; for which the corporation was&nbsp; formed may permit, and the transaction of the lawful business of the corporation may reasonably and&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; require,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; this Act:&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *.</blockquote>In&nbsp; implementation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same and specifically&nbsp; made applicable to a form of corporation recognized by the same law, Section 159 aforequoted expressly allowed the corporation sole to&nbsp; purchase and hold real as well as personal properties necessary for the&nbsp; promotion of the objects for which said corporation&nbsp; sole is created.&nbsp; Respondent Land Registration Commissioner, however, maintained that since the&nbsp; Philippine Constitution&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; later&nbsp;&nbsp; enactment&nbsp; than Public Act No.&nbsp; 1459,&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 159 in amplification&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 13&nbsp; thereof, as regard&nbsp; real&nbsp; properties, should be considered repealed&nbsp; by the former.<br><br>There is reason to believe&nbsp; that when the specific provision of the Constitution invoked by respondent Commissioner was&nbsp; under consideration,&nbsp; the framers of the same did not have in&nbsp; mind&nbsp; or overlooked&nbsp; this&nbsp; particular form of corporation.&nbsp; It is undeniable that&nbsp; the nationalization and conservation&nbsp; of our&nbsp; natural&nbsp; resources was&nbsp; one of the dominating objectives of the&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; and in drafting the present Article&nbsp; XIII&nbsp; of the Constitution, the delegates were&nbsp; goaded by the desire (1) to insure their conservation for Filipino&nbsp; posterity;&nbsp; (2) to serve&nbsp; as&nbsp; an instrument of national&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; helping prevent the extension&nbsp; into&nbsp; the country of foreign control through, peaceful economic penetration; and (3) to prevent making the Philippines a source of international&nbsp; conflicts with the&nbsp; consequent&nbsp; danger to its internal&nbsp; security&nbsp; and independence&nbsp; (<i>See</i> The Framing of the Philippine Constitution by Professor Jose M. Aruego, a Delegate&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Constitutional Convention,&nbsp; Vol.&nbsp; II.&nbsp; P. 592-604).&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the same book Delegate Aruego,&nbsp; explaining the reason behind the first consideration, wrote:<br><blockquote>"At&nbsp; the time&nbsp; of the framing of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Constitution, Filipino capital&nbsp; had been&nbsp; known&nbsp; to be&nbsp; rather&nbsp; shy.&nbsp; Filipinos hesitated as a general&nbsp; rule&nbsp; to invest&nbsp; a considerable sura of their capital&nbsp; for the&nbsp; development,&nbsp; exploitation and&nbsp; utilization&nbsp; of the natural resources of the country.&nbsp; They&nbsp; had not as yet been so used&nbsp; to corporate enterprises as the peoples of the&nbsp; west.&nbsp; This general apathy, the delegates knew, would&nbsp; mean the retardation of. the&nbsp; development of the natural resources, unless foreign capital would be encouraged to come and help in that development.&nbsp; <i>They knew&nbsp; that the nationalization&nbsp; of the natural resources would&nbsp; certainty not&nbsp; encourage the</i> INVESTMENT OF FOREIGN CAPITAL <i>into them</i>. But there was a general feeling in&nbsp; the Convention that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was better&nbsp; to&nbsp; have such a development&nbsp; retarded or even&nbsp; postponed together until&nbsp; such&nbsp; time when the&nbsp; Filipinos&nbsp; would&nbsp; be ready&nbsp; and willing to&nbsp; undertake it rather than permit&nbsp; the&nbsp; natural&nbsp; resources to be&nbsp; placed&nbsp; under the&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; or&nbsp; control&nbsp; of&nbsp; foreigners in order&nbsp; that they might be immediately developed, with the Filipinos of the future&nbsp; serving not as owners but utmosts as tenants or workers under foreign&nbsp; masters.&nbsp; By all&nbsp; means,&nbsp; the:&nbsp; delegates believed,&nbsp; the natural&nbsp; resources should&nbsp; be conserved&nbsp; for Filipino posterity".</blockquote>It&nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp; be distilled&nbsp; from&nbsp; the foregoing that&nbsp; the framers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Constitution intended&nbsp; said provisions as barrier for&nbsp; foreigners or corporations financed&nbsp; by such foreigners&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire,&nbsp; exploit&nbsp; and develop&nbsp; our natural resources, saving&nbsp; these undeveloped&nbsp; wealth for our&nbsp; people to clear&nbsp; and enrich&nbsp; when&nbsp; they are&nbsp; already prepared and capable of&nbsp;&nbsp; doing so.&nbsp; But that&nbsp; is&nbsp; not the&nbsp; case of corporations sole&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; for, We repeat, they are mere administrators&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; "temporalities" or&nbsp; properties titled&nbsp; in their name&nbsp; and&nbsp; for the benefit&nbsp; of the members&nbsp; of their&nbsp; respective religion&nbsp; composed&nbsp; of&nbsp; an overwhelming&nbsp; majority&nbsp; of&nbsp; Filipinos.&nbsp; No&nbsp; mention&nbsp; nor allusion whatsoever&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Constitution as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; against&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; ability&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Roman Catholic&nbsp; Church in the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire and hold agricultural lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there were some discussions on landholdings, they were mostly confined in the inclusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the provision allowing the Government to break big landed estates to put an&nbsp; end to absentee&nbsp; landlordism.<br><br>But let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that the above referred to inhibitory clause of Section 1 of&nbsp; Article XIII&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Constitution does have bearing&nbsp; on&nbsp; the petitioner's case; even so the clause&nbsp; requiring that&nbsp; at least 60 per centum of the capital of the corporation be owned by Filipinos&nbsp; is&nbsp; subordinated to the petitioner's aforesaid right already&nbsp; existing at the time&nbsp; of the inauguration&nbsp; of the Commonwealth&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines. In the language of Mr. Justice Jose P. Laurel&nbsp; (a Delegate to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp; Convention),&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; concurring opinion&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Gold&nbsp; Creek&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Corporation, petitioner vs. Eulogio Rodriguez, Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, and&nbsp; Quirico&nbsp; Abadilla,&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of the Bureau&nbsp; of Mines, respondent,&nbsp; 66&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 259:<br><br><i>"The saving clause in the section involved of&nbsp; the Constitution&nbsp; was originally embodied in the report submitted by&nbsp; the Committee on Nationalization and Preservation of&nbsp; Lands and Other&nbsp; Natural Resources&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 3 7, 1934.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was later inserted&nbsp; in the first draft of the Constitution as section 13 of Article XIII thereof, and finally incorporated&nbsp; as we find it now.&nbsp; Slight have been the&nbsp; changes undergone by the proviso from the time when it came out of the committee until it&nbsp; was finally adopted.&nbsp; When&nbsp; first&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; and as&nbsp; inserted in the first&nbsp; draft of the Constitution&nbsp; it reads:&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to any right,&nbsp; grant,&nbsp; lease&nbsp; or concession&nbsp; existing&nbsp; in respect thereto&nbsp; on the date of the adoption of&nbsp; the Constitution'.&nbsp; As&nbsp; finally&nbsp; adopted, the proviso reads: 'subject to any existing right, grant,&nbsp; lease&nbsp; or concession at the time of&nbsp; the inauguration of&nbsp; the Government established under this Constitution'.&nbsp; This recognition is not mere graciousness but springs from tho just character of the government established.&nbsp; The framers of the&nbsp; Constitution were not obscured by the rhetoric of democracy or swayed to hostility&nbsp; by an&nbsp; intense spirit of nationalism.&nbsp; They well&nbsp; knew that conservation&nbsp; of&nbsp; our natural&nbsp; resources did not&nbsp; mean destruction&nbsp; or annihilation&nbsp; of acquired&nbsp; property&nbsp; rights.&nbsp; Withal,&nbsp; they&nbsp;&nbsp; erected&nbsp; a&nbsp; government neither episodic nor stationary but&nbsp; well-high&nbsp; conservative&nbsp; in&nbsp; the protection&nbsp; of property rights. This&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; nationalistic and&nbsp; socialistic traits discoverable upon even a sudden&nbsp; dip into a variety of the provisions&nbsp; embodied in the instrument."</i><br><br>The&nbsp; writer&nbsp; of&nbsp; this decision&nbsp; wishes&nbsp; to&nbsp; state at&nbsp; this juncture&nbsp; that&nbsp; during the deliberation of this case he submitted&nbsp; to the consideration of the Court the question that may be termed the "vested right saving&nbsp; clause" contained in Section 1,&nbsp; Article&nbsp; XIII of the Constitution, but some of the&nbsp; members of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court either did not agree with the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; of&nbsp; the writer, or were&nbsp; not&nbsp; ready&nbsp; to take a definite stand&nbsp; on the particular point I am now to discuss deferring our&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; on&nbsp; such debatable question&nbsp; for a better&nbsp; occasion, inasmuch as&nbsp; the determination thereof is not absolutely necessary for the solution of the problem involved&nbsp; in this case.&nbsp; In his desire&nbsp; to face the&nbsp; issues squarely, the writer will endeavour,&nbsp; at least as a digression, to explain and&nbsp; develop&nbsp; his theory, not as a lucubration of the Court, but of&nbsp; his&nbsp; own,&nbsp; for he deems&nbsp; it better and&nbsp; convenient to&nbsp; go over&nbsp; the&nbsp; cycle&nbsp; of reasons that are&nbsp; linked to&nbsp; one&nbsp; another and&nbsp; that step by step lead Us to conclude as We do in the&nbsp; dispositive part of this&nbsp; decision.<br><br>It will&nbsp; be noticed&nbsp; that&nbsp; Section 1 of Article&nbsp; XIII of the Constitution provides,&nbsp; among; other things, that "<i>all</i> agricultural lands&nbsp; of the public domain and&nbsp; their disposition shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines or to <i>corporations at least&nbsp; 60 per&nbsp; centum of&nbsp; the&nbsp; capital of&nbsp; which is owned by&nbsp; such&nbsp; citizens</i>,&nbsp; SUBJECT&nbsp; TO&nbsp; ANY&nbsp; EXISTING RIGHT&nbsp; AT&nbsp; THE&nbsp; TIME OF THE INAUGURATION OF&nbsp; THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED UNDER&nbsp; THIS CONSTITUTION."<br><br>As recounted by&nbsp; Mr. Justice Laurel in the aforementioned case of Gold Creek Mining Corporation vs.&nbsp; Rodriguez et al., 66 Phil. 259, "this recognition (in the clause already&nbsp; quoted),&nbsp; is&nbsp; not mere graciousness&nbsp; <i>but springs from the just character of&nbsp; the&nbsp; government established. The framers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Constitution were not&nbsp; obscured by the rhetoric of democracy&nbsp; or swayed to&nbsp; hostility&nbsp; by an intense spirit of nationalism.&nbsp;&nbsp; They well knew that conservation of our natural resources did not mean destruction' or annihilation of</i> ACQUIRED PROPERTY RIGHTS".<br><br>But&nbsp; respondents' counsel may argue that the <i>preexisting</i> right of acquisition of public or&nbsp; private&nbsp; lands by&nbsp; a corporation which does not fulfill this 60 per cent requisite, refers to&nbsp; purchases or&nbsp; acquisitions&nbsp; made&nbsp; <i>prior</i>&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effectivity of the Constitution and not to <i>later</i> transactions. This argument would imply that even assuming that petitioner&nbsp; had&nbsp; at the time of the enactment of the Constitution the right to purchase real property, that power&nbsp; or right could not&nbsp; be exercised&nbsp; after&nbsp; the effectivity&nbsp; of our Constitution, because said power or right of corporations sole, like the herein petitioner, conferred in virtue of the aforequoted provisions of the Corporation Law, could no longer be&nbsp; exercised in view&nbsp; of the requisite therein prescribed that at Jeast 60 per centum of the capital of the corporation had to be&nbsp; Filipino.&nbsp; It has been&nbsp; shown before that:&nbsp; (1) the corporation sole, unlike the ordinary corporations which are formed by no less&nbsp; than 5 incorporators,&nbsp; is composed of only one person, usually the head or bishop of the diocese, a unit which is not subject to expansion&nbsp; for&nbsp; the purpose of determining any percentage whatsoever;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the corporation sole is only the <i>administrator</i> and not the owner of the temporalities located in the territory comprised by said corporation&nbsp; sole;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; such temporalities&nbsp; are&nbsp; administered&nbsp; for and on behalf of the faithful residing in the diocese or&nbsp; territory&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corporation sole;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; as such, has&nbsp; no nationality and&nbsp; the citizenship of the incumbent Ordinary has nothing to do with the operation,&nbsp; management or administration of&nbsp; the corporation sole,&nbsp; nor affects the citizenship of the faithful connected with&nbsp; their respective&nbsp; diocese or corporation sole.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of&nbsp; these peculiarities&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole, it would seem obvious&nbsp; that when the specific provision of the Constitution invoked by respondent Commissioner (section&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; Art.&nbsp; XIII),&nbsp; was&nbsp; under consideration,&nbsp; the framers of the same did not have&nbsp; in mind or overlooked this particular form of&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; If this were so, as the facts and circumstances already indicated tend to prove . it to&nbsp; be&nbsp; so, then the inescapable conclusion&nbsp; would be that this requirement of at least 60 per cent of Filipino capital was never intended to apply to corporations sole, and the existence or&nbsp; not of a vested right becomes unquestionably immaterial.<br><br>But let us&nbsp; assume that the questioned proviso is material, yet We&nbsp; might say that&nbsp; a reading&nbsp; of said Section&nbsp; 1 will show&nbsp; that it does&nbsp; not refer to any actual&nbsp; acquisition of land but to the <i>right, qualification or power to acquire</i> and hold private&nbsp; real property.&nbsp;&nbsp; The population of the Philippines, Catholic to a high percentage, is ever increasing. In the practice of religion of their faithful the corporation sole may be&nbsp; in need of more temples where to pray, more schools&nbsp; where&nbsp; the&nbsp; children of the&nbsp; congregation could&nbsp; be taught in the principles of their&nbsp; religion, more hospitals where their&nbsp; sick could&nbsp; be treated, more hallow or&nbsp; consecrated&nbsp; grounds or cemeteries where Catholics could&nbsp; be buried,&nbsp; many more than&nbsp; those actually existing at&nbsp; the time of the enactment of our Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; This being the case,&nbsp; could it be logically maintained that because the corporation sole which, by express provision&nbsp; of law, has&nbsp; the power to hold and acquire real&nbsp; estate and personal property for&nbsp; its churches, charitable benevolent, or educational purposes (section 159, Corporation Law) it has to stop "its growth&nbsp; and&nbsp; restrain its&nbsp; necessities just because the&nbsp; corporation sole is a non-stock corporation composed of only one person&nbsp; who&nbsp; in his unity&nbsp; does not admit of&nbsp; any percentage,&nbsp; especially 'when&nbsp; that person&nbsp; is not&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner but merely&nbsp; an administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the temporalities&nbsp; of the corporation&nbsp; sole?&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer leaves the answer to&nbsp; whoever may read and consider this portion of the&nbsp; decision.<br><br>Anyway, as stated before, this question is not a decisive factor in. disposing this case,&nbsp; for even if We were&nbsp; to disregard such saving clause of the Constitution, which reads: <i>subject to any existing right, grant, etc., at&nbsp; the time of the inauguration of the Government&nbsp; established under this Constitution,</i> yet We would have, under the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on record, sufficient&nbsp; grounds to uphold petitioner's contention on this matter.<br><br>In this case&nbsp; of the Register of Deeds of Rizal vs. Ung Sui&nbsp; Si Temple,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> G. R. No. L-6776,&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; May 21, 1955, wherein&nbsp; this question was considered from&nbsp; a different&nbsp; angle, this Court,&nbsp; through&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Justice J. B.&nbsp; L. Reyes,&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"The fact that the appellant religious organization has&nbsp; no capital stock does not suffice to escape the Constitutional&nbsp; inhibition, since it&nbsp; is admitted that its members are of foreign nationality. The purpose of the sixty per centum requirement is obviously to ensure that corporation or associations allowed to acquired agricultural land or to exploit&nbsp; natural resources shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; controlled by&nbsp; Filipinos; and the&nbsp; spirit&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; demands that <i>in the absence&nbsp; of capital stock,&nbsp; the&nbsp; controlling&nbsp; membership should&nbsp; be composed&nbsp; of Filipino citizens</i>"</blockquote>In that case respondent-appellant Ung Siu Si Temple was not a corporation&nbsp; sole but a corporation aggregate, i.e.,&nbsp; an&nbsp; unregistered organization&nbsp; operating through&nbsp; 3 trustees, all&nbsp; of Chinese nationality,&nbsp; and that is why this Court laid down the doctrine&nbsp; just&nbsp; quoted.&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to petitioner, the Roman Catholic Administrator of Davao, Inc.,&nbsp; which&nbsp; likewise is&nbsp; a non-stock&nbsp; corporation, the&nbsp; case is&nbsp; different,&nbsp; because it is&nbsp; a&nbsp; registered&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole, evidently of no nationality and&nbsp; registered&nbsp; mainly to administer the temporalities and manage the properties be- longing to the faithful&nbsp; of said church residing in Davao. But even if we were to go over the record to inquire into the composing&nbsp; membership&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; whether the citizenship requirement is satisfied or not, we would find undeniable proof that the members of the Roman Catholic Apostolic faith&nbsp; within&nbsp; the territory of&nbsp; Davao are predominantly&nbsp; Filipino citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; indicated before, petitioner has presented evidence to&nbsp; establish that&nbsp; the&nbsp; clergy and lay members of this religion fully&nbsp; covers the percentage of Filipino citizens required by the Constitution. These facts are&nbsp; not controverted by&nbsp; respondents and our conclusion in this&nbsp; point is sensibly obvious. <br><br><i>Dissenting Opinion—Discussed.</i>—After having developed our theory in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; and arrived at&nbsp; the&nbsp; findings and conclusions already expressed in this decision.&nbsp; We now deem it proper to analyze and delve into the basic foundation on&nbsp; which the&nbsp; dissenting opinion stands up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being aware of the transcendental and far-reaching effects that Our ruling&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter might have, this&nbsp; case was thoroughly considered from all points of&nbsp; view,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court sparing no effort to solve the delicate problems involved herein.<br><br>At the&nbsp; deliberations had&nbsp; to attain this end,&nbsp; two ways were open to a prompt&nbsp; dispatch&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case:&nbsp; (1) the reversal of the doctrine&nbsp; We laid down in the&nbsp; celebrated Krivenko case by excluding <i>urban</i> lots and properties from the grasp of the term&nbsp; "private agricultural lands" used in section 5, Article XIII&nbsp; of the Constitution; and (2) by driving&nbsp; Our reasons to a point that might indirectly cause the appointment of Filipino bishops or&nbsp; Ordinary&nbsp; to head the corporations sole&nbsp; created to&nbsp; administer&nbsp; the&nbsp; temporalities of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. With regard to&nbsp; the first way, a great&nbsp; majority of the members of this Court&nbsp; were not&nbsp; yet&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; nor agreeable to&nbsp; follow that course, for reasons that are obvious. As to the second way. it seems to&nbsp; be misleading because the nationality of the head&nbsp; of&nbsp; a diocese constituted as&nbsp; a corporation sole has no material bearing on the functions of the latter, which are&nbsp; limited to the administration of the temporalities of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church in the Philippines.<br><br>Upon going over the grounds on&nbsp; which the dissenting opinion is based, it may be noticed that its author lingered on the&nbsp; outskirts of the&nbsp; issues, thus throwing&nbsp; the main points in controversy out of focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course We fully agree, as&nbsp; stated by Professor Aruego, that the framers of our Constitution&nbsp; had at heart&nbsp; to insure the conservation of the natural resources&nbsp; of Our motherland&nbsp; for Pilipino posterity; to&nbsp; serve them as an instrument&nbsp; of&nbsp; national defense,&nbsp; helping&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; the extension into the country of <i>foreign control</i> through peaceful economic penetration; and to prevent making the Philippines&nbsp; a source of international conflicts with the consequent danger to its internal security&nbsp; and independence.&nbsp; But all&nbsp; these&nbsp; precautions adopted by&nbsp; the Delegates to Our Constitutional&nbsp; Assembly could not&nbsp; have been intended for or directed against cases like the one at bar.&nbsp; The&nbsp; emphasis and wonderings&nbsp; on the statement that once the&nbsp; capacity of&nbsp; a corporation sole to acquire <i>private</i> agricultural lands is admitted there will be no limit to the areas that it may hold and that this will pave the way for the "revival or revitalization of religious landholdings that proved&nbsp; so troublesome in our past", cannot even furnish the "penumbra" of a threat to the future of the Filipino people.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the first place, the right of Filipino citizens, including those of foreign&nbsp; extraction, and Philippine corporations,&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire&nbsp; <i>private</i> lands&nbsp; is not subject to any restriction or limit as to quantity or area, and&nbsp; We certainly do&nbsp; not see&nbsp; any wrong in that.&nbsp; The right of Filipino citizens and corporations to acquire <i>public</i> agricultural lands is already&nbsp; limited by law.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; second place, corporations sole&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; aliens because they have&nbsp; no nationality at&nbsp; all.&nbsp; Corporations<br><br>sole are, under the law, mere <i>administrators</i> of the&nbsp; temporalities of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. In the&nbsp; third place,&nbsp; every corporation, be it&nbsp; aggregate&nbsp; or sole,&nbsp; is <i>only</i> entitled to purchase, convey, sell,&nbsp; lease, let, mortgage,&nbsp; encumber and otherwise&nbsp; deal with real properties when it is pursuant to or in consonance with the purposes for which the corporation was formed,&nbsp; and when the transactions&nbsp; of the lawful business of the corporation reasonably&nbsp; and necessarily require such dealing—section 13-(5)&nbsp; of the Corporation&nbsp; Law, Public Act No. 1459— and&nbsp; considering&nbsp; these&nbsp; provisions&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; conjunction&nbsp; with Section 159 of the&nbsp; same law which provides that a&nbsp; corporation sole may <i>only</i> "purchase and hold real estate and personal properties for&nbsp; its church, charitable, benevolent or educational&nbsp; purposes", the above mentioned fear of revitalization of religious landholdings in the Philippines is absolutely&nbsp; dispelled.&nbsp; The fact that the law thus expressly authorizes the corporations sole to <i>receive bequestsor&nbsp; gifts of real properties</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; (which were the main source that the friars had to acquire&nbsp; their&nbsp; big <i>haciendas</i>&nbsp; during&nbsp; the Spanish regime), is a clear indication that&nbsp; the <i>requisite</i> that&nbsp; bequests or&nbsp; gifts of real estate be&nbsp; for charitable, benevolent, or&nbsp; educational purposes, was, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion of the legislators, considered sufficient and&nbsp; adequate&nbsp; protection&nbsp; against the revitalization of religious landholdings.<br><br>Finally,&nbsp; and as&nbsp; previously stated,&nbsp; We have&nbsp; reason&nbsp; to believe that when the Delegates to the Constitutional&nbsp; Convention drafted&nbsp; and approved&nbsp; Article&nbsp; XIII of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution, they did not have in mind the corporation&nbsp; sole. We&nbsp; come&nbsp;&nbsp; to this finding&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitutional Assembly,&nbsp; composed as it was&nbsp; by a great number&nbsp; of eminent lawyers and jurists, was like any other legislative body&nbsp; empowered to enact either&nbsp; the Constitution of the country&nbsp; or any&nbsp; public&nbsp; statute,&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; to know the conditions&nbsp; existing as to particular&nbsp; subject matter when it enacted&nbsp; a statute&nbsp; (Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Com'rs of Orange County vs. Bain, 92 S. E.&nbsp; 176; 173 N. C. 377).<br><blockquote>"Immemorial&nbsp; customs are presumed to&nbsp; have been always&nbsp; in the mind of the Legislature in&nbsp; enacting legislation,"&nbsp;&nbsp; (In re Kruger's Estate, 121 A. 109; 277 Pa. 326).<br><br>"The Legislative is&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; to&nbsp; have a knowledge&nbsp; of the state of&nbsp; the law&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; subjects&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which it&nbsp; legislates."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Clover Valley Land &amp;&nbsp; Stock&nbsp; Co. vs. Lamb et al., 187, p. 723, 726.)<br><br>"The Court in construing a statute, will assume that the legislature acted' with&nbsp; full knowledge&nbsp; of the prior legislation&nbsp; on the subject and its construction by the courts."&nbsp; (Johns vs. Town&nbsp; of Sheridan, 89&nbsp; N. E. 899,&nbsp; 44 Ind. App. 620.)<br><br>"The Legislature is presumed to have&nbsp; been familiar with the subject with winch it&nbsp; was dealing * * *"&nbsp; (Landers vs. Commonwealth, 101 S.

W.&nbsp; 202,&nbsp; 250&nbsp; Mich. 349, followed in&nbsp; P.&nbsp; vs. Woodworth, 230 N. W. 211,&nbsp; 250&nbsp; Mich. 436.)<br><br>"It is not to be presumed&nbsp; that&nbsp; a provision&nbsp; was inserted in a constitution or statute without reason, or that a result was&nbsp; intended inconsistent with the&nbsp; judgment of men of common sense guided by reason."&nbsp; (Mitchell vs. Lawden,&nbsp; 123&nbsp; H, B. 566, 288 111.&nbsp; 326.)&nbsp; See City of Decatur vs. German, 142 N.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; 2S2, 310 III.&nbsp; 591, and many other authorities that can be cited in support&nbsp; hereof. </blockquote>Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp; Assembly&nbsp; must&nbsp; have known:<br><blockquote><ol><li> That a corporation sole&nbsp; is&nbsp; organized by&nbsp; and&nbsp; composed of a <i>single individual</i>, the&nbsp; head&nbsp; of any religious&nbsp; society&nbsp; or&nbsp; church operating within&nbsp; the&nbsp; zone,&nbsp; area or jurisdiction covered&nbsp; by said ' corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; (Article 155, Public Act No.&nbsp; 1459);<br></li><li> That a&nbsp; corporation sole is&nbsp; a non-stock corporation; <br></li><li> That the Ordinary&nbsp; (the corporation sole proper) does&nbsp; not own the temporalities which he&nbsp; merely administers; <br></li><li> That under the&nbsp; law the&nbsp; nationality&nbsp; of said Ordinary&nbsp; or of any administrator has&nbsp; absolutely no bearing on the nationality of the person desiring to&nbsp; acquire real property&nbsp; in the Philippines&nbsp; by purchase or other lawful means other than by hereditary&nbsp; succession, who,&nbsp; according to the Constitution must be a&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; (sections 1 and 5,&nbsp; Article XIII); <br></li><li> That section&nbsp; 159&nbsp; of the Corporation Law <i>expressly</i>&nbsp; authorised the corporation sole to <i>purchase and&nbsp; hold</i> Teal estate for&nbsp; its church, charitable, benevolent&nbsp; or educational&nbsp; purposes,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; <i>receive bequests or gifts</i> for such purposes; <br></li><li> That in approving our&nbsp; Magna Carta the Delegates to the Constitutional Convention,&nbsp; almost&nbsp; all of whom were Roman Catholics.</li></ol></blockquote>could not have intended to curtail the propagation of the&nbsp; Roman Catholic faith or the expansion of the activities of their church, knowing pretty well that with the growth of our population more places of worship, more schools where our youth could be&nbsp; taught and trained; more hallow grounds where to bury our dead would be needed in the course of time.<br><br>Long before the enactment of our Constitution the law authorized&nbsp; the corporations sole even&nbsp; to receive bequests or gifts of real estates&nbsp; and this Court could not, without any clear&nbsp; and specific&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution, declare that&nbsp; any real property&nbsp; <i>donated</i>,&nbsp; let us say this year, could&nbsp; no longer be registered in the&nbsp; name of the corporation&nbsp; sole to which it&nbsp; was conveyed.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would be an absurdity that should&nbsp; not receive bur sanction&nbsp; on the pretext that corporations&nbsp; sole which have no nationality and are non-stock corporations composed of only one person&nbsp; in the&nbsp; capacity of administrator, have to establish first that at least sixty&nbsp; per centum of their capital belong to Filipino citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Civil Code&nbsp; even provides:<br><blockquote>"ART.&nbsp; 10.—In&nbsp; case of&nbsp; doubt in&nbsp; the <i>interpretation or application of lawn</i>, it&nbsp; is presumed that the lawmaking body&nbsp; intended right and justice&nbsp; to prevail."</blockquote>Moreover, under the laws&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; the administrator of the properties&nbsp; of a Filipino&nbsp; can&nbsp; acquire, <i>in the name of the latter</i>, private lands without any limitation whatsoever,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that is so&nbsp; because the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; thus acquired are not for and would not&nbsp; belong to&nbsp; the administrator but to the Filipino whom&nbsp; he&nbsp; represents.&nbsp; But the dissenting Justice inquires:&nbsp; If&nbsp; the Ordinary is only the administrator, for&nbsp; whom&nbsp; does&nbsp; he administer?&nbsp;&nbsp; And who can alter&nbsp; or overrule his&nbsp; acts?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will&nbsp; forthwith proceed to answer these questions.&nbsp; The corporations sole by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; peculiar constitution and&nbsp; form&nbsp; of operation&nbsp; have no&nbsp; designed&nbsp;&nbsp; owner of its temporalities, although by the terms of the&nbsp; law it can be safely implied that the Ordinary holds them <i>in trust</i> for the&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; of the Roman Catholic&nbsp; faithful&nbsp; of their&nbsp; respective locality or&nbsp; diocese.&nbsp; Borrowing&nbsp; the&nbsp; very words of the&nbsp; law,&nbsp; We may&nbsp; say that&nbsp; the temporalities of every corporation sole are held <i>in trust</i> for the use, purpose, behoof and benefit of the religious society, or <i>order so incorporated</i> or of the church to which the diocese, synod, or district organization is an&nbsp; organized and constituent part (section 163&nbsp; of the Corporation Law).<br><br>In&nbsp; connection with the powers of the&nbsp; Ordinary over the temporalities of the corporation sole, let us&nbsp; see now what is the meaning and scope&nbsp; of the&nbsp; word&nbsp; "control".&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Merriam-Webster's New&nbsp; International Dictionary,&nbsp; 2nd ed., p.&nbsp; 580, one of&nbsp; the acceptations of&nbsp; the word&nbsp; "control"&nbsp; is:<br><blockquote>"4. To&nbsp; exercise restraining or directing&nbsp; influence&nbsp; over;&nbsp; to dominate; regulate;&nbsp; hence, to hold from action; to curb;&nbsp; subject; also, Obn.—to overpower.<br>"SYN: restrain, rule, govern, guide, direct;&nbsp; check, subdue.</blockquote>" It is&nbsp; true that under section 159 of the Corporation Law, the intervention of the courts is not necessary, to mortgage or sell real property held by the corporation sole&nbsp; where the rules,&nbsp; regulations and discipline of the religious&nbsp; denomination,&nbsp; society or&nbsp; church concerned&nbsp; represented by such&nbsp; corporation sole regulate the methods of acquiring, holding,&nbsp; selling and mortgaging real estate, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Roman Catholic faithful residing in the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the corporation sole&nbsp; has no&nbsp; say&nbsp; either&nbsp; in the manner of acquiring&nbsp; or of&nbsp; selling real property.&nbsp; It&nbsp; may be&nbsp; also admitted that&nbsp; the faithful of the diocese&nbsp; cannot govern or overrule the acts of&nbsp; the Ordinary,&nbsp; but all this&nbsp; does not mean that the latter can administer the temporalities of the corporation sole&nbsp; without&nbsp; check&nbsp; or restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not forget that when&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; sole is&nbsp; incorporated under&nbsp; Philippine laws, the head and only member thereof subjects himself&nbsp; to the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Philip- pine courts of justice and these tribunals&nbsp; can thus enter- tain&nbsp; grievances arising&nbsp; out of&nbsp; or with&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; the temporalities of the church which came into the possession of the corporation sole as administrator. It may be alleged that&nbsp; the courts&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; intervene&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the matters of doctrine or teachings of the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Church.&nbsp; That is correct, but the courts may step in, at the instance of the faithful&nbsp; for whom the&nbsp; temporalities are being held in trust, to check&nbsp; undue exercise by&nbsp; the corporation sole of its&nbsp; powers as&nbsp; administrator to insure that they are used for the purpose or purposes lor which the corporation sole was created.<br><br>American authorities have these to say:<br><blockquote><i>It has been held that the, courts have jurisdiction&nbsp; over an action brought&nbsp; by persons claiming to be members&nbsp; of a church, who-&nbsp; allege a wrongful and fraudulent diversion of the&nbsp; church 'property to uses foreign to the purposes of the church, since no ecclesiastical question is involved and equity will&nbsp; protect&nbsp; from&nbsp; wrongful diversion of the property</i>&nbsp; (Hondryx vs. Peoples&nbsp; United&nbsp; Church, 42 Wash.&nbsp; 336, 4 L.R.A.—n.s. 4).<br><br>The courts of the State have no&nbsp; general&nbsp; jurisdiction and control over the officers of such corporations in respect&nbsp; to the performance of their official duties; <i>but as in respect to the property which they hold for the corporation, they stand in position of TRUSTEES and the courts may&nbsp; exercise the same supervision as in&nbsp; other cases of trust</i> (Ramsey vs. Hicks,&nbsp; 174 Ind. 428, 91 N. E. 344, 92 N. E. 164, 30 L.R.A.—n.s.-665;&nbsp; Hendryx vs. Peoples United Church, <i>supra</i>.)<br><br>Courts of the state do not interfere with the administration of church rules or discipline unless civil rights become involved and which must be protected&nbsp; (Morris St., Baptist Church vs.&nbsp; Dart, 67 S. C. S38, 45 S. E. 753, and others).&nbsp; (All cited in Vol. II, Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, p.&nbsp; 960-964.)</blockquote>If the Constitutional Assembly was aware&nbsp; of all the facts above enumerated and&nbsp; of the provisions of law&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to existing conditions as to&nbsp; management and operation of corporations sole in the Philippines, and if, on the other hand, almost all of the Delegates thereto embraced the Roman Catholic faith, can it be imagined even for an instant that when&nbsp; Article XIII of the Constitution&nbsp; was approved the framers thereof intended&nbsp; to prevent or curtail from then on the&nbsp; acquisition by&nbsp; corporations sole, either by purchase or donation, of real properties that they might need for the&nbsp; propagation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the faith&nbsp; and for&nbsp; other religious and Christian activities such as the moral&nbsp; education of&nbsp; the youth, the&nbsp; care, attention&nbsp; and&nbsp; treatment of&nbsp; the sick and the&nbsp; burial&nbsp; of the dead of the Roman Catholic faithful residing in the jurisdiction of the respective corporations sole ?&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; mere&nbsp; indulgence&nbsp; in&nbsp; said thought would impress upon Us a feeling of apprehension and absurdity.&nbsp; And that&nbsp; is&nbsp; precisely the <i>leit motiv</i>&nbsp; that&nbsp; permeates the&nbsp; whole fabric&nbsp; of the dissenting&nbsp; opinion.<br><br>It&nbsp; seems&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; that the&nbsp; main&nbsp; problem We&nbsp; are&nbsp; confronted with&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; hinges&nbsp; around the necessity&nbsp; of a proper&nbsp; and adequate&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of sections 1 and 5 of Article XIII of the Constitution.&nbsp; Let Us then be&nbsp; guided&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; principles&nbsp; of&nbsp; statutory&nbsp; construction laid&nbsp; down by&nbsp; the authorities on the matter:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; most&nbsp; important single factor in&nbsp; determining the intention of the people from whom the constitution emanated is the language in which it&nbsp; is&nbsp; expressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words employed&nbsp; are to be taken in their natural sense,&nbsp; except that legal or technical&nbsp; terms are to be given their technical&nbsp; meaning.&nbsp; The imperfections of language as a vehicle for&nbsp; conveying meanings result in ambiguities that must be resolved by resort to extraneous aids&nbsp; for discovering the intent of the&nbsp; framers.&nbsp; Among1 the&nbsp; more important&nbsp; of these&nbsp; are a consideration of the history of&nbsp; the times when the provision was adopted and of&nbsp; the purposes&nbsp; aimed&nbsp; at in&nbsp; its adoption.&nbsp; The&nbsp; debates&nbsp; of constitutional&nbsp; conventions,&nbsp; contemporaneous&nbsp; construction, and&nbsp; practical construction&nbsp; by the legislative&nbsp; and&nbsp; executive departments,&nbsp; especially if long&nbsp; continued, may be&nbsp; resorted to to resolve, but not to create, ambiguities. * * *.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Consideration&nbsp; of the consequences flowing from alternative constructions&nbsp; of doubtful provisions constitutes an important interpretative&nbsp; device.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purposes&nbsp; of many of the broadly phrased&nbsp; constiiutional limitations were the promotion of policies&nbsp; that do&nbsp; not lend themselves to definite&nbsp; and&nbsp; specific formulation</i>.&nbsp; The courts have had to define those policies and&nbsp; have&nbsp; often drawn&nbsp; on natural law&nbsp; and natural rights theories in doing&nbsp; so. The interpretation of constitutions tends to respond to changing conceptions of&nbsp; political&nbsp; and&nbsp; social&nbsp; values. The&nbsp; extent to&nbsp; which these extraneous aids affect the judicial construction of constitutions cannot be formulated in precise rules, but their influence cannot be ignored in&nbsp; describing the&nbsp; essentials of the process" (Kottschaeffer on Constitutional&nbsp; Law, 1939 ed., p. 18-19).<br><br>"There are times when&nbsp; even the&nbsp; literal expression of&nbsp; legislation may be inconsistent with the general objectives of policy behind it, and&nbsp; on the basis&nbsp; of the equity or&nbsp; spirit of the statute&nbsp; the courts rationalize&nbsp; a restricted meaning of the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp; A restricted interpretation is usually applied where the&nbsp; effect of a&nbsp; literal&nbsp; interpretation will make for injustice and&nbsp; absurdity&nbsp; or, in&nbsp; the words of one court, the language&nbsp; must be so unreasonable&nbsp; 'as to&nbsp; shock general&nbsp; common&nbsp; sense'".&nbsp; (Vol.&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; Sutherland on&nbsp; Statutory&nbsp; Construction, 3rd ed.,&nbsp; 150.)<br><br>"A constitution&nbsp; is not intended to be a limitation on&nbsp; the development of a country&nbsp; nor&nbsp; an obstruction&nbsp; to&nbsp; its progress&nbsp; and foreign relations"&nbsp; (Moscow Fire Ins.&nbsp; Co. of Moscow, Russia&nbsp; vs. Bank of New York &amp; Trust Co., 294 N.&nbsp; Y. S.&nbsp; 643; 56 N.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; 2d 745,&nbsp; 293 N. Y. 749).<br><br>"Although the meaning or&nbsp; principles of a&nbsp; constitution remain fixed and unchanged from the time of its&nbsp; adoption, a&nbsp; constitution must be construed as if intended to stand for a great&nbsp; length of time, and it is progressive and not static.&nbsp; Accordingly, it&nbsp; should not&nbsp; receive&nbsp; too narrow or literal&nbsp; an interpretation but rather&nbsp; the meaning given it&nbsp; should be&nbsp; applied in such&nbsp; manner&nbsp; as to meet new or changed conditions as they arise" (U.S. vs. Lassie, 313&nbsp; U.S. 299,&nbsp; 85&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Ed., 1368).<br><br>"Effect should be given&nbsp; to the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; indicated by a fair interpretation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; language used and that&nbsp; construction&nbsp; which effectuates,&nbsp; rather&nbsp; than that&nbsp; which destroys&nbsp; a&nbsp; plain&nbsp; intent or purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; constitutional&nbsp; provision,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not only favored&nbsp;&nbsp; but will&nbsp; be&nbsp; adopted"&nbsp; (State&nbsp; ex rel. Randolph Country, vs.&nbsp; Walden,&nbsp; 206 S. W.&nbsp; 2d&nbsp; 979).<br><br>"It is quite generally held that in&nbsp; arriving at the intent&nbsp; and purpose&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction should be&nbsp; broad&nbsp; or liberal or&nbsp; equitable, as&nbsp; the&nbsp; better&nbsp; method&nbsp; of ascertaining&nbsp; that intent, rather&nbsp; than technical" (Great&nbsp; Southern&nbsp; Life Ins. Co.&nbsp; vs. City of Austin,&nbsp; 243 S.W.&nbsp; 778).</blockquote>All these authorities&nbsp; uphold our&nbsp; conviction that&nbsp; the framers of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; had&nbsp; not in mind&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporations sole, nor intended to&nbsp; apply&nbsp; them the provisions of sections&nbsp; 1 and&nbsp; 5 of said Article XIII when they passed and&nbsp; approved&nbsp; the&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if&nbsp; it were so&nbsp; as&nbsp; We think it is,&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Roman&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Apostolic Administrator of Davao, Inc.,&nbsp; could not be deprived of the right to acquire by purchase or donation real properties for charitable, benevolent and educational purposes, nor of the right to register the same in its name with the Register of Deeds of&nbsp; Davao, an&nbsp; indispensable requisite prescribed&nbsp; by the Land Registration Act for lands covered by the Torrens system.<br><br>We leave&nbsp; as the&nbsp; last theme&nbsp; for&nbsp; discussion the&nbsp; much debated question above referred to&nbsp; as "the vested right saving clause" contained in section 1,&nbsp; Article XIII of the Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dissenting Justice hurls upon the personal opinion&nbsp; expressed on the&nbsp; matter by the writer&nbsp; of the decision the most pointed&nbsp; darts of his&nbsp; severe criticism. We think, however, that this strong dissent should have been&nbsp; spared,&nbsp; because&nbsp; as clearly&nbsp; indicated before,&nbsp; some members&nbsp; of this Court either&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; the theory of the writer or were&nbsp; not ready to take a definite stand&nbsp; on&nbsp; that particular point,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; being&nbsp; no majority&nbsp; opinion thereon there&nbsp; was no need&nbsp; of&nbsp; any dissension therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the&nbsp; criticism has been&nbsp; made the&nbsp; writer&nbsp; deems&nbsp; it necessary&nbsp; to say a few&nbsp; words&nbsp; of explanation.<br><br>The writer fully agrees with the dissenting&nbsp; Justice that ordinarily "a capacity to acquire (property) in futuro, is not in itself a vested or existing property right that the Constitution&nbsp; protects from impairment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a&nbsp; property right to be vested (or acquired) there must be a transition from the&nbsp; potential or&nbsp; contingent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; actual,&nbsp; and the proprietary interest&nbsp; must have&nbsp; attached&nbsp; to&nbsp; a thing;&nbsp; it must have become&nbsp; 'fixed and established'"&nbsp; (Balboa vs. Farrales,&nbsp; 51 Phil.&nbsp; 498).&nbsp; But the case at bar has&nbsp; to&nbsp; be considered as an&nbsp; exception to the rule&nbsp; because among the rights granted by&nbsp; section 159&nbsp; of the Corporation&nbsp; Law was the right to receive bequests&nbsp; or gifts of real properties for charitable,&nbsp; benevolent and educational&nbsp; purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this right to receive such bequests or gifts (which implies donations <i>in futuro</i>), is not a mere potentiality that could be&nbsp; impaired without&nbsp; any specific provision&nbsp; in the Constitution to&nbsp; that&nbsp; effect, especially when the&nbsp; impairment would disturbingly affect the propagation of the religious faith of the immense majority&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; people and the curtailment of the activities of their Church.&nbsp; That is why the writer gave as a basis of his contention what Professor Aruego said in&nbsp; his book "The Framing" of the Philippine&nbsp; Constitution" and the enlightening opinion of Mr. Justice Jose P.&nbsp; Laurel, another Delegate to the Constitutional&nbsp; Convention, in his concurring opinion in the case of Goldcreek Mining Company vs. Eulogio Rodriguez et al., 66 Phil.&nbsp; 259.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway the majority of the Court did not deem necessary to pass upon&nbsp; said "vested&nbsp; right saving clause" for the final determination of this&nbsp; case.<br><br><center>JUDGMENT</center><br>Wherefore, the Resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Land Registration&nbsp; Commission of September 21, 1954,&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; in view of the&nbsp; provisions of sections&nbsp; 1 and 5 of Article XIII of the Philippine&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendee (petitioner)&nbsp; is not qualified to acquire lands in the Philip- pines in the&nbsp; absence of proof that at least 60&nbsp; per&nbsp; centum of the capital, properties or assets of the Roman Catholic Apostolic Administrator of Davao, Inc., is actually owned or controlled by Filipino citizens, and&nbsp; denying the registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of sale in the absence of proof of compliance with such&nbsp; requisite,&nbsp; is hereby reversed.&nbsp; Consequently, the respondent&nbsp; Register&nbsp; of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; of the City of Davao is&nbsp; ordered to register the deed of sale executed by&nbsp; Mateo&nbsp; L.

The application for&nbsp; leave&nbsp; to mortgage&nbsp; or&nbsp; sell must&nbsp; be made&nbsp; by&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; duly verified by the&nbsp; bishop chief priest, or presiding elder, acting&nbsp; as corporation sole,&nbsp; and may be opposed by&nbsp; any member of&nbsp; the religious&nbsp; denomination, society,&nbsp; or church represented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; sole: <i>Provided, however</i>, That in&nbsp; cases when the&nbsp; rules, regulations and&nbsp; discipline of the religious denomination, society or church concerned represented by such corporation&nbsp; sole regulate the methods&nbsp; of acquiring,&nbsp; holding,&nbsp; selling, and mortgaging&nbsp; real estate and&nbsp; personal property,&nbsp; such rules, regulations,&nbsp; and discipline shall control and the&nbsp; intervention of&nbsp; the courts shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; necessary." (The Corporation&nbsp; Law. )</blockquote> And in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the above section, the temporalities of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Church or of a parish or&nbsp; diocese are&nbsp; allowed to be registered in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole for purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; administration and&nbsp; in&nbsp; trust for&nbsp; the&nbsp; real owners.<br><br>The&nbsp; mere fact that&nbsp; the Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; authorizes the&nbsp; corporation sole&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire&nbsp; and&nbsp; hold&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate or other&nbsp; property does not make the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; the real owner thereof,&nbsp; as his tenure of&nbsp; Church property is merely for the&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;&nbsp; stated&nbsp; above,&nbsp; the bishop is&nbsp; only&nbsp; the legal&nbsp;&nbsp; (technical)&nbsp; owner&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; trustee, the parish or diocese being the beneficial owner, or cestui que trust.<br><br>Having arrived at the&nbsp; conclusion that the property in question belongs actually either to the parish or the diocese of Davao, the next question that possess for solution is, In case of said property, whose&nbsp; nationality must be considered for the purpose of determining&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicability of the constitutional provision&nbsp; limiting ownership of land to Filipinos, that of the bishop or chief priest who registers as corporation sole,&nbsp; or&nbsp; that of the&nbsp; constituents&nbsp; of the parish or&nbsp; diocese who are the&nbsp; beneficial&nbsp; owners of the land?&nbsp; We believe that&nbsp; that of the latter must be considered, and not&nbsp; that&nbsp; of the priest clothed with the corporate fiction&nbsp; and denominated&nbsp; as the corporation sole. The&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; is&nbsp; a mere contrivance&nbsp; to enable&nbsp; a church to acquire,&nbsp; own and manage properties belonging to the church. It is only a means to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp; The constitutional provision could not have been&nbsp; meant to apply to the means through which and by which property may be owned or&nbsp; acquired, but to&nbsp; the&nbsp; ultimate owner of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the citizenship&nbsp; of&nbsp; the priest forming the corporation sole should be no impediment if the parish or diocese which&nbsp; owns the property&nbsp; is qualified to own and possess&nbsp; the property.<br><br>We can take judicial&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; a great majority of the constituents of&nbsp; the parish or&nbsp; diocese of Davao are Roman Catholics.&nbsp;&nbsp; The affidavit demanded&nbsp; is, therefore, a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; formality.<br><br>The dissenting&nbsp; opinion sustains the proposition that control, not actual ownership, is the factor that determines whether the constitutional prohibition against&nbsp; alien ownership of lands should or should not apply.&nbsp; We may assume the correctness of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proposition&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Holy&nbsp; See exercises&nbsp; control&nbsp; over&nbsp; Church&nbsp; properties&nbsp; everywhere, but the control cannot be real and actual but merely theoretical. In any case, the constitutional prohibition is limited by its terms&nbsp; to&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; and&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; And should the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; sole&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; its&nbsp; powers and&nbsp; authority in relation to the administration or disposal of&nbsp; the property contrary to the&nbsp; wishes of the&nbsp; constituents of the parish or the diocese, the act may&nbsp; always be questioned&nbsp; as&nbsp; ultra vires.<br><br>We agree, therefore, with the reversal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; order.<br><br><i>Montemayor</i> and <i>Reyes,&nbsp; A., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>REYES, J.&nbsp; B. L., J.,:<br><br>I&nbsp; regret not being&nbsp; able to assent to the opinion of Mr. Justice Felix.&nbsp; The decision of the Supreme Court in this case will be of far reaching results, for once the&nbsp; capacity of corporations sole to acquire&nbsp; public and private agricultural lands is admitted, there will be no limit to the areas they may&nbsp; hold until&nbsp; the Legislature&nbsp; implements&nbsp; section 3&nbsp; of Article XII of&nbsp; the Constitution, empowering&nbsp; it to set&nbsp; a limit to the size of&nbsp; private agricultural land&nbsp; that may be held; and even then it can only be done <i>without prejudice to rights acquired prior to the enactment of such law</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, even if a limitative law&nbsp; is&nbsp; adopted, it will&nbsp; not affect the&nbsp; landholdings acquired&nbsp; before the law become effective, no matter how vast the&nbsp; estate should be.<br><br>The&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp; restrictions&nbsp; to&nbsp; the acquisition of agricultural land are well&nbsp; known:<br><blockquote>"SECTION&nbsp; 1. All agricultural, timber, and mineral lands&nbsp; of thel public domain,&nbsp; waters, minerals,&nbsp; coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils,&nbsp; all forces&nbsp; of potential energy, and other natural resources&nbsp; of the Philippines belong&nbsp; to the State, and their disposition, exploitation. development, or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to&nbsp; corporations or associations at&nbsp; least sixty per centum of the capital of which&nbsp; is owned by such&nbsp; citizens,&nbsp; subject to any existing right,&nbsp; grant,&nbsp; lease,&nbsp; or concession&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of the inauguration of the Government established under this Constitution. Natural resources,&nbsp; with the exception of public agricultural&nbsp; land, shall&nbsp; not be alienated, and no license, concession, or lease for the exploitation,&nbsp; development, or&nbsp; utilization&nbsp; of any of&nbsp; the natural resources shall be granted for a&nbsp; period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for another twenty-five years, except as&nbsp; to water rights for&nbsp; irrigation,&nbsp; water supply&nbsp; fisheries,&nbsp; or&nbsp; industrial&nbsp; uses&nbsp; other than&nbsp; the development of water&nbsp; power, in which&nbsp; cases&nbsp; beneficial use may be&nbsp; the measure and the limit of the grant."&nbsp; (Article XII,&nbsp; Constitution of&nbsp; the Phil.)<br><br>"SEC. 5. Save in cases of hereditary succession, no private agricultural&nbsp; land&nbsp; shall be transferred or assigned except to&nbsp; individuals, corporations, or associations&nbsp; qualified to acquire or hold lands of the public domain in&nbsp; the Philippines."&nbsp; (Art. XII,&nbsp; Constitution of the Phil.)</blockquote>In requiring corporations&nbsp; or associations&nbsp; to have sixty per cent (60%) of their capital owned by Filipmo citizens, the&nbsp;&nbsp; constitution&nbsp; manifestly&nbsp; disregarded&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporate fiction,&nbsp; i.e., the juridical&nbsp; personality&nbsp; of such corporations or associations.&nbsp;&nbsp; It went behind the&nbsp; corporate entity&nbsp; and looked&nbsp; at the&nbsp; natural persons that composed it,&nbsp; and&nbsp; demanded that a clear majority&nbsp; in interest (60%)&nbsp; should be Filipino.&nbsp;&nbsp; To me this&nbsp; was done&nbsp; to ensure&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the control of its properties&nbsp; (not merely&nbsp; the beneficial ownership&nbsp; thereof)&nbsp; remained&nbsp; in&nbsp; Filipmo&nbsp; hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Aruego, Framing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Constitution,&nbsp; Vol. 2. pp.&nbsp; 604,&nbsp; 606.)<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; nationalization&nbsp; of the natural resources&nbsp; of the country , was intended (1) to insure their conservation for Filipino posterity; (2) to serve&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; instrument of national&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; helping prevent the extension into the country of foreign control through peaceful economic penetration;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) to prevent making&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines a source of international conflicts with&nbsp; the consequent danger to Its internal&nbsp; security&nbsp; and independence.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *'<br><br>"The&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; permitted aliens&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire an&nbsp; interest in&nbsp; the natural&nbsp; resources of the country&nbsp; and in private agricultural lands as component elements&nbsp; of corporations&nbsp; or&nbsp; associations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; maximum limit&nbsp; of interest&nbsp; that&nbsp; they could&nbsp; hold in&nbsp; a&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; or association&nbsp; would be&nbsp; only&nbsp; forty&nbsp; <i>per centum</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly in control of <i>the corporation or association would remain in Filipino&nbsp; hands</i>.<br><br>In&nbsp; its report&nbsp; the committee on nationalisation&nbsp; and preservation of lands and other natural resources recommended that the maximum limit&nbsp; of interest that aliens&nbsp; could&nbsp; hold in&nbsp; a corporation or&nbsp; association should be only twenty-five <i>per centum</i> of the capital.&nbsp; The purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; tlio&nbsp; committee&nbsp; was&nbsp; to enable <i>Filipino-controlled</i>&nbsp; cor- porations or&nbsp; associations, if necessary,&nbsp; to&nbsp; interest aliens to&nbsp; join their technical or managerial staff hy giving: them a part interest in the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; The&nbsp; sub-committee&nbsp; of&nbsp; seven embodied this&nbsp; recommendation in tile first draft of&nbsp; the Constitution; but in the revised article&nbsp; on General&nbsp; Provisions,&nbsp; it raised the&nbsp; amount to forty <i>per centum.</i>"&nbsp; (emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>It was in recognition of&nbsp; this basic rule that we held in Register of Deeds vs. Ung Siu&nbsp; Si&nbsp; Temple,&nbsp; 51 Off. Gaz. p. 2866, that if the&nbsp; association&nbsp; had no capital,&nbsp; its <i>controlling&nbsp; membership</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp; composed&nbsp; of Filipinos. Because <i>ownership divorced&nbsp; from&nbsp; control&nbsp; is not true ownership</i>.<br><br>From these premises it&nbsp; can be deduced that the preliminary question to&nbsp; be decided&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court is&nbsp; the following:&nbsp; what&nbsp; and&nbsp; who&nbsp; exercises&nbsp; the power of&nbsp; control in the corporation sole known&nbsp; as&nbsp; "The Roman&nbsp; Catholic Apostolic Administrator&nbsp; of Davao,&nbsp; Inc."?<br><br>Under section&nbsp; 155 of the Corporation Law, the bishop, or other religious&nbsp; head, as corporation sole, is&nbsp; "charged with the administration of the temporalities of his church." It becomes then pertinent to inquire: if he is only an administrator, for whom does he administer?&nbsp;&nbsp; And who can alter or overrule his&nbsp; acts?<br><br>If his acts as administrator can not be overridden, or altered, except by himself, then obviously&nbsp; the control of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; and&nbsp; its temporalities is&nbsp;&nbsp; in the bishop himself, and he must be&nbsp; a Filipino citizen.&nbsp; If,&nbsp; on the other hand, the final&nbsp; say as to management, exploitation, encumbrance or disposition of the temporalities resides in another individual or&nbsp; body&nbsp; of&nbsp; individuals, then the control resides there.&nbsp; To possess&nbsp; constitutional capacity&nbsp; to acquire&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; land or&nbsp; other natural&nbsp; resources, that body making the&nbsp; final decision&nbsp; for&nbsp; the corporation must have at least 60 per cent Filipino&nbsp; membership.<br><br>By this test, the body of members professing the Catholic faith&nbsp; in the&nbsp; diocese&nbsp; of Davao&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; constitute the controlling membership.&nbsp; For under the rules of the Roman Catholic Church the faithful&nbsp; can not control the&nbsp; acts of the&nbsp; Ordinary; they&nbsp; can not override&nbsp; his&nbsp; decision, just as they do not elect or remove him.&nbsp; Only his hierarchical superiors can do that; the control is from above, not from below.&nbsp; Hence, the fact that 90 per cent (or even&nbsp; 100 per cent) of the faithful in the&nbsp; diocese should&nbsp; be composed of Filipino citizens is totally devoid of significance from the standpoint of the&nbsp; constitutional restrictions in question (see Codex, Canons 1518 and 1530, paragraph 1,&nbsp; No. 3).<br><br>Moreover, I do&nbsp; not&nbsp; think that&nbsp; the body of Catholic faithful in the Davao diocese can be taken, for the&nbsp; purpose here under consideration, as the Church represented by the Ordinary of Davao.&nbsp;&nbsp; That body does not&nbsp; constitute an entity&nbsp; or unit separate and apart&nbsp; from the rest of&nbsp; the faithful&nbsp; throughout&nbsp; the&nbsp; world that compose the Roman Catholic&nbsp; Church&nbsp; that&nbsp; has always claimed&nbsp; ecumenical (universal) character.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no Catholic&nbsp; Church&nbsp; of Davao district and independent&nbsp; of the Catholic&nbsp; Church of Manila, Lipa or Rome.&nbsp; All those professing Catholic . faith are members of only one single church or religious group.&nbsp; Thus the&nbsp; Iglesia Filipina&nbsp; Independiente&nbsp; is&nbsp; not part of the Catholic&nbsp; Church, precisely&nbsp; because of its independence.<br><br>If,&nbsp; then, the Catholic Church of Davao&nbsp; is&nbsp; part and parcel&nbsp; of the universal&nbsp; Catholic Church,&nbsp; it can not be considered separate and apart from it&nbsp; in this case.&nbsp; And if considered&nbsp; with it, obviously the condition of&nbsp; 60&nbsp; per cent Filipino&nbsp; membership&nbsp; is not&nbsp; satisfied&nbsp; when&nbsp; all&nbsp; the Catholic&nbsp; faithful in the world are&nbsp; taken&nbsp; into account.<br><br>The&nbsp; unity and&nbsp; singleness&nbsp; of the various&nbsp; dioceses of the church appears&nbsp; expressly recognized in&nbsp; section 163 of the Corporation Law, which&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that the corporation&nbsp; (sole)&nbsp; shall&nbsp; hold the temporalities, not&nbsp; for&nbsp; the diocese; but for the&nbsp; benefit "of&nbsp; the <i>church</i>&nbsp; of which&nbsp; the diocese—is an&nbsp; <i>organized or constituent part.</i>"'<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 163.&nbsp; The right to administer all temporalities and all prop- erty held or owned by&nbsp; a religious order or society, or by the diocese, synod, or district organization of any&nbsp; religious denomination or church shall, on its incorporation,&nbsp; pass to the corporation and shall be held in trust for&nbsp; the use, purpose, behoof, and benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the religious society or order so incorporated or of the church of which the diocese,&nbsp; synod, or district organization&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; organized and constituent part."</blockquote>So that, even from the standpoint of beneficial owner- ship, the diocese of Davao can not be viewed as a&nbsp; group legally isolated from the Catholic Church&nbsp; as&nbsp; a whole.<br><br>Nor does court control over the acts of the corporation sole constitute a guarantee of Filipino&nbsp; control.that&nbsp; would satisfy&nbsp; the purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitution,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; under section 159&nbsp; (last&nbsp; proviso)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Corporation law,&nbsp; the court intervention is <i>dispensed with</i> where the rules&nbsp; and discipline&nbsp; of the church already&nbsp; regulate the acquisition and disposition of real estate&nbsp; and&nbsp; personal property.<br><blockquote>"<i>Provided however</i>, That&nbsp; in cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; the rules,&nbsp; regulations and discipline of the religious&nbsp; denomination, society,&nbsp; or church&nbsp; concerned represented by such corporation sole&nbsp; regulate the methods of acquiring, holding, selling, and mortgaging&nbsp; real estate&nbsp; and personal&nbsp; property,&nbsp; such&nbsp; rules,, regulations,&nbsp; and&nbsp; discipline shall control and <i>the intervention of the courts shall not be weessary.</i>" (emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>It&nbsp; is argued that a distinction' must&nbsp; be drawn between the lands to&nbsp; be devoted to purely religious&nbsp; purposes and the lands&nbsp; held in&nbsp; ordinary ownership.&nbsp; But where in the Constitution&nbsp; is&nbsp; such&nbsp; a&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; drawn?&nbsp; Under&nbsp; it, capacity to acquire agricultural&nbsp; land for&nbsp; the erection of a church is capacity to acquire agricultural land for any lawful purpose, whether it be for convents&nbsp; or schools&nbsp; or seminaries or haciendas&nbsp; for their support or land&nbsp; to&nbsp; be held&nbsp; solely&nbsp; for&nbsp; enjoyment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; revenue.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; the capacity to acquire is granted, the way is paved&nbsp; for the revitalization&nbsp; of religious&nbsp; landholdings&nbsp; that proved&nbsp; so troublesome in&nbsp; our past.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; can not&nbsp; conceive&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Constitution intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; revive them.<br><br>It ia&nbsp; also&nbsp; argued&nbsp; that, before&nbsp; the Constitution was adopted, the&nbsp; corporations&nbsp; sole&nbsp; had, by&nbsp; express statute, the right to acquire agricultural land; and that the Constitution was&nbsp; not&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; destroy&nbsp; such&nbsp; "acquired property rights."&nbsp;&nbsp; If followed, the argument destroys the constitutional&nbsp; restrictions.&nbsp; All aliens had&nbsp; a capacity to acquire agricultural land before the Constitution came into effect,&nbsp; because no prohibition&nbsp; existed&nbsp; previously.&nbsp; Must their right to acquire and&nbsp; hold&nbsp; agricultural land be conceded&nbsp; in spite of the Constitution?<br><br>That the law should have <i>expressly</i> conferred capacity to acquire&nbsp; land upon corporations&nbsp; sole&nbsp; was&nbsp; not due&nbsp; to any special predilection for them; it&nbsp; was exclusively due to the&nbsp; principle that corporation,&nbsp; as&nbsp; artificial entities, have no inherent&nbsp; rights,&nbsp; but only those&nbsp; granted by the sovereign.&nbsp; Unless&nbsp; conferred, the corporate right&nbsp; would not exist.<br><br>Furthermore, a&nbsp; capacity to acquire <i>in futuro</i>, is not&nbsp; in itself a vested or existing&nbsp; property right that the Constitution protects from impairment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a property&nbsp; right to be vested&nbsp; (or acquired) there must be a transition from the&nbsp; <i>potential</i>,&nbsp; or contingent, to the <i>actual</i>,&nbsp; and the proprietary interest must have attached to a thing; it&nbsp; must have become "fixed or established" (Balboa vs.&nbsp; Farrales, 51 Phil. 498).&nbsp;&nbsp; If mere potentialities&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; impaired, then the law&nbsp; would&nbsp; become unchangeable,&nbsp; for&nbsp; every variation in&nbsp; it will reduce some one's legal ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; do or not to do.&nbsp; Already in Benguet Consolidated vs. Pineda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. 1961, we have ruled that no one has a vested right in statutory&nbsp; privileges or exemptions.&nbsp; And in his concurring opinion in Gold Creek Mining Corp. vs. Rodriguez, 66 Phil.&nbsp; 259&nbsp; (cited&nbsp; by Justice Felix), Mr. Justice Laurel squarely declared that "contingency or expectation is&nbsp; neither property nor property right."&nbsp; (cas. cit., p. 269.)<br><br>Finally, the&nbsp; point is also made that the&nbsp; Ordinary,&nbsp; as religious corporation sole,&nbsp; has no&nbsp; citizenship, and is not an alien.&nbsp; The answer is&nbsp; that&nbsp; under the Constitution&nbsp; of the Republic, it is not enough that the acquirer of agricultural land be not an alien; he must be&nbsp; a B'ilipino&nbsp; or controlled&nbsp; by&nbsp; Filipinos.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; I am constrained&nbsp; to&nbsp; conclude:<br><blockquote>(1) That&nbsp; the capacity of&nbsp; religious&nbsp;&nbsp; corporations&nbsp; sole to&nbsp; acquire agricultural&nbsp; land&nbsp; depends&nbsp; upon&nbsp; 60 per cent Filipino membership of the group or body exercising control of the&nbsp; corporation; <br>(2) That if control of any such corporation&nbsp; should be vested&nbsp; in a&nbsp; single&nbsp; person, then such&nbsp; person must be a Filipino&nbsp; citizen; <br>(3) That in&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence on these&nbsp; points, the&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from,&nbsp; denying registration&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the conveyance, should&nbsp; be affirmed.</blockquote><i>Concepcion, J.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">* </sup>98 Phil., 711.</div>
