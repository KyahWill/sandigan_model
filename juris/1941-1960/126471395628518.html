				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action to recover at least P3,000 as compensation for the death of  Gervasio  D. Gonzales who on  27 June 1953 was run  over by  a  bus known as  "Dapitan Transit  No.  11"  at  Irasan,  Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte, and died, as a result, it is alleged, of reckless, negligent and careless driving of its  chauffeur; P10,000 for moral damages; P2,000 for exemplary damages; and P2,000 for  attorney's  fees, and costs.  The  first  five  plaintiffs are the sister and brothers  of the deceased and the last is his  minor  son and  the third  and  second  defendants are the chauffeur  and the owner of the bus, respectively, attached to the line operated by the first defendant.  The plaintiffs pray that plaintiff Francisco Gonzales be  appointed guardian ad litem for the minor son of the deceased. This petition for appointment of a guardian  ad<em> litem</em> was not acted upon.</p>
<p>After summons  the defendants appeared and moved for the dismissal  of the complaint on the ground  that  the plaintiffs, the first five being the  sister  and brothers  of the deceased, described as his heirs in  the caption of the complaint, and the last who is a minor child of the deceased, not being represented by a guardian, have no legal capacity to sue.   The defendants contend that under the laws  of descent collateral relatives are excluded when the decedent is survived by a descendant.  Acting upon  the  motion to dismiss,  the Court held that the first five plaintiffs who are the sister and brothers of the deceased  have no right of action against the defendants and that the last, a minor son  of the deceased, should be duly  represented by his mother.  For that reason the Court dismissed the complaint unless  the complaint be  amended  within 15 days from date of the entry of the order.  In their motion for reconsideration  the  first five plaintiffs  claim  that under article 2217 of the  new Civil Code they are entitled to moral damages, and that the mother of  the minor son of  the deceased could not legally and morally represent the minor, because she  and the deceased had  been living separately for 15 years due to her bad character and faithlessness and had never been reconciled.  The motion for reconsideration was denied.   Hence this  appeal.</p>
<p>The ground stated in the motion to dismiss is lack of capacity to sue.  This is not the proper and legal ground for a motion to dismiss in this  case! because it  does not appear  on the face of  the  complaint that the first  five plaintiffs are suffering from any disability.  The defendants most  likely rely on the ground that the complaint states no cause of action insofar  as the first  five plaintiffs are concerned, because they contend that under the laws  of  descent collateral  relatives are excluded  from inheriting  if and when the decedent is survived by a descendant who  is the only one entitled to  sue for  damages arising out of or from the death of the decedent caused by a  wrongful or tortious act of the defendants.  Upon the ground that  the complaint states no cause  of  action the motion to dismiss is well taken.   Article 2217 and article 2206  (3)  of the new  Civil Code do not grant the sister and brothers of the deceased a  right  to  recover moral damages.   But the trial Court failed to act upon the petition for  the  appointment of  a guardian <em>ad litem</em> prayed for in the plaintiffs'  complaint.  It should have acted on the petition, because Charlitos  Gonzales, a  minor  son of the deceased, is entitled to bring the action.</p>
<p>The order appealed from  is affirmed  insofar as  it dismisses the complaint filed by the  sister and brothers of the deceased  and set aside insofar as it dismisses the complaint filed by the minor son  of the deceased and  the  case remanded to the court below with  instructions to proceed according to law and to appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor, without costs.</p>
