				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; March 5, 1957, petitioner-appellee, Maria Natividad vda. de Tan,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila a verified petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus </span>seeking an order to&nbsp; compel&nbsp; the respondent-appellant&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Back&nbsp; Pay Commission:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; to declare deceased Lt.&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Chiat Bee alias&nbsp;&nbsp; Tan Lian&nbsp; Lay, a&nbsp;&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp; national,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to backpay rights, privileges1, and prerogatives under Republic&nbsp; Act No. 304, as amended by Republic Act No. 897; and (2)&nbsp; to give due course to the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner, as&nbsp; the widow of the&nbsp; said veterans,&nbsp; by issuing to&nbsp; her the corresponding backpay&nbsp; certificate of indebtedness.<br><br>Respondent Commission filed its&nbsp; answer&nbsp; in&nbsp; due time asserting&nbsp; certain&nbsp; special&nbsp; and&nbsp; affirmative defenses,&nbsp;&nbsp; on the basis&nbsp; of which,&nbsp; the Commission unsuccessfully&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; dismiss the petition.<br><br>The parties&nbsp; then&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts herein-below reproduced:<br><blockquote>"Come&nbsp; now the petitioner&nbsp; and respondent in the&nbsp; above-entitled case through their respective counsel, and&nbsp; to this Honorable Court respectfully agree and&nbsp; stipulate that the following facts are true:<br><ol><li>That&nbsp; the petitioner is of legal&nbsp;

Manila, July 31, 1957."<br></li></ol></blockquote>Based on the foregoing, the lower court rendered judgment the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; portion of which, reads:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, the petition&nbsp; is granted,&nbsp; ordering respondent&nbsp; Commission to give due&nbsp; course to the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; herein petitioner to the backpay to which her deceased husband was entitled&nbsp; as&nbsp; member of a duly recognized guerrilla&nbsp; organization."<br></blockquote>Against&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision, the respondent&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; this appeal averring once more, in&nbsp; its&nbsp; assignment of&nbsp; errors, the special and affirmative&nbsp; defenses&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner failed to&nbsp; exhaust available&nbsp; administrative remedies; that the suit is, in&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; an&nbsp; action to&nbsp; enforce a money claim against the government without its&nbsp; consent;&nbsp; that mandamus will&nbsp; not lie&nbsp; to compel the exercise of a&nbsp; discretionary function; and that Republic Act&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 304&nbsp; and 897&nbsp; already referred to were never&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; benefit aliens.<br><br>We find no&nbsp; merit in&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; As to the claim that mandamus is not the proper&nbsp; remedy to correct the exercise&nbsp; of discretion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Commission, it may&nbsp; well&nbsp; be remembered that its&nbsp; discretion is limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; the facts of the case,&nbsp; i.e.,&nbsp; in merely evaluating the evidence whether or not&nbsp; claimant is a member of&nbsp; a guerrilla force duly recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States Army.,&nbsp; Nowhere&nbsp; in the law is the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Commission given the power to adjudicate&nbsp; or determine rights after&nbsp; such facts are established.&nbsp; Having been satisfied that deceased Tan Chiat Bee&nbsp; was an officer of&nbsp; a duly recognized&nbsp; guerrilla outfit, certified to by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, having served under the United States-Chinese Volunteers in the Philippines, a guerrilla unit recognized&nbsp; by the&nbsp; United States Army&nbsp; and forming&nbsp; part of the Philippine Army, it becomes the <i>ministerial duty </i>of the respondent to give due&nbsp; course to his&nbsp; widow's application.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See&nbsp; sections 1 and&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; Republic Act 897.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Note&nbsp; that the Chief of the Finance Service, Camp&nbsp; Murphy, has accepted the backpay due&nbsp; the petitioner's husband&nbsp; and the same was passed in audit by the representatives of the Auditor General.<br><br>It is insisted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Commission that aliens are&nbsp; not included within the purview of the law.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; The&nbsp; law as contained&nbsp; in Republic Act Nos. 304&nbsp; and 897 is explicit enough, and it extends its benefits to members&nbsp; of "guerrilla forces&nbsp; duly recognized by the Army of the&nbsp; United States." From the&nbsp; plain and clear language thereof, we fail to see any indication that its operation&nbsp; should be limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines only, for all that is&nbsp; required is that&nbsp; the guerrilla unit&nbsp; be&nbsp; duly&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Army&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; We are in&nbsp; full accord&nbsp; with&nbsp; Opinion&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 213, series of 1956,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Secretary of Justice, which reads:<br><blockquote>"Section 1 of the cited Act (Republic Act No. 304, as amended by Republic Act No. 897), otherwise known as the Back Pay Law, recognizes the rights to the backpay of members of <i>"guerrilla forces duly recognized by the Army of the&nbsp; United States,</i> among others. A perusal of its provisions reveals nothing which may be construed to mean that only Filipino citizens are entitled to back pay thereunder. On the contrary, the statute&nbsp; expressly includes within its coverage&nbsp; "persons under contract with the Government&nbsp; of the Commonwealth", which clause was construed by this&nbsp; office to refer to "experts&nbsp; and technical personnel employed&nbsp; for highly specialized service" by the government&nbsp; (Opinion&nbsp; No. 137, s. 1953), a majority of whom were non-citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in&nbsp; Opinion&nbsp; No. 30,&nbsp; s.&nbsp; 1949, this office ruled that a civil service employee of the U.S.&nbsp; Coast and&nbsp; Geodetic Survey rendering service to the Philippine Government when war broke out on December 8, 1941, was entitled to back pay.<br><br>As&nbsp; regards guerrillas, it seems clear that&nbsp; all the&nbsp; law requires is that they be "duly recognized by the&nbsp; Army&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United States." Section 1 of the Back Pay Law, it is also noted,&nbsp; enumerates those who are not entitled to its benefits; recognized guerrillas who were not Filipino citizens are not among those&nbsp; expressly mentioned.&nbsp; The maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius,</i> I think, finds application here.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; Executive Order No. 21, dated October 28, 1944, expressly declared that,&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 22 (a) and&nbsp; 27 of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 1 to the contrary&nbsp; notwithstanding,&nbsp; "all persons of <i>any nationality or citizenship</i>, who&nbsp; are actively serving in recognized military&nbsp; forces in the Philippines, are thereby considered to be on active service in the Philippine&nbsp; Army."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent's&nbsp; main argument that it could not have been&nbsp; the intention&nbsp; of&nbsp; Congress to extend its benefit to&nbsp; aliens, as the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; the law was&nbsp; "precisely to help&nbsp; rehabilitate members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Armed&nbsp; Forces of the Philippines and recognized&nbsp; guerrillas&nbsp; by giving them the right to acquire public lands and public&nbsp; property&nbsp; by using the back pay certificate", and "it&nbsp; is&nbsp; fundamental&nbsp; under the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; that&nbsp; aliens except&nbsp; American&nbsp; citizens cannot&nbsp; acquire&nbsp; public lands or exploit our natural resources".&nbsp; Respondent Commission&nbsp; fails to&nbsp; realize&nbsp; that this&nbsp; is&nbsp; just one of the&nbsp; various uses of&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificate; and&nbsp; that it&nbsp; may&nbsp; also&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp; utilized&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment of obligations&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Government or to any of its branches or&nbsp; instrumentalities, i.e., taxes,&nbsp; government&nbsp; hospital&nbsp; bills, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Sec. 2,&nbsp; Rep.&nbsp; Act No. 897).<br><br>As further&nbsp; observed by the lower court:<br><blockquote>"It is one thing to be entitled to backpay and to receive acknowledgment therefor, and another thing to receive backpay certificates in accordance with the resolutions of the Commission and&nbsp; to make use&nbsp; of the same."<br></blockquote>It was,&nbsp; therefore, unreasonable&nbsp; if not arbitrary&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part of respondent&nbsp; Commission to deny petitioner's claim on this basis.<br><br>It is further&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; that the petitioner should have first exhausted her administrative remedies&nbsp; by&nbsp; appealing&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; her failure&nbsp; to do&nbsp; so&nbsp; is a bar&nbsp; to her action in&nbsp; court&nbsp; (Montes&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; The&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Board of Appeals, 101 Phil., 490;&nbsp; 54&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp;&nbsp; [7] 2174.&nbsp; The respondent&nbsp; Commission is&nbsp; in&nbsp; estoppel&nbsp; to invoke&nbsp; this rule, considering that in its resolution (Annex F of the Stipulation&nbsp; of Facts)&nbsp; reiterating its&nbsp; obstinate refusal to abide by the&nbsp; opinion of the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Justice,&nbsp; who is the legal&nbsp; adviser of the&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Department, the Commission declared that—<br><blockquote>"The opinions promulgated by the Secretary of Justice are advisory in nature, which&nbsp; may either be accepted&nbsp; or ignored by&nbsp; the&nbsp; office seeking the opinion,&nbsp; and any&nbsp; aggrieved&nbsp; party&nbsp; has the court for recourse,"&nbsp; (Annex F)<br></blockquote>thereby&nbsp; leading the&nbsp; petitioner to&nbsp; conclude that&nbsp; only a final judicial&nbsp; ruling in&nbsp; her favor would&nbsp; be accepted by the Commission.<br><br>Neither is&nbsp; there substance in&nbsp; the contention that the petition is, in effect,&nbsp; a suit against the government without its&nbsp; consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The relief prayed for is simply "the recognition of&nbsp; the rights of the&nbsp; petitioner-appellee" under the provisions of sections 1 and 2&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 897, and consists&nbsp; in&nbsp; "directing&nbsp; an&nbsp; agency of the government to perform an act * * * it is bound to perform."&nbsp;&nbsp; Republic Act Nos. 304 and&nbsp; 897&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; embody state&nbsp; consent to&nbsp; an action&nbsp; against the officers entrusted with the implementation&nbsp; of said Acts&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of unjustified&nbsp; refusal to recognize the rights of proper&nbsp; applicants.<br><br>The decision appealed from&nbsp; should be,&nbsp; and&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; is, affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A. Bautista&nbsp; Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
