				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On August  22, 1950, Efren  Magno  went to  the 3-story house  of  Antonio  Penaloza,  his stepbrother,  located on Rodriguez Lanuza street, Manila, to repair a "media agua" said to be in a leaking condition.  The "media agua" was just below the window of the third  story.  Standing on said  "media agua",  Magno  received  from his  son  thru that window a 3' X 6' galvanized iron sheet to cover the leaking portion, turned around and in doing so  the lower end of the iron sheet  came  into contact with  the electric wire of the Manila Electric Company  (later referred to as the Company) strung parallel  to the edge of the "media agua"  and  21/2 feet from  it, causing his  death by electrocution.   His widow and children filed  suit  to recover damages  from  the  company.   After  hearing,  the  trial court rendered  judgment in their favorâ€”P10,000 as compensatory damages; P784  as actual damages; P2,000 as moral and exemplary  damages;  and P3,000 as attorney's fees, with costs.  On appeal to the  Court  of  Appeals, tha latter affirmed  the  judgment with slight  modification  by reducing the attorney's  fees from P3,000  to  P1,000 with costs.   The  electric  company has appealed said decision to us.</p>
<p>The  findings  of  fact made  by the Court  of Appeals which are conclusive are stated  in the following portions of its decision  which  we  reproduce below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  electric  wire  in question  was  an exposed, uninsulated primary wire  stretched  between poles  on the street and carrying a. charge of  3,600  volts.  It  was  installed there   some  two  years before Penaloza's  house was constructed.  The record shows that during the construction  of said  house  a similar incident took place, although fortunately with much less tragic consequences.  A piece of wood  which a carpenter was holding happened  to  come in contact with  the  same  wire, producing some sparks.  The owner of the house  forthwith  complained to defendant  about the danger which the wire presented,  and as' a result defendant moved one end of the wire farther from the house by means of a brace, but left the  other end where it was.                         '</p>
  <p>"At any rate,  as revealed  by  the  ocular  inspection  of the premises ordered by the trial court, the distance from the electric wire to  the edge  of the 'media agua' on  which  the deceased was making repairs was only 30 inches or  2%  feet. Regulations of the City  of  Manila required that 'all wires  be  kept three feet from the building.'  Appellant contends that in  applying said regulations to the case at bar the reckoning should  not be  from  the edge of the  'media  agua'  but from  the  side of the  house and that, thus measured, the distance was almost 7 feet, or more than the minimum prescribed.   This contention is manifestly groundless,  for not only  is a 'media agua'  an integral  part of the  building to which it is attached but to exclude it in measuring  the distance would defeat the purpose of the regulation.  Appellant  points out, nevertheless, that even assuming that the distance, within the meaning oft the city regulations, should be measured from the edge of the "media  agua', the fact that In the case of the  house involved herein such distance was actually less than 3 feet Was  due to the fault of the owner of said house, because the city authorities gave him  a  permit to construct  a  'media  agua' only  one  meter  or 39%  inches  wide, but  instead  he built one having a width of 65%  inches, 17% inches more  than the width permitted by the authorities, thereby reducing the distance to the electric wire to less than the prescribed minimum of 3  feet.</p>
  <p>"It is a fact that the  owner of the house exceeded the  limit fixed in the  permit  given  to  him  by  the  city authorities for the construction of the 'media agua', and that if he .had not done so appellants  wire would  have  been 11%  (inches)  more than file required distance of three feet from the edge of the 'media agua'. It is also  a fact, however, that after  the 'media agua' was constructed the owner was given a final permit of occupancy of the house.  * * *</p>
  <p>"* * * The wire was an exposed,  high  tension wire carrying a load  of  3,600 volts.  There was,  according to  appellant, no insulation that could have rendered it safe, first, because there  is no insulation  material in  commercial use for such kind of wire; and secondly, because the only insulation material that may be effective is still  in  the  experimental  stage  of  development  and, anyway, its costs would  be prohibitive.   *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  theory followed by the  appellate court in finding for the  plaintiff is  that although the owner of  the house in constructing the "media  agua"  in question  exceeded  the limits  fixed  in the permit, still, after making that "media agua",  its construction though illegal, was finally approved because he was given a final permit to occupy the house; that it was  the company that was at fault  and was guilty of negligence  because although the electric wire in  question had been  installed  long before the  construction  of the house and in accordance with  the  ordinance fixing  a minimum of 3 feet, mere compliance with the regulations does ,not  satisfy  the  requirement of  due  diligence nor avoid  the  need for adopting  such other  precautionary measures as may  be warranted;  that negligence cannot be determined by a simple matter of inches; that all that the city did was to prescribe certain minimum conditions and that just because the ordinance required that primary electric wires should be not less  than 3 feet  from  any house, the obligation of due  diligence is not fulfilled by placing such wires at a distance of 3  feet and  one inch, regardless of other factors.  The appellate court, however, refrained from stating or suggesting what  other  precautionary measures could and should have been adopted.</p>
<p>After a careful study and discussion of the case and the circumstances surrounding the  same, we are  inclined to agree to the contention of petitioner  Company that the death of  Magno was primarily caused by his own  negligence  and in some  measure by the too close proximity of the "media agua" or rather its edge to the electric wire of the company by reason  of  the violation of the original permit  given by the city and the subsequent approval of said illegal construction of the "media  agua".  We fail to see how the Company could be held guilty of negligence or as lacking in due diligence.  Although  the city ordinance called for a distance of 3 feet of its wires  from any building, there was actually a distance of 7 feet and 2% inches of the wires from the side of the house of  Penaloza. Even considering said regulation  distance  of  3 feet as referring not to the side of a building,  but to any projecting part thereof, such as a "media agua" had the house owner followed the terms of the permit given him by the city  for the construction  of  his  "media agua", namely, one meter or  39 3/8  inches  wide,  the.  distance  from  the wires to the edge of  said "media agua" would have been 3 feet and  11 3/8 inches. In  fixing said one meter width for the "media  agua"  the  city  authorities must have wanted to preserve the distance of  at least 3 feet between the wires and any portion of a building.   Unfortunately, however,  the  house owner disregarding the permit,  exceeded the one meter fixed by the same by 17% inches and leaving only a distance of 24 feet  between the "Media agua" as illegally constructed and the electric wires.  And added to this violation of the permit by the house owner, was its approval by the city through  its agent,  possibly an  inspector.   Surely we cannot  lay these  serious violations of a city ordinance and permit at the door of the Company, guiltless of breach of  any ordinance or regulation.  The Company cannot be expected  to  be always on the lookout for any illegal construction which reduces the distance between its wires and said construction,  and after finding that said distance of  3 feet had been  reduced, to change the stringing  or installation of its wires so as to preserve said distance.  It would be  much easier for the City, or rather it is its duty,  to be ever on the alert and to  see to it that.its ordinances  are  strictly  followed by house owners and to  condemn  or disapprove all illegal constructions.   Of course, in  the  present case, the viola- tion of the permit for the construction of the "media agua" was not the direct cause of  the accident.  It merely contributed  to it.   Had  said "media agua" been only one meter wide  as allowed by the permit, Magno standing on it, would instinctively have stayed closer to or hugged the side of the house  in order  to keep a safe margin between the edge  of the "media  agua" and the yawning , 2-story distance or height from the ground, and  possibly if not probably avoided the fatal  contact between  the lower end  of  the iron  sheet and the wires.</p>
<p>We realize that the presence of the wires in  question quite close to  the  house  or its "media  agua" was always a source of danger  considering  their high  voltage  and uninsulated  as they were, but the claim of the company and the reasons given by it for not insulating said wires were  unrefuted as we  gather from the findings of  the Court of  Appeals, and  so  we  have to  accept them  as satisfactory.  Consequently, we may not  hold  said com- pany  as guilty of  negligence or wanting  in  due diligence in failing to insulate said wires.  As to their proximity to the house it  is  to be supposed that that distance of 3 feet was  considered sufficiently safe by  the technical men of  the  city such as its electrician or engineer.  Of course,  a  greater distance of  say 6 feet or 12 feet would have  increased  the margin  of safety but  other factors had  to  be considered such as that the wires could not be strung or the  posts supporting  them  could not be located  too  far  toward  the middle of the street.  Thus, the real cause of the accident  or  death  was the reckless or negligent act of Magno himself.  When he was called by his stepbrother to repair the "meclia agua" just below the third  story window, it is  to  be presumed that due to his  age  and experience  he was  qualified to do  so. Perhaps he  was a  tinsmith  or carpenter  and  had had training and experience for the job.  So, he could  not have been entirely a  stranger to electric wires and the danger lurking in them.  But unfortunately,  in  the instant care, his training and  experience  failed  him, and forgetting where he  was standing,  holding the 6-feet iron sheet with both hands and  at arms length, evidently without looking, and throwing all prudence and discretion to the winds, he turned around swinging his arms  with the motion of his body, thereby causing his own electrocution.</p>
<p>In  support of its  theory and holding  that  defendant-appellant  was liable  for damages the Court  of  Appeals cites  the  case of Astudillo  vs. Manila  Electric Co., 55 Phil., 427.  We  do not think the case is exactly applicable. There, the  premises  involved was that  elevated portion or top of  the walls of Intramuros, Manila, just above the Sta.  Lucia Gate.  In the words of the Court, it was "a public place where persons come to stroll, to  rest and to enjoy  themselves".   The  electric  company  was clearly negligent  in placing its wires so near the place that without much difficulty or exertion, a person by stretching his hand  out could touch them.  A boy named Astudillo, placing  one  foot on a projection,, reached out and actually grasped the  electric  wire and  was  electrocuted.   The person electrocuted in said case was a boy who was in no position to realize the danger.  In the present case, however,  the  wires were well high  over the  street where there was  no possible danger to pedestrians.  The  only possible danger was to persons standing  on the "media agua", but a "media agua" can hardly be  considered a public place  where persons usually gather.  Moreover, a person standing  on the  ''media  agua" could  not have reached the wires with his hands alone.  It was necessary , as was done  by  Magno to hold something  long enough to reach the wire.  Furthermore, Magno was not a boy or a person  immature but the  father  of  a  family,  supposedly a tinsmith trained and  experienced in the repair of galvanized iron roofs and "media agua".  Moreover, in that very case of Astudillo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Electric Co., supra, the court  said that although it  is a well-established  rule .that the liability of electric  companies for damages  or personal injuries  is governed  by the  rules of negligence, nevertheless such companies are  not insurers of the safety of the public.</p>
<p>But even assuming for  a moment that under the facts of the present case the defendant electric  company could be considered negligent in installing its electric wires  so close to the house and "media agua" in question, and  in failing to properly insulate those wires (although according to the unrefuted  claim of said company it  was impossible to make the insulation of that kind of  wire), nevertheless to hold the defendant liable in  damages for the death  of Magno,  such Supposed  negligence of the company must have been the  proximate  and  principal cause of the1 accident, because  if  the  act of Magno  in turning around and swinging the  galvanized iron sheet with his hands was the proximate and principal  cause  of the electrocution, then his heirs may not  recover.  Such was the holding of this Court in the  case of Taylor vs. Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, 16 Phil., 8. In that case the electric company was found negligent  in leaving scattered  on its premises fulminating caps which Taylor, a  15-year old boy found and carried home.  In the course of experimenting with said  fulminating caps, he opened one of them, held it  out with his hands while another boy applied a lighted match to it, causing it to explode and injure one  of  his eyes eventually causing blindness in said eye.   Said this 'tribunal  in denying recovery for the  injury:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * *, so that while it  may be true that these injuries would not have been incurred but  for the negligent act of the defendant in leaving the caps exposed  on its premises, nevertheless plaintiff's own act was the proximate and  principal cause of the accident which  inflicted the injury."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To us it is clear that the  principal and proximate cause of  the electrocution was not  the  electric wire, evidently a remote cause, but rather the reckless and negligent act of  Magno in turning  around and swinging the galvanized iron  sheet without taking any precaution, such as  looking back toward the street and at the wire to avoid its contacting said iron sheet,  considering the lattery length of 6 feet.  For a better understanding of the rule on remote and  proximate  cause with respect to  injuries, we find the following citation helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A prior and  remote' cause cannot  be made  the basis  of  an action if  such remote cause did nothing more than furnish the condition or give rise to the  occasion by  which  the injury was made possible,  if  there  intervened  between such prior or remote cause and the injury a distinct, successive, unrelated, and  efficient cause of the injury, even though such injury  would not have happened but for such condition or occasion.  If  no danger existed in the condition  except  because' of the independent cause, such condition was not the proximate  cause. And if an independent negligent act or defective condition  sets into operation the circumstances which  result in  injury  because of the prior defective condition, such subsequent act or condition is the proximate cause."  (45 C. J. pp. 931-932.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We realize  that  the stringing of wires  of  such  high voltage (3,600 volts), uninsulated and  so close to houses is a constant source  of danger, even  death,  especially  to persons who having  occasion  to be  near said wires, do not adopt the necessary precautions.  But may be, the City of  Manila authorities and the ;electric company could get together  and devise means of  minimizing this danger to the public.  Just  as the establishment of pedestrian lanes in city  thoroughfares may  greatly  minimize  danger  to pedestrians because drivers of motor vehicles may expect danger and slow down or even stop and take other necessary precaution upon approaching said  lanes, so, a similar way may possibly be found.  Since these high voltage wires cannot be properly insulated and at  reasonable cost, they might perhaps be strung  only  up to the outskirts of the city where there are few houses and few pedestrians and there  step down to  a voltage  where the wires carrying the same to the city could be  properly insulated  for the better protection  of the public</p>
<p>In  view, of all  the foregoing, the  appealed decision  of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and the complaint filed against the Company is  hereby dismissed.   No costs.</p>
