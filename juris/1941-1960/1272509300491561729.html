				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners Paulino&nbsp; Ochoa,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; are admittedly&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span>&nbsp; pork vendors and&nbsp; stall&nbsp; holders in the public market of Pasay&nbsp; City.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were, and&nbsp; are being,&nbsp; required to pay, for&nbsp; their swines or hogs slaughtered&nbsp; in the public abattoir of Pasay, the fee of P0.05 per&nbsp; kilo&nbsp; prescribed, for the&nbsp; slaughtering&nbsp; "of large cattle", in&nbsp; Ordinance No. 3, series.of 1945 of said City.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1 of said ordinance provides:<blockquote>"That all owners or incharge of every&nbsp; large cattle slaughtered within&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Slaughterhouse&nbsp; must pay the slaughter&nbsp; fee of five&nbsp; (P0.05) centavos per kilo of the parts of the carcass originally taxed by existing laws and ordinances."</blockquote><p>Contending&nbsp; that the&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "large&nbsp; cattle"&nbsp; as&nbsp; used in this ordinance does not&nbsp; include swine or&nbsp; hogs,&nbsp; petitioners instituted this case in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Rizal for&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaratory judgment&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect that the application of said ordinance to swine&nbsp; is&nbsp; "erroneous and&nbsp; illegal and should be&nbsp; ordered * * * stopped&nbsp; immediately."&nbsp; The answer filed by respondents, Mayor and Treasurer of Pasay City, having merely raised the&nbsp; question&nbsp; of law, whether hogs or swines are included within the&nbsp; purview of&nbsp; the&nbsp; words&nbsp; "large cattle" used in said ordinance, on motion of the petitioners, not&nbsp; objected&nbsp; to by the&nbsp; respondents, said court rendered a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; on the pleadings, resolving said question in the negative and declaring the aforementioned ordinance "inapplicable and without&nbsp; force and&nbsp; effect insofar&nbsp; as swine or hogs that may hereafter be slaughtered by the petitioners within the slaughterhouse of Pasay City."</p><p>Petitioners have&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from said decision, upon the ground that it should not confine&nbsp; its effects to swine&nbsp; or hogs "hereafter" slaughtered&nbsp; by&nbsp; them.&nbsp; This&nbsp; limitation is, indeed,&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; If, as&nbsp; the lower court had correctly held,&nbsp; the term&nbsp; 'large&nbsp; cattle'&nbsp; used&nbsp; in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1 of Ordinance No. 3,&nbsp; series.of 1945, of Pasay City,, does not&nbsp; include * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; hogs or&nbsp; swine,"&nbsp; it follows&nbsp; that&nbsp; this enactment is, inapplicable to any&nbsp; and&nbsp; all hogs or swine slaughtered in the&nbsp; public abattoir of Pasay City during the&nbsp; effectivity of said local legislation, either&nbsp; before&nbsp; or after the final disposition of the case at bar.</p><p>Wherefore, modified in the&nbsp; sense that swine or hogs slaughtered in&nbsp; said&nbsp; public&nbsp; abattoir,&nbsp; at any time&nbsp; after the&nbsp; passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; the ordinance&nbsp; above referred&nbsp; to, are not subject to the provisions thereof,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, in all&nbsp; other respects, without special pronouncements as to costs.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J, B. L., Endencia </em>and <em>Felix,&nbsp; JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
