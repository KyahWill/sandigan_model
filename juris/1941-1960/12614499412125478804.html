				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition seeking to annul the auction sale of the certificate of public&nbsp; convenience of Virginia Sembrano in favor of the Estate of Florencio P.&nbsp; Buan, conducted by the Deputy Sheriff of Ilocos&nbsp; Norte on&nbsp; November 18,&nbsp; 1957, pursuant to a third alias writ of&nbsp; execution issued&nbsp; by the judge&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of the same province, all made respondents herein, and&nbsp; to prevent the approval&nbsp; of the sale by the respondent Public Service Commission.<br><br>In&nbsp; a compromise agreement conditionally approved&nbsp; by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 1377, Alfredo&nbsp; Formoso and Virginia R.&nbsp; Sembrano transferred to Isabel, Miguela and Maximo, all surnamed Quirit, all their rights and interests in a Public Convenience covered by Certificate No. 69144.&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 23, 1953,&nbsp; all the said Quirits executed&nbsp; in favor of above&nbsp; petitioner a Deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sale&nbsp; of the rights over the said certificate&nbsp; of public convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 27, 1956,&nbsp; the Deputy Provincial Sheriff of the same court, in&nbsp; accordance with a second alias writ of execution&nbsp; issued by the said court in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1734, levied on&nbsp; the&nbsp; lines covered&nbsp; by the aforesaid&nbsp; certificate.&nbsp; Petitioner immediately&nbsp; filed a "Third Party Claim" with the said sheriff as a consequence of which the&nbsp; movant for the second alias writ of execution was required&nbsp; to file a&nbsp; bond of P1,000 so&nbsp; as not&nbsp; to stay execution.&nbsp; On August 4,&nbsp; 1956, petitioner&nbsp; filed with same court, against the said deputy sheriff,&nbsp; a&nbsp; complaint for damages with preliminary injunction, which was subsequently dismissed for&nbsp; lack of cause&nbsp; of action.&nbsp; On appeal to this Court,&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of dismissal was&nbsp; affirmed. Upon the issuance of a&nbsp; third alias writ of execution (in the said Civil&nbsp; Case No. 1734), the lines were conditionally sold&nbsp; at public auction.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; the present petition&nbsp; with this Court.<br><br>Petitioner insists that he&nbsp; is a party in&nbsp; interest and&nbsp; is entitled to all&nbsp; his prayers, because there exists a "speed of Sale of Rights" by which the Quirits had transferred and sold to him their rights and interests in the said lines; that the order&nbsp; of the respondent sheriff fixing the bond&nbsp; in the amount of P2,000 to be&nbsp; filed by the plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1734 is null and&nbsp; void.<br><br>The primary consideration in the resolution of the case at bar is the&nbsp; determination of the petitioner's right&nbsp; to institute the case.&nbsp; Petitioner premises his action on the Deed of Transfer executed in&nbsp; his favor&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Quirits.<br><br>By virtue thereof, he claims that he has acquired ownership of the certificate&nbsp; in question. We&nbsp; are&nbsp; brought therefore&nbsp; to the questionâ€”did&nbsp; the said Deed&nbsp; of Transfer ever become effective as to yield the desired consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; deed in question recited the transfer of the Quirits rights over the said certificate which&nbsp; were to have been acquired for the Sembranos by virtue&nbsp; of a&nbsp; compromise settlement, the validity and&nbsp; effectivity of which was in&nbsp; turn conditioned on its approval by the court before which the case involving the said compromise settlement was&nbsp; pending.&nbsp; The court's&nbsp; approval was further subject to a prior approval of the transfer by&nbsp; the Public Service Commission.&nbsp; The said compromise settlement conditionally approved&nbsp; by the said&nbsp; court did&nbsp; not therefore become&nbsp; effective,&nbsp; the conditions&nbsp; imposed for its approval not having been fulfilled. There was no approval by the&nbsp; Public Service&nbsp; Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>"Article 1181.&nbsp; In conditional obligations, the acquisition of&nbsp; rights, as well as the&nbsp; extinguishment or loss of those already acquired, shall&nbsp; depend upon the happening&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; event&nbsp; which constitutes the&nbsp; condition."<br></blockquote>Inasmuch as petitioner's grantors or transferors acquired no rights over the said certificate, nothing passed unto the former.&nbsp; A grantee cannot acquire better rights than what his&nbsp; grantor&nbsp; had.<br><br>We have&nbsp; pointed out that the transfer&nbsp; without the approval and&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of the Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission, of a property covered by a franchise&nbsp; is not binding against said&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; and against third persons, and that the original grantee continues to be responsible under the franchise.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See case of Montoya <i>vs.</i> Ignacio, 94 Phil., 182; 50 Off. Gaz. [1], 108; Flores <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Miranda, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, p. 266;&nbsp; 57 Off. Gaz. [44], 7938).<br><br>In view of the foregoing the&nbsp; present petition is dismissed, with costs against petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur. .<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Concepcion, J., </span>concurs in the result.</div>
