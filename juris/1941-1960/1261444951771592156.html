				G.R. No. L-7296, April 30, 1955</h4>
				<H3>PHILIPPINE LAND-AIR-SEA LABOR UNION (PLASLU), PETITIONER, VS. CEBU PORTLAND CEMENT COMPANY AND THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action has come before us on two different occasions. In the first, 
review was sought of the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations granting, 
among others, thre? concessions to the petitioner, namely, (<em>a</em>) increase 
of wages of laborers, (<em>h</em>) increase of the contract price for the 
hauling of coal, and (<em>f</em>) award of 15 days vacation leave and 15 days 
sick leave with pay to all employees and laborers, except piece workers. The 
awards were affirmed in this Court, and when the record was returned to the 
court below, petitioner filed a motion with the latter, praying that the 
respondent company be ordered to deposit with the court all differential 
salaries and wages of employees and laborers under demands (<em>a</em>) and 
(<em>h</em>) (Annex B). This motion was granted in an order of the court below 
on February 21, 1952 wherein the following order was given:
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *, the Examiner of the Court or his representative is hereby Ordered to 
proceed to the offices of the Respondent Company, both in the City of Manila and 
in Tinaan, Naga, Cebu province, to determine the money value of all the rights, 
benefits and privileges awarded in the decision of this Court of April 27, 1951, 
especially with regard to Demand A and N and the concessions therein granted in 
Exhibit I of the Respondent; and to submit to this Court A8 early as possible 
the result of his examination of the Respondent's books for further 
consideration." (Annex C)</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 8, 1952 the petitioner presented a "motion for execution of award", 
alleging that according to a partial report of the Court examiner the sum of 
P413,073.62 has already been determined as the total amount representing the 
money value of the rights, benefits and privileges pertaining and accruing to 
the petitioner's employees as of February 29, 1952, and praying that the said 
amount be deposited in the court, and that once deposit is made an examiner be 
ordered and authorized to distribute the said sum of money to the employees and 
workers of the company affected by the award (Annex D). This motion was granted 
and an order of the court, dated August 11, 1952, was entered, the pertinent 
portion of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The respondent, Cebu Portland Cement Company, is hereby ordered to deposit 
with the Clerk of Court of this Honorable Court within ten (10) days after 
receipt of this order the amount of P413,073.62, as partially reported by the 
examiner of this Court." (Annex F).</p></blockquote>
<p>Against this order, a petition for certiorari was also filed in this Court, 
but we resolved to dismiss the petition (Annex N). When the case was returned to 
the Court of Industral Relations, the latter in an order of May 12, 1953 made 
the following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In issuing the order directing the respondent to deposit the sum of 
P413,073.62, this Court was of the impression that the said amount represented 
the money value of all rights, benefits and privileges awarded in the decision 
dated April 27, 1951, accruing to the members of the petitioning union and that 
the report of the Examiners of this Court was limited thereto. This belief of 
the Court was further strengthened by petitioner's 'Motion for Execution of 
Award' dated July 8, 1952, wherein it was stated that the sum of P413,073.62 
represented 'the amount already determined as money value of all the rights, 
privileges and benefits accruing to petitioner's affiliates.'</p>
<p>"This Court now realizes that in issuing its order of August 11, 1952, it was 
misled by the Report of the Examiners and the motion of the petitioning union. 
Contrary to the order of February 21, 1952, wherein the Examiners of the Court 
were directed to determine the money value of all the rights, benefits and 
privileges awarded in the decision of this Court of April 27, 1951, especially 
with regard to Demands 'A' and 'H' and the concessions therein granted in 
Exhibit 'I' of the respondent', they incorporated in their report matters which 
have not been covered by the award.</p>
<p>"The report of the Examiners should have been limited to the salary and/or 
wage differential falling under Demands 'A' and 'H' accruing to the affiliates 
of the PLASLU for whose benefits this case is prosecuted and on whose account 
the writ of execution is being asked. The members of the Cement Workers' Union 
and the Philippine Coal Miners' Union are not contemplated nor embraced in the 
decision of this Court of April 27, 1951, because they have already been 
directly granted by the respondent similar concessions without intervention of 
this Court and upon which the award herein made had been based.</p>
<p>"With respect to demand F, the award was limited to a recognition of the 
right of laborers to 15 days sick leave and 15 days vacation leave with pay for 
every year of continuous and efficient service. It was not demanded by the 
petitioner that the money value of the leave earned by its affiliates should be 
commuted and paid but even if this were demanded, it was not agreed to by the 
respondent (See p. 3, Exhibit 'I' re demand 10 of Cement Workers' Union) and as 
the decision was based upon the concessions made in the Resolution of the 
respondent Board of Directors of January 14, 1949 (Exhibit T), no award was made 
for the commutation of the money value of the vacation and sick leave earned by 
the affiliates of the petitioning union. The Examiners of this Court, therefore, 
committed an error in including in the report the money value corresponding to 
this demand.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of April 27, 1951, stands, and the 
implementing order of deposit of August 11, 1952, is hereby modified as 
follows:</p>
<p>"1. The respondent is ordered to deposit with the Clerk of this Court the sum 
of P19.510.84 which is the amount already determined as money value of the 
rights, benefits and privileges accruing to the employees and laborers of the 
respondent by virtue of the award of this Court dated April 27, 1951, on Demands 
(<em>a</em>) and (<em>h</em>) of the petitioner.</p>
<p>"2. The money value of the vacation and sick leave standing to the credit of 
the officials and employees of the respondent as of February 29, 1952, in the 
amount of P393.562.78, is hereby declared specifically excluded from the said 
order of deposit. "Respondent's petition that the PLASLU submit to this Court 
the list of its affiliates who desire to go on leave and commute the money value 
of the vacation and sick leave standing to their credit is denied." (Annex 
U).</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be seen that while in its order of August 11. 1952 the respondent 
court ordered the respondent company to deposit with its own Clerk of Court the 
sum of P413,073.62, in its subsequent order of May 12, 1953 only the sum of 
F19,510.84 was required to be deposited and the balance of P393,652.78 excluded 
from the order of deposit. And it is contended by petitioner that as the 
previous order had become final and executory, the respondent court exceeded its 
jurisdiction in modifying it. We find no merit in the above contention. The 
order of August 11, 1952 is not a final judgment or order determinative of an 
issue of act pending before the respondent court for decision. The examiner of 
the court had made a partial report on the supposed money value of certain 
awards made in the decision of the court, and the court merely ordered the 
deposit of the supposed money value thereof. As to the correctness of the 
amounts included in the partial report, or whether they were actually due and 
payable or not to the members of the petitioning union, no determination by the 
respondent court thereof had been made, and neither were the parties given their 
day in court to contest the correctness of the amounts ir eluded or the right of 
the members of the petitioner to demand payment thereof to them. It was, 
therefore, merely an interlocutory order preparatory to the execution of the 
judgment awarding increase of wages and salaries, and in no sense a final 
judgment determinative of the amounts to which the members of the petitioning 
union were entitled and ordering payment thereof to them by the respondent 
company. As such it was subject to modification and amendment by the respondent 
court under its inherent powers (section 5, Rule 124, Rules of Court in relation 
to Section 6, Commonwealth Act No. 103), in order to make it conformable to law 
and justice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any trial court discovering error or injustice in a judgment before it 
becomes final, may upon its own motion or that of the parties, correct the 
error, or, if necessary, grant a new triaL No statutory authority is necessary." 
(Veluz <em>vs</em>. Justice of the Peace of Sariaya, 42 Phil., 
557.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Having arrived at the conclusion that the order of August 11, 1952 is not a 
final judgment decisive of a controversy or an issue of fact, we will now 
proceed to inquire whether its modification is justified. The respondent court 
had issued said order in the mistaken belief that the examiner had included in 
his report only the amounts which the members of the union were entitled to 
receive as increases in salaries and wages under the demands (<em>a</em>) and 
(<em>h</em>) of the original decision and which were demanded in the Unoin's 
motion; but it subsequently found that the examiner had included in the total 
amount awards made under demand (<em>f</em>) of the decision, the latter being 
the money value of the sick leave and vacation leave which the members of the 
petitioning union had actually to their credit at the time of the partial 
report. The error in the report of the examiner is shown by the record. In the 
order of February 21, 1952 the examiner of the court was to determine the money 
value of the rights, benefits, and privileges awarded on demands (<em>a</em>) 
and (<em>h</em>); no mention was made therein of the award on demand 
(<em>f</em>). So it is ¦clear that the money value of the sick leave and 
vacation leave of the members of the union, which are in award (<em>f</em>), 
were not to be included. That they were not to be included is also evident from 
the fact that the decision made only an <em>award; it did not order a 
commutation and payment of the leaves earned</em>. The original petition of the 
petitioner for the execution dated September 1, 1951 also made demands only for 
the payments of increase of wages under demand (<em>a</em>) and increase of 
price of hauling coal under demand (<em>h</em>). No request in the said motion 
of the petitioner was made for the commutation and payment of vacation and sick 
leave earned by the members. So the court was induced into error both by the 
motion of the petitioner, and the failure of the examiner to follow strictly the 
original order of the court for the computation of the increases of salaries and 
wages.</p>
<p>It is certainly unfair and unjust for the petitioner to take advantage of a 
mistake of the examiner of the court and the error of the court induced by such 
mistake to demand rights not included in its original motion for execution or 
contained or embraced in the judgment which it sought to be executed or 
implemented. Certainly no rights can be predicated on mistakes of the court 
employees or of the court induced thereby. The petitioning union can under no 
circumstances base or claim any right arising from the mistake of the examiner 
of the court, and when the court realized that it had been induced by error to 
make its order of August 11, 1952, and decided to set aside its order <em>motu 
proprio</em>, the petitioner had absolutely no right to object to the 
correction.</p>
<p>The petition must be denied, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J, B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition denied.</em></p></div>
