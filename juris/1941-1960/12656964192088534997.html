				<H3>JUAN MALONDA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JUSTINA INFANTE VDA. DE MALONDA ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the year 1936, Eufronio Malonda died in Camarines Sur leaving the 
defendant Justina Infante as his widow and the other defendants as his 
legitimate children .
<p>On March 15, 1943, Juan Malonda instituted this potion to obtain a partition 
of the properties belong to the estate of said Eufronio Malonda. He alleged he 
was a natural son of the deceased, had continuosly enjoyed possession of the 
status of acknowledged child, and was entitled to share in the inheritance.</p>
<p>After the plaintiff had rested his case, upon motion of defendant, the Court 
of First Instance of Camarines Sur, Judge Gabriel Prieto, dismissed the 
proceeding the reason that the action involved a petition which, according to 
the Civil Code, could only be considered during the lifetime of the putative 
parent, except in two cases, none of which — His Honor said — applied to herein 
plaintiff. Such exceptions are these: (1) if the father or mother died during 
the minority of the child * * *; and (2) if, after the death of the father or 
mother, some document, before unknown, should be discovered in which the child 
is expressly acknowledged. (Article 137 Civil Code.) </p>
<p>Juan Malonda was born in Aug. 1897, in Iriga, Camarines Sur. At that time the 
Civil Code was already in force, it having become law in 1889. His rights are 
therefore governed by that system of legislation. Now, in 1936 when Eufronio 
Malonda departed, Juan Malonda was no longer a minor. Hence, the first exception 
above-mentioned is inapplicable .</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellant, without contesting the general rule invokes the second 
exception, by prasenting Exhibit B and by declaring about, two letter's Eufronio 
Malonda had addressed to him. Exhibit B is not in the record, as reconstituted. 
It seems to be a "certifico de confirmición" , taken from the church registry of 
the Bishop of Nueva Caceres. Supposing that — as plaintiff claims — it actually 
.contains a statement that Juan Malonda is the son of Eufronio Malonda, in 
default of proof that Eufronio had signed it, no recognition of paternity may 
thereby be imputed to him. It is safe to assume that such certificate is signed 
merely by church authorities, attesting to what appears in their records. And 
statements in ecclesiastical books have consistently been held insufficient 
acknowledgments of the filiation of natural children.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Anyway Exhibir B — or what it represents — Is not a document <em>unknown</em> 
to Juan Malonda before the death of his father, as everyone in this Catholic and 
Christian country is supposed to be cognizant of the existence of such church 
records. And the letters to which Juan Malonda referred in his oral testimony 
included no declaration expressly acknowledging Juan Malonda as the offspring of 
Eufronio. Again, such communications are not documents <em>discovered after the 
death</em> of Eufronio. They were received by, and therefore were known to Juan 
before the demise of his alleged father.</p>
<p>It follows from the above exposition that the trial judge made no mistake in 
refusing to entertain the demands of plaintiff-appellant, for it is settled that 
a natural child not acknowledged has no rights whatsoever against his father or 
his estate.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Some authors and jurists 
regard this rule as unfair to natural children who are brought into this world 
through no fault of their own. Others sustain it upon the ground that it 
protects the rights of the legitimate family and serves [to discourage illicit 
relations. Much could be written expounding or criticizing the opposing schools 
of thought. But it is unnecessary to do so at this time. The Code Commission has 
taken a definite stand on the latter in the draft of the Civil Code it has 
submitted to the Congress, — which is currently under study by a committee of 
the House of Representatives — and any official pronouncements made in this 
connection might be considered as an attempt to Influence the members thereof 
and the Congress itself, whose wisdom, patriotism and vision will surely be put 
to a test in the discussion of the many statutory reforms the Code Commission 
has chosen to recommend. In the meantime, until this particular rule about 
natural children is modified by legislative authority our duty is to apply it in 
proper cases, regardless of our preferences.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is affirmed, with cost. So 
ordered.</p><em>Parás, Actg. C. J.</em>, and <em>Tuason, J.</em>, concur. 
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the result.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>There is no course of action more commodious in dispensing justice than that 
of applying the law as we find it clearly printed in a book. When the law we are 
called upon to apply harmonizes with our sense of justice or does not appear to 
contravene any rule of fair play, the course of action should be followed 
without the least hesitation. In this case we are faced with a provision of law 
that provokes revolt in our conscience. The situation creates the alternative of 
whether to apply or not the provision as it is. It calls for a resolute attitude 
from one who, by the nature of his office and by his oath, is duty bound to 
administer true justice.</p>
<p>The law in question is that embodied in article 137 of the Civil Code which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Actions for the acknowledgment of natural children may be commenced only 
during the lifetime of the putative parents except in the following cases:</p>
<p>"1. If the father or mother died during the minority of the child, in which 
case the latter may commence the action within the four years next following the 
attainment of its majority.</p>
<p>"2. If, after the death of the father or mother, some document, before 
unknown, should be discovered in which the child is expressly acknowledged.</p>
<p>"In this case the action must be commenced within the six months next 
following the discovery of such document."</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several fundamental reasons why the provision should be considered 
obsolete and should be denied enforcement:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Being procedural or adjective in nature, it was nullified and superseded 
since July 1, 1940, by the Rules of Court adopted by the Supreme Court as 
provided by the Constitution.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Being a regulation as to the time when a petition for the acknowledgment of a 
natural child should be filed and considered, the matter is governed by the 
Statute of Limitations and provisions on prescription of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, and since the latter's enactment, it ceased to have any effect.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The provision would compel a natural child to bring action against his own 
father, during his lifetime, to seek judicial confirmation of his 
acknowledgment, which is shocking upon moral considerations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The provision is discriminatory against a natural child, and, therefore, is 
unconstitutional, because it violates the "equal protection of the law" 
clause.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The provision is one of the manifestations of feudal ideology, absolutely 
incompatible with the tenets of our present day constitutional 
democracy.</p></li></ol>
<p>The philosophy underlying the provision in question is the product of the 
twisted medieval mentality which, giving back to the healthy processes of 
reason, would punish or impose civil sanction or social ostracism not upon the 
guilty parents, but upon the innocent children who have no choice whether to be 
born out of approved wedlock or out of more or less clandestine illegitimate 
relationship. The injustice is so glaring that only defective morbid mentality 
can fail to perceive it.</p>
<p>It is high time that, in the light of the equal protection of the law and 
social justice clauses of the fundamental law, the discriminatory provisions 
against illegitimate children in the Spanish Civil Code should be erased from 
our statute books as a nullity and permanently relegated to the archaeological 
museum of the mistakes and injustices of a socially and morally immature 
humanity.</p>
<p>All children are entitled to equal protection from their parents. Only a 
distorted concept of that parental duty, Which springs from and is imposed by 
nature, may justify discriminatory measures to the prejudice of those born out 
of illicit sexual relations. The legal or moral violations upon which some of 
our present day legal provisions penalize. illegitimate children with social, 
economic and financial sanctions, are perpetrated by the parents without the 
consent or knowledge of the children. If the erring parents deserve to have 
their foreheads branded with the stigma of illegitimacy, it is iniquitous to 
load the innocent children with the evil consequences of that stigma. There can 
be illegitimate parents but there should not be any illegitimate children. </p>
<p>In affording protection to their offspring, animals, including the wildest 
and most ferocious, do not make unjust distinctions. Can a people of the 20th 
century afford to face the indictment of lacking the sense of justice with which 
even the most sanguinary beasts are endowed? There will not be enough water in 
the Jordan to wash out such shame nor enough flames in the Phlegethon to melt 
the plaque of that sin.</p>
<p>Agreement on the need of surrounding the institution of marriage with legal 
guarantees cannot enshrine it as a cult where the votaries may blindly sacrifice 
innocent children in the altar of Mammon. No matter how high we may place it in 
the category of human institutions, marriage cannot be an end in itself. It is 
only one of the many means devised by mankind to serve its well-being. The 
security, welfare, and happiness of children, so as to Insure the survival and 
perpetuation of humanity, are among the essential purposes of marriage. If 
marriage cannot serve those purposes in the case df illegitimate children, it 
should tot, be used as a pretext to hamper or destroy them. Created bid 
established to promote social welfare, it should not be used as a pretext for or 
an instrument of injustice. Otherwise, the hatred it may provoke will engender 
revolt against its existence.</p>
<p>The present legal discriminations against illegitimate children are 
perpetrated avowedly in the interest of the Institution of marriage. But they 
are miserably missing the mark. By unjustly punishing the innocent illegitimate 
offspring, marriage is not promoted nor protected, while there is no statistical 
evidence that the procedure has reduced ;the number of parents bent on begetting 
children of free love or of mere lust. The authors of the discriminatory laws 
have committed injustice because they did not look at social phenomena realities 
with their retinas but only, as jesting youngsters, with eyelids in entropion. 
No matter how pullulating the number of their unfortunate victims may be, their 
cruelty does not have the effect of an antidote against illicit love or simple 
lust which—call them vices, morbid conditions, or mere weaknesses, as you may 
choose—have afflicted even many of the greatest specimens of humanity, including 
outstanding names in history, starting from David and Solomon of the Sacred 
Scripture, if we choose not to delve further beyond remote antiquity.</p>
<p>The ever present distressing problems of love, sex and marriage, should be 
solved with deeper wisdom than that shown by the rudimentary reasoning process 
behind the discriminatory legal provisions. The problems seem to be part of the 
common ailments of mankind and are becoming more difficile and complex with the 
growing complexity of modern society. They had been and continue to be among the 
main preoccupations of man in all times. Only hypocrisy may conceal the fact. 
The spicy conversations on account of sex very often occupy considerable time of 
many men, without excluding the most cultured ones and those placed in the 
higher brackets of social hierarchy or official authority. Phallicism was a 
characteristic of the most ancient religions. Greek mythology created the cult 
of Priapus in the Dionysiac mysteries. Priam, one of the protagonists of the 
Illiad, was distinguished by his one hundred children. Widespread divorces in 
the most civilized countries, measures to eradicate prostitution, war babies, 
clandestine polygamy, are just some of the problems that so far have defied all 
solution. Certainly, the solution cannot be found in increasing the number of 
social injustices if allowing the continuation of discriminatory measures 
against illegitimate offsprings. Let it be remembered illegitimate children are 
human beings like others and are entitled to the same rights and privileges. And 
no one can deny that many of them have afforded substantial contributions for 
the improvement of the lot of man. Much of the strength and greatness of the 
greatest democracy of modern times is due to the genius of Alexander Hamilton, 
who has been called the "sublime bastard."</p>
<p>The prevailing attitude towards illegitimate children and their mothers 
should be revised. Besides causing Iniquities against the children, it is 
directly responsible for many abortions and infanticides. Without in any way 
encouraging illicit sexual relations, it is high time that the social anatema 
against them should subside in the face of motherhood, which should be taken as 
a redeeming happening, fecundation should give the woman the feeling of being 
blessed by nature, and that should give her enough pride to overcome the shame 
of social taboos so as to preclude her ¦from attempting against the life of her 
child and make her feel that the event had placed in her hands a noble mission, 
the rearing of her child, born in accordance with the inscrutable plans of 
nature. By dedicating herself to such mission she must feel that she is 
contributing to achieve the perpetuation of mankind.</p>The order of dismissal 
should be reversed and the lower court should be ordered to give plaintiff his 
day in court to try and decide the case on the merits, by following general 
rules of procedure and evidence. <br><br><br>
