				<H3>ESTANISLAO FERMIN, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND GAUDENCIO EUGENIO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for a writ of prohibition.
<p align="justify">In civil case No. 96 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos 
Norte entitled "Estanislao Fermin, plaintiff <i>versus</i> Gaudencio Eugenio, 
defendant," for ejectment, the court rendered judgment declaring that the estate 
of the late Fausto Diaz, of which Estanislao Fermin, the plaintiff therein, was 
the administrator, is the owner of the two parcels of land involved in that 
litigation and directed the defendant to deliver the possession thereof to the 
plaintiff (Appendix A). On 12 August 1947 the attorney for the defendant therein 
was notified of the judgment. On 28 August the defendant therein filed a motion 
for new trial couched in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Defendant, Gaudencio Eugenio, By his undersigned counsels, 
respectfully prays this Honorable Court to set aside its decision in the 
above-entitled case, dated July 16, 1947, and grant a new trial therefor on the 
ground that</p>
<p align="justify">1. The decision is not supported and justified by the evidence. 
</p>
<p align="justify">2. The decision is contrary to law and facts. </p>
<p align="justify">WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the decision in the 
above-entitled case be set aside and the new trial sought for be granted. 
(Appendix B.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On 22 September the attorney for the defendant was notified of 
the order denying the motion for new trial (Appendix C). On 29 September the 
defendant filed a notice of appeal; on 2 October, the record on appeal; and on 4 
October, the appeal bond. Despite objection to the allowance of the record on 
appeal and motion to dismiss the appeal, the court allowed it (Appendix D). On 
17 April 1948, the day following the forwarding of the record on appeal and 
before it was docketed in the Court of Appeals, the plaintiff therein filed a 
motion for dismissal of the appeal on the ground that the appellate court 
acquired no jurisdiction over the same, it having been filed beyond the 
reglementary period (Appendix E). On 17 May the plaintiff therein was notified 
of the Court of Appeals resolution denying the motion for dismissal (Appendix 
F).</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the foregoing facts the petitioner, plaintiff in the court 
below, prays that the Court of Appeals be commanded to desist from proceeding 
further with the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent Gaudencio Eugenio, defendant in the court below, 
admits the facts averred in paragraphs from 1 to 6 and denies those set forth in 
paragraphs from 7 to 9. He claims that he had paid the docketing fee and the 
estimated cost of printing the record on appeal and the appeal is now pending in 
the Court of Appeals; that the petition for prohibition is not the adequate 
remedy for the grounds thereof may be raised in the Court of Appeals and that 
the attorney for the petitioner is disqualified from acting as such because he 
is at present the second assistant provincial fiscal of the province of Ilocos 
Norte.</p>
<p align="justify">The only question to determine is whether the motion for new 
trial filed on 2S August 1947 suspended the running of the period within which 
an appeal should be taken. The motion being <i>pro forma</i>, because it does 
not "point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the judgment which 
are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law, making express 
reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence or to the provision of law 
alleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions" (section 2, Rule 37), as 
that provision of the rule was construed in the case of Alvero <i>versus</i> de 
la Rosa et al. G. R. No. L-286, decided 29 March 1946, 42 Off. Gaz., 3161,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> did not suspend the running of the period 
within which an appeal should have been taken. Such being the case, the filing 
of the notice of appeal, the record on appeal and the appeal bond on 29 
September, 2 October and 4 October, respectively, was beyond the reglementary 
period of thirty days from notice of judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">The writ is granted. The respondent Court of Appeals is hereby 
enjoined from proceeding further with the appeal taken by the respondent 
Gaudencio Engenio in civil case No. 96 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos 
Norte, the judgment therein rendered having become final and executory. Without 
costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor, Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
