<h3></h3><p>On April 19, 1954, Pedro A. Venida on his own behalf and on behalf of the 
Larap Labor Union, a duly registered labor organization, filed in the court of 
first Instance of Camarines Sur, a second amended complaint for prohibition, 
damages and injunction against Pedro Iligan and others, alleging substantially 
that on April 4 of the same year, at an election for officers of said Union he 
had been duly elected President of the same; that defendants who were the rivals 
he had defeated for that post planned and threatened illegally to convene on 
April 21 another meeting to elect officers, to his prejudice and damage, because 
the constitution and by-laws of the association permitted only one election 
every year. Pedro A. Venida asked for preliminary injunction, and prayed that 
after a hearing on the merits such injunction be made permanent.</p>
<p>Acting on the petition, the Hon. Gustavo Victoriano, Judge, issued a 
temporary injunction. However on April 27 His Honor granted defendants' motion 
to dissolve the injunction, upon the filing of a suitable bond.</p>
<p>Wherefore on May 12, 1954, Pedro A. Venida for himself and for the Larap 
Labor Union presented, in this Court, this petition for certiorari to revoke the 
order dissolving the preliminary injunction. After alleging the facts 
hereinbefore stated, he complained that he had not been heard before the 
issuance of the order of April 27, because he was in Manila, and the judge knew 
it. He also asserted that the members of the Union were under pressure by the 
respondent Aguedo Masocol, general foreman of the Philippine Iron Mines Inc. in 
Paracale, Camarines Sur, wherein the laborers forming the Larap Union were 
working; and that the attempt of defendants to hold another election had given 
rise to a critical situation in the locality, the labor union having declared a 
strike and formed picket lines in a dispute with the employer mining 
company.</p>
<p>Thru the petitioner's failure to submit sufficient copies, his petition could 
not be taken up until July 2, 1954 when this Court adopted a resolution 
requiring the respondents to answer within ten days, and granting the 
petitioner's prayer for preliminary injunction to prevent the holding of another 
election of officers of the Larap Labor Union.</p>
<p>On July 26, 1954, the respondents, filed their answer, supported by the 
necessary documents.</p>
<p>It appears that the Larap Labor Union is an association of laborers and 
employees of the Philippine Iron Mines Inc.; that on April, 1954 it hold a 
meeting to elect its officers; that Pedro A. Venida was nominated as candidate 
for president, against some of the respondents herein; that Venida's candidacy 
was contested on the ground that he was not employed by the said mining 
corporation; that as a spirited discussion ensued and confusion prevailed, the 
persons appointed to conduct the balloting resigned <em>en masse</em> and the 
officers of the Union decided to postpone the election; that Pedro A. Venida and 
his partisans held a rump election which resulted in his asserted majority 
votes; that the officers exerted efforts to hold another election but were 
prevented by the injunction issued by the respondent judge; but after the 
lifting of said injunction order, the members of the Larap Labor Union in an 
orderly election, on May 6, 1954, elected the following as their officers for 
the year 1954: P. S. Iligan, President; R. de la Paz, Vice-President; E. Pura, 
Secretary; F. Bascombe, Treasurer and others as Board of Directors.</p>
<p>There is a certificate before us that the said election proceedings were on 
the whole, smooth and orderly, thru the cooperation of the Provincial Governor, 
the representative of the Department of Labor, the Constabulary officers and the 
company's security officers.</p>
<p>The fact that at the meeting of April 4, 1954 no set of officers was selected 
because the election was postponed, is attested by the minutes of the Board of 
Directors' meeting, Annex 3, properly certified by the President and the 
Secretary of the Union.</p>
<p>There is no question that Pedro A. Venida was not and is not employed in the 
Philippine Iron Mines Inc., was not a member of the Larap Labor Union and could 
not therefore be elected officer thereof. He contends however, that as he could 
be appointed as a representative of the Union under section 2(<em>h</em>) of 
Republic Act 875 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Representative" includes a legitimate labor organization or any officer or 
agent of such organization, whether or not employed by the employer or employees 
whom he represents,</p></blockquote>
<p>he could be chosen officer thereof, even if he is not employed in the 
company. The argument is unsound, because it assumes, mistakenly, that 
"representative" of the union and "officer" of the labor association always mean 
the same thing.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as Pedro A. Venida was not elected President of the Larap Labor 
Union, he had no reason to complain either in the court of first instance of 
Camarines or in this Court. On the basis of facts subsequently disclosed, it 
must be held that the preliminary injunction was improvidently issued in the 
Camarines Court, And it is unnecessary to discuss procedural errors, if any, in 
the lifting thereof; although the record yields a sufficient excuse for the 
alleged failure to give petitioner a chance to object to the petition to lift 
the injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Anyway, dissolution of 
a preliminary injunction may even be ordered <em>ex parte</em>. (Ong Su Han 
<em>vs</em>. Gutierrez David, 43 Off. Gaz. 95.)</p>
<p>The preliminary injunction issued by this Court in July, 1954 upon the 
strength of petitioners' prima facie representations could not, of course, 
affect the election previously held on May 6, 1954,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and respondents are not to blame therefor. 
And "an action for a permanent restraining injunction should be dismissed when 
it appears upon the trial that the acts, to restrain which the action was begun, 
have been fully executed". (Reyes <em>vs</em>. Harty, 21 Phil. 422.) </p>
<p>For all the foregoing, this petition will be dismissed with costs against 
petitioner Pedro A. Venida. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p><strong>CONCEPCION, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>I concur in the result. For the reasons stated in my separate opinion in the 
case of "Epifanio Farrales <em>vs</em>. Antonio Fuentecilla" (95 Phil., 417), 
decided on July 26, 1954, I cannot agree with the view that a writ of 
preliminary injunction may, consistently with the due process clause, be 
dissolved <em>ex parte</em>.</p>
<p><em>Petition dismissed.</em></p></div>
