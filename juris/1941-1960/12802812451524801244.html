				<H3>NG GIOC LIU (ALIAS VICENTE UY), PETITIONER, VS. THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in September, 1947, Ng Gioc Liu, <em>alias</em> Vicente Uy, 
presented to the Department of Foreign Affairs a letter from the Commissioner of 
Immigration, requesting that the Philippine consulate at Amoy, China, be 
authorized to issue a returning resident visa to Mariano Uy as an unemancipated 
minor son of said Ng Gioc Liu, the Commissioner being satisfied that this minor 
was bofn in Manila in 1928, but that, having gone to China in 1930 to study and 
having stayed there since then, he has to have a <em>visa</em> to return to the 
Philippines. As the Commissioner's request was not granted, Ng Gioc Liu came to 
this Court with a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs to authorize the issuance of the <em>visa</em> in question. 
Answering the petition, the Solicitor General, on behalf of the respondent, 
denies the non-immigrant status of the minor Mariano Uy and alleges as a 
defense, among other things, that the giving of a visa is not a ministerial act 
that may be compelled by mandamus and that the Government has already adopted 
the policy of not considering as <em>bona fide</em> residents those aliens who 
left the Philippines before 1941 and had not returned at the time the said 
policy was adopted in 1946.
<p>The Immigration Act of 1940, which is still in force, permits resident aliens 
who leave the Philippines for a temporary visit abroad to return to the 
Philippines provided they have not relinquished their residence here. Upon 
returning they are considered non-immigrants, but they are required by section 
10 of the Act to present for admission into the Philippine unexpired passports 
and valid passport <em>visas</em> issued by a consular officer. Section 12 
directs that passport <em>visa</em> be not issued to an applicant who fails to 
establish satisfactorily his non-immigrant status or whose entry into the 
Philippines would be contrary to the public safety.</p>
<p>It is obvious from the legal provisions above cited that a <em>visa</em> is 
not issued as a matter of course to anyone applying for it. In the case of a 
non-immigrant, the law directs that he must first establish satisfactorily his 
status as such and the consular officer, on his part, has to satisfy himself 
that the applicant's entry into the Philippines would not be contrary to the 
public safety. The matter obviously requires an investigation by the consular 
officer issuing the visa. And it should be stated in this connection that 
although the foreign service has been placed under the over-all direction and 
supervision of the Department of Foreign Affairs by Executive Order No. 13 (42 
Off. Gaz., 2064), this does not necessarily mean that the Department Secretary 
takes the place of the consular officers abroad in the matter of the issuance of 
passport <em>visas</em>, for the Secretary can not relieve those officers of 
their responsibility under the law. This is in accord with the practice in the 
United States where the State Department at Washington, D. C, "does not and will 
not take any interest to direct the issuance of <em>visas</em> by the various 
consulates in foreign countries," for the reason that "to do so would relieve 
the consul of his responsibility." (U. S. Immigration, Exclusion, Deportation 
and Citizenship by Sydney Kansas, p. 70). The reason of the law in conferring 
upon the consuls themselves the duty and power to grant passports and 
<em>visas</em> is obvious. The applicant for a visa is in a foreign country and 
the Philippine consular officer there is naturally in a better position than the 
home office to determine through investigation conducted on the spot whether or 
not the said applicant is qualified to enter the Philippines.</p>
<p>The determination of whether or not an applicant for a <em>visa</em> has a 
non-immigrant status and whether or not his entry into this country would be 
contrary to public safety, is not a simple ministerial function. It involves the 
exercise of discretion and cannot therefore be controlled by mandamus. The fact 
that the Commissioner of Immigration has made his own investigation and is 
himself satisfied that the applicant is entitled to his claim is immaterial. For 
the consular officers are not bound by the findings and conclusions of the 
immigration office.</p>
<p>The petition for mandamus is, therefore, denied, with costs against the 
petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla</em>, and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p>REYES, J.:</p>
<p>I hereby certify that Mr. Justice Montemayor, who is now in Baguio, took part 
in the consideration of this case and voted in favor of the decision. </p></div>
