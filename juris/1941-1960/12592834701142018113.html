				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are&nbsp; six (6) class suits against the City Engineer of&nbsp; Manila to enjoin .him&nbsp; from carrying out&nbsp; his threat to&nbsp; demolish&nbsp; the houses&nbsp; of petitioners herein,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground that said&nbsp; houses constitute public nuisances.&nbsp;&nbsp; In due course,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila rendered separate, but&nbsp; substantially&nbsp; identical, decisions&nbsp; adverse to&nbsp; the petitioners, who have&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; therefrom directly&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Court.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the fact&nbsp; are&nbsp; not disputed&nbsp; and the&nbsp; same issues&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; raised in&nbsp; all these cases,&nbsp; which were jointly heard before this Court, we deem it&nbsp; fit to dispose of the appeals&nbsp; in one decision.<br><ol type="1"><li>Case No.&nbsp; L-8191&nbsp; (Case&nbsp; No. 21530&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila) was instituted by Diosdado A.&nbsp; Sitchon, Luis Gavino and Ponciano Adoremos, in their own behalf&nbsp; and&nbsp; in representation of twenty-two&nbsp; (22) persons,&nbsp; named&nbsp; in an annex&nbsp; to&nbsp; the petition.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1947 and&nbsp; 1948, said petitioners occupied portions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public street known as Calabash Road, City of Manila, and constructed houses thereon, without&nbsp; the&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of the authorities.&nbsp; Later on, some of, them paid&nbsp; "concession fees or&nbsp; damages, for the use"&nbsp; of said portions' of the street, to&nbsp; a collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city&nbsp; treasurer,&nbsp; who issued&nbsp; receipts with an&nbsp; annotation reading: "without&nbsp; prejudice to the order to&nbsp; vacate."&nbsp; On or about July&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; respondent City Engineer&nbsp; advised and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; them&nbsp; to&nbsp; vacate the place and remove their houses&nbsp; therefrom before August 5,&nbsp; 1952, with the warning that otherwise&nbsp; he would effect the demolition&nbsp; of&nbsp; said houses&nbsp; at their&nbsp; expense.&nbsp; This notice&nbsp; having been&nbsp; unheeded, a demolition team of the office&nbsp; of the City Engineer informed the petitioners in December, 1953, that&nbsp; their, houses&nbsp; would be&nbsp; removed, whereupon the case was instituted for the&nbsp; purpose already stated.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; instance of&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; herein, the lower court issued a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; preliminary injunction.<br><br></li><li>Case&nbsp; No. L-8397&nbsp; (Case No.&nbsp; 21755 of the Court of First Instance of Manila)&nbsp; was brought by Ricardo de la Cruz,&nbsp; Isidro&nbsp; Perez&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando&nbsp; Figuerroa,&nbsp; in&nbsp; their behalf and in representation of two&nbsp; hundred^$ixty-seven (267)&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; who, sometime after&nbsp; the&nbsp; liberation of Manila,&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; portions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Antipolo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Algeciras Streets,&nbsp; of said city,&nbsp; and&nbsp; constructed&nbsp; houses&nbsp; thereon, without any authority therefor.'&nbsp; Several&nbsp; petitioners later paid "concession fees or&nbsp; damages" to&nbsp; a&nbsp; collector of the city treasurer, and were&nbsp; given receipts with&nbsp; the annotation:&nbsp; "without&nbsp; prejudice&nbsp; to the order to vacate."&nbsp;&nbsp; The constructions&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; such&nbsp; that the&nbsp; roads and&nbsp; drainage on&nbsp; both sides thereof were obstructed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; some places, the ditches used for drainage purposes&nbsp; were completely obliterated. What is more, said ditches cannot be opened, repaired&nbsp; or placed&nbsp; in&nbsp; proper condition&nbsp; because&nbsp; of&nbsp; said houses.&nbsp; On&nbsp; or about&nbsp; Slay 15,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; respondent.&nbsp; City Engineer advised&nbsp; them to vacate the&nbsp; place&nbsp; and remove their houses&nbsp; within&nbsp; a stated period, with the&nbsp; warning already referred to.&nbsp; Hence, the institution of the case, upon the filing of which a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction was issued.<br><br></li><li>Felino Peña, Francisco&nbsp; Morales&nbsp; and&nbsp; Jose Villanueva filed case&nbsp; No. L-8500&nbsp; (Case No.&nbsp; 21535&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila),&nbsp; on their own behalf and in representation of&nbsp; about thirty (30)&nbsp; persons, who,&nbsp; without&nbsp; the aforementioned&nbsp; authority, occupied&nbsp; portions of the street area of&nbsp; R.&nbsp; Papa Extension,&nbsp; City of Manila, sometime after&nbsp; its liberation.&nbsp; As in the&nbsp; preceding cases, several petitioners&nbsp; paid&nbsp; "concession fees or damages" .to a&nbsp; collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; city&nbsp; treasurer,&nbsp; "without prejudice to the order to vacate", which was given on May 10, 1932, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; warning&nbsp; that&nbsp; should&nbsp; they&nbsp; fail to remove said houses, respondent&nbsp; would do so, at their expense.&nbsp; Upon being advised,&nbsp; later on,&nbsp; of the intention of respondent's agents to carry out said threat, the&nbsp; corresponding petition was filed and a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction&nbsp; secured.<br><br></li><li>Santiago Brotamonte,&nbsp; Godofredo Blanquiso and Salvador&nbsp; Justiniano commenced case No. L-8513 (Case&nbsp; No. 21531&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila),&nbsp; on their behalf and in representation of forty-two (42) other, persons,&nbsp; who,&nbsp; without any authority,&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; portions&nbsp; of the bed of&nbsp; a branch of&nbsp; the Estero de&nbsp; San, Miguel, City of Manila,&nbsp; and constructed&nbsp; houses thereon, sometime in 1947 and&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp; As in the cases already mentioned, some of them paid concession&nbsp; fees or damages, "without prejujudice to&nbsp; the order to&nbsp; vacate", which&nbsp; was&nbsp; given, with the usual warning, in December,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; The institution of the case and a writ of preliminary injunction soon followed.<br><br></li><li>In case No. L-8516&nbsp; (Case No. 21580 of the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila), Ernesto&nbsp; Navarro,&nbsp; Pablo Salas and Herminigildo&nbsp; Digap are petitioners, on their own behalf and in that of fifteen&nbsp; (15) persons, who, sometime&nbsp; after the liberation&nbsp;&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; occupied portions&nbsp; of the bed of the Pasig River, at about&nbsp; the end of Rio Vista Street, San Miguel, Manila, which are covered and uncovered by the tide, and erected houses thereon without&nbsp; any authority&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concession&nbsp; fees&nbsp; or damages" were paid by some of them, "without prejudice to the&nbsp; order to vacate".&nbsp; After giving, on or about June 20,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the corresponding notice and warning, which were not&nbsp; heeded, respondent threatened to&nbsp; demolish said houses at petitioners'&nbsp; expense,&nbsp; whereupon&nbsp; the&nbsp; case was instituted and&nbsp; a writ&nbsp; of preliminary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; secured.<br><br></li><li>Case No. L-8620&nbsp; (Case No. 22143 of the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila)&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Amado&nbsp; Sayo, Marciano&nbsp; Laraeo and Victor&nbsp; Bernardo, on their behalf 'and in that of&nbsp; twenty-two&nbsp; (22)&nbsp; other persons,&nbsp; who, in 1946 and 1947, occupied&nbsp; portions' of Torres&nbsp; Bugallon, Cavite,&nbsp; Misericordia and Antipolo Streets, in&nbsp; the City of&nbsp; Manila, and&nbsp; constructed houses thereon, without any authority&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; paid "monthly&nbsp; rentals and/or damages, and/or concession fees" from 1946 to 1951, "without prejudice to the order to vacate", which was given on&nbsp; lay 1, 1952, with the usual warning, followed,.about two (2) years later, by a threat to demolish said houses, Hence, the case,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the filing of&nbsp; which writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction was&nbsp; issued.<br></li></ol>After appropriate proceedings, the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila rendered separate decisions, the dispositive part of&nbsp; which,&nbsp; except&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-8620,&nbsp; is of&nbsp; the following tenor:<br><blockquote>"Por tanto, el Juzgado sobresee esta. causa por falta de&nbsp; meritos y ordena al ingeniero&nbsp; de la ciudad&nbsp; de Manila que haga la demolicion o la remocion&nbsp; de&nbsp; las citadas casas, dentro de quince dias despues de liaber avisado al efecto a los aqui&nbsp; reeurrentes, y&nbsp; a costa de&nbsp; los niismos."<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; said case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-8620,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing considerations tile Court hereby declares:<br><br>"(<i>a</i>) that the houses of all petitioners in this case erected on the land which forms part of Torres Bugallon, Cavite, Misericordia and Antipolo&nbsp; Streets constitute public nuisance as denned by&nbsp; section 1112 of Ordinance No. 1600 of the City of&nbsp; Manila and by Article 694 paragraphs&nbsp; 4 and 5 of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code and<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) that the City&nbsp; Engineer of the City of Manila is the official authorized&nbsp; by Article 1112 of Ordinance No. 3600 of the&nbsp; City of Manila and Article 699, paragraph 3 of the Civil&nbsp; Code to abate said public nuisance and charge&nbsp; the expenses thereof&nbsp; to petitioners."<br></blockquote>Petitioners contend&nbsp; that said&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; demolish their respective houses&nbsp; without&nbsp; notice&nbsp; and&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; the city engineer sought&nbsp; to deprive&nbsp; them of their property without due process of law, apart from the fact that, under Articles 701&nbsp; and&nbsp; 702 of the new Civil Code,&nbsp; the power to remove public nuisances is vested in the district health' officer,&nbsp; not&nbsp; in&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; city&nbsp; engineer.&nbsp; It&nbsp; should&nbsp; be noted,&nbsp; however, that,&nbsp; before&nbsp; expressing&nbsp; his&nbsp; intent&nbsp; to demolish&nbsp; the houses in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; had&nbsp; advised and ordered the petitioners to&nbsp; remove&nbsp; said houses, within the&nbsp; periods&nbsp; stated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding notices; "that petitioners&nbsp; do not question, and&nbsp; have&nbsp; not questioned,&nbsp; the: reasonableness&nbsp; or&nbsp; sufficiency of&nbsp; said&nbsp; periods;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that they&nbsp; have&nbsp; never asked respondent&nbsp; herein to&nbsp; give&nbsp; them an&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; show&nbsp; that their' houses do not constitute public nuisances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; it, is not disputed&nbsp; that said houses are standing on. public&nbsp; streets,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception of&nbsp; the&nbsp; houses&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases&nbsp; Nos. 8518 and 8516, which&nbsp; are built&nbsp; on&nbsp; portions of river&nbsp; beds.&nbsp; It is clear,&nbsp; therefore, that said&nbsp; houses&nbsp; are&nbsp; public&nbsp; nuisances,' pursuant to&nbsp; Articles 694 and&nbsp; 695&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of the Philippines, which&nbsp; is Republic Act No. 386, reading:<br><blockquote>Art. 694.—"A nuisance is&nbsp; any&nbsp; act,&nbsp; omission, establishment, business, condition&nbsp; of&nbsp; property, or anything else which:<br><blockquote>"(1) Injures or endangers the health or safety of others; or<br><br>"(2) Annoys or offends the senses;&nbsp; or<br><br>"(3) Shocks, defies or disregards decency&nbsp; or morality; or<br><br>"(4) <i>Oblstucts or interferes with&nbsp; the&nbsp; free&nbsp; passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; any public&nbsp; highway&nbsp; or&nbsp; street, or&nbsp; any&nbsp; body of water; or</i><br><br>"(5) Hinders&nbsp; or impairs the use of property."'<br></blockquote>ART. 695.—"Nuisance is&nbsp; either&nbsp; public or private.&nbsp; <i>A public nuisance affects a community&nbsp; or&nbsp; neighborhood</i> or any&nbsp; considerable number&nbsp; of persons, although the extent ol the annoyance,&nbsp; danger or damage&nbsp; upon individuals&nbsp; may be unequal. A&nbsp; private nuisance is one that is&nbsp; not&nbsp; included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; definition."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is true that Articles 700&nbsp; and 702 of the same Code provide:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>ART. 700.-—"The district health officer&nbsp; shall take&nbsp; care&nbsp; that one, or all of the remedies against a public&nbsp; nuisance are&nbsp; availed&nbsp; of"<br><br>ART.&nbsp; 702.—"The district health officer 'shall&nbsp; determine&nbsp; whether or not abatement, without judicial proceedings) is&nbsp; the best remedy against a publie nuisance."<br></blockquote>However,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 31&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 409,&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Charter of the City of Manila, specifically places upon the city engineer the&nbsp; duty;&nbsp; among others,&nbsp; "to&nbsp; have charge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; * *&nbsp; * care ,of * * *&nbsp;&nbsp; streets,&nbsp; canals .and esteros&nbsp; * **"; to "prevent the encroachment of private buildings * * * on the streets&nbsp; and public places * * *"; to "have supervision * * *&nbsp; of&nbsp; all private docks,&nbsp; wharves, piers * *&nbsp; * and other property bordering on the harbor, rivers,&nbsp;&nbsp; esteros&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; waterways * * *&nbsp; and *&nbsp; * * issue permits&nbsp; for the construction, repair&nbsp; and removal of the same and&nbsp; enforce all&nbsp; ordinances relating to the same"; to "have the care&nbsp; and custody of all sources&nbsp; of&nbsp; water supply *&nbsp; * *"; to "cause buildings&nbsp; dangerous to the public to be * * *&nbsp; torn down"; and to "order the removal of buildings and.&nbsp; structures&nbsp; erected in violation&nbsp; of the ordinances *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *".&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, articles&nbsp; 700 and&nbsp; 702 of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 386, should yield to&nbsp; said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 31 of Republic Act No. 409, not&nbsp; only because&nbsp; the former preceded&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; but,&nbsp; also, because&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 31 of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 409 is a special provision&nbsp; specifically designed&nbsp; for the City of Manila, whereas&nbsp; said Articles 700&nbsp; and&nbsp; 702&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code are general provisions' applicable&nbsp; throughout the Philippines.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; section 1122 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Ordinance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Manila (No. 1600) explicitly&nbsp; authorizes&nbsp; the&nbsp; action sought to be taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent herein, by&nbsp; providing:<br><blockquote>"Whenever the owner or person responsible for any unauthorized obstruction shall, after official notice from&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper department, refuse or neglect to remove the same within&nbsp; a&nbsp; reasonable time, such obstruction&nbsp; shall be deemed a public&nbsp; nuisance,&nbsp; and the city. engineer is authorized to remove the same at the owner's expense."<br></blockquote>Again, houses&nbsp; constructed,&nbsp; without governmental authority,&nbsp; on public streets and&nbsp; waterways, obstruct at all times the free&nbsp; use by the public of said streets and waterways,&nbsp; and, accordingly, constitute nuisances per se,&nbsp; aside from public&nbsp; nuisances.&nbsp; As such,&nbsp; the summary removal thereof, without judicial, process or proceedings may&nbsp; be authorized by the statute or municipal ordinance, despite the due process clause.&nbsp;&nbsp; (66&nbsp; C.J.S. 733-734.)<br><blockquote>"The police power of the&nbsp; state&nbsp; justifies the abatement or&nbsp; destruction, by summary proceedings, of whatever&nbsp; may be regarded as a public nuisance; and the legislature, may&nbsp; authorize the&nbsp; summary&nbsp; abatement&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; nuisance&nbsp; without judicial&nbsp; process or proceeding.<br><br>"* * * The&nbsp; remedy of summary abatement&nbsp; for violation&nbsp; of a municipal ordinance&nbsp; may be used&nbsp; against&nbsp; a public nuisance." (66 ,C.J.S.&nbsp; 855, 856.)<br><br>"When necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; insure the public&nbsp; safety,&nbsp; the&nbsp; legislature may under its&nbsp; police power authorize municipal authorities&nbsp; summarily to destroy property without&nbsp; legal&nbsp; process or previous notice to the&nbsp; owner.<br><br>&nbsp;"* * * It is not an objection to&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of a.police&nbsp; regulation that it does not provide for&nbsp; a heading or for notice to the owner&nbsp; before&nbsp; his property is subjected to restraint or destruction." (12 Am. Jur. 356, 357.)<br><br>Municipal Corporations generally&nbsp; have&nbsp; power&nbsp; to cause&nbsp; the abatement of public nuisances summarily without resort to legal proceedings."&nbsp; (39 Am.&nbsp; Jur. 455, 456, 467.)"</blockquote>Being&nbsp; in&nbsp; conformity with&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts and the&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the decisions appealed from are hereby affirmed <i>in toto,</i>&nbsp; and the writs of preliminary injunction issued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; dissolved,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; petitioners-appellants. It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A. Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L. </i>and Endencia, JJ., concur.</div>
