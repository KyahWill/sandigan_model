				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; the decision of the Court First Instance of Leyte in its Civil Case No. 776, annulling the previous final judgment rendered by it in Civil Case No. 578, ordering the partition of certain parcels of land.<br><br>It appears that on September 29, 1949, appellants filed with the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Leyte a complaint against appellees (Civil Case No. 578) for partition of 11 parcels of land&nbsp; described therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, pp. 8-11).&nbsp; The defendants in said case (appellees herein) were declared in default for failure to file their answer within the reglementary period, in spite of summons duly served upon&nbsp; them (Exh.&nbsp; 1, p.&nbsp; 1, Records).&nbsp; Trial having been had, the court rendered judgment, on December&nbsp; 22, 1949, finding (1) that all the&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land&nbsp; described in the complaint belonged originally to the deceased spouses Mauricio Aragon and Leona Ingay (parents of the parties-litigants) ;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that plaintiffs&nbsp; and&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; co-owners thereof,&nbsp; and (3) ordering&nbsp; the partition of said eleven&nbsp; (11) parcels among them.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, p. 11)<br><br>For&nbsp; failure&nbsp; of the parties&nbsp; to amicably partition&nbsp; the properties among themselves, the court appointed commissioners to effect such partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit 3, p. 3, Records) The&nbsp; commissioners&nbsp; submitted a project&nbsp; of partition on March 11, 1950 which&nbsp; was approved by the&nbsp; court on April 1,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibits 5, 9,&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; p. 17, Records)<br><br>In two separate petitions (Exhibits 10&nbsp; and&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; pp. 13 and&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; Records), the then defendants (now appellees) sought the judgment to be set&nbsp; aside on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground of excusable neglect under&nbsp; Rule 38 of the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court. Both motions were denied.&nbsp; (Exhibits 12&nbsp; and&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; pp. 18 and&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; Records).&nbsp; A petition to set aside the order of the court approving the project of partition (pp. 22-23, Records) was likewise denied (Exhibit 14, p. 25, Records). No appeal was taken,&nbsp; and the judgment became final. Consequently,&nbsp; a writ of execution&nbsp; (Exhibits 15&nbsp; and 16, pp.&nbsp; 26 and 27, Records)&nbsp; was issued by the&nbsp; court, by virtue of which&nbsp; the sheriff placed the parties in&nbsp; possession of the respective portions alloted to them in the&nbsp; project of partition (Exhibit 17, pp.&nbsp; 28-30, Records).&nbsp; The then defendants&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to receive&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective portions (pp. 31-33, Records) and, instead,&nbsp; filed the instant action to annul the final judgment in said Civil Case No.&nbsp; 578, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court which rendered it.<br><br>A motion&nbsp; to dismiss,&nbsp; dated February 15,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; (pp. 14-19, Record on&nbsp; Appeal), on the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> having been denied by the court on March 12, 1951 (Record on&nbsp; Appeal, pp. 24-25), defendants-appellants&nbsp; (successful plaintiffs in the previous case No. 578) filed their answer, dated March&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; (Record&nbsp; on Appeal,&nbsp; pp. 25-28) and after&nbsp; trial the court below&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; the decision appealed from (1)&nbsp; declaring the judgment in Civil&nbsp; Case No. 578 null and void insofar as it declares that plaintiffs-appellees and defendants-appellants are the co-owners&nbsp; of lots (a) and&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; described in the&nbsp; complaint for partition in&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 578,&nbsp; for lack of jurisdiction;&nbsp; (2) affirming the ownership of&nbsp; plaintiffs-appellees Conrado Aragon and Francisco Aragon&nbsp; over said lots (a) and (d); (3) declaring the project of partition null and void, for being inequitable, and (4) ordering the parties to make&nbsp; a new project&nbsp; of partition of the rest of the properties, excluding therefrom lots (a) and&nbsp; (d), within 30 days from the finality of the decision.&nbsp; The defendants directly appealed to this&nbsp; Court on&nbsp; points of law.<br><br>The issue herein&nbsp; presented&nbsp; is whether or not the trial court could still&nbsp; nullify&nbsp; or annul, in whole or in&nbsp; part, the decision in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 578.<br><br>There can be no question that the trial court had jurisdiction&nbsp; to take cognizance of the&nbsp; partition proceedings in Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 578.&nbsp; This much has been conceded when the trial&nbsp; court did&nbsp; not declare the decision&nbsp; therein null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto,</span> for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; It only declared null and&nbsp; void that&nbsp; portion relating to&nbsp; lots&nbsp; (a) and (d) insofar as&nbsp; it declared all the parties in&nbsp; Case No. 578 co-owners thereof, on the theory that the Torrens Certificates of Title covering these&nbsp; lots, and&nbsp; standing solely in the name of Francisco and Conrado Aragon, are conclusive of&nbsp; the ownership&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same, and to declare the parties co-owners of lots (a) and (d)&nbsp; would be&nbsp; "to&nbsp; amend or alter the decision of the Cadastral Court&nbsp; in Cases Nos. 34 and 26, with&nbsp; respect to the above-mentioned parcels," (Appellees'&nbsp; Brief, p. 5).&nbsp; We&nbsp; disagree.&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 578 was not one for the alternation or amendment of the decision or decree in the cadastral case but for the partition of properties among&nbsp; the co-owners.&nbsp; The circumstance that lots&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; and (d) are registered in the name of two of the co-owners alone does not&nbsp; preclude the court from including and dealing with said&nbsp; lots in the partition proceedings (Act 496, sec 70; Dayao <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Aming,&nbsp; 74 Phil. 114). The rule is well settled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the registration of a parcel of land in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of one&nbsp; of the co-owners does&nbsp; not preclude the court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, from compelling the registered owner to reconvey the right, interest,&nbsp; share and participation in the&nbsp; registered parcel of the one lawfully&nbsp; entitled thereto.&nbsp; (Sahagun <i>vs.</i> Gauiran, 93 Phil., 227; 50 Off. Gaz., No. 10, p. 4316).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, when the trial court declared the parties to be co-owners of&nbsp; the&nbsp; eleven parcels subject of&nbsp; the former partition proceedings,&nbsp; it in&nbsp; effect declared that Francisco&nbsp; Aragon&nbsp; and Conrado Aragon,&nbsp; the registered owners&nbsp; of&nbsp; lots (a) and&nbsp; (d), were holding the lots in trust for the other co-owners.&nbsp; This4was&nbsp; justified&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that, in spite of the summons served upon&nbsp; them in Civil Case No. 578, said appellees&nbsp; preferred to remain silent, without&nbsp; even caring to file their answer, thereby making the court believe that all the eleven parcels were common property of the parties to Case No. 578.<br><br>If there was any error in the decision in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 578, the same should have been corrected on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellees' contention that they could not have appealed because they had no more standing&nbsp; in court, having been declared&nbsp; in default,&nbsp; and because their petitions for relief under&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 38 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court had been denied,&nbsp; is likewise untenable.&nbsp; The rule is well&nbsp; established&nbsp; that appeal, not a separate action is the proper remedy for questioning the validity of a judgment, upon the denial of a petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.<br><blockquote>"Not having&nbsp; appealed from the order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for relief under Rule 38, the plaintiff is precluded from questioning, in a separate action, the validity of&nbsp; the judgment sought to be annulled and set&nbsp; aside."&nbsp; (De la Paz <i>vs.</i> Hiring,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; [Syllabus], 96 Phil., 733; 51 Off. Gaz., No. 5, 2419.)<br></blockquote>Hence, because of appellees' failure to appeal the orders denying their petitions&nbsp; for relief,&nbsp; the decision in&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 578, no&nbsp; matter how erroneous it might&nbsp; be, has become final&nbsp; (Mandac <i>vs.</i> Gumarad,&nbsp; 87 Phil., 278; 47 Off. Gaz. [Supp. 12,] 449; Daquis <i>vs.</i> Bustos, et al., 94 Phil., 913 50 Off. Gaz., No. 5, 1964) and is now conclusive and binding upon them not only with respect to questions actually contested and determined therein, but upon all matters, either factual or&nbsp; legal,&nbsp; which might have&nbsp; been litigated and decided in that suit (People <i>vs.</i> Sales, L-8925,&nbsp; May 21, 1956; Jalandoni <i>vs.</i> Martir-Guanzon, 102 Phil., 859; 54 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [5]&nbsp; 2907;&nbsp; Velasquez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Gil, 99 Phil., 457;&nbsp; 53 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [17]&nbsp; 5615; Namarco <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Macadaeg,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; 98 Phil.,&nbsp; 185;&nbsp; 52 Off. Gaz. No.&nbsp; 1, 182),&nbsp; pursuant to the principle&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata </span>or estoppel by judgment.<br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; is a finality as to&nbsp; the claim or demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with&nbsp; them,&nbsp; not&nbsp; only as to every matter which&nbsp; was&nbsp; offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissable matter which might have been offered for that purpose."&nbsp; (Miranda <i>vs.</i> Tiangco, et al.,&nbsp; 96 Phil., 526; 51&nbsp; Off. Gaz. [3], 1366).<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; as much&nbsp; as the ownership of&nbsp; the eleven&nbsp; parcels, including&nbsp; lots&nbsp; (a) and (d),&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 578 was necessarily litigated and in fact actually decided&nbsp; therein, the same&nbsp; can&nbsp; no longer be&nbsp; litigated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the instant case without doing violence to the principle above referred to.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed&nbsp; from is set aside&nbsp; and the complaint&nbsp; dismissed, with costs in this instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
