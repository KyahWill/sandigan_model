				<H3>CABMEN TOLENTINO, PETITIONER,  VS. THE COURT OF  FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA AND JOSEFA VDA.  DE ALTONAGA, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition for  mandamus to compel the Judge of the  Court of First  Instance of Manila, Third Branch, to order the immediate execution of the judgment of the municipal court in  its case  No. 70179, wherein the petitioner was plaintiff  against Josefa Vda. de  Altonaga in a  complaint for <em>desahucio</em> (April, 1945) based  on the termination of the verbal lease  of the former's house at No. 785 San Sebastian Street, Manila,  and defendant's failure to pay rent for several months.  In that case, defendant  interposed special  defenses, and after hearing the  parties, the  municipal judge ordered her  to vacate  the premises and pay  a monthly  rental of P65 from  March 1, 1945, plus costs.  She  appealed in  due time, depositing for  purposes of appeal P16 as docket  fee, and P25 as appeal bond, plus, P260 to  cover rents for March-June,  1945, but without filing a <em>supersedeas</em> bond to stay execution.</p>
<p>After the litigation had been docketed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, plaintiff on June 13, 1945 moved for immediate  execution  of the  appealed  judgment  upon the ground that appellant had failed to submit  the <em>supersedeas</em> undertaking.  On July 10,  1945,  the  respondent Judge Pompeyo Diaz, denied the motion, requiring defendant-appellant to file a <em>supersedeas</em> bond in the sum of P700 within five days, which  order was promptly complied  with. Plaintiff,  herein  petitioner,  asked  for  reconsideration, claiming it was beyond the court's power to fix or admit a bond at that stage of the proceedings.   Denial of that request led to the commencement of this special civil action, planted on the legal propositions  (1)  that upon  Altonaga's neglect to file a <em>supersedeas bond</em> in an amount approved by the municipal judge, plaintiff was  entitled to  immediate execution of the judgment of eviction, and  (2) that Judge Diaz's order was  legal  error  reversible by a directive to carry out instanter the municipal court's verdict of  restitution.</p>
<p>Rule 72, section 8, provides that  "if judgment is rendered against the defendant,  execution shall issue immediately, unless an appeal  has  been  perfected  and the defendant to stay execution files a sufficient bond approved by the justice of the peace or municipal court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in  the  Court of  First Instance,  *  *  *."</p>
<p>The rule substantially reproduces the provisions of Act No. 2588  (amending  section 88 of Act No. 190), the law applied in Igama <em>vs.</em> Soria (42  Phil., 11) wherein this Court sustained the power of the judge of first instance to permit the appellant in forcible entry and detainer cases to present the bond which he had failed to submit to  the justice of the peace court.  Indeed, bearing  in mind the purposes oÂ£ the undertaking, we perceive  no  reason to prohibit its submission to, and admission by, the judge of first instance in the exercise of his lawful  discretion.   The  attitude of the respondent judge perfectly dovetails the injunction to construe the rules liberally "in order to promote their object and to assist  the parties obtaining just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding." (Rule 1, section  2.)</p>
<p>When it  adopted the Rules  of  Court, and declined to modify the words of  the statute as interpreted,  this body practically  reiterated its previous  ruling.</p>
<p>But it is argued that this  court modified or reversed igama <em>vs.</em> Soria when it promulgated  its decision in Felipe <em>vs.</em> Teodoro  (46  Phil.,  409),  and  said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *  The  failure of  the appellants  from the judgment of, the  justice of the peace to  give the special  bond required by section 88,  <em>supra</em>, for rents and damages,  prevents a stay of execution of the  judgment as far  as  the restitution to  the  appellees of the possession of the land is  concerned. The fact that the Court of First  Instance  in its  order of June 17th required the appellants to file the special bond  in nowise  altered the previously existing situation; by operation of law, the appellees were  entitled to the immediate execution of  the judgment for possession * *  *.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not see any modification and, if there was  any, it does not necessarily favor the petitioner herein. It must be  noted that in the latter  case, no bond  had  been  filed either in the justice of the peace court or in the court of first  instance.  In fact the losers  or deforciants objected to  the filing  of  bond.   No  wonder  this Supreme Court declared the  judgment for possession had  become  executory  at the time it was called upon to act  in  certiorari proceeding's.</p>
<p>The  petition is denied.  No costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Jaranilla, Feria, De Joya,  Pablo, Perfecto</em>, and <em>Briones, JJ.</em>,  concur.</p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur, because the deposit made by the appellant is equivalent  to  if not better than a  <em>supersedeas</em> bond.</p>
