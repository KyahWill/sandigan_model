				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal taken by&nbsp; defendant William&nbsp; Ernest Jolliffe&nbsp; from a decision of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal, convicting him of a violation of Republic Act No. 265, and sentencing him to imprisonment for one&nbsp; (1) year, and to pay a fine of P2,000 and the costs,&nbsp; as well as decreeing the forfeiture,&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; Government, of four (4) pieces of gold&nbsp; bullion valued&nbsp; P35,305.46, and a travellers' check in the sum of $100.00. <br><br>There is no&nbsp; dispute about the main facts,&nbsp; which&nbsp; are set forth in&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the following language:<br><blockquote>"The accused, Mr. William&nbsp; Ernest&nbsp; Joliiffe is a Canadian subject, born&nbsp; in&nbsp; China and residing permanently&nbsp; in Hongkong. He is the son of a former&nbsp; Chancellor of the&nbsp; West China&nbsp; Union University and&nbsp; had been Trade' Commissioner&nbsp; for. Canada&nbsp; in Shanghai and Hongkong, until 1948.&nbsp; The accused belongs to a good and reputable family and is quite well-known in Hongkong.&nbsp; The accused had made several trips to Manila, sometimes on business and three times to meet&nbsp; his wife and children passing thru Manila.&nbsp; He also&nbsp; came to collect the&nbsp; debt&nbsp; owed&nbsp; to him&nbsp; by one T.&nbsp; W. Woo, a prominent businessman in Hongkong.&nbsp; He came back to Manila on December 4, 1953 to try to collect the debt owed him by T.&nbsp; Y. Woo, although he had no idea how said debt&nbsp; was to be paid, whether in peso or in gold.&nbsp; He was paid in gold which he brought with him by messenger to his room in&nbsp; the Bay View Hotel.&nbsp; At&nbsp; about&nbsp; plane&nbsp; time he went&nbsp; back to his&nbsp; hotel room and&nbsp; carried&nbsp; his gold around&nbsp; his body underneath his shirt.&nbsp; When he was&nbsp; going towards the door leading to the runway he was&nbsp; accosted&nbsp; by&nbsp; a woman,&nbsp; Amada Arimbay, a secret&nbsp; service agent,&nbsp; and was&nbsp; told to go&nbsp; to the search room" (Quoted&nbsp; from the statement of facts in the memorandum for the accused.)<br><br>"When the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; was searched&nbsp; four&nbsp; pieces&nbsp; of&nbsp; gold bullion were&nbsp; found&nbsp; tied&nbsp; to his body a few inches above the waist.&nbsp; There was also found in his&nbsp; possession&nbsp; a&nbsp; $100.00 travelers check issued by&nbsp; R. McGinty.&nbsp; While&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; under arrest he&nbsp; made&nbsp; an offer to settle&nbsp; the case by offering to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; agents&nbsp; who were then arresting him.&nbsp; He stated also that Mr. Manikan, Deputy Collector of Customs, told&nbsp; him during the&nbsp; search&nbsp; that the case could have been&nbsp; fixed had he&nbsp; told him&nbsp; before&nbsp; hand of&nbsp; his desire to export gold from the Philippines.&nbsp; Mr. Manikan, on&nbsp; the other hand, said that when the&nbsp; accused was&nbsp; about to be&nbsp; searched he offered him P30,000.00&nbsp; provided the case&nbsp; be settled&nbsp; and forgotten.&nbsp; The Court accepts the testimony of Mr.&nbsp; Manikan as the true version of the incident because&nbsp; the accused himself&nbsp; said&nbsp; in the&nbsp; course of his testimony that Mr. Manikan told him that he could say anything&nbsp; in private to him after he (accused) had signed the written&nbsp; statement, Exhibit I,&nbsp; certifying to the things found&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession, of the accused, among which, were the four pieces of gold bullion.&nbsp; These facts show that when Mr.&nbsp; Manikan consented to&nbsp; allow the accused to talk with him&nbsp; about the case after signing Exhibit I, there was no other desire on the part of Mr. Manikan but to give the accused every&nbsp; opportunity to explain his side of the&nbsp; case but not for any illegitimate purpose.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Manikan's acts in&nbsp; this case&nbsp; are above board&nbsp; and the only logical steps&nbsp; that&nbsp; an&nbsp; honest official could take&nbsp; in the present case.&nbsp;&nbsp; But these minor incidents&nbsp; relating to&nbsp; the case are of no&nbsp; importance, taking into consideration&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that the accused himself has admitted that on December 7,&nbsp; 1953 when he was about&nbsp; to board in one of the planes of the&nbsp; Pan&nbsp; American World Airways he.had&nbsp; with&nbsp; him four pieces&nbsp; of gold bullion of&nbsp; the approximate value of P35,305.46.&nbsp; This being a fact, the only question before the Court&nbsp; is purely&nbsp; a question of law."<br></blockquote>Appellant alleges that:<br><blockquote>"1. That the trial court&nbsp; erred in not&nbsp; ruling that Circular 21&nbsp; of the Central Bank is the only law in point, and that, being&nbsp; a special law, it does not penalize attempted or frustrated&nbsp; violations thereof, but merely consummated violations and, therefore,&nbsp; under the facts&nbsp; of this case, the accused&nbsp; cannot be held liable; <br><br>"2. That the trial court erred in not ruling that even if attempted violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Circular&nbsp; 21&nbsp; is&nbsp; punishable, still the&nbsp; accused is not criminally liable&nbsp; because&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; wilful&nbsp; violation&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; said circular;<br><br>"3. That the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; erred in ruling that mere possession&nbsp; of gold is made illegal by Circular 21 of the Central Bank, the&nbsp; truth being&nbsp; that the said circular in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; specifically authorizes&nbsp; sales&nbsp; of gold within the Philippines even without the&nbsp; benefit of license;<br><br>"4. That the trial court erred in not ruling that&nbsp; Circular 21 of the Central Bank is&nbsp; not a valid penal law, because&nbsp; it did not comply with the provisions of section 74&nbsp; of Republic Act 265, in that:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; It was not approved by the President of the Philippines;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; In its&nbsp; promulgation, the&nbsp; Monetary Board&nbsp; exceeded&nbsp; the authority granted it by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Central Bank Act, because the context of the circular does not indicate that&nbsp; it was a temporary emergency measure;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; It&nbsp; can only&nbsp; be issued&nbsp; as&nbsp; an emergency measure or during crisis, and as issued, has no force and effect, because the emergency it seeks to remedy never existed or no longer exists;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; That the publications of the circular&nbsp; (original and amended) in the November i951 and October 1952 issues of the Official Gazette are not the adequate publications required by law, because said publications oh their faces showed them to be incomplete and defective;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)&nbsp; That granting, without&nbsp; admitting, that the power to promulgate it was granted to the Monetary Board by Republic Act 265, and granting without admitting, that the power to so promulgate was validly exercised, still it is invalid because&nbsp; it constitutes an invalid delegation of&nbsp; legislative power and, therefore, unconstitutional and void.<br></div><br>"5. That the trial court erred in ordering forfeiture of the four (4) packages&nbsp; of gold, Exhibits G-l, G-2, G-3 and G-4, in&nbsp; favor of the Government.<br><br>"6. That&nbsp; the trial court erred in ordering the forfeiture of the travellers' check for $100, Exhibit K, in favor of the Government, in spite of the fact that the accused was acquitted on the charge&nbsp; of illegal possession of dollars under Circulars 20 and 42."<br></blockquote>Appellant does&nbsp; not deny that he had no license to export the gold&nbsp; bullions&nbsp; above referred to.&nbsp; Under his first assignment&nbsp; of error, he maintains,&nbsp; however, that&nbsp; Central Bank Circular No. 21&nbsp; requiring said license and&nbsp; section&nbsp; 34 of Republic Act No. 265, prescribing the penalty for violations of said Circular,&nbsp; refer to consummated exportation, not to "attempted or frustrated exportation."&nbsp; Section 4 of said Circular provides:<br><blockquote>"Any person desiring to export gold in any form,&nbsp; including jewelry, whether for&nbsp; refining abroad or otherwise, must&nbsp; obtain a license from the Central Bank. Applicants for export licenses must present satisfactory evidence that the import of the gold into the country of the importer will not be in&nbsp; violation of the rules&nbsp; and regulations of such country."<br></blockquote>This section explicitly applies to "any&nbsp; person <i>desiring to&nbsp; export </i> gold" and,&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; it contemplates&nbsp; the situation existing prior to the consummation of the exportation.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; its purpose would be defeated if the penal sanction were&nbsp; deferred until after&nbsp; the article&nbsp; in question had&nbsp; left the Philippines, for jurisdiction over it, and over, the guilty party, would be lost thereby.<br><br>Appellant's avowed ignorance of the necessity of license and of the illegality&nbsp; of the act performed by him,&nbsp; alleged in support of the second assignment of error, is belied by the fact that he had&nbsp; the gold bullions under his shirt; that by objecting, at first, to being searched, he tried to prevent that the presence of said articles upon his person&nbsp; be discovered ; and that he tried to bribe the public officers who searched him.<br><br>As regards the third assignment of error, it is not necessary for us to determine whether mere possession of gold bullions is illegal under Circular No. 21, for his conviction was due, not to such possession alone, but to the fact that appellant <i>tried to export</i> said gold bullions without&nbsp; the requisite license.<br><br>Let us now consider the fourth assignment of error which is based upon several grounds. The first is that the aforementioned circular has not&nbsp; merited the approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the President of the Philippines,' which is required in&nbsp; section 74 of Republic Act No. 265.&nbsp;&nbsp; This pretense&nbsp; is untenable. It would appear from Exhibits S&nbsp; and S-l that the practice of the Monetary Board was to obtain said approval before the formal enactment and promulgation of circulars necessitating presidential&nbsp; sanction.&nbsp; Indeed, since it&nbsp; has no authority to subject transactions in&nbsp; gold to license, unless the President agrees&nbsp; thereto, it&nbsp; is, in effect, the duty of the Board to obtain the&nbsp; assent of the Executive to the policy of requiring said&nbsp; license&nbsp; at&nbsp; a particular time, either upon adoption of the resolution to this effect,&nbsp; or prior thereto. As&nbsp; a consequence, it must&nbsp; be presumed—in the absence of proof to the contrary, which is wanting—that such duty has been fulfilled&nbsp; in the case at bar.<br><blockquote>"It is frequently said that a presumption of regularity attends the performance of administrative duties.&nbsp; That is, when an act has been completed,&nbsp; it is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; act was done in the manner prescribed and by an&nbsp; officer authorized&nbsp; by law&nbsp; to&nbsp; do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presumption is of course a rebuttable one, but the bare allegation that there has been&nbsp; a failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; observe&nbsp; statutory requirements has been regarded as a mere conclusion of the pleader; where the administrative&nbsp; order&nbsp; is&nbsp; accompanied by&nbsp; a&nbsp; statement&nbsp; that there has been compliance and there is no showing of fact to the&nbsp; contrary,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the presumption of regularity is ordinarily sufficient to support the official act of a public . officer."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Administrative Law—Cases&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Comments by Gellhorn, pp. 315-316.)<br></blockquote>Contrary to appellant's pretense, it is not&nbsp; essential that the administrative acts of the President be made in writing, unless the law says&nbsp; so.&nbsp; Thus, for&nbsp; instance, in Ykalina <i>vs.</i> Oricio,&nbsp;&nbsp; (93 Phil.,&nbsp; 1076;&nbsp; 49&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; [12], 5431),&nbsp; this Court quoted&nbsp; approvingly the following passage from <i>Corpus Juris Secundum:</i><br><blockquote>"While the appointment of an officer is usually&nbsp; evidenced by a commission,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a general rule&nbsp; it is not&nbsp; essential&nbsp; to&nbsp; the validity of an appointment that a commission issue, and an appointment may he made by&nbsp; an oral&nbsp; announcement of his determination by&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; : appointing power."<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; U.S. <i>vs.</i> Fletcher&nbsp; (148&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; 84,&nbsp; 89-90, 37 Law Ed. 378,&nbsp; 379-380), the Federal Supreme&nbsp; Court said:<br><blockquote>"The presumption is that the Secretary and the President performed the duties devolved upon&nbsp; them respectively, and it&nbsp; would be unreasonable&nbsp; to construe the Secretary's&nbsp; indorsement&nbsp; as&nbsp; meaning that he had reviewed&nbsp; the proceedings for the action of the President in conformity with Article 65, and had approved them himself and ordered&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; the sentence in&nbsp; contravention of the article. * * * While in&nbsp; the case on hand it is not said that&nbsp; the proceedings were submitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the President, it is&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; they had been forwarded to the Secretary of War for the action of the President, and as that is&nbsp; followed by&nbsp; an&nbsp; approval and the direction of&nbsp; the execution of the sentence, which approval and sentence could only, emanate from the President, the conclusion follows&nbsp; that the action taken&nbsp; was the action of the President.<br><br>"We regard the&nbsp; certification of the Secretary&nbsp; of War&nbsp; * * * as perceive&nbsp; no&nbsp; ground upon which&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of that date can be a&nbsp; sufficient certification of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; President, and treated as null&nbsp; and void for want of the required approval."<br></blockquote>What is&nbsp; more, in Villena <i>vs.</i> Secretary of the Interior (67 Phil., 451, 463), the majority of the members&nbsp; of this Court expressed the view that:<br><blockquote>"After serious reflection, we have (decided to sustain the contention of the&nbsp; government in this case on the&nbsp; broad proposition, albeit&nbsp; not suggested, that&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> under the presidential type&nbsp; of government&nbsp; which we&nbsp; have adopted and considering the departmental&nbsp; organization established and continued in force by paragraph 19 section 21 Article VII, of our Constitution, all executive&nbsp; and administrative organizations are adjuncts of the Executive Department,&nbsp; the heads of&nbsp; the various executive departments a/re assistants and agents of the Chief Executive, and, except in cases where the Chief Executive is&nbsp; required by the Constitution or the law to act in person or the exigencies of the situation demand that he act personally, the multifarious executive and administrative functions of the Chief Executive, presumptively the acts of the&nbsp; Chief Executive.</span> (Runkle <i>vs.</i> United&nbsp; States [1887], 122 U.S. 543; 30 Law ed.&nbsp; 1167; 7 Sup. Ct.&nbsp; Rep. 1141;&nbsp; see also U.S. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Eliason [1839], 16 Pet. 291; 10 Law ed. 968; Pones <i>vs.</i> U.S. [1890], 137 U.S. 202; 34 Law&nbsp; ed.&nbsp; 691; 11 Supp. Ct. Rep. 80; Wolsey&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Chapman&nbsp; [1880] 101 U. S.&nbsp; 755;&nbsp; 25 Law&nbsp; ed. 916; Wilcox <i>vs.</i> Jackson [1836], 13 Pet. 498; 10 Law ed.&nbsp; 264.)"<br></blockquote>Needless to&nbsp; say, the cases cited&nbsp; by&nbsp; appellant herein&nbsp; refer to&nbsp; the&nbsp; presidential approval of legislative&nbsp; enactments, which the&nbsp; Constitution <i>explicitly</i>&nbsp; requires to&nbsp; be evidenced by the <i>signature</i> of the Executive&nbsp; (Art. VI, section 20 [1]) There is no similar provision in Republic Act No.&nbsp; 265.<br><br>It is urged, however, that the authority of the Monetary Board to suspend or restrict the&nbsp; sales of exchange by the Central Bank and to subject all transactions&nbsp; involving foreign exchange to license, is temporary in nature and may be exercised only during an exchange&nbsp; crisis, as an emergency measure to combat such crisis, and that the context of the circular in&nbsp; question, as amended, does not&nbsp; indicate that it&nbsp; was a temporary&nbsp; emergency measure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; not necessary,&nbsp; however, for the legality of said&nbsp; circular that its temporary character be <i>stated on its face,</i> so&nbsp; long as the circular has&nbsp; been issued during&nbsp; an&nbsp; exchange crisis, for the purpose of combating the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; absence of evidence to the contrary, which has not been&nbsp; introduced or offered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; presumed that&nbsp; the provision&nbsp; of section 74&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 265, under the authority of which&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; circular was issued, has authority of which the aforementioned circular was issued, has been complied with.&nbsp; Besides, the fact that there has been an exchange crisis in the Philippines and that such crisis, not only existed at the time of the issuance of said circular in 1949 and 1950, but, also, has&nbsp; remained in&nbsp; existence up to the present, may be taken judicial cognizance of. <br><br>Although, from a purely theoretical and legal viewpoint, the Monetary Board and the President could have specified in Circular 21 the period of&nbsp; its effectivity, their failure to do&nbsp; so&nbsp; did not necessarily impair its validity.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a measure taken under the police power of the state, said period had to&nbsp; be commensurate with the crisis that led to its adoption, and the duration of said crisis&nbsp; could not be anticipated with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Upon the termination&nbsp; of the aforementioned crisis, as determined&nbsp; by competent authority, the circular would become inoperative. Thus, in Rutter&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Esteban,&nbsp; (49 Off. Gaz., 1807), Commercial Investment <i>vs.</i> Garcia (49 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 1801), Salvador <i>vs.</i> Locsin, (93 Phil., 225),&nbsp; and Nicolas <i>vs.</i> Matias, L-5250 (May 29, 1953), we held that, although the moratorium laws enacted in the Philippines, upon its liberation from the&nbsp; Japanese forces, could not be permanent in character and did not specify the duration thereof, it was Valid and effective <i>until</i> the emergency for which it was intended had already disappeared.<br><br>It is further&nbsp; argued&nbsp; that,&nbsp; as&nbsp; published in&nbsp; the Official Gazette, Circular No. 21, in its original, as well as in its amended&nbsp; form, did not bear the approval of the President and that, accordingly, said publication was not sufficient to give the effect contemplated by law therefore.&nbsp;&nbsp; This pretence is based upon&nbsp; false promise.&nbsp; The original circular subjecting to licensing by the Central Bank "all transactions in gold and foreign exchange", is Circular No. 20, which, as approved and published, states, that, "pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 265',, it&nbsp; had been adopted by "the Monetary Board, by unanimous vote and <i>with the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the President of the Philippines"</i> What is more, the last paragraph of Circular No. 20, provides that "further regulations&nbsp; in respect to transactions covered by this circular will be&nbsp; issued separately."&nbsp; Thus, the President had approved not only the "licensing by the Central Bank"&nbsp; of "all transactions&nbsp; in&nbsp; gold and&nbsp; foreign exchange," but, also,&nbsp; the issuance,&nbsp; subsequently&nbsp; to&nbsp; the promulgation of Circular No. 20, of "further regulations in respect" of such transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said further regulations were incorporated into Circular No.&nbsp; 21, which thus bears the&nbsp; stamp of&nbsp; presidential sanction,&nbsp; although <i>this is not specifically required by law</i>.&nbsp; It is only the decision of the Monetary Board to <i>subject to license </i>by the Central Bank all transactions in gold and&nbsp; foreign exchange&nbsp; that&nbsp; needs the approval&nbsp; of the President.&nbsp; Once the same has been given, the&nbsp; details in the implementation of said decision may be determined by said Board, through such&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; as may be promulgated from time to time.&nbsp; The assent of the President is not a prerequisite to the validity and effectivity of these regulations, as distinguished from the aforementioned decision thereby sought to be enforced or executed. The authority of the Monetary Board to make regulations is governed, not&nbsp; by section&nbsp; 74 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 265, but by section 14 thereof, in the language of which:<br><blockquote>"In order to exercise the authority granted to it under this Act the&nbsp; Monetary Board&nbsp; shall:<br><br>(a) Prepare and issue such rules&nbsp; and regulations as it&nbsp; considers necessary&nbsp; for the effective discharge of the&nbsp; responsibilities and exercise of the power assigned to the Monetary Board and to the Central Bank under this Act."<br></blockquote>Lastly, the legality of Circular No. 21 is assailed upon the ground that the grant of authority to&nbsp; issue the same constitutes an undue delegation&nbsp; of legislative power.&nbsp; It is true that, under our system of government, said power may not be delegated except to local&nbsp; governments.&nbsp; However, one thing is to&nbsp; delegate the&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; what the law shall be, and another thing to delegate the authority to fix the details in&nbsp; the <i>execution or enforcement of a</i> policy set out in the law itself.&nbsp; Briefly stated, the rule is that the delegated powers fall&nbsp; under the&nbsp; second category, if the law authorizing the delegation furnishes a reasonable standard which "sufficiently marks the field within&nbsp; which the Administrator is to act so that it may be known whether he has kept within it in compliance with the legislative will." (Yakus&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> United States, 88&nbsp; L. ed. 848.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to the case&nbsp; at bar, section&nbsp; 74 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 265 conferred upon the&nbsp; Monetary Board&nbsp; and the President the power to subject&nbsp; to licensing all transactions in gold and foreign&nbsp; exchange&nbsp; "in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to protect the international reserve&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Central&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; during an exchange crisis and to give the Monetary Board and the Government time in which to take constructive measures&nbsp; to combat such crisis."&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board is, likewise, authorized "to take such appropriate remedial measures&nbsp; as are appropriate" to protect the international&nbsp; stability&nbsp; of the peso,&nbsp; "whenever the international reserve is falling, as a result&nbsp; of payment or remittances abroad which, in the opinion of the&nbsp; Monetary Board,&nbsp; are contrary to the national welfare" (section 70, Rep.&nbsp; Act No. 265).&nbsp; It should&nbsp; be noted, furthermore, that these power must be&nbsp; construed and&nbsp; exercised in relation to the&nbsp; objectives of the law&nbsp; creating&nbsp; the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank, which are;&nbsp; among others, "to maintain monetary stability in the&nbsp; Philippines,"&nbsp; and "to&nbsp; promote a rising level of production, employment and real income in the Philippines." (Section 2, Rep. Act No. 265.)&nbsp;&nbsp; These standards are sufficiently&nbsp; concrete and definite to vest&nbsp; in the delegated authority the character&nbsp; of <i>administrative details</i>&nbsp; in the enforcement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law and to place the&nbsp; grant of said authority beyond&nbsp; the category of a delegation of legislative powers&nbsp; (Cardona <i>vs.</i> Municipality of Binangonan, 36 Phil,. 547; Compañia General&nbsp; de&nbsp; Tabacos <i>vs.</i> Board&nbsp; of Utility, 34, Phil., 136; Rubi"<i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Board of Mindoro, 39 Phil., 660; Alegre <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Collector of Customs, 53 Phil., 394;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Rosenthal, 63 Phil.,&nbsp; 328; Antamok Gold Fields <i>vs.</i> C.I.R., 68 Phil., 340; Calalang <i>vs.</i>. Williams, 70 Phil., 276; Cervantes <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Auditor General, 91&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 359;&nbsp; Phil., Association of Colleges &amp; Universities <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Sec. of Education, 97 Phil., 806; 51 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; (12), 6230;&nbsp; Mutual Films Corp. <i>vs.</i> industrial&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; 276&nbsp; U.S. 230;&nbsp; Muliord&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Smith, 30/ U.S.&nbsp; 48; National Broadcasting&nbsp; Co. <i>vs.</i> U.S. 319 U.S. 225; Yakus&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> White, 321&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; 414; Ammann <i>vs.</i> Maiionee, 332 U.S. 245).<br><br>Under the fifth assignment of error, appellant maintains that Article 45 of the revised Penal code authorizing the forfeiture of the proceeds of a crime&nbsp; and the instruments or tools with which it was committed, does not apply to the case at bar,&nbsp; the crime involved herein being covered by a special law.&nbsp; However, pursuant to section 10 of the Revised Penal Code, the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of said Code shall be "supplementary" to special laws, "unless the latter should specifically&nbsp; provide the&nbsp; contrary", and there is no such provision to the contrary in Republic Act No. 265 (U.S. <i>vs.</i> Parrone, 24 Phil., 29; People <i>vs.</i> Moreno,&nbsp; 60 Phil., 712; People <i>vs.</i> Ramayo, 61 Phil., 225; Copiaco <i>vs.</i> Luzon Brokerage, 66 Phil., 184).<br><br>The last assignment of error refers to the propriety of the order of confiscation of the traveller's check for P100, the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; having&nbsp; found&nbsp; that the accused had&nbsp; no knowledge of the fact that it was in his physical possession, and that therefore, he had no criminal intent in connection therewith.&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel that this point is well taken, and that, accordingly, said travellers' check should not be forfeited to the Government.<br><br>With this modification, the decision, appealed from should be, as it&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, in all other&nbsp; respects,&nbsp; with costs against the defendant-appellant.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><br><i>Paras, C.
