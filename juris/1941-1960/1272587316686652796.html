				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari and&nbsp; prohibition with preliminary&nbsp; injunction seeking to nullify all&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings had before respondent Judge in Civil Case No. 26169 of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; particularly that which refers to the order issued by him on&nbsp; May 10, 1955, enjoining the Philippine&nbsp; Association of Free Labor Unions&nbsp; (PAFLU), its members, associates, or agents to cease and desist from picketing the properties of&nbsp; respondent REMA, Incorporated, as well as molesting, transferring or preventing the&nbsp; public from&nbsp; entering the Republic and Majestic theaters leased and operated by said respondent. In&nbsp; due course, this Court issued the writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction prayed for upon&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; by petitioners of a bond of P500.<p>On May 9, 1955, REMA,&nbsp; Incorporated&nbsp; filed an action for damages&nbsp; with preliminary injunction against petitioners in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; alleging, among other things, that the "plaintiff is the leasee and operator of&nbsp; the "Republic"&nbsp; and 'Majestic" Theaters doing business at Florentino Torres Street, Manila,&nbsp; which establishments were leased by the plaintiff on April 27th, 1955 from the Goodwill Trading&nbsp; Co., Inc., who on the&nbsp; same date acquired the said theaters by way of purchase from the L. C.&nbsp; Eugenio and Co., Inc., the former owner";&nbsp; that "the members of the defendant labor union,&nbsp; PAFLU and the other defendants&nbsp; who&nbsp; are mostly&nbsp; members of the defendant labor union, PAFLU, were formerly employed with&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned theaters&nbsp; when the&nbsp; latter were still&nbsp; under the ownership, operation and management of the former owner, L.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Eugenio and Co., Inc., but who ceased to be&nbsp; such&nbsp; employees since&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of the said theaters&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1955, to the Goodwill&nbsp; Trading Co., Inc.,&nbsp; and their&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; lease&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff on the same date"; and that&nbsp; "the&nbsp; plaintiff and the defendants have&nbsp; no&nbsp; employer-employee relation&nbsp; because the&nbsp; latter are not in any manner the employees or laborers of the plaintiff&nbsp; and as such they have no labor dispute between them."</p><p>The court,&nbsp; presided over by&nbsp; Hon. Bienvenido A.&nbsp; Tan, set for hearing the petition for injunction&nbsp; requiring defendants&nbsp; (now petitioners)&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear on May&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1955 to&nbsp; show&nbsp; cause&nbsp; why the writ&nbsp; should not&nbsp; be issued as prayed for in the complaint.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of hearing, defendants assailed&nbsp; the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court on the ground that, it involving a labor&nbsp; dispute or an employer-employee relation, the sole power to determine the&nbsp; issue is the Court of Industrial Relations as provided for in Republic&nbsp; Act N6. 875.&nbsp; After the case has&nbsp; been&nbsp; argued orally by counsel of both parties, but without receiving any evidence&nbsp; in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of the factual allegations&nbsp; of the petition,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge declared himself&nbsp; with&nbsp; jurisdiction to act and in effect issued&nbsp; on May 10, 1955 an order granting the&nbsp; writ of injunction&nbsp; upon plaintiff's filing a bond in the amount of P500.&nbsp; Hence the present petition&nbsp; for certiorari.</p><p>The first issue&nbsp; to&nbsp; be determined is whether the&nbsp; main case&nbsp; involves a&nbsp; labor dispute&nbsp; or an&nbsp; employer-employee relation.&nbsp; This needs a brief statement of the facts which led to the institution of the main case in the lower court.</p><p>On September 11, 1954,&nbsp; a collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into by and between&nbsp; the Republic Theater&nbsp; Enterprises and the Majestic Theater, Inc. on one hand and the Majestic and&nbsp; Republic Theaters Employees Association on the other.&nbsp; This agreement was to run for a period of&nbsp; two&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Because of the failure of the theater enterprises to&nbsp; comply with&nbsp; some terms of the agreement,&nbsp; the employees&nbsp; of the association&nbsp; went&nbsp; on strike on January 2, 1955.&nbsp; In consideration of the return of the strikers to work, the collective bargaining contract was modified and a new one entered into also for a term of two years on February 16, 1955.&nbsp; This new agreement was signed by the Philippine Association of&nbsp; Free Labor Unions (PAFLU), with which the employees association had affiliated after the conclusion of the original collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; Among the pertinent provisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement, as&nbsp; amended,&nbsp; were&nbsp; that&nbsp; during the period of its&nbsp; life the&nbsp; association or&nbsp; any laborer or employee shall not declare a strike,&nbsp; nor engage in picketing, while the management of&nbsp; the theaters in return "shall not lockout their&nbsp; employees."&nbsp; The&nbsp; revised&nbsp; agreement also included rigid&nbsp; clauses in the payment of overtime pay, night differential pay and a provision for the examination of the books of the theaters on June 30, 1955.</p><p>On March 31, 1955, the two theaters, Republic&nbsp; and Majestic, with all their&nbsp; assets and&nbsp; improvements thereunto appertaining, were sold,by the owner L. C. Eugenio and Co., Inc. to Goodwill Trading Co., Inc., which was later supplemented by another agreement executed by the same parties&nbsp; on&nbsp; April 26, 1955.&nbsp; On the same date, April 26, 1955, a contract of lease&nbsp; concerning the operation of the two&nbsp; theaters was&nbsp; executed by Goodwill Trading&nbsp; Co., Inc. in favor of&nbsp; the REMA, Incorporated, and on April&nbsp; 27, 1955, the latter corporation, as leasee and operator of the two theaters, sent&nbsp; a circular letter to&nbsp; all the employees of the former&nbsp; owner&nbsp; requiring them to apply for employment with the new management in a form&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; prepared for the purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 8,&nbsp; 1955, the employees of the association&nbsp; started picketing the premises&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the two theaters with&nbsp; the help of the members of the Philippine Association&nbsp; of&nbsp; Free Labor Unions (PAFLU), for which reason the&nbsp; REMA, Incorporated&nbsp; filed&nbsp; the present action for damages with preliminary injunction in the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; And on May 20, 1955, a complaint for unfair labor practice was filed before the Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations by&nbsp; the Majestic&nbsp; and&nbsp; Republic Theaters Employees Association against its employers, the Republic Theater Enterprises and&nbsp; the Majestic Theater, Inc., alleging among other grounds,&nbsp; that the latter committed a&nbsp; breach of the collective&nbsp; bargaining agreement concluded between them.</p><p>It is contended by respondents that there is no relation of&nbsp; employer&nbsp; and employee&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; REMA, Incorporated and the Republic and Majestic Theaters Employees Association for&nbsp; the reason&nbsp; that the two&nbsp; theaters had already been sold by their original owner&nbsp; and the vendee had in&nbsp; turn leased&nbsp; them&nbsp; to REMA,&nbsp; Incorporated which has no contractual relation whatsoever with the members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; association.&nbsp;&nbsp; There being&nbsp; no&nbsp; employer-employee relation, they contend, there is no labor dispute and consequently the lower court had jurisdiction to entertain the case.&nbsp; This claim is disputed&nbsp; by petitioners.</p><p>There is no&nbsp; merit in this claim of respondents.&nbsp; While it is true that the employees of the petitioning association do not have an actual contract of employment with REMA, Incorporated and&nbsp; were actually employed by the former&nbsp; owner of the&nbsp; two theaters&nbsp; with whom&nbsp; they had concluded&nbsp; a&nbsp; collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact however remains that these employees do&nbsp; not admit, and in fact dispute, the genuineness and validity of the alleged transfer and for&nbsp; that reason they still consider themselves as employees of the two theaters in contemplation of law. It is their stand&nbsp; that the alleged transfer is fictitious and was merely resorted to by the former, owner as&nbsp; a ruse to evade its&nbsp; liability under&nbsp; the collective bargaining agreement because of&nbsp; some provisions contained therein which in its opinion&nbsp; were detrimental to&nbsp; its interests although highly beneficial&nbsp; to the interests of the employees.&nbsp; There is therefore the vital issue concerning the genuineness and validity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale involved in the main case which&nbsp; in the light&nbsp; of the spirit&nbsp; of our labor legislation is deemed a labor dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it&nbsp; was held that "The disputants need not&nbsp; stand&nbsp; in relation&nbsp; of employer and employee for case to involve a 'labor dispute' within Norris La Guardia Act regulating issuance of restraining order or injunction in&nbsp; cases&nbsp; involving&nbsp; labor&nbsp; disputes"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Green,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Obergfell, et al., 121 F 2d.,&nbsp; 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>.&nbsp; While, under&nbsp; our own Industrial Peace Act,&nbsp; the&nbsp; term "labor dispute" includes any controversy concerning terms, tenure, or conditions of&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; "<em>regardless&nbsp; of whether&nbsp; the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.</em>" [Section 2, (<em>j</em>), Republic Act No. 875].&nbsp; In our opinion, considering the equities involved, the relation of petitioner to respondent comes within the purview of this definition.</p><p>The next issue that arises&nbsp; is: It&nbsp; appearing that the main case&nbsp; involves&nbsp; a&nbsp; labor dispute,&nbsp; does it&nbsp; come&nbsp; under the jurisdiction of an ordinary court of justice or should it be left entirely to the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations. This&nbsp; involves a little digression on the scope&nbsp; and extent of&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations which is&nbsp; now&nbsp; conferred upon it by the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act.<br>&nbsp; <br>It should be noted that prior to the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of the Industrial Peace Act (Republic Act No. 875), the law that governed&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations over cases involving labor disputes is Commonwealth Act 103.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Act gave&nbsp; to that court broad powers of compulsory arbitration on&nbsp; any&nbsp; matter involving a labor dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, that Act gave that court "jurisdiction over the entire&nbsp; Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide and settle all questions, matters, controversies,&nbsp; or disputes arising between, and/or affecting employers and employees or&nbsp; laborers, and landlords&nbsp; and&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; or farm-laborers, and regulate the relations between them" (section 1).&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, that&nbsp; court&nbsp; could&nbsp; take cognizance&nbsp; "of&nbsp; any industrial&nbsp; or&nbsp; agricultural dispute&nbsp; causing or&nbsp; likely to cause&nbsp; a strike or&nbsp; lockout" with the only limitation that the employees, laborers or&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; that may bring the matter to&nbsp; court exceed thirty in&nbsp; number&nbsp; (section 4). And,&nbsp; commenting&nbsp; on these broad powers given by Commonwealth Act No. 103 to the Court of Industrial Relations, this Court said:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"Resulta evidente de las&nbsp; disposiciones transcritas lo&nbsp; siguiente: (<em>a</em>) que cuando surge una disputa entre el principal&nbsp; y&nbsp; el empleado&nbsp; u obrero, vgr.&nbsp; sobre cuestion&nbsp; de salarios, la Corte de Relaciones&nbsp; Industriales tiene jurisdiccidn en todo el territorio de Filipinas&nbsp; para considerar, investigar y resolver dicha disputa, fijando" los&nbsp; salarios que estime justos y razonables;&nbsp; (<em>b</em>) que para los efectos&nbsp; de&nbsp; prevenci6n,&nbsp; arbitraje, decision y arreglo, el mismo Tribunal de Relaciones&nbsp; Industriales tiene igualmente jurisdiccion para conocer&nbsp; de cualqier disputa—industrial&nbsp; o agricola—resultante&nbsp; de cualesquier diferencias respecto de los&nbsp; salarios,&nbsp; participaciones o compensaciones, horas de trabajo,&nbsp; condiciones&nbsp;&nbsp; del&nbsp; empleo&nbsp; o&nbsp; de&nbsp; la aparceria&nbsp; entre los patrones y los empleados&nbsp; u obreros y entre los propietarios y los terratenientes&nbsp; u&nbsp; obreros&nbsp; agricolas&nbsp; previo&nbsp; el «umplimiento de ciertos requisites y condiciones, cuando se viere que dicha disputa&nbsp; ocasiona o puede ocasioner una huelga; (<em>c</em>)&nbsp; que en&nbsp; el ejercicio de&nbsp; sus facultades arriba&nbsp; especificadas, el Tribunal de Relaciones&nbsp; Industriales no queda limitado, al decidir la disputa, a conceder el&nbsp; remedio o&nbsp; remedios&nbsp; solicitados por las partes en la controversia, sino que puede incluir en la orden o&nbsp; decision cualquier materia o determinacion&nbsp; para el proposito de arreglar la&nbsp; disputa . o de&nbsp; prevenir ulteriores&nbsp; controversias&nbsp; industriales&nbsp; o agricolas." (The&nbsp; Shell&nbsp; Company of Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; Limited <em>vs.</em> National Labor&nbsp; Union,&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-1309, decided July 26, 1948)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><p>But&nbsp; this&nbsp; broad&nbsp; jurisdiction was&nbsp; somewhat&nbsp; curtailed ..upon the approval of Republic Act No. 875, the purpose being to limit it to certain specific cases, leaving the rest to the regular courts.&nbsp; Thus, as the law now&nbsp; stands, that power is confined&nbsp; to&nbsp; the following cases:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; when the labor dispute affects an industry which is indispensable to the national interest and is so certified by the President to the industrial court (Section 10, Republic Act No. 875);&nbsp; (2) when the controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (3) when it involves hours of employment under the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act No. 444);&nbsp; and (4) when it involves&nbsp; and unfair labor practice [section 5, (<em>a</em>), Republic Act No. 875].&nbsp;&nbsp; In all other cases, even if they grow out of a labor dispute, the Court of Industrial Relations does&nbsp; not have jurisdiction, the intendment&nbsp; of the law&nbsp; being&nbsp; "to prevent undue restriction&nbsp; of free&nbsp; enterprise for&nbsp; capital and labor and to encourage&nbsp; the truly democratic method of&nbsp; regulating&nbsp; the&nbsp; relations between the&nbsp; employer and employee&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of an agreement freely entered into in collective bargaining" (section 7, Republic Act No. 875): In&nbsp; other words, the policy of the law is to advance&nbsp; the settlement&nbsp; of disputes between&nbsp; the employers and&nbsp; the employees through collective bargaining, recognizing "that real industrial peace cannot be achieved by compulsion of law" [See section (<em>c</em>), in relation to section 20, (Idem.)].</p><p>It therefore appears that with the exception of the four cases above&nbsp; specified&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction&nbsp; even&nbsp; if&nbsp; it involves a&nbsp; labor&nbsp; dispute. And as the issue involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; instant&nbsp; case&nbsp; does&nbsp; not fall under, nor refer to, any of those specified cases, it follows that the lower court has&nbsp; jurisdiction to entertain the same.</p><p>The&nbsp; remaining issue is:&nbsp; Can the lower court grant an injunction&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; the&nbsp; picketing of the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; of respondent by the members of the&nbsp; petitioning association?&nbsp; If so, has respondent judge issued the relief in accordance with law?</p><p>The&nbsp; pertinent&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; concerning the issuance of injunctions in&nbsp; labor disputes are those embodied in sections 9&nbsp; and&nbsp; 10 of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875.&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing the provisions of these&nbsp; two sections, we find&nbsp; that there are two groups&nbsp; of activities that&nbsp; may be reckoned&nbsp; with in connection&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; injunction,&nbsp; one? as to which&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; is prohibited even&nbsp; if&nbsp; they&nbsp; involve or grow out of a labor dispute, and another as to which injunction&nbsp; may be&nbsp; issued under certain&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; For ready reference,&nbsp; we will&nbsp; quote the&nbsp; pertinent&nbsp; provisions of these section.</p><blockquote><p>As to the first group, section 9(<em>a</em>) provides:</p><p>"(<em>a</em>) No Court, Commission or Board of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; shall have jurisdiction&nbsp; except as provided in&nbsp; section ten of this Act to issue any restraining order, temporary or permanent&nbsp; injunction in any case involving or growing out of labor dispute to prohibit any person or persons participating or interested in such&nbsp; dispute from doing, whether singly or in concert, any of the following acts:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(1)&nbsp; Ceasing or refusing to perform&nbsp; any work&nbsp; or to remain in any relation of employment;</p><p>(2) Becoming&nbsp; or remaining a member of&nbsp; any&nbsp; labor organization&nbsp; or&nbsp; of&nbsp; any&nbsp; employee organization&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of any undertaking or promise&nbsp; as is described in section&nbsp; eight of this Act; <br></p><p>(3)&nbsp; Paying or&nbsp; giving. to, or&nbsp; withholding,&nbsp; from any person participating or interested in such labor dispute, any&nbsp; strike or unemployment benefits or insurance, or&nbsp; moneys&nbsp; or&nbsp; things of value;</p><p>(4)&nbsp; By all lawful means aiding any person participating or interested in&nbsp; any labor dispute&nbsp; who is&nbsp; being&nbsp; proceeded against in,&nbsp; or&nbsp; is prosecuting&nbsp; any action or&nbsp; suit in&nbsp; any&nbsp; court of the Philippines;</p><p>(5)&nbsp; Giving publicity&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the facts involved in&nbsp; any labor dispute, whether by&nbsp; advertising, speaking, patrolling,&nbsp; or,by any method not involving fraud or&nbsp; violence;</p><p>(6)&nbsp; Assembling&nbsp; peaceably to&nbsp; act or to organize to act in promotion of their interests in&nbsp; a labor dispute;</p><p>(7)&nbsp; Advising or notifying any person of an intention&nbsp; to do any&nbsp; of the acts&nbsp; heretofore specified;</p><p>(8)&nbsp; Agreeing with&nbsp; other persons&nbsp; to&nbsp; do or&nbsp; not to do any of the acts heretofore specified; and</p><p>(9)&nbsp; Advising, urging, or otherwise causing&nbsp; or inducing without fraud or violence, the&nbsp; acts heretofore specified, regardless of any&nbsp; such understanding or&nbsp; promise as is&nbsp; described in section eight of this Act." <br></p></blockquote><p>And as to the second group, section 9(d)&nbsp; and section 10 provide: Sec. 9.</p><p>"(<em>d</em>)&nbsp; No court of the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue a&nbsp; temporary&nbsp; or permanent&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; in&nbsp; any case&nbsp; involving&nbsp; or growing out of&nbsp; a labor dispute,&nbsp; as&nbsp; herein&nbsp; defined&nbsp; except&nbsp; after hearing the testimony of witnesses&nbsp; in open&nbsp; court (with opportunity for cross-examination)&nbsp; in support of the allegations of a complaint made under oath, and&nbsp; testimony in opposition thereto, if offered, and except&nbsp; after finding of fact by the Court, to the effect:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(1) That unlawful&nbsp; acts have been&nbsp; threatened and will&nbsp; be committed unless restrained, or have been&nbsp; committed and will be&nbsp; continued unless restrained, but no&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; or temporary restraining order shall be issued on account&nbsp; of&nbsp; any threat&nbsp; or unlawful&nbsp; act&nbsp; excepting against the&nbsp; person&nbsp; or persons, association, or organization&nbsp; making&nbsp; the&nbsp; threat&nbsp; or committing&nbsp; the unlawful&nbsp; act or actually authorizing&nbsp; or ratifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; same after actual knowledge thereof; <br></p><p>(2)&nbsp; That substantial and irreparable injury to&nbsp; complainant's property will follow;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>(3)&nbsp; That as to&nbsp; each&nbsp; item of relief granted greater injury will be inflicted upon&nbsp; complainant by the denial of relief than will be inflicted&nbsp; upon defendants&nbsp; by the granting of relief; <br></p><p>(4)&nbsp; That complainant&nbsp; has no adequate remedy at&nbsp; law; and <br></p><p>(5)&nbsp; That the public officers charged&nbsp; with the duty to protect complainant's&nbsp; property&nbsp; are unable or&nbsp; unwilling&nbsp; to furnish adequate&nbsp; protection." <br></p></blockquote><p>"Sec. 10.<em> Labor&nbsp; Disputes in&nbsp; Industries&nbsp; Indispensable&nbsp; to the National Interest</em>.—When&nbsp; in the opinion of&nbsp; the&nbsp; President of the Philippines there&nbsp; exists a labor dispute in an&nbsp; industry indispensable to the national interest and&nbsp; when such labor&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; is&nbsp; certified by the President to the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations, said Court may cause to be issued a restraining order forbidding the employees to strike or the employer to&nbsp; lockout the employees,&nbsp; pendingan&nbsp; investigation by the&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; and&nbsp; if no&nbsp; other solution&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; dispute is found, the Court may issue an order fixing the terms and conditions of employment."</p></blockquote><p>From the above-quoted provisions it can be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; that the&nbsp; activities&nbsp; that&nbsp; <em>cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; enjoined</em> are those&nbsp; enumerated in section 9,&nbsp; paragraph a, even if they involve&nbsp; or grow&nbsp; out of a labor dispute.&nbsp; To this&nbsp; we&nbsp; may&nbsp; add&nbsp; the case provided for&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; (<em>b</em>), when there&nbsp; is an unlawful combination or conspiracy on the&nbsp; part of those engaged in the labor dispute in connection&nbsp; with the&nbsp; acts above enumerated.&nbsp;&nbsp; And those that can&nbsp; be enjoined refer to the case certified by the President&nbsp; as&nbsp; affecting national interest and to those enumerated in section 9, paragraph d, particularly when&nbsp; "unlawful acts have been threatened and will be&nbsp; committed unless restrained,&nbsp; or&nbsp; have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; and will be continued unless restrained."&nbsp; Note that, as to the acts that may be enjoined,&nbsp; section 9&nbsp; (<em>d</em>) contains&nbsp; a number of conditions which the&nbsp; court must find to&nbsp; exist before an injunction&nbsp; can&nbsp; be granted&nbsp; and which are&nbsp; considered as limitations&nbsp; on the&nbsp; court's power to grant relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement was&nbsp; held to be&nbsp; jurisdictional such that, if not followed, it may result in the annulment&nbsp; of the proceedings.</p><blockquote><p>"Section 7 declares that no court of the United States shall&nbsp; have jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as herein defined' except after a hearing of a described&nbsp; character, 'and except after findings of fact by the court, to the effect—(<em>a</em>) That unlawful acts have been threatened&nbsp; and will be&nbsp; committed unless&nbsp; restrained&nbsp; or have been committed and will be continued unless restrained' and that no injunction&nbsp; 'shall be issued on account of any threat&nbsp; or unlawful act excepting against&nbsp; the person&nbsp; or persons, association or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or actually&nbsp; authorizing or ratifying the same . . .'&nbsp; By subsections (<em>b</em>)&nbsp; to (<em>c</em>)&nbsp; it is provided that&nbsp; relief&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; be granted unless the&nbsp; court&nbsp; finds that&nbsp; substantial and&nbsp; irreparable&nbsp; injury to&nbsp; complainants'&nbsp; property will&nbsp; follow:&nbsp; that&nbsp; as to each item&nbsp; or&nbsp; relief granted greater injury will be&nbsp; inflicted upon the complainant&nbsp; by denying the&nbsp; relief&nbsp; than will be inflicted upon defendants by granting it; that&nbsp; complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and that the public 'officers&nbsp; charged with the duty to protect, complainants' property are unable or unwilling&nbsp; to&nbsp; provide&nbsp; adequate protection. There can be no question of the power of Congress thus to define and&nbsp; limit the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the inferior courts of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States.<em> The District&nbsp; Court made one&nbsp; of the required findings save as to irreparable injury and lack of remedy at law.&nbsp; It follows that in issuing the injunction U exceeded its jurisdiction</em>."&nbsp; (Lauf <em>vs.</em> E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., Inc., Wis. 1938, 58 S. Ct. 578, 303 U. S., 323, 82 L. Ed., 872.)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>With regard to activities that may be&nbsp; enjoined, in order to&nbsp; ascertain what&nbsp; court has jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue the injunction, it is necessary to determine&nbsp; the nature of the controversy.&nbsp; When the case involves a&nbsp; labor dispute that affects national&nbsp; interest and is certified to&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations, or refers to the Minimum Wage Law or Eight-Hour Labor Law, there is&nbsp; no doubt that it&nbsp; is this court that&nbsp; has jurisdiction&nbsp; over the incident.&nbsp; The same thing may be said when&nbsp; the case involves an unfair labor practice, for under&nbsp; section 5 (<em>a</em>), Republic Act No. 875, the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations is exclusive.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; situation varies with regard to other acts where injunction is permissible&nbsp; because&nbsp; of the ambiguity in the language of the Jaw!&nbsp;&nbsp; Note&nbsp; that the law refers to&nbsp; "no court of the Philippines", which&nbsp; gives the connotation that if not&nbsp; because&nbsp; of the prohibition any court may issue&nbsp; the injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true that the last part of section 9 (<em>d</em>) says "after finding of fact&nbsp; by the Gourt" and, in section 2 (<em>a</em>), in defining the word "court", it says:&nbsp; " 'Court' means the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations * * * unless another Court&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be specified"; but this definition is&nbsp; no&nbsp; authority for us&nbsp; to&nbsp; conclude that only the Court of Industrial Relations can issue injunctions in all&nbsp; cases&nbsp; mentioned. in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 9&nbsp; (<em>d</em>) for, as&nbsp; already adverted to, there are cases which may involve or grow out&nbsp; of a&nbsp; labor dispute which may not necessarily come under its&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp; To hold&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; would&nbsp; be to give to the Court of Industrial Relations jurisdiction over cases which it&nbsp; does not have under the law.&nbsp; We are therefore forced&nbsp; to conclude&nbsp; that that court&nbsp; can only issue injunction&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases that come under&nbsp; its exclusive jurisdiction and in those&nbsp; cases that do not, the power can be exercised by regular courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instant case is one of those that do&nbsp; not come under&nbsp; its jurisdiction.</p><p>We believe however that&nbsp; in&nbsp; order that an injunction may be properly issued the procedure laid down in section 9 (<em>d</em>) of Republic Act 875. should be followed and cannot&nbsp; be granted&nbsp; ex-parte as allowed&nbsp; by Rule 60,&nbsp; section 6, of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The reason is that the case, involving as it does a labor dispute,&nbsp; comes under said section 9&nbsp; (<em>d</em>) of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; That procedure&nbsp; requires that&nbsp; there should be a hearing at which the parties should be given an opportunity to present witnesses&nbsp; in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; of the opposition, if any, with opportunity for cross-examination, and that the other conditions required&nbsp; by said section as prerequisites for the granting of&nbsp; relief&nbsp; must be established and stated in the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court. Unless this procedure is followed, the proceedings would be invalid and of no&nbsp; effect.

I also agree that the&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; courts of the Philippines may issue&nbsp; restraining orders or temporary or permanent injunctions, under the conditions outlined in Section 9 (<em>d</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of said act.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I disagree in so far&nbsp; as the majority opinion holds that the Court of Industrial Relations (C. I. R.) may not issue writs of injunction in cases involving labor disputes, except&nbsp; when said cases fall under its exclusive jurisdiction,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as&nbsp; cases&nbsp; involving&nbsp; unfair labor practice and cases certified to&nbsp; it&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chief Executive under section 10 of Republic Hct No. 875.&nbsp; The reason for this disagreement is that the phrase "no court of the Philippines" mentioned in section 9, paragraph&nbsp; (<em>d</em>), in&nbsp; the absence of any distinction&nbsp; or qualification, must include the C.&nbsp; I. R.; naturally, the C. I. R. may also issue writs of injunction in cases involving or growing&nbsp; out of a labor dispute, when warranted by section 9, paragraphs (<em>d</em>) and (<em>f</em>).</p><p>When section 9 (<em>d</em>) says that <em>no court of the Philippines </em>shall&nbsp; have jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; issue&nbsp; a temporary or permanent injunction&nbsp; in&nbsp; any case involving&nbsp; or&nbsp; growing out of labor dispute, except after&nbsp; hearing the testimony of the witnesses in open&nbsp; court, and except after making certain findings of fact required by this section,&nbsp; to me it is clear that when these conditions&nbsp; are complied with and fulfilled, the courts of the Philippines empowered&nbsp; by the Judiciary&nbsp; Act of 1948 to issue writs of injunction, have jurisdiction to issue.said writs in cases involving labor disputes.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of the law&nbsp; (Republic&nbsp; Act No. 875)&nbsp; were to confine the&nbsp; issuance of these writs&nbsp; to the C. I.&nbsp; R.,&nbsp; then it&nbsp; should have&nbsp; made itself clear and unequivocal; instead of using the phrase "no court of the Philippines", it should have just&nbsp; said "the Court of Industrial Relations shall have no jurisdiction to issue temporary or permanent injunction, except after hearing the testimony of the witnesses," etc.</p><p>I see no reason for confining the issuance of restraining orders in&nbsp; cases&nbsp; involving labor disputes to the&nbsp; C. I. R., because under the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act, many of said cases involving labor disputes, as well pointed out in the majority opinion, will never reach&nbsp; the C. I.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; Unless a labor dispute involves unfair labor practice&nbsp; or is certified by the Chief Executive, under section 10, the&nbsp; C. I. R. has no jurisdiction over it.&nbsp; We are aware of many cases of&nbsp; strikes and picketing, involving no unfair labor practice but merely based on and arising from unsatisfied demands of labor for increase in wages, payment of&nbsp; annual bonus, vacation and sick leave with pay,&nbsp; shorter hours of work, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; these&nbsp; labor&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; cases&nbsp; involving no&nbsp; unfair labor practice, the parties are left to bargain&nbsp; or thresh out their differences&nbsp; even if, as&nbsp; a result&nbsp; of failure in negotiations, the employees resort to strikes&nbsp; and&nbsp; picketing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeat that, in these cases which never reach the C. I.&nbsp; R. and over which it has no jurisdiction, there is no reason for limiting the issuance of restraining orders under section 9', paragraphs (<em>d</em>) and (<em>f</em>) to the C.&nbsp; I. R.</p><p>It is urged in the learned dissent of Mr. Justice&nbsp; J. B. L. Reyes that inasmuch as the C. I. R., because of&nbsp; the training and, experience&nbsp; of its judges in handling&nbsp; and resolving labor and management questions,&nbsp; is the court best qualified to pass upon the merits of said labor&nbsp; dispute cases, it should&nbsp; have exclusive&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue restraining 'orders in labor dispute&nbsp; cases under&nbsp; section 9.&nbsp; I regret to disagree.&nbsp; In the first place, as I have already pointed out,&nbsp; there are many cases growing out of a labor dispute which by reason of their not involving unfair labor practice, cannot and will never reach the C. I. R.&nbsp; for&nbsp; bearing and determination, and over which the C. I. R. consequently would have no occasion to draw upon and use the special qualifications&nbsp; of its&nbsp; judges to pass upon the&nbsp; merits of said cases.&nbsp; In the second place, the cases&nbsp; and occasions calling for&nbsp; the issuance of restraining orders under section 9, paragraphs (<em>d</em>)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<em>f</em>), almost&nbsp; invariably are those&nbsp; where unlawful acts are threatened and&nbsp; will be committed unless restrained, or have been&nbsp; actually&nbsp; committed and will be continued unless restrained, acts such as personal violence, coercion, destruction of property or malicious mischief,&nbsp; (covered by&nbsp; Articles 282, 286, 324, 327, Revised Penal Code)&nbsp; etc., sometimes committed on the occasion of a strike and picketing.&nbsp; These are offenses and violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; peace and order wherever committed regardless of the occasion of or reason for their commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Affecting as they do, not only the immediate parties to the labor dispute, but the populace and&nbsp; public&nbsp; tranquility, they are cognizable and should be cognizable by the courts in the&nbsp; district&nbsp; and territory where committed and not&nbsp; by one single court with limited jurisdiction like the C. I. R.&nbsp; Furthermore, a Court of First Instance, issuing the writ of&nbsp; injunction does not&nbsp; have to pass upon the merits of the labor dispute or controversy,&nbsp; requiring or calling for the use of special knowledge&nbsp; of or experience in labor management differences&nbsp; and controversies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The injunction merely seeks to restrain the violation or continued violation of the criminal&nbsp; law, and this can and may be done by an ordinary court.</p><p>Another reason&nbsp; in support of the view that the ordinary courts of the&nbsp; Philippines have jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue&nbsp; restraining orders in cases&nbsp; involving a labor dispute, provided that the conditions outlined by the law&nbsp; are complied with, is that, while the C. I. R. with its limited number of Judges and personnel is situated&nbsp; in Manila, the unlawful acts threatened and which would be committed unless restrained, or have been committed and will&nbsp; be continued unless restrained,&nbsp; may take place&nbsp; or may have taken&nbsp; place outside of Manila and far from it, like far off Aparri on the north or the distant City of Davao in the&nbsp; south, and it would be quite difficult, if not impossible, for the aggrieved party to come&nbsp; to&nbsp; Manila with his witnesses&nbsp; to apply for the restraining order from the C. I. R.; and even if despite the expense and inconvenience to&nbsp; witnesses it could do so, during all the interval between&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of the unlawful acts and the actual issuance of the restraining order by the C. I. B. in Manila, and its notification&nbsp; to the offender or offenders in Aparri or City of Davao, irreparable&nbsp; injury may already&nbsp; have been committed,&nbsp; and the efforts of the aggrieved party may&nbsp; after all prove futile and of&nbsp; no avail.&nbsp; Truly,&nbsp; time is of the essence&nbsp; in such cases.</p><p>Seceion 9, paragraph&nbsp; (<em>d</em>),&nbsp; in&nbsp; part reads:</p><blockquote><p>"(<em>d</em>) No&nbsp; court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines shall have jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in&nbsp; any case&nbsp; involving or growing&nbsp; out of a labor&nbsp; dispute, as herein defined&nbsp; except&nbsp; after hearing the&nbsp; testimony of witnesses in open court (with opportunity for cross-examination) in support of the allegations of a&nbsp; complaint made under oath,&nbsp; and testimony in opposition&nbsp; thereto, if&nbsp; offered, and except after finding of&nbsp; fact by the Court, to the effect: "(5) That the public officers charged with the duty to&nbsp; protect complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection.</p><p>"Such hearing shall be held after due and personal notice&nbsp; thereof has&nbsp; been&nbsp; given, in&nbsp; such manner as the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; shall&nbsp; direct, to all known persons against whom relief is sought, and also to the&nbsp; chief of those public officials of&nbsp; the province or city within which the unlawful&nbsp; acts have&nbsp; been threatened or&nbsp; committed charged&nbsp; with the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; to protect&nbsp; complainant's&nbsp; property:&nbsp; Provided,&nbsp; however, That if a complainant shall&nbsp; also allege that unless&nbsp; a temporary restraining order shall be issued&nbsp; without&nbsp; notice, a substantial and irreparable injury&nbsp; to complainant's&nbsp; property will be&nbsp; unavoidable, <em>such a temporary restraining order may be issued upon&nbsp; testimony</em> under&nbsp; oath, sufficient,&nbsp; if not&nbsp; sustained,&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in issuing a&nbsp; temporary injunction upon hearing after notice.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; a<em> temporary restraining order</em> shall be <em>effective for no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; than five</em> days and shall become void at the expiration of five days.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>True,&nbsp; under the proviso found&nbsp; in the&nbsp; middle&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; third paragraph above quoted, the temporary restraining order may be issued upon an <em>ex parte</em> hearing&nbsp; based on&nbsp; the testimony of only the witnesses presented by the complainant, but it is&nbsp; equally true&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; temporary restraining order is good only for five days, after&nbsp; which it becomes void,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; the&nbsp; unlawful&nbsp; acts or threats&nbsp; to&nbsp; commit the&nbsp; same&nbsp; may&nbsp; be resumed&nbsp; without hindrance.&nbsp; In order&nbsp; to issue a temporary&nbsp; restraining order good&nbsp; for more than five days or a permanent one under&nbsp; the 1st and 2nd paragraphs&nbsp; of the legal&nbsp; provision above quoted, a regular hearing should be held after due and personal notice&nbsp; thereof to all known persons&nbsp; against whom&nbsp; the relief is sought and also to the chief of those public&nbsp; officials of&nbsp; the province or city within which the unlawful acts have been threatened&nbsp; or committed charged with the duty to protect complainant's property.&nbsp; To do this, the C.I.R. must hold the hearing in such&nbsp; province or city so as to give opportunity not&nbsp; only to&nbsp; the&nbsp; witnesses for the complainant,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also to the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; against whom&nbsp; relief is sought and to the peace officers concerned. I believe that the C.&nbsp; I.&nbsp; R. with its limited number of judges and personnel is not in a position to go to&nbsp; said province or city or to detail one of its judges to hold hearings and make findings of facts. We must bear in mind that the C. I. R. stationed&nbsp; in Manila is holding hearings&nbsp; daily not only in cases&nbsp; involving&nbsp; unfair labor&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of which there are many, but&nbsp; also in cases&nbsp; certified to it by the Chief Executive under section&nbsp; 10 of Republic Act No. 875. This, to say nothing of its heavy backlog of old cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will take some time&nbsp; for the C. I. R. with all its&nbsp; judges&nbsp; to dispatch all these accumulated cases&nbsp; in&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; so&nbsp; that it can&nbsp; ill afford to send one of its judges to&nbsp; the cities and provinces outside&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; Moreover, strikes&nbsp; and picketing with their not infrequent incidents involving&nbsp; violations of&nbsp; peace and order,&nbsp; may&nbsp; take place simultaneously&nbsp; in different parts of the Philippines,&nbsp; calling for immediate hearing in&nbsp; said cases for&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; of acting&nbsp; upon urgent petitions for issuance of restraining&nbsp; orders; naturally, the&nbsp; C. I. R.&nbsp; cannot possibly cover all these urgent cases&nbsp; with&nbsp; details of&nbsp; its&nbsp; judges outside&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila. The logical courts for this purpose&nbsp; are, besides the C. I. R., the ordinary Courts of First Instance, holding court in Manila and in all the provinces, not only in the capitals thereof, but in the chartered cities and sometimes in different&nbsp; parts&nbsp; of&nbsp; each province, such as&nbsp; Lingayen (Capital of Pangasinan), the towns of Tayug and Alaminos&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same province,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the chartered City&nbsp; of Dagupan, same province.</p><p>It is said that&nbsp; because there are policemen and constabulary soldiers supposed to keep peace&nbsp; and order in the provinces,&nbsp; and that since&nbsp; the&nbsp; law specifically limits the issuance of injunctions to&nbsp; those cases where those peace officers&nbsp; are unable or&nbsp; unwilling to furnish adequate protection, there are not many cases left for the C. I. R. to act upon as regards the issuance&nbsp; of restraining orders. This&nbsp; argument&nbsp; is plausible,&nbsp; but I&nbsp; am afraid, only&nbsp; in theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that those peace officers have in the past made&nbsp; arrests to preserve peace and order on the occasion of strikes and&nbsp; picketing, but those arrests&nbsp; were limited&nbsp; to cases&nbsp; of actual violence and personal injury, such as, where killings&nbsp; or physical injuries are involved. They do not cover&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; coercion,&nbsp; intimidation,&nbsp; or obstruction of the normal activities&nbsp; of&nbsp; the strike bound company, such as, where the picketers by threats and&nbsp; intimidation actually prevent the passing thru or crossing of&nbsp; the&nbsp; picket lines by&nbsp; non-striking employees&nbsp; and customers&nbsp; of the company; or where strikers and picketers stop the free movement of vehicles&nbsp; going in and out of the&nbsp; company's compound&nbsp; to distribute&nbsp; its products,&nbsp; or prevent motor vehicles or rail cars from entering the company's compound to deliver raw materials for&nbsp; processing,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; sugar cane for its&nbsp; sugar mills,&nbsp; by not only standing in the&nbsp; path of said vehicles, but even of lying down on&nbsp;&nbsp; the road&nbsp; or railway,&nbsp; knowing that the drivers of&nbsp; said&nbsp; vehicles would not&nbsp; run them&nbsp; down and commit mass killing.&nbsp; Furthermore, Republic&nbsp; Act No. 1167, punishing&nbsp; obstruction or&nbsp; interference with peaceful picketing&nbsp; during any&nbsp; labor&nbsp; controversy, imposes&nbsp; heavy penal sanctions,&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; for a peace officer being a fine not exceeding P10,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years, or both.&nbsp; An ordinary policeman or constabulary soldier not familiar with the intricacies of the law and its interpretation and in no position to decide on the spot whether or not a certain picketing is peaceful, would naturally try to play safe and so would&nbsp; act and&nbsp; make arrests only in actual cases of&nbsp; violence or&nbsp; killing, but not&nbsp; in cases&nbsp; of threats,&nbsp; intimidation,&nbsp; or coercion,&nbsp; preferring in the latter cases to wait for&nbsp; a&nbsp; court&nbsp; order for his own protection.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&nbsp; is&nbsp; well known that in&nbsp; many cases of picketing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; labor unions&nbsp; and&nbsp; their members engaged in such picketing object to and have denounced the&nbsp; presence of peace officers for they want to&nbsp; conduct their picketing in their own way without interference; and in some cases, these peace officers&nbsp; are withdrawn&nbsp; or are relieved.</p><p>To show that only the G.&nbsp; I.&nbsp; R. can take cognizance&nbsp; of cases involving labor dispute&nbsp; where restraining orders are sought,&nbsp; the learned dissent points&nbsp; to the&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "the Court" found&nbsp; in&nbsp; the last&nbsp; line of the&nbsp; 1st&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; of section 9 (d),&nbsp; reproduced above,—* * * "and except after finding of fact by the Court, to the effect:" in connection with the definition of the word "court" found in section 2, paragraph (a) of Republic Act No. 875, which reads:</p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 2. Definitions.—As used in this Act—</p><p>"(<em>a</em>) 'Court' means the Court of Industrial Relations established by Commonwealth Act Numbered&nbsp; One hundred and three,&nbsp; as amended, unless&nbsp; another. Court shall be specified."</p></blockquote><p>In other words, it is claimed that, in the absence of any specification, the Court mentioned in section 9, paragraph (<em>d</em>), can refer only to the C. I. R.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I&nbsp; am afraid that the&nbsp; argument&nbsp; though&nbsp; seemingly valid,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be sustained.&nbsp; The phrase underlined "no court of the Philippines shall have jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue a&nbsp; temporary or permanent injunction" found at the beginning of said section 9 (<em>d</em>), in my opinion, qualifies the word "Court"&nbsp; found at the end of said&nbsp; paragraph.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the&nbsp; law says that no court of the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue temporary or&nbsp; permanent injunction&nbsp; except after hearing and after&nbsp; finding of said facts,&nbsp; the logical conclusion is that any court of the Philippines ordinarily vested with the&nbsp; jurisdiction to issue writs&nbsp; of&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; can take cognizance of those cases involving a labor&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of issuing restraining orders&nbsp; as&nbsp; long as it holds a hearing and thereafter makes certain findings of fact justifying the issuance of the injunction, so that the word&nbsp; "court" found at&nbsp; the end of the&nbsp; paragraph must necessarily refer&nbsp; to any court of the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; taking cognizance.&nbsp; Otherwise, the paragraph in question would not only be confusing but&nbsp; contradictory&nbsp; in that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; one part thereof, it authorizes&nbsp; any court of the&nbsp; Philippines, such as the Courts of First Instance, to take cognizance and then as claimed, requires that the finding of fact based on the result of the hearing be made by the C. I R.</p><p>Moreover,&nbsp; in the very recent case of&nbsp; Scoty's Department&nbsp; Store,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Nena Micaller (supra,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 762), decided by this Court on August&nbsp; 25, 1956, we had occasion to interpret&nbsp; section 25&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875,&nbsp; which in part reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 25. <em>Penalties.</em>—Any&nbsp; person who violates the provisions of section three of this Act shall&nbsp; be punished&nbsp; by a fine of not less than one hundred pesos nor more than one thousand pesos, or by imprisonment of not less than one month nor more than one year, or both such fine and&nbsp; imprisonment, in the discretion of the Court. * * *,"</p></blockquote><p>The phrase "the Court" is&nbsp; also found at&nbsp; the end&nbsp; of the paragraph above quoted, so that following the&nbsp; definition of section 2, paragraph (a)&nbsp; of the same Act, the phrase "the Court"&nbsp; must refer to&nbsp; the C.&nbsp; I. R.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; in the Scoty's Department&nbsp; Store&nbsp; case&nbsp; above&nbsp; mentioned,&nbsp; this Tribunal in a decision with no dissent clearly and emphatically said that despite the definition of the word "Court" in section 2 (a) of Republic Act No. 875, it is not the C.&nbsp; I. R. but the&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; courts that&nbsp; can&nbsp; impose the penalties provided&nbsp; in section 25.&nbsp; I&nbsp; quote:</p><blockquote><p>"In&nbsp; conclusion, our considered opinion is that the power to impose the penalties provided for in section 25 of Republic Act No. 875 is lodged in ordinary courts, and not in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations, notwithstanding the definition of the word "Court" contained in section 2&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; of said Act.&nbsp; Hence, the decision of the industrial court in so far as it imposes a fine of PI 00 upon petitioners is illegal and should be nullified.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Scoty's Department Store, Et Al., <em>vs.</em> Nena Micaller, G.&nbsp; B. No. L-S116, August 25, 1956)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italic is mine.)</p></blockquote><p>In view of the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; I am with the majority holding that the ordinary courts&nbsp; of the Philippines may take&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of&nbsp; cases involving labor disputes for&nbsp; the purpose of issuing restraining orders under section 9,&nbsp; paragraphs (<em>d</em>)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<em>f</em>) of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 875.<br><br><br></p><p></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><p align="center"><em><br>&nbsp; <br>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em><br><br>&nbsp; <br></p><p><strong>REYES, J.&nbsp; B.

Whether the tendency is due to&nbsp; the Legislative having believed that the regular Judges, trained in strict legal questions of property and&nbsp; contract, are ill prepared&nbsp; to cope&nbsp; with&nbsp; labor and tenancy&nbsp; disputes that&nbsp; demand&nbsp; a different perspective&nbsp; and a compromising temperament, aimed above all at minimizing friction and avoiding paralization&nbsp; of the processes&nbsp; of production; or because it was believed that the quick&nbsp; solution&nbsp; of social problems&nbsp; demanded more simplified&nbsp; and&nbsp; less protracted procedures; or because as it has&nbsp; been suggested, courts and&nbsp; lawyers are becoming obsolete, the policy&nbsp; of specialized offices for special&nbsp; problems clearly&nbsp; exists and should not be evaded.</p><p>With particular&nbsp; reference to labor injunctions, the&nbsp; all important issue is whether a given case involves or grows out&nbsp; of&nbsp; labor&nbsp; dispute.&nbsp; Our Judges&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations are&nbsp; certainly&nbsp; much better qualified to determine such issue than the regular judges, experienced as the former are in&nbsp; the multifarious aspects that such dispute may assume.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should we entrust this&nbsp; and other related questions to judges who have&nbsp; not handled labor disputes on any previous occasion?&nbsp; The very case before us is proof that to do so would be to nullify the restrictions imposed by law on&nbsp; labor injunctions, because of the&nbsp; Judges'&nbsp; unfamiliarity with the&nbsp; policies&nbsp; and&nbsp; interests&nbsp; involved.&nbsp; It was not&nbsp; so long&nbsp; ago,&nbsp; either, that complaints were being aired that the regular courts are far&nbsp; too&nbsp; generous in granting&nbsp; <em>ex parte</em> preliminary&nbsp; injunctions,&nbsp; without due regard&nbsp; for&nbsp; the social aspects of the cases brought before them; and this Court has recently passed upon case where squatters on public thoroughfares came to be protected by <em>ex parte</em> injunctions improvidently issued that took long years to correct</p><p>That the Court of Industrial Relations has its seat in Manila, and can not speedily intervene in labor disputes In the provinces, is a fact that must have&nbsp; been known to the legislators who approved&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875; and their failure to specify the Courts of First&nbsp; Instance in section&nbsp; 9 (<em>d</em>) of the&nbsp; Act indicates that they did not consider that objection decisive against the policy therein set.&nbsp; One must not lose sight of the fact that the situations in which injunctions will be sought under that section do not involve cases of actual violence or&nbsp; open breaches of public peace and order,&nbsp; because peace&nbsp; officers are duty bound to intervene on such occasions: the law specifically limits the injunctions&nbsp; to those cases where "the&nbsp; public officers&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with the duty to&nbsp; protect complainant's property are unable&nbsp; or&nbsp; unwilling to&nbsp; furnish adequate protection".&nbsp; Such cases, if any, will be&nbsp; necessarily rare; our police and constabulary officers have never been unwilling&nbsp; to&nbsp; protect those that deserve protection, nor have they ever been found inadequate for ordinary police action.</p></div>
