				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 26,  1954, Ng Guat,  et  al. were under nine separate informations of the same tenor,  charged by the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal before the  Justice of the Peace Court of  Caloocan with a violation of Article 195 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of the Revised Penal Code for  maintaining and operating, on or about July  19,  1954, in their respective places  of business, slot machines (jackpots), which are mechanical devices or contrivances whereby  the winning or losing of money by the  players or bettors wholly or chiefly  depends upon chance or  hazard. <br><br>Similarly, on November 15, 1954, Rufino Crisostomo, et al. were charged before the Justice of the Peace Court of Navotas  with the same offense,  under  three  separate informations. <br><br>Upon motion to quash of counsel  of the accused in all the aforementioned  criminal cases, the Justice  of the Peace Courts of both Caloocan and Navotas  ordered the dismissal of the charges on the ground of prescription of the offenses alleged, with  the exception of the case  against  accused George Philips, wherein the Justice of  the Peace Court of Caloocan reconsidered the order of dismissal and  ordered the reinstatement of the charges against him, because when the offense charged was discovered by the authorities,  as well as when  the information against  him was filed, this particular accused was outside the country. <br><br>From the orders of dismissal of the Courts of Navotas and Caloocan, the Provincial  Fiscal appealed to the Court of First Instance of Rizal; the latter, however, affirmed the orders of the  inferior courts. Whereupon, the prosecution interposed the present appeals to this  Court (G.  R. Nos. L-10249 to 10260). <br><br>The sole question raised by these appeals is whether the offenses in question, being punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> or a fine not exceeding 200 pesos, prescribe in 2 months. The trial court so  held, in the light of Article 9 taken in connection with the penultimate paragraph of Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code which considers said  offenses  as light offenses that prescribe in two months; but the State contends that the offenses prescribe in 10 years, since under the provisions of Article 27 in conjunction with the third paragraph of  Article 90, also  of the Revised  Penal  Code, a fine of not less than 200 pesos is a correctional penalty that prescribes in ten years. <br><br>The above question has already been decided and settled by this Court in the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Yu hai<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G. R.  L-9598, promulgated on August 15,  1956  (52 Off.  Gaz.,  No.  11, 5116), followed by the cases  of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aquino,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  G.  R. L-9357-70, promulgated  August  21, 1956, and  People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Canson<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> L-8848-58, promulgated  May 23, 1957  (53 Off. Gaz., No. 19,  6512).  In said cases we have ruled, for the reasons  stated  therein,  that an  offense punishable  by arresto menor or a fine  not exceeding 200 pesos is only a light offense  under Article 9 of the Revised Penal  Code, and prescribes in  two months under  Article 90, par. 6. The trial  court, therefore, did  not  err in quashing  the present informations  on the  ground  that  the  offenses charged had  already prescribed. <br><br>However, considering that the informations here in question also  involve twelve violations of  the  gambling law which have to be dismissed,  not because of the innocence of the  accused, but  simply because  of  the failure  of the prosecution to file the charges on time, we  deem it apposite to reiterate our comments in People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Canson,  <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, to wit:<br><blockquote>"We  see  no  reason for abandoning  the doctrine  laid down in said  two cases.  At the same time, we realize the conflict or discrepancy between Articles 9  and 26 of  the Revised  Penal Code, as pointed  out by  the  lower  court  and  the prosecution.  It would greatly  be  desirable  if the  Legislature resolved  this conflict  by suitable  legislation,  or amendment of the  Revised  Penal  Code.  The  Executive Department, through the office of the Secretary of Justice and the  Office of  the Solicitor General, might make representations with the  Legislature  as to the necessity  or  wisdom of making  an exception in the case of a violation of the gambling law  (Article 195 of the Revised  Penal  Code), classified as a light offense for the purposes of  prescription.  It  has always been the policy of the Government to  curb and minimize,  even eliminate, the evils of  gambling, specially in the form of slot machines, popularly known  as "one-arm bandits", which are often patronized  by that element  of  the community which could least afford  to lose money on the same, not realizing the inexorable  law of averages,  namely, that despite occasional  and  rare hits  of  the jackpot, in the long run, they always lose.  Or  if the Legislature is not favorably inclined towards the amendment suggested, the  Department of Justice might brief and circularize prosecuting attorneys to be  more alert in the  prosecution  of violations of the gambling law,  so that the corresponding  complaints  or information could be filed  within the present  prescriptive period of two months."</blockquote>The  orders appealed  from  are affirmed,  without pronouncement  as to  costs.
