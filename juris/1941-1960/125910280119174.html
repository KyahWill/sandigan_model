				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga dismissing appellant's petition for certiorari to annul and declare void all proceedings  had in the ejectment case filed in Civil Case No. 54 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Mabalacat,  entitled "Victor R. Serrano and  Marcelino  Garcia, plaintiffs,  <em>vs</em>. Jesus S. Dizon, defendant."</p>
<p>The record shows that the appellant Jesus  S.  Dizon, on January  28,  1953,  entered into a contract with  Jose T. Garcia and  Juan  Rivera—the latter  acting  in  his own name  and  as executor of the  estate iof his  deceased wife Vicenta Dizon—for the  lease  of 8 parcels of agricultural land  for a period of 5  years co.  imencing  with  the crop year 1953-54 up  to  and including the  agricultural year 1957-58.  Three of said  parcels oi land were covered by transfer, certificates of title issued in the name of the spouses Juan Rivera  and Vicenta Dizon, while the other five were covered by transfer certificates of title issued in the name of Jose T. Garcia and the spouses Juan Rivera and Vicenta Dizon, Garcia being  a  co-owner  in the  proportion  of an undivided one-third.  Among the terms of the lease  were:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. That  the LESSEE hereby agrees with the  lessor for the consideration  hereinafter  named, to lease, for the purpose of tilling: and farming, well and faithfully, for a period of five (5) agricultural years commencing  with the crop year 1953-1954, up to and including the  agricultural year 1957-1958, in a  good  and farmlike manner, and according  to  the usual course of  farming, the above-described property;</p>
  <p>"2. That  the rental for the first crop year (1953-1954) shall be Twenty Thousand Fesos (P20,000.00),  Philippine  Currency,  to be paid and delivered on or before June  30, 1953; and Two Hundred Fifty (250) cavans  of  palay, fifty (50)  cavans of which shall be of the 'Milagrosa' variety, or its equivalent, to be delivered on or before  the  end  of February, 1954;</p>
  <p>"That the rental for the  succeeding  years shall be  Twenty One Thousand  Pesos (P21,000.00), Philippine Currency,  for  each year to be paid and delivered on or before the  30th  of June of each succeeding  years;  and Two Hundred Fifty (250)  cavans of palay for each year also, in the varieties and in the  amounts indicated in the  foregoing paragraphs,  or its equivalent, to be delivered on or before the end of  each February of the succeeding years.</p>
  <p>"3. That the  lessee shall have no  right to a reduction of the rentals agreed upon on account of the sterility of the land leased, or by reason of the  loss of fruits due  to fortuitous events, ordinary or extraordinary;</p>
  <p>"4. That in case of failure or neglect on the part  of the lessee to  perform  any of  the  conditions and terms of this contract on his  part,  then the lessor is  hereby authorized and  empowered  to enter said land and  take full and absolute possession of the same, and he may do and perform all things agreed to be done by the lessee remaining  undone, and may retain or sell sufficient portion of  the crops raised on said  land that would otherwise belong  to the  lessee if he had performed the conditions hereof, to  pay and satisfy all conditions and expenses of every  kind incurred  in performing said contract;</p>
  <p>"5. That the LESSOR shall, upon the termination of the lease, become the owner of all the  improvements introduced  in the property leased without any liability on his part to the lessee for the cost of the same;</p>
  <p>"6. That the lessee shall have the option  for a renewal of this contract of lease if upon the termination of this, the lessors shall decide to have the same property leased again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the death of Juan Rivera in 1953, Marcelino Garcia was appointed administrator of  his  estate, and Victor R. Serrano  and  Alejandro P. Dizon,  administrators  of the estate of the late Vicenta Dizon.  Allegedly to determine to  whom the rentals due under the  lease contract  for the agricultural  year  1956-57 should be  delivered  and in what proportion, herein  appellant Jesus  S.  Dizon  filed  in the court below a complaint for interpleader against the above-named administrators and  Jose T. Garcia  (Civil  Case No. 1131).   Giving due course  to the complaint, the  court required the alleged conflicting claimants to  inter plead with one another.  It  also ordered  Jesus S.  Dizon to  deposit with the clerk  of  court all the rentals which  may be due under the contract of lease.  Upon  a stipulation  of facts signed by Jose T. Garcia, Marcelino Garcia and Victor  R. Serrano—stating, among  other things, that defendant Jose T. Garcia  signed as co-lessor in the contract of lease at the request of the parties thereto merely to facilitate registration thereof his 1/3 undivided share in  the  lands not being included in the contract as the same  had been  provisionally segregated and separately given in lease in favor of one Mr. Angelo Hizon  with the full knowledge  of Jesus  S. Dizon—the  lower court on November  6,  1956 rendered judgment condemning plaintiff Jesus S. Dizon to pay the rentals in the manner therein stated.   The judgment, however, was set aside upon the attention of the court being called to the fact that Alejandro  P. Dizon was not a party to the stipulation of facts entered into by the other defendants.  In a  separate order, the court directed  plaintiff Jesus S. Dizon to deposit  in court all  rentals in his possession  as well  as  future rentals.  After  plaintiff  had deposited the sum of P4,950.00, counsel for the defendants (except Alejandro P.  Dizon) filed an  urgent petition praying, among other things, that the  plaintiff be directed  to deposit with the clerk of court within 24 hours the amount of P12,OOO;OO, which represents  rentals due on the property. This petition,  however, was denied,  the  court  intimating that the remedy for the collection of said rentals was to file the  proper action in the competent court.</p>
<p>On November  29,  1956,  Marcelino  Garcia and  Victor  R. Serrano filed a complaint for illegal detainer and collection of rentals in Civil Case No. 54 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Mabalacat,  Pampanga, against Jesus  S. Dizon, alleging, among  other  things, that  the  rentals "for the agricultural  year just past" which the defendant should have paid  in full not later than June 30,  1955  was paid by him only  in the amount of f&gt;19,500.00 leaving an unpaid balance of Pl,500.00  which defendant has refused to pay despite  repeated  demands; that  "for the current agricultural year" defendant has  only paid the amount of P4,050, which, together with P4,950.00 deposited with the clerk  of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, total P9,000.00; and that despite repeated verbal and written demands made since July, 1956,  defendant refuted and still refuses to pay the  balance  of P12,000.00,  or to return possession of the leased properties. Jesus S. Dizon, on t'.:e other hand, filed on December 1, 1956  a complaint for specific performance and d?mages (Civil  Case No. 1163)  in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga against Jose  T.  Garcia, Marcelino Garcia, Alejandro P. Dizon  and Victor Serrano, praying under the first cause of action that defendants be directed to execute a renewal of the lease for another 5 years and to deliver, under the second cause of action, 25 hectares oi the leased premises, plus damages.</p>
<p>To  the complaint in the ejectment case filed in Civil Case No. 54 of the Justice of the Peace  Court of Mabalacat, Pampanga,  the defendant  therein Jesus  S.  Dizon filed  a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of cause of action, lack of jurisdiction, lack  of legal capacity to sue, pendency in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga of two actions (<hvil cases="" nos.="" 1131="" 1163)="" over="" cause="" between="" same="" parties,="" payment="" claims="" set="" forth="" complaint.="" motion,="" however,="" denied.="" reconsideration="" having="" been="" also="" denied,="" jesus="" s.="" dizon="" filed="" present="" petition="" for="" certiorari="" below="" annul="" declare="" void="" altl="" proceedings="" had="" ejectment="" case,="" alleging="" that="" inferior="" court="" gravely="" abused="" discretion="" and="" exceeded="" its="" jurisdiction="" in="" denying="" his="" motion="" to="" dismiss.="" as="" prayed="" for,="" a="" writ="" of="" preliminary="" injunction="" enjoining="" respondents="" from="" further="" proceeding="" with="" the="" case="" was="" issued.=""></hvil></p>
<p>Instead of answering the petition, the respondents Marcelino Garcia and Victor R. Serrano filed a motion to dismiss  and to  lift the preliminary  injunction  issued. After disposing of the several  incidents raised by  the parties in  the meantime, the lower court on  December 5, 1957  rendered a decision,  the  dispositive  part  of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore, finding no merit  in  the instant petition  for  certiorari, the court hereby dismisses the same with  costs against the petitioner, definitely dissolving  the writ of preliminary injunction, heretofore issued in this  case.</p>
  <p>"Let the parties and the respondent Judge be immediately notified of this decision.</p>
  <p>"So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reconsideration of  this decision having been denied,  petitioner Jesus  S. Dizon appealed to the Court  of  Appeals, but that court has  certified the case to us on the ground that the questions involved are purely legal.</p>
<p>We find the appeal to be without merit.</p>
<p>Appellant contends that  the court below erred in holding that the inferior court had authority to  try  Civil  Case No.  54.  Under this contention,  appellant questions the non-inclusion  as party  plaintiff of Jose  T. Garcia,  a co-owner in 4 of the  parcels of land leased and a  party to the lease contract.   It appears,  however, from the allegations of the  complaint itself that Jose  T.  Garcia is not a party  in interest in  the case.  Thus,  it  is alleged that his participation in  the  lease agreement  was merely to facilitate the  transaction,  he being a  registered co-owner, and that his interests in the land had actually been leased, with appellant's knowledge, to Angel Hizon.  At any rate, the alleged non-inclusion cannot deprive the inferior court of authority  to try the case.  Non-joinder of  necessary parties is not a ground for dismissal.</p>
<p>It is also  argued that appellant cannot be held guilty of unlawful  detainer until after the termination of the action for  specific  performance and  damages wherein he prayed for the delivery of 25 hectares of  land under the lease agreement with damages.  It will  be recalled,  however, that the action for specific performance was filed later than the action for unlawful detainer.  This was probably one of the reasons  that prompted  the lower court to rule that said action was  filed for  purposes  of  delay.   The action for unlawful detainer having taken precedence over that for specific performance, it is the latter that should be held in abeyance if  that is necessary at all.</p>
<p>Appellant also advances the rather novel theory that to successfully maintain and prosecute the action for unlawful detainer, the following, which are not within the competence of the inferior court, must first be accomplished: (1)  reformation of the  contract of lease so as to exclude Jose T. Garcia as co-lessor and to exclude 25 hectares of the leased lands; (2)  partition of four  of the  parcels of land in question  since said parcels are held in  common  and still undivided; and   (3)  accounting,  since  petitioner,  herein appellant, claims to have paid in full the rents as stipulated. In answer, suffice it to  say that there  is nothing in the allegations or prayer of the  complaint in  the  unlawful detainer  case which may raise any issue  about reformation of contract, partition, or accounting.  On the contrary, the allegations in said complaint clearly make out  a case for unlawful detainer.</p>
<p>There  is nothing  to the claim that four of the parcels of land in question are located  outside the territorial jurisdiction of Mabalacat, Pampanga.  Granting this to be true, section 2 of Rule  4 provides that "If the  property be found in two or more municipalities  actions may  be brought in any of them, at the option of the plaintiff."</p>
<p>The interpleader case  (Civil Case No. 1131)  is also invoked by appellant,  but  this has already been finally dismissed precisely  because  with  the filing of  the  ejectment case,  it had become moot  and  academic, the proper place for the discussion of the questions  involved therein being in the ejectment case.  The dismissal was ordered at the instance  of herein appellant invoking the filing of the unlawful detainer case,  and certainly he  cannot  now turn about and allege  such dismissal as a bar to the prosecution of the same  unlawful detainer case.</p>
<p>Alleging that  there was no  formal  demand to vacate, appellant claims that the justice of the peace  court acquired no jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case.   The claim cannot be sustained.   The complaint expressly alleges that since the month of July, 1956, oral and written demands for the payment of the rentals due had been made.   This may not be sufficient  notice of demand to vacate as required by  the Rules, but  such shortcomings cannot deprive the inferior  court  of jurisidiction  over the case.   After the motion to dismiss had been overruled on this point, appellant could have still raised it as an affirmative  defense in his answer.   It  certainly cannot be  a ground  for a  petition for certiorari.  In any event, the complaint has since then been amended to cure the defect.</p>
<p>In recapitulation of his arguments, appellant concludes that the ejectment case  is really  an action for collection of rentals involving more than P2,000.00 and consequently outside the  jurisdiction  of inferior  courts.  In the  light of what has already been said, this argument deserves no serious consideration.</p>
<p>In  view  of the  foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B. L.,  Barrera, Paredes,  </em>and  <em>Dizon, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
