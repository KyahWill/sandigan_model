				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><em>Statement.</em>—The petitioner challenges the&nbsp; respondent judge's order of May&nbsp; 14, 1955, requiring him to authorize the refund&nbsp; in legal currency of&nbsp; "script"&nbsp; or&nbsp; "guerrilla" money deposited as bail bond in 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; At his&nbsp; request, we issued a preliminary injunction temporarily&nbsp; to restrain the enforcement of said directive.<p><em>Facts.</em>—In&nbsp; Criminal Case No. 416 of&nbsp; the court of&nbsp; first instance of Negros Occidental, in&nbsp; August, 1945, Gorgonio Java as bondsman&nbsp; for the accused Fe Villavecer, deposited with the Municipal Treasurer of Gadiz, same province, the sum of five hundred pesos in guerrilla or "script" money. Said Treasurer's receipt expressly noted: "Dep. in script". On January 14, 1945,&nbsp; upon motion of the fiscal, the court dismissed the case and directed&nbsp; the&nbsp; cancellation of the bond.</p><p>On May 3, 1955,&nbsp; upon motion of Gorgonio Java, filed the previous month, the respondent judge entered an order,&nbsp; in said criminal case, requiring the provincial auditor, (herein petitioner) to sign the voucher for the release of the cash bond deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The said&nbsp; auditor signed the corresponding voucher, remarking however that payment shall be made in "script money".&nbsp; The bondsman again asked the court for a directive for the return in legal tender of the amount he had deposited.&nbsp; After some court skirmishes, and after listening to the&nbsp; auditor's&nbsp; counsel, the respondent&nbsp; judge finally ruled on May 14,&nbsp; 1955 that the cash bond must be returned <em>in&nbsp; legal&nbsp; tender,</em>&nbsp; and&nbsp; commanded&nbsp; said&nbsp; official accordingly to make the&nbsp; corresponding release within five days.&nbsp; An urgent motion to reconsider was promptly denied, Hence this petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction which was given due course.</p><p><em>Discussion</em>.—It is at once apparent that in the Criminal Case No. 416&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial auditor was&nbsp; not a party. Wherefore, the orders of the court therein do not normally bind him, unlike&nbsp; the ministerial&nbsp; officers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court, the sheriff, clerk of court, etc.&nbsp; True, the auditor was furnished copy of the motion to&nbsp; release, and subsequently appeared to contest the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; However he&nbsp; raised substantial questions, which&nbsp; should not have been decided summarily on a mere motion, to wit:&nbsp; reimbursement in 1955 in legal tender of guerrilla money "deposited" in 1945; validity of said money; error in the acceptance thereof; applicability and operation&nbsp; of Republic Acts&nbsp; 386&nbsp; and&nbsp; 22 concerning redemption and registration of guerrilla&nbsp; currency; laches; no funds available.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are matters which, with other subsidiary issues, should have been debated&nbsp; in a separate suit (mandamus) against the auditor,&nbsp; who,&nbsp; as already observed, was not a party&nbsp; to the criminal case.</p><p>Anyway, respondents might argue, the result is the same,because&nbsp; these matters could be litigated, and in fact have been discussed, in the case; and thereby&nbsp; a "speedy and inexpensive determination" of the&nbsp; question was&nbsp; obtained, in accordance with Rule 1 section 2 of the Rules of Court.</p><p>The argument may not be sustained.&nbsp; For&nbsp; one thing if <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus</span> were instituted by Gorgonio Java against the auditor to compel release of the money in legal tender, the respondent therein could set up one&nbsp; good defense<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>, the explanation&nbsp; he offered in his pleadings herein and in the court below: that he had consulted the Auditor General, and that the petitioner's remedy was to appeal his ruling to said higher official&nbsp; of the Executive&nbsp; Branch.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Such defense would have been effective in a <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus </span>proceeding; yet&nbsp; it&nbsp; received no attention in the consideration of Java's motion for reimbursement.&nbsp;&nbsp; If respondents should demur to the institution of another action asserting it is not speedy and is expensive, and therefore obnoxious to the spirit of section 2 Rule 1, they&nbsp; should remember that the purpose&nbsp; of the rules of procedure is&nbsp; to&nbsp; promote not only the&nbsp; speedy and&nbsp; inexpensive determination of issues, but also&nbsp; the just decision thereof;&nbsp; and it is not fair to adjudge an&nbsp; issue in a proceeding where the&nbsp; person to be affected is not a regular party,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; what is worse, can not properly assert&nbsp; a&nbsp; defense&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; approved by statutes&nbsp; and precedents.</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment</span>.—For the above reasons, the order complained of is revoked.&nbsp; The injunction heretofore issued is hereby made permanent.&nbsp; Costs against respondent Gorgonio Java.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
