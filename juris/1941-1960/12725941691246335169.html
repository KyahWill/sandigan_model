				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the People's Court Jose Ortega was accused of treason on 
four (4) counts. Upon the abolition of said Court, the case was indorsed to the 
Court of First Instance of Bulacan. After trial where a number of witnesses for 
the prosecution and defense testified, Ortega was found guilty under counts 2 
and 3 and sentenced to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, to pay a fine of P10,000, and to pay the costs. He first 
appealed to the Court of Appeals before which tribunal the Solicitor General and 
the appellant filed their briefs. After studying the case the Court of Appeals 
arrived at the conclusion that appellant was guilty; but because the crime of 
treason is penalized with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> to death, and in view of the 
absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, said appellate court is 
of the opinion that the penalty should be imposed in its medium degree, namely, 
<span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, it certified the case to us for decision. 
<p align="justify">Counts 2 and 3 read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(2). That on or about December 22, 1944, and at the market 
place of San Ildefonso, Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of 
this Court, the herein accused, Jose Ortega, for the purpose of giving aid and 
comfort to the Japanese Army did willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and 
treasonably join, accompany and lead a Japanese patrol which captured Santiago 
Samaniego, a guerrilla, who was taken to the Japanese Garrison where he was 
severely beaten and tortured. </p>
<p align="justify">"(3). That on December 28, 1944, in the municipality of San 
Ildefonso, Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable 
Court, the herein accused, Jose Ortega, with intent to give aid and comfort to 
the Japanese Imperial Army, did willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and 
treasonably join, accompany and lead a Japanese patrol which captured Jesus 
Samaniego, a guerrilla, who like his brother Santiago was taken to the Japanese 
garrison where he was severely beaten and tortured." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Under count 2, it has been proven through Santiago Samaniego 
who was then working in the office of the Municipal Treasurer of San Ildefonso, 
Bulacan, that in the morning of December 22, 1944, while on his way to his 
office, he was arrested by Japanese soldiers accompanied by appellant Ortega 
near the market place. He was apprehended for being a guerrilla and as a matter 
of fact, he was then a member of the Buenavista Regiment, a guerrilla unit 
operating in the province of Bulacan. He was taken to the Japanese garrison near 
the market place ana investigated. After about two weeks of confinement, he was 
released. The testimony of Santiago regarding his arrest was corroborated by 
Bernardo Sanchez.</p>
<p align="justify">Under count 3, Jesus Samaniego told the court that in December, 
1944, he was a guerrilla Captain in the Bulacan Military Area; that on the 
afternoon of December 28, 1944, while at a house in Buenavista estate in San 
Ildefonso, Bulacan, he saw appellant Ortega, Antonio Labao and other Makapilis 
accompanied by Japanese soldiers approaching the house. Appellant aiming his 
rifle at Jesus ordered the latter to come down his house, and after obeying the 
order, his hands were tied and he was taken to the Pinaog railroad station about 
three kilometers away. He was told that he would be taken to "Little Tokyo", the 
Japanese headquarters in the barrio of Sumandig, San Ildefonso, Bulacan, where 
he would be killed. However, the plan would appear to have been changed, because 
instead he was taken to the Japanese garrison in the poblacion where his hands 
and feet were tied. He was investigated by a Japanese officer named Hanai and 
was beaten and tortured until he lost consciousness. The investigators were 
trying to make him confess that he was a guerrilla Captain. During the 
investigation Ortega was present. The testimony of Jesus Samaniego was 
corroborated by his brother Pacifico Samaniego, an eyewitness to the arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">While the charges under counts 1 and 4 were not fully 
established, because of non-compliance with the two-witness rule, the witnesses 
under said counts told the court that Ortega was a Makapili and had joined the 
<span style="font-style: italic;">United Nippon</span> (YOIN), a military organization composed of Filipinos and Japanese 
subjects which was incorporated into the Japanese Army; that on several 
occasions appellant was seen dressed in Japanese military uniform, carrying a 
gun and accompanying Japanese patrols in raiding different places to apprehend 
members of the guerrilla. </p>
<p align="justify">After liberation appellant was investigated by the Counter 
Intelligence Corps (C. I. C.) of the U. S. Army and he signed an affidavit 
(Exhibit C) before Special Agent Milton H. Balinslie and two witnesses. We 
reproduce said affidavit. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I, JOSE ORTEGA, Unpakan, San Ildefonso, having been first duly 
cautioned that I need not make any statement, either oral or written, either 
sworn or unsworn, hereby voluntarily and of my own accord, without duress or 
compulsion of any kind, with full Knowledge that any statement I may make may be 
held against me, hereby depose and say under oath: </p>
<p align="justify">"I am thirty years of age. In December 1944 I was persuaded to 
join the United Nippon organization with the full knowledge that this 
organization was assisting the Japanese in their war against the Philippines. My 
duties in this organization consisted of guiding Japanese troops to apprehend 
Guerrillas and also trace rice for the Japanese. In January, 1945, I led the 
Japanese to the capture of Santiago B. Samaniego and Jesus Samaniego, two 
Guerrillas, in the market of San Ildefonso. My companions in this capture were 
Buenaventura Villena, Graciano Dionicio, Nicanor Reyes and Antonio Labao. I do 
not know where they are now. All guerrillas which I led the Japanese to were 
bound and tortured.</p>
<p align="justify">"I know that what I did in joining the United Nippon was wrong 
and I am willing to take the consequences for my acts." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In connection with this affidavit which was admitted by the 
trial court without objection, Ortega claimed during the trial that he was 
tricked into signing the same by the Samaniego brothers who allegedly told him 
that if he signed the same, he would receive his backpay. But besides the 
improbability of said story, the affidavit itself does not show any intervention 
on the part of the Samaniego brothers; and Ortega introduced no witness to 
corroborate him on this point. </p>
<p align="justify">The prosecution has introduced evidence to prove appellant's 
Filipino citizenship and appellant does not deny it. On the witness stand Ortega 
admitted that he was present on the occasions of the arrest of Santiago 
Samaniego and Jesus Samaniego but claimed that he was then a prisoner of the 
Japanese and was accompanying them as their servant and errand boy; that he was 
a member of the guerrilla but was captured by the Japanese soldiers and after being confined for some time, was released but was made to do errands for them, 
some of his duties being to go to the market and buy foodstuffs and to gather 
firewood for the Japanese soldiers. He introduced several witnesses to show that 
he used to be a member of the guerrilla organization but was later captured by 
the Japanese. </p>
<p align="justify">The decision of this case hinges mainly on the credibility of 
witnesses and the probability or improbability of the story told by them. The 
trial court rejected the testimonies of the witnesses for the defense and gave 
its reasons for not attaching any credit to them. After carefully reviewing the 
evidence we find no reason for disturbing this finding of the trial court. There 
is reason to believe that the appellant identified himself with the Japanese 
Armed Forces, accompanied them in their raids, oftentimes dressed in Japanese 
military uniform and armed with a gun. It is improbable that the Japanese Army 
would allow a mere prisoner, utilized as an errand boy to wear their uniform, 
carry a gun and accompany them in their patrols. Ortega not only accompanied 
Japanese patrols but he took more or less active part in the arrest of guerrilla 
suspects. If it were true as he claims that he was only a prisoner of the 
Japanese, it is not explained why some others who were captured by the Japanese 
soldiers and Makapilis were able to escape. On the other hand, Ortega stayed 
with the Japanese and helped them until the end. It may not be amiss to quote a 
part of the decision of the trial court referring to the credibility of 
witnesses and the reason for rejecting the testimony of the defense 
witnesses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"There is no reason whatsoever for not giving full weight and 
credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. There is no proof that 
they were motivated by hatred or ill-feelings or of any other evil motives which 
would impeach their credibility. It was proven by the prosecution that the 
victims, Santiago Samaniego and Jesus Samaniego were guerrillas. There is, 
therefore, reason to believe that they were arrested and tortured for their 
guerrilla activities, considering that during that time the Japanese and the 
Yoins and Makapilis were allies and were bent on exterminating the forces of 
resistance to their established government. The accused could not have been 
impelled by any other motive than the willful and criminal intent to betray his 
country to the side of the Japanese. Such acts gave the enemy aid and comfort. 
They not only diminished the power of the forces of liberation, hut also 
advanced the cause ot the Japanese Empire. </p>
<p align="justify">"The witnesses for the defense with respect to the guerrilla 
activities of the accused in the person of Lt. Leodegario de la Fuente, Fernando 
Verde, and Anastacio de la Fuente were very doubtful and did not convince the 
Court. One important question in the testimony of Anastacro de la Fuente was 
that both he and the accused were detained as prisoners. He, Anastacio de la 
Fuente, was able to escape. Why is it that the accused was with the Japanese 
until the last hour? The answer to this is very simple. Anastacio de la Fuente 
was able to escape because he was a guerrilla and therefore tried to escape and 
he escaped successfully. On the contrary, the accused was not able to escape 
because in the first place he did not try because his position was not as a 
guerrilla, hut as a spy, that is, working together and giving aid ancl comfort 
to the Japanese. The Court holds that the arrest of Santiago Samaniego in Count 
2 and the arrest of Jesus Samaniego in Count 3 were duly 
proven."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, we find the guilt of appellant under counts 2 
and 3 as having been fully established. His adherence to the enemy was also 
proven. In the imposition of penalties on treason cases we have not followed 
strictly the rules of the Penal Code regarding the presence or absence of 
aggravating or mitigating circumstances. We consider rather the gravity or 
seriousness of the acts of treason established. Where the accused has taken part 
in the killing and torture of persons apprehended by the Japanese forces through 
him, we impose the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> or even death. Where the 
participation of the accused consisted merely in accompanying Japanese patrols 
and helping in the arrest of guerrilla suspects, we generally impose the minimum 
penalty which is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>. In the present case under the charges 
proven, Ortega did not take part in the killing or torture of any person 
apprehended. And we agree with the trial court that the imposition of the 
penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> sufficiently punishes his treasonable acts. </p>
<p align="justify">Finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, the 
same is hereby affirmed, with costs. </p><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span>
