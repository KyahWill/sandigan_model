				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Removed&nbsp; from&nbsp; his&nbsp; position as&nbsp; policeman&nbsp; of Bacolod City without&nbsp; benefit of investigation, Rogerio Gendrala brought an action for mandamus&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Occidental Negros to&nbsp; compel the Mayor of said city to reinstate him and&nbsp; pay him&nbsp; backpay, plus moral and&nbsp; exemplary&nbsp; damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; the action having been dismissed in that&nbsp; court,&nbsp; he took&nbsp; the present appeal.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; statement of&nbsp; facts&nbsp; that appellant was appointed policeman&nbsp; of Bacolod&nbsp; City&nbsp; on October 16,&nbsp; 1955; that&nbsp; he was not a civil service eligible and&nbsp; his&nbsp; appointment&nbsp; was&nbsp; merely&nbsp; temporary;&nbsp; that&nbsp; his position was newly created and&nbsp; the salary therefor was included in the city budget for the fiscal year 1955-1956, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; approved by the&nbsp; city council&nbsp; on November 14, 1955 and by the Secretary of Finance on January 18 of the following&nbsp; year;&nbsp; that previous to his dismissal he had never been accused of any crime or charged&nbsp; with any anomaly, irregularity or&nbsp; inefficiency in the performance of his duties;&nbsp; that&nbsp; though he had asked&nbsp; the mayor&nbsp; to reconsider his&nbsp; dismissal he did not appeal&nbsp; to the higher authorities;&nbsp; and that following his dismissal he&nbsp; was paid his total salary for the entire period of his service.<br><br>It is apparent at once that&nbsp; the appeal is without&nbsp; merit. Not being a civil service eligible and his appointment being merely temporary appellant could legally be dismissed at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cuadra <i>vs.</i> Cordova, 103&nbsp; Phil., 391; 54 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [35],&nbsp; 8063&nbsp; Galon <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Cordova, G. R. No.&nbsp; L-11515, November 29,&nbsp; 1958.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Though removed without previous investigation, he&nbsp; cannot invoke the protection&nbsp; accorded to municipal policemen by Republic Act No. 557 for the simple reason that he is a non-eligible.&nbsp; (Orais, et al <i>vs.</i> Ribo, et al., 98 Phil., 985, 49 Off. Gaz. 5386; Amora, et al., <i>vs.</i> Bibera,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., 99 Phil.,&nbsp; 1; 52 Off. Gaz., No.&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 3015.) And being merely a temporary employee and with no civil service eligibility, he&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; come&nbsp; under the constitutional guarantee against removal without cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Galon <i>vs.</i> Cordova, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, and cases cited therein.) As appellant's dismissal was lawful,&nbsp; his&nbsp; action for&nbsp; reinstatement and damages was properly dismissed.&nbsp; Appellant's case is, as a matter of fact, identical&nbsp; with&nbsp; those&nbsp; of Cuadra <i>vs.</i> Cordova and Galon <i>vs.</i> Cordova, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, which were decided last year.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision below is affirmed, but without special pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,</i> and <i>Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.&nbsp; JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
