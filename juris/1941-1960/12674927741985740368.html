				G.R. No. L-2852, June 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>VICTOR A. BOROVSKY, PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION AND THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Victor A. Borovsky, a stateless citizen though a Russian by 
birth according to his allegations, prays for release from the custody of the 
Director of Prisons, who holds him for purposes of deportation.
<p align="justify">In December, 1946, the President of the Philippines ordered 
petitioner's deportation as undesirable alien, after a proper investigation by 
the Deportation Board upon charges of being a vagrant and habitual drunkard, 
engaged in espionage activities, whose presence and conduct endangered the 
public interest. Pursuant to such order, Borovsky was placed aboard a vessel 
bound for Shanghai; but the authorities there declined to admit him for lack of 
the proper visa, which the Chinese consulate in this country had refused to 
give. Wherefore he was brought back to the Philippines. Thereafter he was 
temporarily released pending further arrangements for his banishment. And when 
subsequently a Russian boat called at Cebu, Borovsky was re-arrested and 
transported to Cebu for deportation; however, the captain of the boat declined 
to take him, explaining he had no permission from his government to do so. 
Wherefore the petitioner is now confined in .the premises of the New Bilibid 
Prisons—not exactly as a prisoner—while the Government is exerting efforts to 
ship him to a foreign country.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question as to the validity of the deportation 
decree. It must be admitted that temporary detention is a necessary step in the 
process of exclusion or expulsion of undesirable aliens and that pending 
arrangements for his deportation, the Government has the right to hold the 
undesirable alien under confinement for a reasonable length of time. However, 
under established precedents, too long a detention may justify the issuance of a 
writ of habeas corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">The meaning of "reasonable time" depends upon the 
circumstances, specially the difficulties of obtaining a passport, the 
availability of transportation, the diplomatic arrangements with the governments 
concerned and the efforts displayed to send the deportee away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Considering that this Government desires 
to expel the alien, and does not relish keeping him at the people's expense, we 
must presume it is making efforts to carry out the decree of exclusion by the 
highest officer of the land. On top of this presumption assurances were made 
during the oral argument that the Government is really trying to expedite the 
expulsion of this petitioner. On the other hand, the record fails to show how 
long he has been under confinement since the last time he was apprehended. 
Neither does he indicate neglected opportunities to send him abroad. And unless 
it is shown that the deportee is being indefinitely imprisoned under the 
pretense of awaiting a chance for deportation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> or unless the Government admits that it 
can not deport him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> or unless the 
detainee is being held for too long a period our courts will not interfere.</p>
<p align="justify">In the United States there were at least two instances in which 
courts fixed a time limit within which the imprisoned aliens should be 
deported<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>otherwise their release would 
be ordered by writ of habeas corpus. Nevertheless, supposing such precedents 
apply in this jurisdiction, still we have no sufficient data fairly to fix a 
definite deadline. Petition denied. No costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Montemayor, </i>and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, 
concur.</p>
<p align="justify">MORAN, C. J.:</p>
<p align="justify">I hereby certify that Mr. Justice Pablo voted to deny the 
petition.</p>

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PARAS, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">I agree to a temporary detention of a person to be deported, 
but said detention must be for a reasonable length of time. In this particular 
case, the deportation order was issued in 1946. If the Government is unable to 
carry out said order within a reasonable period, it should in the meantime 
release the petitioner, unless he has committed a crime, in which case the law 
should take its due course. The theory that the detention of a person is to 
prevent the commission of a crime, is more in consonance with the idea of 
concentrating suspected or would be criminal.. In a democracy, however, every 
person is entitled to freedom, subject to arrest only for actual commission of a 
crime. At most, I can agree to a further detention of the herein petitioner, 
provided that he be released if after six months, the Government is still unable 
to deport him.</p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, J.:</p>
<p align="justify">I concur in this dissenting opinion except that two months 
constitute, in my judgment, reasonable time.</p>
<p align="justify">FERIA, J.:</p> I dissent from the majority. The Government cannot indefinitely 
detain the petitioner until it may deport the petitioner, without violating the 
right of the petitioner not to be deprived of his liberty without due process of 
law.</div>
