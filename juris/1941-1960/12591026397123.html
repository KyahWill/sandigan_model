				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from the decision of  the  Court of First Instance of Cagayan in Naturalization  Case No. 23-A,  dismissing the petition by Ly Hong alias Pio Lee, for  admission  to Philippine citizenship.</p>
<p>In  his petition  filed  on  August 12,  1955,   Ly  Hong averred that he  is 46 years of age, having been born  in China on January 18, 1909; that he came to the Philippines around the year 1923,  having resided first in  the City of Manila,  thereafter in the municipality of Irosin, Sorsogon up to 1949, and from said year to  the  present  in the municipality  of Aparri,  Cagayan; that during the whole period of his residence in the Philippines, he has conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner, both  in his relations with his neighbors and with the duly constituted government; that he is married to one Salvacion Gerona,  a Filipina, and a native of Irosin,  Sorsogon, with  whom he  has four  (4)  children  all  born in this country, namely: Amelia,  10  years old; Lolita, 7 years; Edna, 5  years; and  Evelyn, 2 years, all surnamed Ly; that he  is the manager of the Redwood Company,  in the municipality of Aparri,  with  a yearly  salary  of F7,200, plus commission; that he is a citizen of China, under whose laws, Filipinos may become naturalized citizens or subjects thereof; that he has resided  continuously in the  Philippines for a period of more than thirty (30) years, to wit, since 1923; that he has  enrolled his  children of school age at the Aparri Chinese Kete School, which institution is  duly recognized by the Philippine Government; that he is  able to read and write the English language and, in addition, Tagalog and  the Bicol  dialect; that he  believes in the principles  underlying the  Philippine  Constitution;  that he has mingled socially with the Filipinos and has evinced a sincere desire  to learn and embrace the customs,  traditions  and ideals of  the Filipino people; and that he has all  the  qualifications  required under Section 2  and none of the  disqualifications mentioned in Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473.</p>
<p>Being sufficient in form and substance, the petition was given due course, and the required publications were  complied with.</p>
<p>On November  26, 1956, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Cagayan, without filing formal opposition to the petition, forwarded to the court a letter of a citizen, Lauro Villados, dated November 8, 1956, addressed to the Solicitor  Gen^ eral, opposing the petition  of Ly Hong and that of one Ong Ang, on  the ground that they have not  intermingled socially with Filipinos or evinced a sincere desire to learn and embrace our customs, traditions and ideals; that  they have not been paying their employees  in accordance  with the Minimum  Wage Law; that they frequent gambling  dens. and play prohibited games; and that their prime motive to become citizens is  to acquire the right to exploit our natural resources, especially forest products in the exploitation of which they are actively engaged.</p>
<p>At the trial, which was commenced on August 26, 1958, the petitioner presented his evidence, both oral and documentary,  to substantiate the  allegations  of  his petition. After the petitioner had nested his case, the assistant provincial fiscal sought leave to present Lauro  Villados to the witness stand, which  the court  granted  after the fiscal's manifestation that they were  adopting the opposition  of Villados as that  of the government.  Villados having testified, the trial was closed.</p>
<p>On  September  1,  1958,  the court  rendered  judgment dismissing Ly's petition for naturalization.   Said the court:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"While it may be true that the petitioner  has  shown that he  is entitled to be naturalized Filipino citizen in view of the evidence he has presented, still the fact remains that the testimony of Lauro Villados that the petitioner  has  played the prohibited  games of <em>pikiu and paya </em>and that the petition was filed in order that the petitioner  can exploit the natural resources of  the Philippines has not been denied, refuted or  contradicted by the  petitioner.  Since the evidence  of  the  government that the petitioner has played the prohibited games of <em>pikiu and paya</em> In a gambling club  in Aparri has not been disproved, the Court must necessarily accept the same as true and  accurate.  The failure, therefore, of the petitioner to deny the testimony of Lauro Villados is fatal to his petition.</p>
  <p>It having been  shown that  the  petitioner  has  frequented  a gambling club in  Aparri for  the last two years, the  Court finds that he has not conducted himself in a  proper and  irreproachable manner such that the Court has no alternative  except to dismiss his petition for  naturalization.</p>
  <p>Wherefore  the  Court dismisses the above entitled petition."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor General concurs with  the above  view of the trial court and  argues  against  the  reversal of  the judgment as prayed for by Ly Hong in this appeal.</p>
<p>The government's position  and that  of the  court a  quo should be upheld.   Lauro Villados, state witness, categorically charged petitioner with having operated  illegally forest concessions owned by  Filipinos  in violation of  our nationalization laws,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  and with having often indulged in gambling.  Elaborating on the second  charge, the witness testified  that,  on several  occasions, he saw Ly  play the Chinese games of <em>pikiu  and  paya </em>(games  of cards about two inches long  and  11Â½ centimeters wide) inside a gambling club  located at the commercial center  of the town and  operated  by a  certain  Chinese  woman.  Gambling, which is a  national offense and  penalized  as  a  crime against public morals  under Art. 195, et seq., of the Revised Penal Code, is not a minor transgression, as petitioner's counsel  would imply from his arguments,  especially for one who intends  one day to become a naturalized citizen. Indeed,  in frequenting a known gambling den, petitioner himself  has demonstrated that his conduct is not above reproach.</p>
<p>Petitioner's theory that a criminal conviction for gambling  is necessary in order that it may be considered a ground  for  denying  his  petition  for  naturalization  is unacceptable. The denial of his petition, it is to be noted, did not proceed on account of Section 4(<em>d</em>)  of Commonwealth Act No. 473, which disqualifies persons convicted of crimes involving  moral  turpitude  from being naturalized, but by virtue of Section 2  of the same Act, requiring, among other things,  that the  applicant "must  be of good moral character  *  *  *   and  must  have  conducted  himself in a proper and  irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in  the  Philippines," of which  he has been shown  to be  deficient.  The case of Daniel Ng Teng Lin vs. Republic, 103 Phil., 484; 56 Off. Gaz. (14) 2952 wherein this Court ruled that the filing of criminal charges (physical  injuries),  without proof  of  conviction,  is  no disqualification for an  accused to be naturalized,  is inapplicable in this instance,  since it  is there apparent that, except  for the fact that  the  petitioner therein  was criminally charged, no independent evidence  was introduced by the government why  his  petition  for naturalization should be denied; so that the presumption that a person is presumed  innocent  unless the contrary  is proved  was squarely  on  point.  Here,  however,  independent  proof establishing  petitioner's  lack  of  qualifications stands  on record.</p>
<p>Lastly, petitioner urges that it was error for the lower court to have given credibility to  the uncorroborated testimony of Lauro Villados.  Petitioner, however,  has not shown  any  sufficient  reason  why we  should doubt  the testimony of said witness, which, in  the words of  the trial court, "has not been denied, refuted or contradicted" by petitioner.  Questions as to the credibility of witnesses, moreover, rest primarily with the  trial court, and  unless the  latter failed to take into account some material  fact or circumstance in the case, its findings will  not be disturbed on appeal  (Tiu Bon Hui vs. Republic,  G. R. No. L-8730, November 19, 1956).</p>
<p>Finally, we  may well  restate  the  general  principle that the burden is on  the  applicant for naturalization to show that he satisfies  all the qualifications. and possesses none of  the disqualifications provided by law;  and if there is a doubt in the mind of the court, the same should be resolved against the grant of citizenship (see 3 C.J.S., sec.  122, pp. 833-834).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from should be, as it is hereby, affirmed.   Costs against the petitioner Sy Hong.</p>
