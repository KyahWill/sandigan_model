Alfredo S. Rebueno, No. 584 if said court, copy of which order was 
received by the plaintiff (herein petitioner) on August 14, 1951; that 
on August 16, 1951, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of
 said order which was denied by the Court of First Instance of Albay on 
August 25, 1951, copy of which resolution of denial was received by the 
petitioner on September 3, 1951; and that the order of dismissal being 
of a final and not interlocutory character, the petitioner should have
