				<H3>BETTING USHERS UNION (PLUM) PETITIONER, VS. JAI ALAI CORPORATION  OF THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE COURT OP INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal by certiorari&nbsp; from a&nbsp; resolution of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; dismissing a petition filed in that court by the Betting Usher's Union&nbsp; (PLUM) to have the Jai Alai Corporation of the Philippines pay its&nbsp; betting ushers&nbsp; the minimum wage fixed&nbsp; in&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 602.<br><br>As a background to the case,&nbsp; it should be stated that previous to the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of that petition, the&nbsp; acting&nbsp; chief of the WAS (Wage Administration&nbsp; Service, Department of Labor) had been&nbsp; investigating the Jai Alai Corporation with&nbsp; a view&nbsp; to&nbsp; determining its liability to pay&nbsp; minimum wage to its&nbsp; betting ushers,&nbsp; but&nbsp; upon complaint&nbsp; of the corporation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila—in Civil Case No. 24155 of that court—enjoined the investigation on&nbsp; the ground that the&nbsp; said betting&nbsp; ushers, who plied their trade under&nbsp; a concession, were not employees of the corporation and, therefore, not entitled to&nbsp; the legal minimum wage.&nbsp; In granting the injunction to&nbsp; stop the investigation,&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance at the&nbsp; same time&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Jai&nbsp; Alai&nbsp; Betting Ushers' Association which,&nbsp; having been made co-defendant in the action, had set&nbsp; up&nbsp; a&nbsp; counterclaim for P243,360 as&nbsp; total minimum wages&nbsp; already due its 65&nbsp; members.<br><br>From the judgment rendered in the said civil&nbsp; case, the acting chief of the WAS appealed to the Supreme Court, but the&nbsp; Betting&nbsp; Ushers' Association did not.&nbsp; What it did was&nbsp; to file a petition in the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations to have that court order the Jai Alai Corporation to pay the claim for minimum wages which had already been denied by the Court of First Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; For reasons which do not appear, the petition is in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of Betting Ushers'&nbsp; Union (PLUM).&nbsp; But&nbsp; there appears&nbsp; to be no&nbsp; question&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; union and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Jai&nbsp; Alai&nbsp; Betting Ushers' Association are one and the same thing.<br><br>Answering the petition, the corporation set up the defense of&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction,&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; lack of cause of action and (3) pendency of another case&nbsp; between the same parties in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; And then after the expiration of the association's period for appeal in that ease, the corporation amended its answer by&nbsp; converting&nbsp; the third defense&nbsp; (pendency&nbsp; of&nbsp; another suit)&nbsp; into one of&nbsp; <i>res judicata</i>—on&nbsp; the theory that the judgment in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; had&nbsp; already become final with respect to the association or&nbsp; union—and at the same time prayed that the preliminary issues&nbsp; raised in its three&nbsp; affirmative&nbsp; defenses,&nbsp; which also&nbsp; constituted grounds&nbsp; for&nbsp; a motion to dismiss, be ruled&nbsp; upon&nbsp; and resolved&nbsp; pursuant to section 5&nbsp; of Rule 8.<br><br>The general manager of the corporation&nbsp; having&nbsp; subsequently received a letter signed by&nbsp; 64 out of the 65 members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; union,&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; him to&nbsp; ask for the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of the case before the Industrial Court for lack of merit, the corporation filed a&nbsp; "supplemental motion to dismiss"&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to said letter as well&nbsp; as on the grounds&nbsp; of <i>res judicata</i> and lack of cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the union itself, by resolution of its members and&nbsp; acting through its board of directors, filed a motion for dismissal "with prejudice&nbsp; and without pronouncement as to costs."<br><br>Informed of the motion to dismiss, Attys.&nbsp; Rafael&nbsp; and Ilustre, who had theretofore been handling the case for the union, filed an opposition thereto, alleging that they had no knowledge of the letter sent by the 64 members of the union to the management of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; or of its&nbsp; authenticity and&nbsp; praying that resolution on the&nbsp; motion to dismiss be deferred until the union should have duly&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; either&nbsp; through&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; "or directly&nbsp; by&nbsp; proper notice of&nbsp; their&nbsp; lack of interest to prosecute."&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite&nbsp; this opposition,&nbsp; however, the Judge in charge of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; handed&nbsp; down&nbsp; an order on&nbsp; March 30, 1955, which reads:<br><blockquote>Acting on the motion for dismissal filed by the petitioner union, through&nbsp; its Board&nbsp; of Directors acting&nbsp; under&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of&nbsp; its members this case is, as it is hereby,&nbsp; dismissed with prejudice."</blockquote>On April 5, 1955 Attys.&nbsp; Rafael and Ilustre filed a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration, supporting it&nbsp; 8 days later with written&nbsp; argument in&nbsp; which, among&nbsp; other&nbsp; things, it is alleged that&nbsp; 40&nbsp; members of the union had not authorized the dismissal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case and that if they signed&nbsp; the letter to the general manager of the corporation,&nbsp; it was because&nbsp; the&nbsp; same was&nbsp; "imposed"&nbsp; (sic)&nbsp; upon them and on&nbsp; condition&nbsp; that&nbsp; they would&nbsp; be fully compensated&nbsp; for their&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; as shown&nbsp; by a&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; 40 members, dated&nbsp; April&nbsp; 2, 1955 attached to the&nbsp; written argument.<br><br>Opposing the motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; the corporation alleged that,&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to the assertion&nbsp; of Attys.&nbsp; Rafael and Ilustre, the dismissal was consented to and duly authorized by the members of the&nbsp; union; that the&nbsp; dismissal was without any condition; that&nbsp; the said attorneys were&nbsp; without authority to ask for&nbsp; a reconsideration of the dismissal as, the&nbsp; day following the said&nbsp; dismissal, they were by letter&nbsp; informed&nbsp; by the union through&nbsp; its board&nbsp; of directors&nbsp; that their&nbsp; services&nbsp; were&nbsp; being&nbsp; dispensed with; and that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the dismissal partook&nbsp; of&nbsp; the nature of a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; by&nbsp; consent, it became&nbsp; final upon promulgation and, therefore, no longer&nbsp; subject to reconsideration or appeal.&nbsp; In pleadings subsequently filed, with supporting affidavits from the members of the union,&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; also informed&nbsp; the&nbsp; court that subsequent to the resolution of April 2, 1955, purportedly signed by 40 members&nbsp; of the union&nbsp; and presented by the complaining attorneys as basis for their motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration, 28 of the signers thereof made statement under oath to the effect that it&nbsp; was&nbsp; their real&nbsp; desire to have the&nbsp; case dismissed for the&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were not&nbsp; really employees&nbsp; of the corporation&nbsp; and that if they&nbsp; signed the said resolution&nbsp; it&nbsp; was because they had&nbsp; been made to believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; its purpose was only&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; refund of one-half of the cost of their original&nbsp; uniforms.&nbsp; The corporation further informed the court&nbsp; that 28 more&nbsp; of the members of the union&nbsp; also&nbsp; signed sworn statements&nbsp; reiterating&nbsp; their desire to have the ease dismissed with prejudice and to abide by the decision of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, so that the total, number of those who had expressed&nbsp; their desire in favor of dismissal was 56, or more than four-fifths of the total union membership.<br><br>After considering the arguments adduced by&nbsp; both sides, the Industrial&nbsp; Court, sitting <i>en&nbsp; banc</i>,&nbsp; handed&nbsp; down its resolution, dated June 18,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; attorneys' motion&nbsp; for reconsideration.<br><br>From that resolution the aforementioned attorneys have appealed to this Court by certiorari,&nbsp; contending that the dismissal of the case was erroneous because (1)&nbsp; it in effect authorized a waiver of the legal right of the betting&nbsp; ushers to a minimum wage, (2) it denied due process by not allowing a trial on the merits, and (8) it foreclosed the question of jurisdiction.<br><br>The basic question to determine is whether the dismissal of&nbsp; the case was proper.<br><br>The record shows that the dismissal&nbsp; was decreed upon motion&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by the petitioning union itself, through its board of directors, acting in deference to the&nbsp; wishes of all the members of, the union except one as expressed in their resolution.&nbsp; Attys. Rafael and Ilustre tried to show by means of a resolution purportedly signed by 40 members of the union that&nbsp; the said 40 signers had&nbsp; not.&nbsp; authorized the dismissal of the case, alleging that the resolution for dismissal had been "imposed" upon them and that they were made to believe that they would be fully paid their claim for minimum wages.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it appears from the sworn statements of more than three-fourths of the 40 signers of the resolution presented by the attorneys that their signatures were affixed&nbsp; thereto under a misapprehension in that&nbsp; they had&nbsp; been made to believe that the object of the&nbsp; said resolution was only&nbsp; to secure reimbursement for one-half&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of&nbsp; their original&nbsp; uniforms,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; their&nbsp; real desire was to have&nbsp; the case dismissed because it lacked merit since&nbsp; they were not&nbsp; employees of the corporation. It appearing then that the&nbsp; dismissal was&nbsp; sought by the union&nbsp; itself&nbsp;&nbsp; acting through the&nbsp; instrumentality of its governing body and also in accordance with the&nbsp; wishes of an overwhelming majority of&nbsp; the members of the union, we do not think the lower court abused its&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; or violated&nbsp; any&nbsp; legal rule in&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; Surely, the&nbsp; will&nbsp; of&nbsp; one or&nbsp; several members&nbsp; of&nbsp; an association cannot be allowed to&nbsp; prevail over&nbsp; the&nbsp; will&nbsp; of the great majority. And it may well&nbsp; be questioned whether Attys. Rafael and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ilustre&nbsp; could still&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed authorized&nbsp; to ask for a reconsideration of the dismissal after they had been notified by the union that their services had already been dispensed with.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true that, as already held&nbsp; in several cases, once the case&nbsp; is in court with&nbsp; the requisite jurisdicfcional number&nbsp; of employees involved, jurisdiction over it is not lost upon the&nbsp; withdrawal of some of those employees from the&nbsp; union.&nbsp;&nbsp; But such&nbsp; is not&nbsp; the situation in the instant&nbsp; case, it not appearing that any of&nbsp; the dissenting members has withdrawn&nbsp; from the union.&nbsp; And as already stated, it was the union itself that asked for the dismissal of the case."<br><br>The objection on lack of due process on the ground that the movants&nbsp; for reconsideration were not heard is without basis, for&nbsp; we gather&nbsp; from the&nbsp; allegations in&nbsp; the answer&nbsp; of the corporation,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is not&nbsp; denied by the movants, that although a&nbsp; hearing was held Attys. Rafael and&nbsp; Ilustre did not appear thereat. Petitioner&nbsp; also&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; matter&nbsp; involved in&nbsp; the case dismissed&nbsp; below wag&nbsp; a labor dispute falling under the&nbsp; exclusive jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Industrial Court, but it is now idle to&nbsp; argue that point, the case having been dismissed on&nbsp; motion of the petitioning union itself.<br><br>It may&nbsp; here be stated that&nbsp; the appeal&nbsp; taken by the acting chief of the WAS from the&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; was dismissed&nbsp; by&nbsp; that court&nbsp; and the petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; mandamus&nbsp; to elevate the appeal&nbsp; here was denied by us in our decision&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1956.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the petition is denied, without special pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L</i>. and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur.&nbsp; </div>
