				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In connection with the application for registration of his land,
Domingo T. Parras was required by the Land Registration Commissioner to
remit to his (the Commissioner's) office, "pursuant to Paragraph 2,
page 445, Special Provisions of Republic Act No. 2300,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
otherwise known as the Appropriations Act for the current fiscal year",
the sum of P57.00 as estimated cost of publication in the Official
Gazette of the initial notice of the hearing of the case (Land
Registration Case No. N-2536, L. R. C. Record (No. N-17331, Court of
First Instance of Pangasinan.) Objecting to this requirement, the
applicant filed a petition in the land registration court claiming that
the insertion of the aforecited provision, which allegedly is
revenue-raising, in the appropriation act is unconstitutional, and thus
prayed that he be exempted from making such deposit and that the Land
Registration Commissioner and the Director of Printing be ordered to
publish in the Official Gazette the notice of initial hearing without
requiring applicant to pay the cost.
  <p> This petition was
opposed by the Land Registration Commissioner, contending, among
others, that the requirement to land registration applicants to pay the
cost of publication was not made for the first time in the disputed
Special Provisions of Republic Act 2300; that although under Section
114 of Act 496, as amended by Act 2866, where the value of the land to
be registered is less than P50,000.00, the applicant is exempted from
payment of the publication expenses, such exemption was eliminated with
the re-amendment of the same Section 114 by Republic Act 117.</p>
  <p>
Holding that Republic Act 117 amended Section 114 of Act 496 only
insofar as it increased the rates payable by the applicant, upon the
filing of the application and did not actually eliminate the exemption
now being claimed by the applicant, and that the insertion of the
revenue raising Paragraph 2, Special Provisions in the Appropriation
Act is unconstitutional, the Court ordered the Land Registration
Commissioner to publish the notice of initial hearing of the case in
the Official Gazette without requiring the applicant to pay the cost.
From this order, the Land Registration Commissioner appealed directly
to this Court on purely legal grounds.</p>
  <p>  Section 114 of the Land Registration Act, as amended by Act 2866, in its pertinent part, reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Sec. 114. Fees payable under this Act shall be as follows:</p>
    <p>"From the time of filing the application until the final determination of each case, for all <em>services performed by the clerk</em> or his deputies in each case, except the taking of affidavits or acknowledgments, <em>including filing</em>, entering, indexing, and recording all documents, plans, orders, decrees, and other papers, <em>all notices by mail or publication</em>, and a certified copy of the decree of registration, if any there be,<em> there shall be paid by the applicant to the clerk the sum in the following table</em>
corresponding to the value of the property, which shall be its assessed
value or, if the property has not been declared for purposes of the
land tax, its market value:</p>
    <p align="center"> * * *.</p>
    <p>"<em>Provided, however</em>,
That in all cases in which the assessed value of the property, or its
market value, if not assessed, covered by any proceeding, is <em>more
than fifty thousand pesos and the expenses incurred by the General Land
Registration Office for the preparation of the notice, the publication
thereof in the Official Gazette, and the stamps used in mailing copies
of said notice to the interested parties exceeds the sum paid as fees
under paragraphs</em> (7), (8), and (9)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the schedule above inserted, <em>such excess shall be refunded by the applicant</em> to the General Land Registration Office prior to the issuance of the final decree by the chief of said office: <em>Provided further</em>,
That in case of dismissal of the proceedings, the court shall issue an
order of execution against the applicant for the collection of the said
excess expense.</p>
    <p align="center"> * * *." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The above-quoted provisions are explicit that (1) the filing fees paid
to the clerk of court are for certain services which expressly include
the mailing or publication of all notices, and (2) that in case the
expenses for the mailing or publication of the notices exceeds the
filing fees paid and required for lands valued at more than P50,000.00,
the applicant will have to refund such excess to the land registration
office. In other words, an applicant for registration is exempt from
paying the cost of publication when his land is valued at less than
P50,000.00.</p>
  <p>    On the other hand, Republic Act 117,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
entitled AN ACT TO AMEND SECTION ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OF ACT
NUMBERED FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX, ENTITLED "THE LAND REGISTRATION
ACT," AS AMENDED, FIXING A NEW SCHEDULED OF FEES FOR CLERKS OF COURTS,
SHERIFFS AND REGISTERS OF DEEDS, in Section 1 thereof, provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Section
1. Section one hundred and fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and
ninety-six, entitled "The Land Registration Act', as amended, <em>is hereby further amended to read as follows</em>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>    'Sec. 114. Fees payable under this Act shall be as follows:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"A. Fees payable to the Clerk of Court.â€”The fees payable to the clerk of court or his deputies shall be as follows:</p>
    <p>"1.
For filing an application for the registration of land, the fees shall
be based on the assessed value of the property for the current year, in
accordance with the following schedule: (Then follows a schedule of
fees whose amounts depended upon the value of the land sought to be
registered.) (Italics supplied)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"> * * * * * * *."</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It will be seen that the new law has eliminated the provision which
specifically included the publication of the notices as within the
application of the fees paid by the applicant, as well as the express
injunction that applicants whose properties are worth more than
P50,000.00 shall reimburse the Clerk of Court for any excess in the
cost of publication over the amount of fees paid by them. The
suppression in the amendatory act of the provision exempting the
applicant from the obligation to pay for the cost of publication of his
application can not mean but a withdrawal by the legislature of such a
privilege allowed in the previous law. It can not be said, as ruled by
the lower court, that Republic Act 117, in amending Section 114 of Act
496, merely changed the rates of fees fixed in the original law. That
Congress intended Republic Act 117 to completely amend or replace
Section 114, as amended by Act 2866, in its entirety and not merely to
increase the rates of filing fees, is evident from the specific
provision thereof that the section was "further amended <em>to read as follows</em>:" Plainly, it is a re-enactment of the whole subject in-substitution of the previous one which thereafter disappears entirely.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
The intent of the legislature to set out the original act or section as
amended is most commonly indicated by a statement in the amendatory act
that the original law is amended, "to read as follows<em>:</em>" The legislature thereby declares that the new statute is a substitute for the original act or section. <em>Only those provisions of the original act or section repeated in the amendment are retained</em>. (1 Sutherland Statutory Construction, 3rd Ed., pp. 420-421.) (Italics supplied.)</p>
    <p>    When the amendatory act purports to set out the original act or section as amended, <em>all matters in the act or section that are omitted in the amendment are considered repealed</em>. (U. S. <i>vs.</i> One Ice Box, 37 F. [2d] 120 [N. D. 111. 1930]; Mitchell <i>vs.</i> Walden Motor Co., 235 Ala 34, 177 So 151 [1937]; Buckman <i>vs.</i> Board of Directors, 188 Ark 396, 66 Sw [2d] 619 (1934), and others.) (Italics supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It is clear, therefore, that after the enactment of Republic Act 117,
the cost of publication of the notice of initial hearing, required by
Section 31 of Act 496, shall be borne by the applicant. Needless to
state, in this connection, that Paragraph 2 of the Special Provisions
of Republic Act 2300 (Appropriation Law) is actually nothing more than
an express statement of the non-availability of funds for free
publication of notices, which is permissible, as a consequence of the
abrogation of the exemption clause in Section 114 of the Land
Registration Act.</p>
  <p> Wherefore, the order appealed from is set
aside, and applicant is hereby directed to pay the publication
expenses, as required by the Land Registration Commissioner. Costs are
taxed against the applicant-appellee. So ordered.</p>
