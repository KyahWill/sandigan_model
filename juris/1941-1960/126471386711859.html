				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija denying a motion for new  trial on the principal ground that the same has been filed out of time and for lack of merit.</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the facts of the case are as follows:   On April 24, 1953, the appellant was  convicted for the crime of serious  physical injuries with  damage to  property through reckless imprudence and  sentenced to suffer one (1) year and one (1) day of <em>prision correccional,</em> to pay  a fine  of P3,000  and to indemnify the  offended party, Marcelino Veneracion, in the  same amount, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in both cases,  and to pay  the costs.  On June 16,  1953, the decision was  pro mulgated and immediately thereafter, in open court and in the presence  of the acting provincial fiscal of Nueva Ecija,  appellant announced  his intention  to  appeal  and right away filed  a bond wherein he  stated that he  has appealed from the decision.  The  bond was on that  very day  approved by  the  court  and thus the appellant  was not committed to prison. The record of the case, however, Wfts  not transmitted  immediately to the  corresponding appellate court,  presumably  because the  appellant failed to file  a written notice of appeal as required by section 3 of Rule 118.  On July 16, 1953, appellant filed a motion for new trial on the  ground  that the  offended party, Marcelino Veneracion,  has, in an affidavit,  retracted from his testimony given  during the trial of the case, assumed the blame and exonerated the appellant from  the  charges brought against him in this case.  This motion was opposed by the provincial fiscal on the  ground  that it has no merit;  that  the  decision  rendered in this case  and duly promulgated has already become  final and executory because  appellant has not filed the written notice within the reglementary period of 15 days as required by section 3  of Rule 118 of the Rules  of Court and therefore  said motion  was  filed out  of time.   After   due  hearing,  the trial court denied it, hence this appeal.</p>
<p>It is contended by the  Solicitor General that the appeal should be dismissed because the  decision against the  appellant  became  final  15  days after  its promulgation on June 16,  1953, the  appellant  having not filed his written notice of appeal.  It  is alleged that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" * * *  The settled rule is that the appeal in a criminal case must  be perfected  in  the manner  and form prescribed  by law (section 3, Rule 118, Rules of Court), to  wit, by filing with the court  in which the judgment or order was rendered a notice stating the appeal and by serving a copy thereof  upon the adverse  party or his attorney (U.S. <em>vs.</em> Recano, 4 Phil. Rep., 91; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Torres, 8 Phil. Rep., 88;  U.S. <em>vs</em>. Rota, 9 Phil.  Rep., 426; U.S. <em>vs.</em>  Court of First Instance  of  Manila, 23 Phil. Rep.,  321; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Enriquez, 36 Phil. Rep., 725).  The word 'filing' as used  in  the foregoing provision of law means  the delivering to the corresponding  Clerk of Court  a written  notice  of the  accused's  intention to appeal (U.S.  <em>vs</em>.  Tenorio, 37 Phil., 7; Recano and Glory <em>vs.</em> Warden  of Tayabas, 54 Phil.,  821;  Elegado <em>vs</em>.  Tavora, 59 Phil.,  140; People <em>vs.</em> Fatriarca, G. R.  No. 45090,  March 30,  1937,  unpub., 64  Phil., 1055;  People <em>vs.</em> Natividad,  63 Phil., 336). Hence,  assuming for the sake of  argument to be true the claim made herein that the accused orally manifested his intention to appeal the case  at bar, his verbal  notice did not operate to  perfect his appeal.  Where a statute prescribes a  particular mode  of taking  an appeal, that mode must be strictly adhered to in order to confer  jurisdiction on the appellate court (U.S. <em>vs.</em>  Tenorio, 37 Phil., p. 7).  Appeals in  criminal cases  do not take place and are  not considered perfected  until  after the accused has personally  or  through  counsel filed with  the clerk  of  court  a written notice expressly  stating the appeal  (People <em>vs.</em> Natividad, 63 Phil.,  336).</p>
  <p>"The motion for new trial in the case at bar was filed one month after the judgment of conviction was promulgated, and judgment having become already  final.  The  failure, therefore,  to  comply with the law  (section 1,  Rule 117, Rules  of Court) that a  motion for new  trial can only be filed  before the judgment has  become final, that  is  within  15  days from the date of  promulgation, is fatal to the motion for new trial in question."<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant, in turn, claims  that  he has  perfected  his appeal in  this case  arguing that although  he failed  to file the written notice required by section 3 of Rule 113 i6f the Rules of Court, he has however announced in open court his intention to appeal and filed a bond on the very day the  decision was promulgated, where he has  clearly stated that he has appealed from  the  decision  rendered against him, and that the verbal notice of appeal, together with the  tiling  of the bond,  do  constitute substantial compliance with the requirements  of said  section 3  of Rule 118.</p>
<p>Obviously, if there has been  a perfected appeal, as  the appellant so Claims,  the decision in  this case  could  not have become final  and therefore a motion for  new trial might be filed  with the proper court.  Conversely, if  the decision  in this case has become final because the appeal taken by the appellant was not perfected, the motion  for new trial in question should be outright dimissed. Were we to follow strictly section 3 of Rule 118, as it has been interpreted by this Court in the decision invoked  by  the Solicitor General, there  is no alternative but to hold  that in  the present case  the appellant has  not  perfected  his appeal because he  has not filed the corresponding written notice of appeal as required thereby and by not serving a copy thereof upon the  provincial fiscal  of  Nueva Ecija. But it is  undisputed that  the herein  appellant gave  a verbal notice of appeal in open court and in the presence of  th6 provincial fiscal  of  Nueva Ecija  and filed a bond wherein  he stated  that he has appealed from the decision and that the bond was duly approved  by the court and thus he was not committed to prison.   Having these facts in  mind, we believe that appellant's contention that  he has substantially complied  with the requirements of section 3 of  Rule 118 should be given full  consideration, otherwise,  the herein appellant who  has been solicitous in  the protection of his rights may be deprived thereof. In  the case at  bar, therefore, section 3 of Rule 118 should be liberally applied, for its strict application may cause irreparable damage.</p>
<p>In reaching this conclusion, we are not  unmindful of our previous decisions  cited by  the Solicitor General in his brief, but the facts  and circumstances proven in those cases are not  similar to the facts and circumstances obtaining in the present  case.  The herein appellant never lost interest in his appeal and he should not be deprived of his  right  to appeal only because he has  not filed a written notice of  appeal, for he  has given  verbal notice thereof in open court and in the  presence of the adverse party and immediately  posted  a  bond for his provisional release  which was duly  approved by the  court  on the very day the decision was promulgated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we hold that in cases like the one at bar, when an accused manifests or gives notice of his intention to appeal in open court and files a bond for his provisional release,  within 15 days  from the promulgation  of the decision against him,  he may be considered as  having perfected his  appeal  notwithstanding his failure to file a written notice of appeal and to serve a copy thereof to the adverse party as required of  section 3 of Rule 118 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>Consequently, we hold that the disputed order denying the motion  for new trial filed by  the appellant should be reversed in so far as it declared that the decision in the case at  bar has become  final and therefore the motion for new trial was filed out of time,  for  there has been  substantial compliance of the law by  the appellant regarding the perfection  of appeal and consequently the  decision in this case has not yet become final.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the  disputed  order of the lower  court is hereby set aside in so far as it declared that the decision of this case has become final for lack of a perfected appeal taken by the appellant and that therefore the  motion for new trial was filed out of  time,  and the record  of  the case is  hereby remanded to the lower  court for  further proceedings in accordance with the provisions of Rule 118 of  the Rules of Court.</p>

REYES, J.  B. L., </strong></p>
<p>I concur in view of the fact that the  appeal bond that was filed before the fifteenth day from the promulgation of the judgment, expressly recites that the accused has appealed from  the trial Court's decision, and  hence it may be  regarded  as a  timely written notice of appeal  that satisfies the requirements  of the rule.</p>
