				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila dismissing plaintiff's complaint on the ground of prescription.<br><br>It appears that on various dates from January 19, 1949 to March 28, 1950,&nbsp; appellant, a&nbsp; domestic corporation engaged in importing and selling&nbsp; meat and&nbsp; meat products in the City of Manila,&nbsp; paid to&nbsp; said City&nbsp; inspection fees of the total amount of P3,553.33 levied under&nbsp; Ordinance No. 2991 of said City, approved on November&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1946; that on January 11,1951, the Secretary of Justice rendered an&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; declaring the&nbsp; said ordinance void as beyond the power of the&nbsp; City to enact, and in deference apparently to said opinion, the City, on October 31, 1952,&nbsp; approved Ordinance No. 3538, authorizing the refund in full&nbsp; of all meat inspection fees paid under&nbsp; Ordinance No.&nbsp; 2991, and appropriating funds for the&nbsp; purpose; that on November 20, 1952,&nbsp; appellant filed its claim&nbsp; with the City Treasurer for the refund of the inspection&nbsp; fees paid by it, but as the claim was disallowed, appellant on January 6, 1955 filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the City of Manila and the City Treasurer for the recovery of the amount claimed.<br><br>Answering the&nbsp; complaint, the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; set&nbsp; up&nbsp; the defense that the&nbsp; inspection fees&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be&nbsp; recovered were&nbsp; paid voluntarily&nbsp; and&nbsp; without&nbsp; any&nbsp; protest and&nbsp; that plaintiff's action had&nbsp; already prescribed.<br><br>Overruling the&nbsp; defense that the fees were&nbsp; paid&nbsp; voluntarily without&nbsp; protest, but&nbsp; upholding the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; prescription,&nbsp; the lower court, after trial, dismissed the&nbsp; action.<br><br>Hence, this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>The appeal is meritorious.&nbsp; This case is similar to&nbsp; that of Wise &amp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc<i>. vs.</i> City&nbsp; of Manila, et al. (101 Phil., 244; 54 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; [14], 4245) where this Court declared that the cause of action for the recovery of inspection&nbsp; fees paid&nbsp; under Ordinance&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2991 accrued&nbsp; on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 31, 1952 when Ordinance&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3538,&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; the&nbsp; refund thereof,&nbsp; was&nbsp; enacted.&nbsp; We there said:<br><blockquote>"The other ground&nbsp; of the motion to dismiss&nbsp; that&nbsp; the action is barred by the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; of limitations is not well&nbsp; taken.' The&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; alleges that Ordinance No. S53S,&nbsp; appropriating funds&nbsp; for and authorizing the refund of meat inspection fees illegally collected under Ordinance No.&nbsp; 2991, was enacted on&nbsp; 28 October&nbsp; and approved on 31 October 1952.&nbsp; Prom the last mentioned date, when the cause of action accrued, to&nbsp; 7 January 1955,&nbsp; when the complaint in&nbsp; the case was filed, only&nbsp; two years,&nbsp; two months and eight days&nbsp; had elapsed. Hence, whether the prescriptive period&nbsp; is six years under article&nbsp; 1145 of the new Civil Code, as&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiff, or four years&nbsp; under&nbsp; article 1146(1)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the new&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; or section 43, paragraph 3, of Act No. 190, as claimed by the defendants the action was&nbsp; not barred by the&nbsp; statute of limitations."<br></blockquote>From&nbsp; the above&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; is clear&nbsp; that&nbsp; when plaintiff's complaint was filed on January 6, 1955, its&nbsp; action had not yet prescribed,<br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from must,&nbsp; therefore be&nbsp; as it is hereby, revoked, and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is ordered that judgment be rendered for&nbsp; the refund of&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P3,553.33 claimed Araneta and&nbsp; Uy&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Commonwealth Ins.&nbsp; Co., et al. by plaintiff, with legal interest from the date of the filing of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint as therein prayed.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; special pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
