				<H3>PABLO ESPANOLA, PETITIONER,  VS. VICENTE T.  SINGSON, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner&nbsp; Pablo Espanola&nbsp; is the offended party in two criminal&nbsp; cases pending in the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; court of Aritao, Nueva&nbsp; Vizcaya,&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 120&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; 121, for less serious physical injuries and oral defamation, respectively. The accused&nbsp; in said criminal cases are the municipal mayor, a councilor and some policemen of the town.&nbsp; When&nbsp; these two criminal cases were called for trial before the Justice of the Peace, respondent Vicente T. Singson, the accused challenged the right of counsel for petitioner to&nbsp; appear in the trial, alleging that&nbsp; petitioner had expressly reserved his right to present an independent civil action for damages arising from the offenses charged.&nbsp; Respondent Justice of the Peace sustained the objection of the accused, and upon&nbsp; denial&nbsp; by him of a motion for reconsideration, the petitioner instituted the present action for&nbsp; certiorari to annul the order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respondent Justice of the Peace denying him the right to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; by counsel in the said criminal cases. <br><br>The petition must be&nbsp; denied following our recent decision in the case of Gorospe, et&nbsp; al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gatmaitan.et al., .supra, p. 600, where we said through Mr. Justice Bautista:<br><blockquote>"It therefore appears from the foregoing that an offended party loses Ms right to intervene in the prosecution of&nbsp; a criminal case, not only when he has waived the civil action or expressly reserved his&nbsp; right to institute&nbsp; it, but also when he has actually instituted the&nbsp; civil action even if he&nbsp; has&nbsp; not made the waiver or&nbsp; reservation above adverted to.&nbsp; This ruling is further strengthened by&nbsp; article 83 of the new Civil Code which provides that 'In cases&nbsp; of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate&nbsp; and distinct&nbsp; from the&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; action,&nbsp; may&nbsp; be brought by&nbsp; the&nbsp; injured party', and that such&nbsp; action may proceed independently of the criminal and for its determination preponderance of evidence would suffice.&nbsp; The present&nbsp; ease comes within the purview of&nbsp; this provision."<br></blockquote>The petition is hereby&nbsp; denied,&nbsp; with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Par√°s, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
