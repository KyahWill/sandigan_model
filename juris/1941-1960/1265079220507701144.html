				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 31,&nbsp; 1955, Domitila&nbsp; Angeles filed a verified petition in Cadastral Case No.&nbsp; 11, Record No. 18 of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, under the provisions of Section 112 of&nbsp; the Land Registration Act, wherein she alleged&nbsp; that she be declared the only&nbsp; heir&nbsp; of spouses Santiago Angeles&nbsp; and Anastacia Guevarra;&nbsp; that on&nbsp; June 20, 1929, said spouses bought Lot 848 of the Cadastral Survey of Bacolor from Paulina Angeles, wife of Eulalio Razon, in whose names&nbsp; said lot was registered under Original Certificate of&nbsp; Title No. 8168; that the heirs of Eulalio&nbsp; Razon upon his death were Pedro, Felix, Bernardina, Maria,&nbsp; Paula, Antonina, Lorenza,&nbsp; Gaudencio&nbsp; and Antonino, all surnamed Razon, the first five being his children by his first wife and the last&nbsp; four&nbsp; his children by his second wife; that said heirs sold&nbsp; their rights, shares and interests in said lot to Ignacio Angeles who in turn ceded verbally all his rights to his nephew Santiago Angeles, father of&nbsp; Domitila; that Domitila Angeles has been in possession of aid&nbsp; lot and the house erected thereon for the last thirty (30)&nbsp; years.&nbsp; In&nbsp; said petition, Domitila Angeles prayed that Original Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 8168 in the&nbsp; name of Eulalio Razon be cancelled and in&nbsp; lieu thereof&nbsp; a transfer certificate of title be issued in her name.<br><br>On September 23, 1955, Pedro Razon, Bernardina Razon, Marcela Ordoñez, Leonora Ordonez, Mercedes Ordoñez, Jose Ordoñez, Maria Olalia,&nbsp; Francisca&nbsp; Maglalang, Pastor Maglalang, Crisanta Maglalang, and Anselma&nbsp; Maglalang filed an opposition claiming that they are the only children and direct descendants&nbsp; of Eulalio Razon; that the latter was the original and exclusive owner of said lot No. 848; that they are the owners of 5/6 of said lot while the remaining 1/6 is the only share of petitioner Domitila Angeles; that Eulalio&nbsp; Razon is&nbsp; already&nbsp; dead and is survived by six children,&nbsp; to wit: Felix, Bernardina, Maria, Justa,&nbsp; Pedro, and Paula, all surnamed Razon; that Felix Razon&nbsp; is also dead but&nbsp; is survived by his son Pedro Razon,&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the oppositors herein;&nbsp; that Maria Razon is also dead&nbsp; but is survived&nbsp; by four legitimate&nbsp; children, Marcela, Leonora, Mercedes, and Jose,&nbsp; all surnamed Ordonez, who are also oppositors herein;&nbsp; that Justa Razon is also dead&nbsp; but is survived by her only&nbsp; daughter Maria Olalia, also oppositor herein; that Pedro Razon is also dead but is survived by his five children whose names were&nbsp; not stated&nbsp; in the opposition&nbsp; for the reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; Pedro Razon already&nbsp; sold his 1/6 share to Ignacio Angeles; and that Paula&nbsp; Razon is now dead but is survived by&nbsp; her four children,&nbsp; Francisca,&nbsp; Pastor, Crisanta and Anselma, all&nbsp; surnamed Maglalang, also oppositors herein.&nbsp; The&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; was based on the claim that the deed of donation&nbsp; executed in favor of Pedro&nbsp; Razon by his brothers and sisters and on&nbsp; which petitioner bases her right of ownership over the property in question is null and void because it was not contained in a public instrument,&nbsp; did not&nbsp; contain the signature of the alleged donors, nor was it accepted by the donee as required by law.<br><br>During the hearing, the parties&nbsp; presented documentary evidence and submitted&nbsp; the case for decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on October 21, 1955, oppositors filed a motion&nbsp; to dismiss impugning the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter for the&nbsp; reason that the&nbsp; ownership of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot of which petitioner&nbsp; claims to be the absolute&nbsp; owner and for which she asks that&nbsp; a new title be issued in&nbsp; her&nbsp; favor is seriously disputed and, therefore, the&nbsp; same can only be threshed out&nbsp; in an ordinary action.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court sustained&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; and dismissed the petition accordingly.&nbsp; After petitioner&nbsp; has taken the case on appeal to the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; certified the case to this&nbsp; Court on the ground that only questions of law are involved.<br><br>There is no dispute that the petition in question was filed in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Pampanga&nbsp; in&nbsp; its capacity as cadastral&nbsp; court because its&nbsp; purpose is to ask for the cancellation of&nbsp; Original&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Title No. 8168 issued in the name of Eulalio Razon and the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in&nbsp; the name of petitioner under the provisions of Section 112 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Land: Registration Law.&nbsp; Such being the case, it is evident that the trial court has no jurisdiction to act thereon&nbsp; it appearing that the ownership of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; covered by the Torrens title is controverted and under our law&nbsp; and&nbsp; jurisprudence should be threshed&nbsp; out in an ordinary action.<br><br>Thus, this Court has held that&nbsp; "the lower court did not err in finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; it lacks jurisdiction to entertain the present petition for the simple&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that it&nbsp; involves a controversial issue which takes this case out of&nbsp; the&nbsp; scope of section 112 of Act No. 496.&nbsp; While this section, among, other things,&nbsp; authorizes a&nbsp; person in interest to ask the court for erasure, alteration, or amendment of a&nbsp; certificate of title 'upon&nbsp; the ground that registered interests of any. description, whether vested, contingent, expectant, or inchoate,&nbsp; have terminated and&nbsp; ceased'&nbsp; and apparently the petition&nbsp; comes under&nbsp; its scope,&nbsp; such relief&nbsp; can only&nbsp; be granted if there is unanimity&nbsp; among the parties, or there is no adverse claim or&nbsp; serious objections on&nbsp; the part&nbsp; of any party in interest;&nbsp; otherwise the&nbsp; case becomes controversial and should be threshed out in an ordinary case or in the case where the incident&nbsp; properly belongs.<br><br>Thus, it was&nbsp; held that 'It is&nbsp; not proper to cancel&nbsp; an original certificate of Torrens&nbsp; title issued exclusively in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of a deceased person, and to issue a new certificate in the name of his heirs,&nbsp; under the provisions of section 112&nbsp; of Act No. 496,&nbsp; when the surviving spouse&nbsp; claims right&nbsp; of ownership over the land&nbsp; covered by said certificate.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Jimenez, <i>vs.</i> Castro, 40 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [G. R. No. 3,1st Sup.], p. 80.)&nbsp; And, in another case, where there was a serious&nbsp; controversy between the parties as to the&nbsp; right of ownership over the properties involved,&nbsp; this court&nbsp; held 'that following&nbsp; the principle laid down in the decision above cited, the issues herein should be ventilated in a regular action, as was done in the case of Montilla <i>vs.</i> Jalandoni (TA-R. G. No. 3133) above mentioned.'&nbsp; (Government of the Philippines <i>vs.</i> Jalandoni, 44 Off. Gaz., 1837.)"&nbsp; (Tangunan <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines 94 Phil.,&nbsp; 171; 50 Off. Gaz., No. 1, p. 115).<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
