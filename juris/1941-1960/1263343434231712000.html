				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On  August 30, 1955, in Civil  Case  No. 22152  of the Court of First Instance of Manila, in  which  respondent Rufino P. Halili  is the plaintiff and  petitioners Victoria D. Miailhe, et al. are defendants,  the  trial court rendered judgment against the plaintiff as  follows: <br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered  in  favor of  the defendants and  against the plaintiff, ordering the latter to pay the former the sum of  P3,100  a monthly rental for the occupation of the lot described in  Exhibit A during  the last two years of the lease, that is, from December 1,  1953 to November 30, 1955 and to pay the costs." </blockquote>From the above  judgment, plaintiff Rufino P. Halili appealed to the  Court of  Appeals, but  because  the amount involved is  P77,400, excluding damages  and interests, the appeal  was  certified  by  the  Court   of  Appeals to  this Court and  docketed  herein as G.  R.  No.  L-13229. <br><br>In  the  meantime,  during the pendency  of  the  appeal, defendants  Miailhe, et  al.  applied for the issuance  of a writ  of execution pending  appeal unless plaintiff  Halili furnish a supersedeas bond.   The trial court granted the application,  and  as Halili  failed  to  furnish  the  bond, writ of execution was issued  on  October 22, 1955,  and a first and  second  <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span>  writs  on  October  10, 1956  and March 13, 1957 respectively.  Claiming that the trial court acted without  or  in excess of jurisdiction  or  with  grave abuse of discretion in issuing  the execution orders,  plaintiff Rufino P.  Halili and his wife Josefina Punsalan  filed a petition for  <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> with  prohibition and preliminary injunction with  the  Court  of Appeals  for the nullification of said  writs  of execution  (C. A.-G.  R. No. 20328-R). The petition was  given  due course and  a writ of preliminary injunction  was  issued.   Respondents Victoria Miailhe,  et  al, asked for, the dismissal of  the petition on the ground that the Court  of Appeals has no jurisdiction over the  subject-matter  thereof,  but  the  Court of Appeals refused to dismiss the  same, holding that although the main case involves an amount beyond its jurisdiction, the issue in the  petition for certiorari is simply the alleged grave  abuse  of discretion committed  by  the  lower court in  issuing  writs  of  execution pending appeal.  Having failed  to  obtain reconsideration of the ruling of the Court of Appeals, respondents filed the  present petition for certiorari with this Court.<br><br>We  agree with the petitioners that the Court of Appeals erred  in  holding that it has jurisdiction to entertain the petition in  question. <br><br>Under sec.  30 of the Judiciary Act of  1948, as amended, as well as  sec.  4 of Rule  67, Rules of Court, the original jurisdiction of  the Court of Appeals  to issue  writs of mandamus,  prohibition, injunction, certiorari,  habeas  corpus, and all  other auxiliary writs  and  processes limited to cases where the issuance thereof would be  "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction."   Explaining the phrase "in aid of its  appellate jurisdiction", former Chief Justice Moran wrote  in  his  commentaries on the Rules  of Court: <br><blockquote>"A writ of mandamus, prohibition or certiorari against a lower court is said to  be  in  aid of  the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals  within the  meaning of  section  30  of  Republic Act No. 296, if the  Court of  Appeals has jurisdiction to review, by appeal  or writ of error,  the final orders or decision of the former,  and said writs are issued by the Court  of Appeals in the exercise of its supervisory power or jurisdiction  over  the wrongful acts or  omissions  of  the lower court that   are not  appealable. But if the Court of Appeals has no appellate  jurisdiction it could not issue writs of mandamus, prohibition or  certiorari  in aid of an appellate  jurisdiction which it does not have.  In other words, the supervisory  power or jurisdiction of  the  Court of  Appeals to issue  mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari in  aid of  its appellate jurisdiction must co-exist with and  be  a  complement  to  its appellate jurisdiction to review, by appeal  or  writ of error, the  final orders and decisions of the lower court, in order to have a  complete supervision over the acts of the latter."  (II Moran, Rules of Court, 1957 Ed., pp. 192-193)</blockquote> In line with the above commentary, we have repeatedly held that the basis of the  jurisdiction  of the  Court of Appeals to  issue writs of mandamus, certiorari,  prohibition,  etc. is its power to review the  final judgment in the main case.   That is, the  Court of Appeals would have jurisdiction to  issue  said writs  if  an appeal  could be made to said Court from the judgment of  the lower court in the main case (Roldan <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Villaroman, 69 Phil., 12; Breslin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Luzon Stevedoring Co.,  84  Phil., 618; 47 Off.  Gaz., 1170; Pineda &amp; Ampil Mfg. Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Bartolome, 95 Phil., 930). <br><br>In the instant case,  while it  may be true that the  issue raised by  respondent's complaint in  the  court below is limited to the question of the just and reasonable monthly rental for  the premises he is leasing from the petitioners, the latter,  however, in their counterclaim, had  asked for the payment of all rentals  due and  unpaid by  plaintiff which, as found by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, amounted to  P77,400, and accordingly, plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendants  this  amount, exclusive  of damages  and   interests. Clearly  then, the  amount involved in  the  main judgment is beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and the appeal therefrom is cognizable  by, as in fact it is pending before,  this Court.  As the Court of Appeals has no appellate jurisdiction over the judgment in  the  main  case, so it can have no  jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to enjoin execution thereof  pending  appeal.  Otherwise, issuance thereof by said Court would be in  aid of  an appellate jurisdiction that does not exist. <br><br>Wherefore, Case G. R. No.  20328-R of the  Court of Appeals entitled "Rufino Halili, et  al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hon. Froilan Bayona, et al." is ordered  dismissed  for lack of jurisdiction of said court  to entertain  the petition, and  all orders already  issued  therein by the  Court  of Appeals are declared null and  void.  Costs against respondent  Rufino P. Halili and  Josefina  Punsalan.   So ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
