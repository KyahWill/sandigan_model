				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> Appeal from the order dated April 5, 1957, of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija&nbsp; in Special Proceedings No. 972,&nbsp; which&nbsp; reads as follows:</p> <blockquote><p>"This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion for&nbsp;&nbsp; partial&nbsp; partition&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; distribution. The parties having agreed that only the&nbsp; heirs Dominica&nbsp; Medina. and Gorgonio&nbsp; Medina&nbsp; be given an advance payment of P1,000.00 from the cash&nbsp; deposit,&nbsp; and they, as well as the other heirs twenty-five cavans of palay each for their subsistence, to be included in the final distribution of the residue of the estate, the administrator is hereby ordered to advance to&nbsp; Dominica Medina and Gorgonio Medina the amount of P1,000.00,&nbsp; each,&nbsp; from the cash&nbsp; deposit of the estate, and twenty-five cavans each&nbsp; to all&nbsp; the five heirs for their subsistence, pending&nbsp; the liquidation&nbsp; of the said estate, provided that the same shall be collated in&nbsp; the final distribution of shares among the heirs";</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp; and from the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; April 29, 1957, denying for&nbsp; lack of merit&nbsp; appellant's motion for reconsideration.</p> <p>&nbsp; The records disclose that the following proceedings were had in the lower court:</p> <p>&nbsp; On March 10,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; Felicisimo Gatmaitan filed a petition, seeking his appointment as&nbsp; administrator of the property of his wife, Veronica Medina, who died intestate. On April 2, 1956, Gorgonio Medina and Dominica Medina, as heirs of the&nbsp; deceased (she being their full-blood sister), filed an opposition,&nbsp; praying&nbsp; that Gorgonio&nbsp; Medina,&nbsp; or a neutral third party, or Felicisimo Gatmaitan and Gorgonio Medina, jointly, be appointed as administrator or administrators of the estate.&nbsp; In an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated July 18,&nbsp; 1956, the court appointed Felicisimo Gatmaitan as administrator of the estate with&nbsp; a bond in the amount of&nbsp; P2,000.00 and&nbsp; Gorgonio Medina&nbsp; as co-administrator without compensation and bond.</p> <p>&nbsp; On March 14, 1957, administrator Gatmaitan filed an amended&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; of the estate left by&nbsp; the deceased consisting of an undivided half of the conjugal&nbsp; partnership properties&nbsp; and&nbsp; amounting&nbsp; all in&nbsp; all to P31,336.60.&nbsp; An opposition&nbsp; to the admission of said inventory was registered by the oppositors on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; the same did not represent the true and faithful list of the properties left by the deceased,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; particularly, that a&nbsp; parcel of twenty-two (22) hectares of land, more or less, was left but.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opposition,&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; and&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the amended inventory was, in&nbsp; an order dated April 29,&nbsp; 1957, postponed&nbsp; until further&nbsp; assignment.</p> <p>&nbsp; On April 2, 1957, the heirs of the deceased, through counsel, filed a "Motion for Partial Partition&nbsp; and Distribution", stating that the&nbsp; estate had no debts and the heirs were all&nbsp; of legal&nbsp; age; that some of&nbsp; them&nbsp; were necessitous and in&nbsp; need of cash; and praying that the share&nbsp; corresponding to each&nbsp; of the heirs&nbsp; in the palay produce for the&nbsp; agricultural year 1956-1957, as well as the cash deposit in the different banks, be ordered partially distributed among the heirs pending the final&nbsp; distribution of the estate.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court heard counsel for administrator Gatmaitan and&nbsp; for&nbsp; the heirs or oppositors,&nbsp; but without receiving any evidence whatsoever, promulgated on April 5, 1957&nbsp; the order subject-matter&nbsp; of the instant&nbsp; appeal. On April 26, 1957,&nbsp; the administrator, Gatmaitan, filed a motion for reconsideration, calling attention&nbsp; to the&nbsp; fact that, contrary to what the order states, "he has not agreed to the partial distribution of the estate in the manner contained&nbsp; in the order", and urging that "the sums ordered&nbsp; to he partially distributed&nbsp; are not warranted by the circumstances obtaining" in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case and&nbsp; that, moreover, "the manner&nbsp; of distribution will work difficulties to the estate and to the heirs themselves". As previously indicated, this motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied by&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; P. Montesa&nbsp; for lack of merit.</p> <p>&nbsp; Gatmaitan filed&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of appeal&nbsp; from the foregoing orders.&nbsp; On May 17, 1957,&nbsp; appellant filed the record on appeal and notified counsel for the oppositors&nbsp; of&nbsp; the date he would move for the approval&nbsp; thereof by&nbsp; the court.&nbsp; The order of Judge Felix Makasiar,&nbsp; dated July 15,&nbsp; 1957, approving the record&nbsp; on appeal presented by appellant, states that counsel&nbsp; for the&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; had failed to file written opposition&nbsp; thereto as&nbsp; required in the order&nbsp; of the court dated June 12, 1957, notwithstanding the length of time that had already elapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his&nbsp; brief, appellant only made one assignment of error, and it reads thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The lower&nbsp; court gravely abused&nbsp; its discretion in directing a partial distribution of&nbsp; the intestate estate of the&nbsp; deceased Veronica Medina in favor&nbsp; of appellees, under its order of April 5,&nbsp; 1957, without requiring the distributees to file the proper bonds pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions of Rule&nbsp; 91, Section 1 of the&nbsp; Revised Rules&nbsp; of Court."</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp; This appeal was originally taken to the Court of Appeals, but, since there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; serious&nbsp; issue&nbsp; of fact involved&nbsp; in the case, the same&nbsp; was certified&nbsp; to&nbsp; us pursuant to the appellate&nbsp; court's resolution of August 28,&nbsp; 1958.</p> <p>&nbsp; The&nbsp; lower court, we believe, erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; rendering the order appealed from. A partial distribution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>of the&nbsp; decedent's&nbsp; estate pending the final termination of the testate or&nbsp; intestate proceedings should as much&nbsp; as possible be discouraged by the&nbsp; courts and,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; in&nbsp; extreme cases, such form of advances&nbsp; of inheritance should not be countenanced.&nbsp; The reason&nbsp; for this strict&nbsp; rule is obvious—courts should guard with utmost&nbsp; zeal&nbsp; and jealousy the estate&nbsp; of the decedent to the end that the creditors thereof be&nbsp; adequately protected and&nbsp; all the rightful heirs assured of their shares in the inheritance.</p> <p>&nbsp; Why the appealed order is unwarranted is&nbsp; evident on three counts. <i>Firstly</i>, to our mind, the partial distribution was prematurely ordered by&nbsp; the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that at the time the questioned order was rendered, the amended inventory and appraisal filed by the administrator-appellant was not yet&nbsp; even accepted, and it was still under consideration by the&nbsp; court, in view of an opposition to the admission thereof by some of the heirs.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; it seems that notices for&nbsp; the presentation of claims by&nbsp; possible creditors of the estate had not yet been published, so that the period for&nbsp; the presentation of claims had not as yet elapsed.&nbsp; Consequently, it cannot be safely said that the court had a sufficient basis&nbsp; upon which&nbsp; to order a partial distribution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties, having&nbsp; in mind the adverse effects that it might have on the rights of the creditors and the heirs&nbsp; alike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As pointed out by the appellant,&nbsp; there are indications that&nbsp; the fruits and cash&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; ordered to be partially&nbsp; distributed&nbsp; would be in excess of the distributees' full&nbsp; inheritance from the estate.&nbsp; The inventory, as&nbsp; filed,&nbsp; showed a total sum&nbsp; of P31,336.60 that actually represents&nbsp; the&nbsp; conjugal&nbsp; partnership assets, half of which&nbsp; belongs&nbsp; to the surviving spouse. Said&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; does&nbsp; not embody any Seductions&nbsp; for such expenses&nbsp; as funeral&nbsp; charges, inheritance&nbsp; taxes,&nbsp; expenses for administration or&nbsp; an estimate&nbsp; of&nbsp; probable&nbsp; debts&nbsp; of the estate.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is worthwhile to state&nbsp; in&nbsp; this connection that besides the appellant, as the&nbsp; surviving spouse&nbsp; of the decedent, there are&nbsp; about&nbsp; eight others, all claiming&nbsp; to&nbsp; be lawful heirs and seeking&nbsp; respective shares in the estate, five of whom&nbsp; are alleged full-blood brothers and sisters and three half-blood brothers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Medina. It should be noted that the appellees, being&nbsp; brothers and sisters of the deceased, are not entitled to allowances for support, such as the court is authorized to provide, under Section&nbsp; 3 of Rule&nbsp;&nbsp; 84&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; for the widow and the children<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the deceased during the&nbsp; settlement&nbsp; of estate proceedings,&nbsp; to be&nbsp; deducted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the respective shares&nbsp; of the participants.</p> <p>&nbsp; Second, and more important,&nbsp; no&nbsp; bond was&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; by the court as a condition precedent to the partial distribution ordered by it,&nbsp; a bond which, because of the reasons already&nbsp; adduced,&nbsp; becomes all the more imperative.</p> <p>&nbsp; Rule 91, Section&nbsp; 1 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court,&nbsp; specifically provides&nbsp; as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"When&nbsp; the debts, funeral charges, and expenses of administration, the&nbsp; allowances to the widow, and inheritance tax, if any, chargeable to the estate in accordance with law, have been paid, the court, on the&nbsp; application of the&nbsp; executor&nbsp; or administrator, or of a&nbsp; person interested in the estate, and after hearing upon notice, shall assign the&nbsp; residue&nbsp; of the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; to&nbsp; the persons&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; the same, naming&nbsp; them and&nbsp; the proportions, or&nbsp; parts,&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; each&nbsp; is entitled, and such persons may demand and recover their respective shares&nbsp; from the executor or administrator,&nbsp; or any other&nbsp; person having the same in his possession. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p> <p>&nbsp; <i>No distribution shall be&nbsp; allowed until the payment of the obligations</i> above mentioned <i>has&nbsp; been made</i> or provided&nbsp; for, <i>unless the distributees</i> or any&nbsp; of&nbsp; them, <i>give a bond</i>, in a sum to be fixed by the court, conditioned&nbsp; for the payment of said obligations within such time as the court directs." (Italics supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp; Appellees contend that&nbsp; the order of partial distribution having been issued pursuant to an agreement of the&nbsp; parties, the same&nbsp; could not now be assailed&nbsp; by the appellant. While the wording&nbsp; of the appealed order&nbsp; seem to indicate that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; with&nbsp; the conformity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the heirs, there&nbsp; is reason&nbsp; to believe that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; just a&nbsp; mistaken impression on the part of the court.&nbsp; Soon after the order was rendered, the&nbsp; administrator-appellant filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration, among other things,&nbsp; calling the attention&nbsp; of the court that&nbsp; he never agreed to the partial distribution of the estate in the manner ordained in the appealed&nbsp; order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; for lack of merit, the court did not&nbsp; deny categorically appellant's&nbsp; imputation, which&nbsp; could have easily been&nbsp; averred to by&nbsp; it; nor did the appellees at any time prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; this appeal controvert the aforesaid allegation of the&nbsp; administrator.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; plausibility&nbsp; in&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; statement that the agreement&nbsp; referred to in the&nbsp; order was&nbsp; actually one&nbsp; between the appellees among themselves.</p> <p>&nbsp; It should&nbsp; be&nbsp; noted, furthermore, that the bond required b£ the Rules is not solely for the protection of the heirs tjfien appearing, but also&nbsp; for the benefit of creditors&nbsp; and subsequent claimants who have not agreed&nbsp; to the advances.</p> <p>&nbsp; As to the&nbsp; argument that the order in question is merely interlocutory and therefore&nbsp; not appealable, we find&nbsp; that the objection was not seasonably&nbsp; interposed by the appellees.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Salazar <i>vs.</i> Salazar, G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5823, April 29, 1953,&nbsp; it was held,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The motion to dismiss filed by appellee during the pendency of this appeal on the ground that the order&nbsp; appealed from is not appealable because it is merely interlocutory, cannot be entertained. While an order denying or granting alimony <i>pendente lite</i> is interlocutory and consequently non-appealable * * * ,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; if appeal is taken&nbsp; therefrom, and no timely objection is&nbsp; interposed thereto, the objection is deemed waived.&nbsp; Thus, when the objection is founded on the ground that the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is interlocutory, but the appellee, before making such&nbsp; objection, has allowed the record on appeal&nbsp; to be approved and printed, and has allowed the appellant to print his brief, such objection is too&nbsp; late and is deemed waived (Slade-Perkins <i>vs.</i> Perkins, 57 Phil., 223, 225; Luengo &amp; Martinez <i>vs</i>. Herrero, 17 Phil., 29; Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 1, 1952 ed., p. 987)."</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp; Lastly, appellees urge that this appeal was prematurely taken&nbsp; in that&nbsp; appellant has not as&nbsp; yet formally objected to the proffered bond as mentioned in an alleged order of the court, dated&nbsp; May&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; which appellees&nbsp; have quoted in their brief, as&nbsp; follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Atty.&nbsp; Cesar Francisco, counsel for&nbsp; the administrator, is hereby given one week from today within which to file his manifestation as to whether the administrator&nbsp; is willing to withdraw his appeal from the order dated&nbsp; April&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; provided&nbsp; Atty. V.&nbsp; M.&nbsp; Ruiz files a bond in the amount of&nbsp; P2,000.00 and the value of 25 cavanes of palay&nbsp; granted to each&nbsp; of the, two heirs Dominica Medina and Gorgonio&nbsp; Medina in the aforesaid order of the Court to guarantee the refund of the said amount and the value of the palay should the same&nbsp; be found, to be in excess of what is due to the said two heirs upon the&nbsp; final&nbsp; distribution of the&nbsp; estates";</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp; and upon which, they&nbsp; (appellees)&nbsp; filed the following manifestation dated May 23, 1957:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Considering&nbsp; that up to the&nbsp; present, the Court&nbsp; has not as yet ruled upon counsel's opposition&nbsp; or objection to the administrator's appeal, <i>nor have the&nbsp; administrator or that of his counsel rejected the heir's offer of a bond to answer for whatever excess they might receive as advance inheritance</i>, the&nbsp; undersigned counsel for the heirs above-named respectfully prays the Court, to hold in abeyance whatever action it shall take towards the approval or non-approval of&nbsp; the Record on Appeal, until such&nbsp; time as it shall have&nbsp; ruled upon their opposition&nbsp; or <i>until the administrator</i> shall have rejected formally&nbsp; the offer of&nbsp; a bond aforesaid.&nbsp; Counsel shall then in time file his corresponding opposition&nbsp; to the Record on Appeal."</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenor of the order of May 16, 1957, as well as the fact that neither said order nor the "<i>constancia</i>" of appellees are included in the Record on&nbsp; Appeal, indicates that the belated&nbsp; offer to file a bond amounted to&nbsp; no more than an attempt of appellees to settle the particular issue between&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties that was&nbsp; rejected&nbsp; by the appellant. That the record on appeal&nbsp; was approved much later, on July 15, 1957, and yet&nbsp; without the written opposition * * * required in&nbsp; the order of this Court dated&nbsp; June 12, 1957, notwithstanding the&nbsp; length of time that has already elapsed (R. A. p.&nbsp; 23), and the absence of proof that the bond offered&nbsp; was&nbsp; ever filed and approved by the Court, fortify&nbsp; that conclusion.&nbsp; Anyway, since the purpose of the bond required by Section 1, paragraph 2, of Rule&nbsp; 91 is to protect not only the appellant but&nbsp; also the creditors and subsequent&nbsp; claimants&nbsp; to the&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order that they may not&nbsp; be&nbsp; prejudiced by the&nbsp; partial&nbsp; distribution, the amount of&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; could not&nbsp; be&nbsp; fixed without&nbsp; hearing such interested parties, and there is no showing that they were consulted.&nbsp; Hence, the bond offered could not affect the&nbsp; merits of this appeal, although the Court below is not&nbsp; precluded&nbsp; from approving&nbsp; a new bond.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; partial&nbsp; distribution appealed from is hereby set aside, without prejudice&nbsp; to the issue of another order after strict compliance with&nbsp; the Rules of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; records are ordered remanded&nbsp; to the&nbsp; lower court for&nbsp; further proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against appellees.</p> <i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera</i>, and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ</i>.,&nbsp; concur. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [1]</sup> Should not be confused with an order for alimony <em>pendente lite</em>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br> <br> [2]</sup>&nbsp; See Escuin <i>vs.</i> Escuin, 11 Phil. 332.<br> <br>&nbsp; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> These last mentioned heirs were not&nbsp; included in the order of partial distribution.<br> <br>&nbsp; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The enumeration has been held to be exclusive (see Babao&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Villavicencio, 44 Phil., 921).</div>
