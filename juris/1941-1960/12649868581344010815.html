				<H3>ST. STEPHEN'S ASSOCIATION AND  ST. STEPHEN'S CHINESE GIRLS  SCHOOL, PETITIONERS  VS. THE  COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner St.  Stephen's Association is a non-stock corporation organized under the  laws of the  Philippines for the purpose of supporting and maintaining school or schools wherein the arts, sciences, and other studies are taught to children of Chinese parentage and descent; while the other petitioner, the St. Stephen's  Chinese Girls School,  is  a school maintained and supported by funds received from its co-petitioners, the St. Stephen's Association.<br><br>On January 21,  1950, the petitioner St. Stephen's  Association turned over the amount  of P9,252.48 to  the St. Stephen's Chinese Girls School, and the transfer of funds was entered in the ledger and cash book of the School as a "donation"  from the Association.  Having come across the book entry in a routine inspection of the books of the School, an examiner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue reported the donation to the Collector and thereafter, the Collector of Internal Revenue  sent petitioners his Assessment Notice No. GA—3008—50 dated October 15, 1954, demanding the payment of the amounts of P98.70 and P699.07 as donor's and donee's, gift taxes on the donation in question, including surcharges and interests. <br><br>On November  13, 1954, petitioners wrote the Collector a letter requesting the cancellation and withdrawal of the assessment notice in question on the ground that the amount of P9,252.48 was erroneously  entered by the bookkeeper as a donation from the Association to the School, when the truth was that said amount was obtained by the former by means of small contributions from  the public and allocated to the  School for its  maintenance.  On April 21, 1955,  petitioners received a letter from the Collector dated April 6, 1955, denying the request embodied in their letter of November 13, 1954, and insisting that the assessment  in question be  paid.  On May  9, 1955, petitioners filed their reply to the  Collector's letter of April 6, 1955, rebutting the arguments of the Collector in support of the assessment, and asking for its reconsideration.  On July 25, 1955, petitioners received the letter of  the Collector dated July 11, 1955, again denying their request that the assessment in question be cancelled and withdrawn,  and stating in its last paragraph that:<br><blockquote>"This decision becomes final thirty days after your receipt hereof unless an appeal is taken  to the Court of Tax Appeals within the same period,  in  accordance  with the provisions of Republic Act No. 1125."</blockquote>Within thirty days  from  the receipt of the above letter, or on August 13,  1955, petitioners filed a petition for review with the respondent Court of Tax Appeals. <br><br>Issues having been joined in the respondent court, the case was tried on the  merits  and thereafter, the parties were asked  to file  their  respective memoranda.  Before they could do so,  however, the court  required the parties to submit arguments to show whether the petition for review was filed within the thirty-day period prescribed in Section 11 of Republic Act No.  1125.  Petitioners  filed a memorandum calling attention to the last paragraph of the letter of the Collector of Internal Revenue of July 11, 1955; no memorandum was filed by the respondent Collector. On August 15, 1955, the respondent court promulgated a resolution dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The resolution was  premised on the court's  findings that the period for petitioners'  appeal started to run from their receipt  of the assessment notice  in  question;  that said period was  interrupted by  the filing  of petitioners' two requests for the cancellation of the assessment, but started to run  again when  said  requests  were denied; and that from November 12,  1954, when  petitioners received  the assessment notice, to August  13, 1955, when  they  filed their petition for  review, deducting the time when their two requests for cancellation were pending with the respondent Collector,  37 days had elapsed and therefore, their petition  was filed out of  time and did not  confer jurisdiction upon the respondent court.  From this resolution of dismissal, petitioners appealed to this Court. <br><br>We find merit in  the appeal. <br><br>In the first place, we believe the respondent court erred in holding that the  assessment in question is  the respondent Collector's  decision or ruling appealable to it,  and that consequently, the period of thirty days prescribed by section 11 of Republic Act No. 1125 within  which petitioner should have appealed to the  respondent court must be counted from its receipt of said assessment.  Where a taxpayer questions an assessment and asks the Collector to reconsider or cancel the same because he (the taxpayer) believes he is not liable therefor, the assessment becomes a "disputed  assessment" that the  Collector must  decide, and  the taxpayer can appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals only upon receipt of the decision of the Collector on the disputed assessment, in accordance with paragraph (1) of section 7, Republic Act No, 1125, conferring appellate jurisdiction upon the Court of Tax Appeals to review "<span style="font-style: italic;">decisions</span> of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving <span style="font-style: italic;">disputed assessment</span>  *  *  *"  (Italics supplied).<br><br>The period for appeal to the respondent court  in  this case must, therefore, be computed from the time petitioners received the decision of the respondent (Collector of Internal Revenue on the  disputed  assessment, and not from the time they received said assessment.  The next question now is: which is the decision of the  Collector on the disputed assessment—his  letter of April 6,  1955,  received by petitioners on  April 21, 1955, denying their first request for  the withdrawal and cancellation  of the   assessment; or his letter of July 11, 1955, received  by petitioners on July 25, 1955, denying their second request that the assessment be cancelled and  withdrawn, and stating that: <br><blockquote>"This decision becomes final thirty days after your  receipt hereof unless an  appeal is taken to the Court of Tax Appeals within the  same  period, in accordance with the  provision of Republic Act No. 1125."</blockquote> From the above-quoted statement appearing in his letter of July 11,  1955, it is evident that the respondent Collector himself considered said letter as his final decision in the case, hence  his warning that the same would become final in thirty days unless petitioners appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals within the same period.  Prior to his letter-decision of July 11, 1955,  then, the  Collector must have held the matter under advisement and considered his preceding rulings as merely tentative in character, pending his final determination and resolution of the  merits of the arguments of fact and law submitted by petitioners in support of their requests for the cancellation and withdrawal of the assessment.  This must have been the reason why, in said letter-decision  of July 11,  1955, the  Collector included an express  statement that said decision was to become final in thirty days unless  appealed from  within the same period; and it must also have been for this reason that, throughout the proceedings in the respondent court, the respondent  Collector never claimed  that  petitioners' appeal was filed out of  time, and it was the Tax Court that <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> dismissed the petition because it believed  it was not filed within the period provided by Republic Act No. 1125. <br><br>Respondents assert that  the  Collector of Internal Revenue  can not enlarge or  extend  the  period for  appeal under  section  11 of Republic Act No. 1125.  This is not, however,  a case where the respondent Collector had enlarged or extended the period for appeal to the respondent Court; this is simply a case where the Collector did not reach a final decision on the matter pending  before him until July 11, 1955,  when he released his letter-decision of the  same date.  Petitioners having filed their appeal on the 19th day from the receipt of this decision, their appeal was filed  on time and the respondent Court erred in dismissing the same for lack of jurisdiction. <br><br>Wherefore, the resolution  appealed from is reversed, and the records are ordered remanded to the respondent court for decision on  the  merits.   Without costs.  So  Ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
