				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts in this case are not disputed. As a matter of fact, the appeal from 
the decision of the trial court was taken directly to us, involving as it does, 
only questions of law. On December 27, 1944, the spouses Anastacio Alagar and 
Paulina Baltazar, residents of Bacoor, Cavite, being indebted to appellant 
Sabina Zaragoza married to Joaquin Gonzales in the sum of P7,500.00, admitted to 
be in Japanese War Notes, executed a deed of mortgage to secure the payment of 
the loan. The manner and the time for payment are contained in the paragraph of 
the deed of mortgage reproduce below:
<blockquote>
<p>"That the condition of this mortgage is that we promise to pay the said 
amount of SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED (P7,500.00) PESOS unto the said SABINA 
ZARAGOZA her heirs and assigns six (6) months immediately following the 
cessation of the present war in the Philippines in legal tender to be existing 
and prevailing at that time in the Philippines. And if the war in the 
Philippines will not be terminated within one year from this date, then the said 
mortgage amount will bear interest at 12% per annum. And in case we fail to pay 
the whole amount of P7,500.00 to said Sabina Zaragoza her heirs and assigns 
within the stipulated period above-mentioned, this mortgage will become due and 
enforceable in accordance with law."</p></blockquote>
<p>After Liberation appellant made repeated demands on the mortgagors for the 
payment of the full amount of the debt in Philippine currency, but the debtors 
refused to make payment alleging that according to the Ballentyne Schedule, the 
equivalent of P7,500.00 borrowed by them in Japanese Military War Notes is only 
about P83.00, Philippine currency, but that they were willing to pay P500.00. 
So, appellants brought this action in the Court of First Instance of Cavite not 
to forclose the mortgage for the reason that the deed was not registered but 
only for the payment of the loan with interests, plus costs. The trial court, 
interpreting the paragraph of the deed of mortgage above-qouted, held that 
although the stipulation was that the P7,500.00 was made payable within six (6) 
months following the cessation of the war "in legal tender to be existing and 
prevailing at that time in the Philippines", said clause may not be construed to 
be an stipulation that the obligation be payable in genuine Philippine currency, 
for the possibility existed that after the last war was terminated the Japanese 
could have been victorious in the war. Furthermore, the trial court took 
"judicial cognizance" of the fact that Japanese Military War Notes on December 
27, 1944, were practically worthless, and said that "it is certainly against 
conscience to permit that the amount of P7,500.00, which defendants had borrowed 
from plaintiff Sabrina Zaragoza, for the former's survival be now paid in 
Philippine currency" x x x. For the above reason given by the trial court, the 
latter rendered judgment sentencing defendants to pay only P500.00 in Philippine 
currency. Sabrina Zaragoza appealed from that decision.</p>
<p>The present contract of mortgage, particularly the paragraph we have quoted, 
contains the same speculative or aleatory feature of the contracts involved in 
several cases heretofore decided by us, principally the case of Gomez vs. Tabia, 
47 O.G. No. 2, p. 641 and the case of Ro√±o vs. Gomez, et al., 46 O.G. No. 11, 
Supplement, p. 339. On the basis of said cases, we find and hold that inasmuch 
as defendants-appellees in the present case have undertaken to pay the amount of 
the debt after the war and in the legal tender prevailing at the time, which is 
the Philippine peso, they are bound to make good their undertaking however 
onerous or burdensome and even unfair said obligation turned out to be. 
Defendants-appellees just lost in their gamble. Had the result of the war been 
otherwise and Japan had won, defendants would undoubtedly have paid off their 
obligation in the same Japanese Military War Notes, perhaps more depreciated 
than they were in December, 1944. However, in order to minimize the loss to them 
we are willing to overlook the element of interests, including that of 
costs.</p>
<p>Reversing the decision appealed from, the defendants-appellees are hereby 
sentenced to pay the plaintiff-appellant the sum of P7,500.00 in Philippine 
currency, with legal interest from the date the decision become final. No 
costs.</p>

<em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J</em>., dissents for the same reasons stated in his opinion in 
the cases cited by the majority.</p><span style="font-style: italic;">Padilla, J.</span>, see dissent. <br><br><hr align="center" width="70%">

<p align="center"><strong><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J., </strong><em>dissenting:</em></p>
<p>I dissent. On 27 December 1944, the Japanese war notes had very little value. 
The purchasing power of P7,500 in Japanese war notes at the time of the loan was 
practically nil. The judgment appealed from ordering the defendants to pay the 
plaintiff P500 is more than sufficient to return to the latter the little value 
of the loan obtained by the former in December 1944.<br></p></div>
