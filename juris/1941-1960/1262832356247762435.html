				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This quo warranto proceeding was initiated on November 25, 1959. The prayer in the petition, as amended
        
on December 1, 1959, reads:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered
              
in favor of the petitioners:</p>
    <p>  ON THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:</p>
    <ol><li> Declaring the petitioners as duly qualified for the position
                    
 of member of the Board of Medical Examiners and that any one
                    
 of them is legally entitled to be appointed as members of said
                    
 Board;<br>
     <br>
      </li><li>  Declaring the appointment of the respondent Dr. Pedro M.
                    
 Cruz as a member of the Board of Medical Examiners illegal and
                    
 therefore null and void and ousting him therefrom and perpetually
                    
 prohibiting him (unless appointed in accordance with law) from
                    
 exercising the rights and performing the duties and functions connected therewith.</li></ol>

 respondent to cease, desist and refrain from assuming the office
                    
 of member of the Board of Medical Examiners and exercising the
                    
 rights and performing the duties and functions connected therewith,
                    
 particularly to give or conduct the next examinations for physicians <i>scheduled on or about December 14, 1959</i>, or to take part in any

      </li><li>  Ordering the respondent to pay the costs of this suit.</li></ol>
    <p> Petitioners further pray for such further and other relief as this
                
 Honorable Court "may deem just and proper under the premises."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    By a resolution dated December 3, 1959, this Court
          
 denied the petition for a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>
  <p>    The petitioners are doctors Jose Cuyegkeng, Pedro N.
          
 Mayuga, Benjamin Roa, Timoteo Alday, Dominador Jacinto, Alejandro Gaerlan and Rosita Rivera-Ramirez.
          
 Their alleged cause of action is predicated upon the fact
          
 that their names appear in a list of qualified physicians,
          
 approved and submitted, to the President of the Philippines, by the Executive Council of the Philippine Medical
          
 Association of the Philippines pursuant to the provisions
          
 of section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382, for appointment
          
 as members of the Board of Medical Examiners, and that
          
 respondent Dr. Pedro M. Cruz, whom the President appointed to said board, was not named in said list.</p>
  <p>    Soon after the institution of this case, the officers and
          
members of said Council of the Philippine Medical Association, which is said to be an incorporated association
          
of the medical profession in the Philippines, were allowed
          
to intervene and then filed a petition in intervention,
          
joining the petitioners in praying for the relief sought
          
by them.</p>
  <p>    It appears that, on October 16, 1959, said Council, acting in conformity with section 13 of Republic Act No.
          
2882, otherwise known as The Medical Act of 1959,
          
approved and submitted to the President a revised list
          
of qualified physicians, including petitioners herein, for
          
appointment to the aforementioned Board. The letter
          
of said Council transmitting the aforementioned list reads
          
as follows.</p>

Dear Sir:<br>

 In compliance with your request as contained in your letter of
                
October 15, addressed to the Executive Council of the Philippine

namely, Dr. Rosita Rivera-Ramirez, is now being recommended
                
as No. 12. With the disqualification of Dr. Dionisio R. Parulan
                
 (No. 11) by virtue of his candidacy to an elective post, we hereunder

  <p>    By a letter of the Assistant Executive Secretary dated 
              
November 18, 1959, said Council was advised that the 
              
President had decided to appoint, as member of said Board, 
              
Dr. Cesar Filoteo, Dr. Oscar Chacon, Dr. Edgardo Caparas, Dr. Jose Cocjin, Dr. Antonio Guytingco and Dr.

two from the University of Santo Tomas and two government

  <p>
The first five (5) persons mentioned in this letter were included in
the list aforementioned, but the name of the last, namely, that of
respondent herein, did not appear in said list. Petitioners herein, as
well as the intervenors, maintain that, pursuant to section 13 of
Republic Act No. 2382, the President cannot appoint to the Board of
Medical Examiners any person not named in the list submitted by the
Executive Council of the Philippine Medical Association, and that,
accordingly, the aforementioned appointment of respondent is null and
void.</p>
  <p>
Respondent alleged in his answer that three (3) of petitioners herein
are, pursuant to section 14 of Republic Act No. 2382, not qualified for
appointment to the Board of Medical Examiners, they being members of
the professional staff of certain private medical colleges; that there
is no cause of action against him for none of the petitioners and
intervenors claim to be entitled to the office in question; that the
aforementioned list, submitted by the executive Council of the
Philippine Medical Association, is merely recommendatory in nature and,
as such, not binding upon the President; that insofar as Section 13 of
Republic Act No. 2382 may be construed as limiting the choice of the
President, in a mandatory manner, in the selection of members of the
Board of Medical Examiners, to the list aforementioned, said legal
provision is unconstitutional and void; and that inclusion in the list
above referred to is not one of the qualifications prescribed in
section 14 of Republic Act No. 2382 for appointment to said Board.</p>
  <p>    The members of this Court are split into three (3)
              
croups in their views on the issues thus raised by the
              
pleadings. Section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382, upon
              
which the petitioners and the intervenors rely, provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<i>The Board of Medical Examiners, its composition and duties</i>.—The Board of Medical Examiners shall be composed of six members to be appointed by the President of the Philippines from
                    
a confidential list of not more than twelve names approved and
                    
submitted by the executive council of the Philippine Medical
                    
Association, after due consultation with other medical associations,
                    
during the months of April and October of each year. The
                    
chairman of the Board shall be elected from among themselves by
                    
the members at a meeting called for the purpose. The President
                    
of the Philippines shall fill any vacancy that may occur during
                    
any examination from the list of names submitted by the Philippine Medical Association in accordance with the provisions of this
                    
Act.</p>
    <p>"No examiner shall handle the examinations in more than four
                    
subjects or groups of subjects as hereinafter provided. The distribution of subjects to each member shall be agreed upon at a
                    
meeting called by the chairman for the purpose. The examination
                    
papers shall be under the custody of the Commissioner of Civil
                    
Service or his duly authorized representative, and shall be distributed
                    
to each member of the Board who shall correct, grade, and sign,
                    
and submit them to the said Commissioner within one hundred
                    
twenty days from the date of the termination of the examinations.</p>
    <p>"A final meeting of the Board for the deliberation and approval
                      
of the grades shall be called by the Commissioner of Civil Service
                      
 immediately after receipt of the records from the members of the
                      
 Board of Medical Examiners. The secretary of the Board shall
                      
 submit to the President of the Philippines for approval the names
                      
 of the successful candidates as having been duly qualified for
                      
 licensure in alphabetical order, without stating the ratings obtained
                      
 by each."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    One group of members of this Court is of the opinion
                    
 that the provisions of this section are mandatory in character; that, although Congress may, by law, prescribe
                    
 the qualifications for appointment to a public office created
                    
by statute, such as membership of the Board of Medical
                    
Examiners, and has specified the qualifications for eligibility to said Board in Section 14 of Republic Act No. 2382, reading:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<i>Qualifications of examiners</i>.—No
person shall be appointed a member of the Board of Medical Examiners
unless he or she (1) is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, (2)
is a duly registered physician in the Philippines, (3) has been in the
practice of medicine for at least ten years, (4) is of good moral
character and of recognized standing in the medical profession, (5) is
not a member of the faculty of any medical school and has no pecuniary
interest, directly or indirectly, in any college of medicine or in any
institution where any branch of medicine is taught, at the time of his
appointment: <i>Provided</i>, That of the six members to be
                          
appointed, not more than two shall be graduates of the same
                          
institution and not more than three shall be government physicians."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
inclusion in the list submitted by the Executive Council of the
Philippine Medical Association, in compliance with section 13 of the
same Act, is not one of the qualifications enumerated in said section
14; that by confining the selection of the six (6) members of the Board
of Medical Examiners to the twelve (12) person included in said list,
the framers of the law have evinced the intent, not merely to prescribe
the qualifications for eligibility to said Board, but, also, to limit
and curtail, and, hence, to reduce and impair the power of appointment
vested in the President by the Constitution, which authority connotes
necessarily a reasonable measure of freedom, latitude or discretion in
the exercise of the power to choose the appointees (67 C. J. S.
157-158); and that, consequently, the pertinent portion of section 13
of Republic Act No. 2382 is unconstitutional and the appointment of
respondent herein lawful and valid.</p>
  <p>    It may not be amiss to note, in this connection, that
                      
none of the cases cited in the memorandum of the intervenors herein (Marks <i>vs.</i> Frantz [1956] 179 Kan. 638,
                      
 298 P 2nd 316; Railroad et al. <i>vs.</i> Willis [1947] 305 Ky.
                      
 224, 203 S. W. 2nd 18; Bradley <i>vs.</i> Board of Zoning Adjustment [1926], 255 Mass. 160, 150 N. E. 892) is in point
                      
 for the constitutions of Kansas, Kentucky and Massachusetts contain no provision identical or analogous to
                      
 that found in our fundamental law, vesting in the President
                      
 all executive powers not conferred upon others, and explicitly stating that all officers of the Government whose
                      
 appointment are not otherwise provided for in the charter 
                      
 of said states shall be appointed by him. The authority
                      
 of the chief executive of those states to appoint the officers
                      
 involved in said cases springs mostly from statutes, unlike
                      
 the President of the Philippines, whose appointing power
                      
 emanates from our Constitution.</p>
  <p>    Another group adheres to the view that said portion of
                      
 section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382 is merely directory
                      
 in nature. Indeed, in their respective pleadings, the
                      
 petitioners, as well as the intervenors, refer to the persons
                      
 named in the list aforementioned as "recommendees". They
                      
 are identically referred to in the communication transmitting said list to the President of the Philippines, which
                      
 communication is, in turn, described in said pleadings as
                      
 a letter of "recommendation". By their very acts therefore, the intervenors have clearly expressed the belief,
                      
 which was shared by the President, that the function of
                      
 the former under said section 13 is purely recommendatory.
                      
 Needless to say, a "recommendation", as such, implies
                      
 merely an advice, exhortation or indorsement, which is
                      
 essentially persuasive in character, not binding upon the
                      
party to whom it is made. The members of the Court
                      
 constituting this group feel, therefore, that, although
                      
 section 13 of Republic Act No. 2382 is constitutional,
                      
 respondent herein has a valid title to his office as member
                      
of the Board of Medical Examiners.</p>
  <p>    The third group, which is bigger than any of the two
                      
 (2) groups already adverted to, deems it unnecessary,
                      
 either to inquire into the constitutionality of said section
                      
 13, or to determine whether the same is mandatory or
                      
 directory, for the reasons presently to be stated.</p>
  <p>
The letter to the Executive Council of the Philippine Medical
Association dated November 18, 1959, informing the Association of the
action taken by the President, states that he "had decided to appoint
in the Board two graduates from the University of the Philippines, two
from the University of Santo Tomas and. two government physicians
irrespective of alma mater". The list submitted by the Executive
Council of the Philippine Medical Association included two (2)
government physicians, namely, Dr. Antonio Guytingco and Dr. Alejandro
Gaerlan, both of whom were "personal physicians of the President".
Believing, perhaps, that their appointment to the Board may either
deprive him completely of the benefits of their professional services,
or impair the quality or usefulness thereof, or that a choice in favor
of his two (2) personal doctors, as representatives of the government
physicians in said Board, may smack of, or be misconstrued as, an act
of nepotism, it was deemed best to appoint to the Board only one of
them so that the other could continue giving his undivided attention to
the health of the President. Hence, the latter had to look for another
government physician for appointment to the Board. In this connection,
it should be noted that respondent's professional competency for the
post he now holds is not disputed. In fact, he had been a member of
said Board twice before. What is more, when the questioned appointment
was extended to him, on November 18, 1959, respondent was a member of
said Board, and his term as such would have expired on August 7, 1960,
had it not been for the approval of Republic Act No. 2382 on June 20,
1959. The President made, therefore, said appointment, which, the
members of the Court belonging to the third group believe, is
sanctioned by section 15 of Republic Act No. 2382, reading:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<i>Tenure of office and compensation of members</i>.—The members
                            
of the Board of Medical Examiners shall hold office for one year: <i>Provided</i>, That any member may be reappointed for not more
                            
than one year. Each member shall receive as compensation ten
                            
pesos for each candidate examined for registration as physician,
                            
and five pesos for each candidate examined in the preliminary or
                            
final physician examination.</p>
    <p>"The President of the Philippines, upon the recommendation of
                            
the Commissioner of Civil Service, after due investigation, may
                            
remove any member of the Board of Medical Examiners for
                            
neglect of duty, incompetency, or unprofessional or dishonorable
                            
conduct."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The members of said group opine that it is not absolutely necessary that the person reappointed under this
                          
provision be included in the list mentioned in section 13
                          
of Republic Act No. 2382, for, in case of conflict between
                          
two (2) provisions of the same statute, the last in order
                          
of position is frequently held to prevail (82 C. J. S. 718),
                          
unless it clearly appears that the intent of Congress is
                          
otherwise, and no such intent is patent in the case at bar.
                          
Furthermore, the purpose of section 13, in requiring the
                          
favorable indorsement of the Philippine Medical Association, evidently, to reasonably assure that the members
                          
of the Board of Medical Examiners are among the best in
                          
their profession, and one who has already held, or who still
                          
holds a position in said Board, is presumed to belong to
                          
such class, in the absence of proof to the contrary. There
                          
is not even the slightest suggestion that respondent does
                          
not live up to the standard required for membership in
                          
said Board.</p>
  <p>    In conclusion, although none of the groups already adverted to have sufficient votes to constitute the requisite
                          
majority, the members of this Court are unanimous in the
                          
opinion that respondent herein has a good and valid title
                          
to his office.</p>
  <p>    Lastly, this is a quo warranto proceeding, which, pursuant to Rule 68 of the Rules of Court, may be brought,
                          
either by the Government or by a private individual. Not
                           every individual may, however, initiate the proceedings.
  Section 6 of said Rule provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<i>When an individual may commence such an action</i>.—A person
                                
 claiming to be entitled to a public office usurped or unlawfully held
                                
 or exercised by another may bring an action therefor in his own
                                
 name."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Thus, one who does not claim to be entitled <i>to the 
                              
 office</i> allegedly usurped or unlawfully held or exercised by
                              
 another cannot question his title thereto by quo warranto.
                              
 In the case at bar, petitioners do not claim to be entitled <i>to the office</i> held by respondent herein. None of them
                              
 has been appointed thereto and none of them may, therefore, be placed in said office, regardless of the alleged
                              
 flaws in respondent's title thereto. They merely assert
                              
 a right <i>to be appointed</i> to said office. Considering, however, that there are seven (7) petitioners and that only
                              
 one (1) office is involved in this case, none of them can, or
                              
 does, give an assurance that he will be the one appointed
                              
 by the President, should said office be declared vacant. In
                              
 short, the claim of each petitioner is predicated solely upon
                              
 a more or less remote possibility that in said event, he
                              
 may be the recipient of the appointment. It is obvious,
                              
 therefore, that none of them has a cause of action against
                              
 respondent herein (Acosta <i>vs.</i> Flor, 5 Phil., 18, 22; Lino
                              
 Luna <i>vs.</i> Rodriguez, 36 Phil., 401; Nueno <i>vs.</i> Angeles, 76
                              
 Phil., 12).</p>
  <p>    Upon the other hand, the petition in intervention is
                                
predicated upon the right of the intervenors to submit
                                
a list of <i>recommendees</i> for appointment to the Board
                                
 of Medical Examiners. Such right does not entitle the
                                
 intervenors, under the above provision of Rule 68, to
                                
 question the title of respondent herein. Hence, the petition for quo warranto has no leg to stand on.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the writ prayed for should be, as it is hereby,
                                  
denied, with costs against the petitioners. It is so ordered.</p>
