				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for detainer and collection of rentals due 
and unpaid. After trial judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs. The defendant 
appealed filing a supersedeas bond. In the Court of First Instance the defendant 
filed an answer setting up illegality of the rentals sought to be collected and 
of the assessed value of the leased premises upon which the increased rental was 
based, failure of the plaintiffs to make plumbing repairs in the leased 
premises, a counterclaim for P128 claimed to be an excess of the amount of 
rental authorized by law from February 1945 to December 1946, both inclusive, 
and damages in the sum of P250. On 21 January 1949 the attorneys for the 
plaintiffs filed a motion praying for the dismissal of the case, payment to the 
plaintiffs of the supersedeas bond in the sum of P347.50 and withdrawal by them 
of the amount of F176 for rentals deposited by the defendant, for the reason 
that the latter had vacated the premises on 19 January 1949 and because she and 
her attorney failed to appear at the resumption of the trial of the case on 21 
January, (the plaintiffs waiving payment of rentals for July, October, November 
and December 1948 and half of January 1949, to put an end to the litigation, 
without costs. On that date, after stating that the case was partly tried on 1 
July, the trial having been postponed due to the failure of the clerk of the 
municipal court to forward the exhibits presented by the parties, and that the 
resumption of the trial set for 24 August and 23 September was postponed again 
upon motion of the attorney for the defendant and set for 21 January 1949, on 
which date the defendant and her attorney failed to appear and the attorneys for 
the plaintiffs moved for the dismissal of the case and prayed that the 
plaintiffs be allowed to withdraw the rentals deposited in court by the 
defendant, the court entered an order holding that "her failure to appear and 
prosecute her appeal is tantamount to a withdrawal of said appeal" and that "the 
appeal is considered withdrawn, the judgment of the Municipal Court is deemed 
revived and let the record of the case be remanded to the Municipal Court in 
accordance with section 9, Rule 40, of the Rules of Court, for the enforcement 
of the judgment rendered by it in the case." On 24 January 1949 the attorney for 
the defendant filed a motion praying that the proceedings be suspended until 
after the provisions of section 17, Rule 3, shall have been complied with, in 
view of the fact that the defendant had died on 9 January 1949, and explaining 
that his (attorney's) failure to appear at the resumption of the trial on 21 
January was due to the fact that there was a proposal for an amicable settlement 
and that not having heard from the defendant despite his letter to her sent on 
the 15th, he thought that the case had been settled amicably. On 29 January 1949 
both motions for dismissal of the case filed on behalf of the plaintiffs and for 
suspension of the proceedings filed in behalf of the defendant were acted upon, 
the Court inviting attention to its order of 21 January 1949, which, according 
to it, disposed of the two motions, and further holding that the case was 
"within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court for the execution of the 
judgment rendered by it in this case." On 18 May 1949, acting upon a motion 
filed by the plaintiffs, the court authorized the attorneys for the plaintiffs 
to withdraw the sum of P176 in cash for rentals deposited and of P347.50 filed 
as supersedeas bond, and further stated that "this withdrawal is authorized in 
accordance with the judgment rendered in this case on 21 January 1949." On 21 
June 1949 attorney for the defendant moved for reconsideration of the order of 
18 May 1949, on the ground that it was contrary to law and entered without 
jurisdiction. This motion was denied. A notice of appeal, an appeal bond and a 
record on appeal were filed. The appeal was certified to this Court because only 
questions of law are raised and involved.
<p align="justify">Section 9, Rule 40, provides: "A perfected appeal shall operate 
to vacate the judgment of * * * the municipal court, and the action when duly 
entered in the Court of First Instance shall stand for trial <span style="font-style: italic;">de novo</span> upon its 
merits in accordance with the regular procedure in that Court, as though the 
same had never been tried before and had been originally there commenced. If the 
appeal is withdrawn, the judgment shall be deemed revived and shall forthwith be 
remanded to the * * * municipal court for execution." The defendant filed her 
answer within the time provided for in section 1, Rule 9, so she could not be 
deemed and declared in default (section 3, Rule 7). Even if she had failed to 
file her answer within the time required and were declared in default, the 
plaintiffs were bound to present their evidence upon which judgment could be 
rendered. In accordance with the above quoted provisions of section 9, Rule 40, 
the party who could withdraw the appeal was the appellant, because such 
withdrawal would revive the judgment against her rendered by the municipal 
court. Obviously, the appellees for whom judgment was rendered could not ask for 
the withdrawal of the appeal. They would not ask for the dismissal of the case 
because the judgment secured by them would not be revived thereby and they would 
be left without judgment which was vacated upon perfection of the appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">It is contended that section 9, Rule 40, is not applicable to 
appeals in detainer cases because the appeal does not vacate the judgment but 
suspends only, as may be inferred from the authority of the court to which the 
case has been appealed to order execution of the judgment during the pendency of 
the appeal upon failure of the appellant to pay to the prevailing party or to 
deposit in court the stipulated rentals or the reasonable compensation, for the 
preceding month on or before the tenth day of each month, for the use or 
occupation of the premises, as found by the judgment of the municipal or justice 
of the peace court. This authority to direct execution expressly provided for in 
section 8, Rule 72, in no way alters the provisions of section 9, Rule 40, on 
the effect of an appeal upon a judgment rendered by a municipal or justice of 
the peace court. And proof of this is the provision in the same section that 
"such execution shall not be a bar to the appeal taking its course until the 
final disposition thereof on its merits." When the defendant or her attorney 
failed to appear at the resumption of the trial on 21 January 1949, the court 
could not dismiss the appeal because it was not authorized to do so, but was in 
duty bound to hear the evidence of the plaintiffs and render judgment thereon 
unless for good reasons it deemed it justified to postpone the hearing of the 
case. Nor could it dismiss the case and grant the remedy prayed for, such as the 
payment of rentals, even if the defendant had vacated already the premises, 
without a finding that such rentals were really due and unpaid, for a dismissal 
of the case, if granted, would leave the prevailing parties in the municipal 
court bereft of or without a judgment. The failure of the defendant or her 
attorney to appear at the resumption of the trial of the case on 21 January 1949 
could not be deemed a withdrawal of her appeal. And as there are no findings of 
facts upon which a judgment may be based and rendered, the order of 21 January 
1949 is not and cannot be deemed a judgment of the case on the merits (section 
12, Article VIII, of the Constitution).</p>
<p align="justify">As to the substitution of the defendant, her attorney should 
prove the fact of her death and the court shall order, upon proper notice, the 
legal representative of the deceased to appear for her within 30 days or such 
time as may be granted, as provided for in section 17, Rule 3. The court could 
not order the legal representative of the deceased to appear for her because it 
considered the order of 21 January 1949 as judgment entered in the case and 
notice of the defendant's death was given it three days later or on 24 January 
1949.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court seems to be of the belief and opinion that the 
order of 21 January 1949 is a judgment, where it held that failure of the 
defendant or her attorney to appear at the resumption of the hearing of the case 
on that date was tantamount to a withdrawal of the appeal, that the judgment of 
the municipal Court was revived, and that for that reason it directed the record 
of the case to be remanded to the municipal court for execution. For the reasons 
above set forth this is an error, because as the appellant did not withdraw the 
appeal there was no withdrawal thereof. On the other hand, as already stated, 
the appellees could not ask for the withdrawal of the appeal because it was not 
their appeal and would not ask for the dismissal of the case because, if 
granted, they would have been left without a judgment. </p>
<p align="justify">The orders of 29 January and 18 May 1949, being predicated upon 
an erroneous opinion that the order of 21 January 1949 is a judgment, which is 
not and is a nullity, are set aside and the case remanded to the court below for 
further proceedings in accordance with law, without costs.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo,
