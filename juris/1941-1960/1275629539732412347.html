				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Samuel Goode was accused before the Court of First Instance of Surigao of the 
crime of murder with assault upon an agent of authority and, after trial, was 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, with the 
accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of 
P6,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the 
costs. Because of the nature of the penalty, the appeal was taken directly to 
this Court.
<p>In the night of September 22, 1942, while a game of <em>monte</em> was being 
played in the house of Florentina Ambil at the barrio of Barobo, Lianga, 
Surigao, two players, Fabian Moreno and Gencroso Altizo, engaged in a heated 
discussion over a bet of P10.00. Sarafio Tremedal, who was living nearby, came 
to the house to investigate the matter, he being the barrio lieutenant of the 
place. Tremedal intervened and tried to pacify the two players at the same time 
admonishing Florontina Ambil not to allow prohibited games in her house because 
they usually are the source of trouble. Florentina retorted by saying, that he 
had nothing, to do with it because the game was being played in her house. To 
this Tremedal remarked that he had a right to give counsel because he was the 
barrio lieutenant.</p>
<p>While Florontina and Tremedal were exchanging remarks, Samuel Goode arrived 
and, siding with his mother Florentina, addressed Tremedal: "You have nothing, 
to do in coming to my house, you are an intruder you salomabits", and thereupon 
gave a fist blow to the left jaw of Tremedal causing him to fall flat on the 
floor face downward. Thereafter, Goode hold Tremedal by the neck, lifted him and 
challenged him to a fight, at which instance Tremedal remarked that it was not 
his purpose to fight but merely to counsel peace as it was his duty to do as a 
barrio lieutenant. Immediately thereafter Goode drew his 45 caliber automatic 
pistol and fired at Tremedal hitting him on the left eye perforating the 
cranium. Tremedal fell to the floor and died instantly. Goode pulled him 
downstairs and threw his dead body on the ground. The next morning the widow 
reported the matter to the municipal authorities who found the body of the 
victim laying prostrate on the ground with his face mangled it having been eaten 
by the pigs during the night.</p>
<p>The corresponding charge was filed with the justice of the peace who 
immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of the accused. However, the warrant 
was not served during the occupation because of the uncertainty of the 
situation. As the records were lost as a result of the war, the case was revived 
after liberation with the filing of a new information by the provincial fiscal 
of Surigao on September 16, 1950.</p>
<p>The defense gave two versions relative to the killing of the deceased. On one 
hand, it claims that the deceased was killed by guerrilla Lt. Gonzalo Villan on 
August 31, 1942 because he was a Japanese collaborator. To this effect is the 
testimony of appellant who claims that sometime in June, 1942 the deceased 
accompanied a group of fourteen Japanese soldiers in the confiscation of 
foodstuffs stored inside a guerrilla depot at Lianga. On the other hand, the 
defense also claims that the deceased was shot to death on the same date by Lt. 
Gonzalo" Villan for violating the curfew orders of the guerrillas in that area. 
To this effect is the testimony of appellant and his witness Juanito Pingoy who 
claim that sometime before the shooting there were around thirty-seven 
guerrillas in the town of Lionga under the command of appellant; that the 
guerrillas occupied the house of Florentina Ambil as their outpost; that at 
about 10 o'clock p.m. on August 31, 1942 the deceased passed near the guerrilla 
outpost and did not stop to identify himself upon being required to do so by the 
sentry; that the deceased was admonished by the sentry to observe the curfew 
hours imposed by the guerrillas of Lianga, to which he replied that he was the 
barrio lieutenant and was on his way to look for food for the guerrillas; and 
that suddenly the deceased drew his hunting knife and tried to stab Lt. Villan, 
the guerrilla executive officer, whereupon the latter shot him to death.</p>
<p>The fact that the defense has advanced an alternative version regarding the 
killing of the deceased is an indication of its weakness and of the fact that it 
cannot give a true account of how the latter was killed. This weakness is 
further aggravated by the testimony of the Justice of the Peace Julian Martinez, 
whom the trial court described as "a venarable and respected man" who has 
reached "the ripe age of 71" who gave the lie to the claim that the deceased was 
killed on August 31, 1942, for, according to him, said killing took place on 
September 22, 1942, as claimed by the prosecution, so much so that he issued a 
warrant of arrest for the apprehension of the appellant which could not however 
be effected because of the uncertainty of the situation. The story that at the 
time of the killing there was a regularly organized guerrilla unit in Lianga 
under the command of appellant has likewise been belief by the prosecution, for, 
according to witness Francisco Cayna, the guerrillas in Lianga were only 
organized in 1943 and were placed, not under the command of appellant, but of 
one McCarthy. And even if it be granted that at the time of the killing there 
were already guerrillas in that area and that the deceased was seen accompanying 
the Japanese patrol in the confiscation of food-stuffs which were then stored in 
a depot belonging, to the former, his killing outright cannot be justified it 
appearing that he was then a barrio lieutenant and in that capacity he could not 
but obey the command of the occupation government. Even therefore under this 
theory the killing, of the deceased upon the command of appellant is not 
justified and cannot exempt him from liability.</p>
<p>The second version advanced by the defense is just as unworthy of credence an 
the first. According to the witnesses for the defense, there wore around 
thirty-seven guerrillas who at the time of the killing were stationed at the 
house of Florentine Ambil located on the main road at barrio Barobo and that it 
was on the occasion when the deceased passed by in violation of the curfew 
orders issued by appellant as commander that said deceased defied the seaitry 
and tried to assault with a knife Lt. Gonzalo Villon. In the first place, if it 
is true that the town of Lianga was under the control of the Japanese so much so 
that the latter used to send soldiers to patrol the place and confiscate 
foodstuffs for their own use, how can it be pretended that the guerrillas wore 
properly organized and had as their outpost a house located on the main road 
with a sentry guarding that road as though in defiance of the occupation 
government? How can it be possible for the guerrillas to adopt a curfew 
regulation and enforce the same in an open manner without catering detection on 
the part of the Japanese authorities?</p>
<p>Even if the claim as to the curfew regulation were true, considering that, 
according to appellant, there were around thirty-seven guerrillas who were in 
complete control of the town of Lianga and said guerrillas were then armed with 
pistols and revolvers, it cannot be reasonably believed that the deceased, 
single-handed, would defy their authority and even attempt to assault with a 
knife one of the officers as the defense would like us to believe. The deceased, 
who was then a barrio lieutenant, should know the consequences of such an act 
and, knowing, them, could not fail to see that to attempt to do it would be 
suicidal. It is evident that this version cannot be ac&amp;cptcd as it is 
against logic and reason.</p>
<p>The defense also claims that the lower court erred in not entertaining its 
motion to quash based on the ground that the information against appellant 
charges more than one offense. It appears however that the accused was charged 
not only with the killing of the deceased but with having done it on the 
occasion when the latter was in the exercise of his functions as barrio 
lieutenant. Such being the case, the acts charged come under one of the 
exceptions of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code which allows the inclusion in 
the information of more than one offense when the same are the result of one 
single act. The plea that the assault upon an agent of authority cannot be 
considered because appellant was also a councilor at the time of the killing, 
cannot be entertained because, even if true, this kind of offence can be 
committed even by a public officer or employee (Article 48, Revised Penal 
Code).</p>
<p>The defense likewise contends that the trial court erred in not declaring 
that the appellant is entitled to the benefits of Amnesty Proclamation No. 8 of 
the late President Roxas. But this question has already been passed upon by the 
13th Guerrilla-Amnesty Commission to which the case wan referred precisely upon 
petition of appellant, and said Comission denied said appellant the benefits of 
the amnesty on the ground that "there is nothing of record to show that the 
accused committed the offense in pursuance of the resistance movement and not 
due to personal motives." Since this case has boon already acted upon by the 
Guerilla Amnesty Commission, the lower court acted properly in abstaining from 
passing upon the same question now raised by appellant. Indeed, how con he be 
entitled to the benefits of said proclamation when he know claims that it is not 
he but Lt. Gonzalo Villan who killed the deceased?</p>
<p>And with regard to the claim that the prosecution of this case has suffered 
considerable delay, suffice it to say that such delay is due not to the fault of 
the prosecution bat to the fact that appellant could not be apprehended during 
the Japanese occupation in view of the uncertainty of the situation. As this 
Court has said, the delay in the prosecution of crimes committed during the 
occupation should not''militate against the complainant for the court can "take 
judicial notice of the fact that it took many months after liberation before 
normalcy had been reestablished in the country. The unsettled conditions in many 
parts during the first year after liberation were such that many persons did not 
feel safe to bring their grievances to courts of justice." (People <em>v</em>. 
Manzanares, G. R. No. L-1293, May 24, 1948.)</p>
<p>Considering that appellant is guilty of the crime of murder with assault upon 
an agent of authority, a complex crime, for which the penalty for the most 
serious crime is prescribed, the Solicitor General recommends that the penalty 
of death be meted out to appellant. However, for lack of the requisite vote, in 
view of the circumstances under which the crime was committed, the Court 
resolved to affirm, as it hereby affirms, the decision appealed from, with costs 
against appellant.</p>
