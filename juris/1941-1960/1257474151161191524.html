				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CHAN CHEN ALIAS ANTONIO CHAN TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHAN CHEN ALIAS ANTONIO CHAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Cebu 
granting Chan Chen's application for naturalization.
<p>It appears that applicant Chan Chen <em>alias</em> Antonio Chan, a Chinese 
citizen, who alleges to be a resident of Cebu City, applied for citizenship on 
February 18, 1956 in the Court below. Attached to the petition were the 
affidavits of applicant's two character witnesses, namely, Ramiro P. Atilo, who 
claims to have known applicant continuously since 1947 and Cesar Las Pinas, who 
claims having known said applicant since 1940.</p>
<p>After the petition was heard with the applicant and hi3 witnesses taking the 
stand, one Damaso del Rosario, a resident of Cebu City, filed a written 
opposition to the aforesaid petition on the ground that applicant has been made 
respondent in several labor cases for collection of separation and overtime pay, 
as well as under-payment before the Department of Labor, and also for estafa and 
violation of the Blue Sunday Law, which cases were pending before the fiscars 
office of Cebu City.</p>
<p>On June 1,1957, the lower court finding that the applicant has all the 
qualifications necessary for naturalization and none of the disqualifications 
provided for by law, rendered a decision granting the application. Alleging that 
the evidence submitted during the hearing was "insufficient to support the 
finding of the trial court that petitioner possesses all the qualifications and 
none of the disqualifications to become a naturalized citizen," the Provincial 
Fiscal of Cebu filed a motion for new trial or reopening of the case. The motion 
was granted, but after the reception of evidence, the lower court promulgated 
its order dated November 4, 1957, reiterating its decision of June 1, 1957, 
granting the application for naturalization. Hence, this appeal taken by the 
Government.</p>
<p>Appellant's contentions, as stated in the Solicitor General's brief are (1) 
that one of the two character witnesses introduced by appellee has not satisfied 
the statutory requirement as to the period of time he has known the petitioner 
as a resident; (2) that the petitioner has not conducted himself in a proper and 
irreproachable manner during the entire period of his residence in the 
Philippines; and (3) that he lacks sincerity in his desire to become a 
naturalized Filipino citizen.</p>
<p>We find merit in the above contentions of the Solicitor General.</p>
<p>As required by section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended, a petition 
for naturalization must be supported by the affidavit of at least two credible 
persons, stating that they are citizens of the Philippines and personally know 
the petitioner to be a resident of the Philippines for the period of time 
required by the Act. Accordingly, where the affidavit of the witness attached to 
the application for naturalization states that the affiant had known the 
applicant for less than the period* required prior to the filing thereof, the 
petition has been declared fatally defective.</p>
<p>As required by section 7 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, (Cu <em>vs</em>. 
Republic, 89 Phil., 473; Awad <em>vs</em>. Republic, 97 Phil., 569; Sy Chut 
<em>vs</em>. Republic, 102 Phil., 839; see also Yu Chong Tian <em>vs</em>. 
Republic, 94 Phil., 742; Karam Singh <em>vs</em>. Republic, 97 Phil., 622; 51 
Off. Gaz., 5172; Dy Tian Siong <em>vs</em>. Republic, 103 Phil., 363; 55 Off. 
Gaz., 420; Go Kiam Lam <em>vs</em>. Republic, G.R. No. L-13571, January 31, 
1959.) From the affidavit of witness Ramiro P. Atilo, as affirmed by him in his 
direct testimony, it appears that he came to know the petitioner only in 1947, 
or barely 9 years prior to February 18, 1956 when the latter's application for 
naturalization was filed. Such failure to know petitioner for the statutory 
period of residence required by law, which is 10 years in this case, renders the 
petition defective from the very beginning and, therefore, the lower court 
should not have entertained it at all.</p>
<p>We also note that the other character witness, Cesar Las Pifias, while 
declaring that he had known the petitioner since 1940 in Cebu City, admitted 
that he is a certified public accountant and that petitioner is his retainer 
client. Considering that the question of a witness' qualification in a 
naturalization proceeding is a matter of more than usual importance since "they 
are in a way insurers of the character of the candidate concerned," we are not 
prepared to say that this witness possesses the qualifications necessary to 
satisfy the requirements of the law.</p>
<p>It is also on record, as stated by the Solicitor General, that petitioner has 
been found guilty of violating labor laws regarding the payment of wages to his 
employees, and sentenced to pay the corresponding money claim against him. The 
decision in the case was rendered <em>ex parte</em> but this appears to be due 
to petitioner's own fault, since he did not even care to appear at the hearing 
despite summons served upon him. While the present case was pending trial below, 
petitioner, it would seem, voluntarily settled the money claim against him 
although for less than the amount adjudicated. This conduct of petitioner, as 
observed by the Solicitor General, does not speak well of him, as it is not 
improbable that his belated payment of the claim, resulting in the complaint's 
withdrawal of his written opposition to the application for naturalization was 
but an 11th hour compliance with the decision, to facilitate the grant of said 
application.</p>
<p>Finally, petitioner's sincerity in becoming a Filipino citizen has been put 
in serious doubt. In the course of his testimony, he positively declared that he 
was not willing to embrace Philippine citizenship if he would not be allowed to 
acquire real estate property; that his interest was to acquire real property; 
and that being in business his main purpose is to stand on equal footing with 
Filipinos who are also engaged in business. Petitioner having, by his own 
admission, mercenary motives in applying for naturalization, and considering 
that "naturalization laws should be rigidly enforced and strictly construed in 
favor of the government and against the applicant" (Co Quing y Reyes 
<em>vs</em>. Republic, 104 Phil., 889; Co <em>vs</em>. Republic, 108 Phil., 265; 
58 Off. Gaz. [9] 1718), the trial court erred in granting the petition.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed and the petition for 
naturalization denied, with costs against petitioner-appellee.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. 
L., Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed</em>.</p></div>
