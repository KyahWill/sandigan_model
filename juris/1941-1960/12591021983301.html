  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a  petition for certiorari to annul an order  of the Public Service Commission entered in Case No. 05557, Antonio de Guzman, applicant, granting  the applicant a provisional permit to operate eight jitneys from feotonda. (Pasay) to  Forbes Park  <em>via</em> Highway  54  and  two jitneys from.  Rotonda (Pasay)  to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Taft; Avenue, Buendia and San Lorenzo Village, both vice versa. </p>
<p>On February 11, 1965, Antonio de Guzman filed with the Public Service Commission an application for a certificate of public convenience to  operate a TPU  service on  the lines (a)  from Pasay Rotonda  (Pasay City)  to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Highway 54  and vice  versa; and (b) from Pasay  Rotonda (Pasay City) to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Taft Avenue, Buendia Junction and Ayala Boulevard and vice versa. His application is docketed as Case No. 95557 of the Public Sepice Commission.  On July 2, 1956, Emiliana C. Estrella,  petitioner herein, also filed with the Commissioman application for a new, line  and increase of units on  her  old line.  The old line  is Forbes.Park, Makatf,  Rizal to Taylo  (Pasay City) and the new line is from  Pasay Rotonda, Pasay City to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Taft Avenue, Buendia, San Lorenzo Village and vice versa. petitioner's old line consists of 5 units and  her certificate of public  convenience is for 25  years.  She  increased the number of piits operating in her old line by 20 units, and she applies for 10 jitneys for her  new line.  The applications of both petitioner and respondent were published and thereafter hearings were held.  Estrella appeared as oppositor at the hearing of De Guzman's application.  As the trial could not promptly be terminated the   Public Service Commission on July 30,  1957 granted a  provisional permit &amp; respondent Antonio de Guzman to operate eight jitneys in the line from Hotonda (Pasay) to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Highway 54 and two jitneys on  the line from Rotohda (Pasay) to Forbes Park <em>via</em> Taft Avenue, Buendia and San Lorenzo Village.</p>
<p>The petitioner who had opposed  De Guzman's  application for provisional permit seeks to set aside this order, alleging that the  Commission committed a grave abuse of discretion in  granting the provisional permit in question, for the reason that petitioner  is already an operator along the lines covered by the provisional  permit and  is willing and ready to put  the additional service to cover the lines granted in the  provisional  permit.</p>
<p>There is no question that there is a public need for the lines  granted  to respondent  De  Guzman;  the petitioner herself alleged the necessity of said lines in  her  application and her petition is premised on such necessity.  Commissioner Aspillera of the Public Service Commission hol<jls view="" there="" no="" need="" for="" new="" lines,="" oh="" ground="" many="" buses="" ply="" 54,="" but="" view,="" represents="" a="" minority="" commission,="" fails="" take="" into="" account="" that="" lines="" granted="" provisionally="" serve="" customers="" along="" buendia="" and="" forbes="" park,="" are="" not="" reached="" by="" highway="" 54.="" majority="" commissioners="" make="" following="" finding="" existence="" of="" public="" necessity="" in="" the="" order="" which="" is="" now="" sought="" to="" be="" set="" aside:=""></jls></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * The  Commission finds  that on  the  lines applied for, there is a big volume of paBsengqrs and that the means of transportation presently operating on the said lines, consisting  of about twelve  (12) TPU  and AC jitneys cannot accommodate these passengers.  The  service which applicant proposes to render will serve not only the passengers that go to the different industrial establishments located along the Highway 54 and Buendia,  but  also  the people  who live within the  compound  of the Forbes Park and San  Lorenzo Village.  There  is evidence to show that  no other TPU  operators  serve the  people  living  within the compounds and the applicant  has shown to  the satisfaction  of the  Commission that he is  the only  person who  has  obtained  the permit  to operate within the Forbes Park which is a private property owned by the Forbes Park  Association, Inc.</p>
  <p>"The oppositors in  this case have just started presenting their evidence and  it will take considerable time before hearing  on this case can be completely terminated and the application decided on its merits. In the meantime, the people or the passengers whom the applicant desires  to  serve will be deprived  of  the benefit of the  proposed service."  (Annex  "H".)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two grounds upon which the claim of petitioner is based, namely: that since the  petitioner has already made substantial  investments in the  business she would be given the preference to put  up the additional units  needed,  and that(respondent Antonio de Guzman does  not have  the necessary financial means to maintain the service.</p>
<p>With respect to the first claim, substantial  reason given by  the Commission  in granting  the provisional permit        to respondent Antonio de Guzman is the fact that he has the necessary  permit  from  the owners of  both Forbes Park and San Lorenzo Village to operate jitneys  inside the subdivisions.  It is argued by the petitioner that the whims and desires of private property owners can not   deprive the right  of prior existing operators, evidently     referring to the  fact that owners  of San Lorenzo Village       and  Forbes Park have granted De Guzman privilege to operate in said subdivisions.   A consideration of the terminals of the lines granted in the provisional permit; shows that these lines are different from those operated by the petitioner because of their terminals.  The Pasay terminal of the lines covered by the provisional permit is Rotonda, whereas that of petitioner is  Taylo market.  The other terminal of the lines covered by the provisional permit is inside the compound of Forbes Park for the reason that respondent Antonio de Guzman was  given  permit to operate his jitneys therein.  The other line passes the San Lorenzo Village.  Forbes  Park is a private compound and certainly no  operator can enter  therein  without  the permission of the owners  thereof.  So is San Lorenzo Village.  The terminal of the  lines  of  the petitioner  would only  be at the gate of the Forbes  Park.   The claim of petitioner that the whims of the owners of both San Lorenzo Village and Forbes  Park can not  destroy  the preference granted by law to her as old operator is without merit. Lanes in San  Lorenzo Village and Forbes Park can not be operated without the consent of the owners.  Certainly the owners of  San  Lorenzo Village and Forbes  Park, which are private subdivisions, have the  right to determine  the operator whom  they would admit inside  their subdivisions.   The  special authority  granted to respondent Antonio de Guzman to operate in these subdivisions is indeed a very valid and practical reason for granting the provisional permit to him, in preference to petitioner.</p>
<p>As  to the supposed lack of financial ability on the part of respondent, there was showing that he had real estate assessed at P45,000  and  a residential house  valued at P7,500.  These,  we believe, are sufficient proofs of  financial ability.  It also appears that respondent has already registered  10 jitneys under  the  provisional permit.  In the face of this facts, We find no ground  for reversing the finding of the Commission as to the  financial ability of  respondent.</p>
<p>Finding no error in  the granting of provisional permit to  Antonio de Guzman, we hereby  dismiss the petition, with  costs against petitioner.</p>
