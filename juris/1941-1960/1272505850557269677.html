				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Robles Transportation Company, Inc., later referred to as the Company, is appealing from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, civil case No. 2013, ordering it&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay plaintiffs Emilio&nbsp; Manalo and his&nbsp; wife, Clara Salvador, the sum of P3,000 with&nbsp; interest at 12 per cent&nbsp; per annum from&nbsp; November&nbsp; 14, 1952&nbsp; plus the amount of P600&nbsp; for attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, with&nbsp; costs.<p>The facts involved in this&nbsp; case are simple and without dispute.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 9, 1947, a taxicab owned and operated by defendant appellant Company and driven by&nbsp; Edgardo Hernandez its driver,&nbsp; collided&nbsp; with a passenger&nbsp; truck at Paranaque, Rizal.&nbsp; In the course of and as a result of the accident, the taxicab ran over Armando Manalo, an eleven year old,&nbsp; causing him physical&nbsp; injuries which resulted in his death several days later, .Edgardo Hernandez was prosecuted for homicide through reckless imprudence and after trial was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to&nbsp; one year <span style="font-style: italic;">prison correctional, </span>to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of&nbsp; P3,000, in case of insolvency to suffer subsidiary imprisonment, and to pay costs.&nbsp; Edgardo Hernandez served out his sentence but failed to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; indemnity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two writs of&nbsp; execution were&nbsp; issued&nbsp; against him to satisfy the amount of the indemnity, but both writs were returned unsatisfied by the sheriff who&nbsp; certified that&nbsp; no property, real or personal, in Hernandez'&nbsp; name could be found.'</p><p>On&nbsp; February&nbsp; 17, 1953,&nbsp; plaintiffs Emilio Manalo and his wife&nbsp; Clara Salvador, father and mother respectively of Armando, filed the present action against the Company to enforce its subsidiary&nbsp; liability, pursuant to&nbsp; Articles 102 and&nbsp; 103 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company filed its&nbsp; appearance and answer and&nbsp; later an&nbsp; amended answer with&nbsp; special defenses and counterclaim.&nbsp; It also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint unless and until the convicted driver Hernandez was included as&nbsp; a&nbsp; party defendant, the Company considering him an indispensable party..&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss, holding that Hernandez was not an&nbsp; indispensable&nbsp; party defendant.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with this ruling, the Company filed certiorari proceedings with the&nbsp; Court of Appeals,&nbsp; but said appellate court held that&nbsp; Hernandez&nbsp; was not an indispensable&nbsp; party defendant, and consequently, the trial court in denying the motion to dismiss acted within the proper limits of its discretion.&nbsp; Eventually, the&nbsp; trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant&nbsp; Company to pay to&nbsp; plaintiffs damages in the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P3,000 with interest at 12 per cent per annum from November 14, 1952, plus P600 for attorney's fees and expenses for litigation, with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; aforestated, the Company&nbsp; is&nbsp; appealing . from this decision.</p><p>To prove&nbsp; their case&nbsp; against the defendant&nbsp; Company, the&nbsp; plaintiffs introduced a&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision in the criminal case convicting Hernandez of homicide&nbsp; through reckless imprudence, the&nbsp; writs&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution to enforce the civil liability, and the returns of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; showing that the two writs&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution were not&nbsp; satisfied because of the&nbsp; insolvency of&nbsp; Hernandez, the&nbsp; sheriff being unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; locate&nbsp; any property&nbsp; in&nbsp; his name.&nbsp; Over the objections of the Company, the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court admitted this evidence and based&nbsp; its decision in the present case on the same.</p><p>Defendant-appellant&nbsp; now contends&nbsp; that this&nbsp; kind of evidence is inadmissible and cites in support&nbsp; of its&nbsp; contention the cases of City of Manila&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Manila Electric Company (52 Phil., 586), and Arambulo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Electric Company (15 Phil., 75).&nbsp; This&nbsp; point has&nbsp; already been decided by&nbsp; this tribunal in the case of Martinez&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Barredo (81 Phil., 1).&nbsp; After considering the same two cases now cited by appellant,&nbsp; this court held that the judgment of&nbsp; conviction, in the absence&nbsp; of any collusion&nbsp; between the defendant and&nbsp; offended party, is binding upon the party subsidiarily liable.</p><p>The appellant also claims&nbsp; that in admitting as&nbsp; evidence the sheriff's return of&nbsp; the&nbsp; writs&nbsp; of execution to&nbsp; prove the insolvency of Hernandez,&nbsp; without requiring said official's appearance in court, it was&nbsp; deprived of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opportunity to cross-examine&nbsp; said&nbsp; sheriff.&nbsp; A sheriff's&nbsp; return is&nbsp; an&nbsp; official&nbsp; statement&nbsp; made by a public" official&nbsp; in&nbsp; the performance&nbsp; of a&nbsp; duty specially&nbsp; enjoined&nbsp; by law and forming part of official records, and is <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence of the facts&nbsp; stated therein.&nbsp; (Rule 39, section 11 and Rule 123, section 35, Rules of Court.)&nbsp; The sheriff making the return need not testify in court as to the facts stated in his entry.&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp; Antillon <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Barcelon, 37 Phil., 151, citing Wigmore on&nbsp; Evidence, this court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"To the foregoing rules with reference to the method of&nbsp; proving private documents an exception is&nbsp; made&nbsp; with reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the method of proving public documents executed before and certified to, under the hand and seal of&nbsp; certain public officials.&nbsp; The courts and the legislature have recognized the valid reason for such an exception.&nbsp; The&nbsp; litigation is unlimited in which testimony by&nbsp; officials is daily needed, the occasions in which the officials would be&nbsp; summoned from his ordinary duties to declare&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness are numberless. The public officers are few&nbsp; in whose daily work something is&nbsp; not done in which testimony is&nbsp; not&nbsp; needed from official sources.&nbsp; Were there no&nbsp; exception&nbsp; to official statements, hosts of officials would be found&nbsp; devoting&nbsp; the&nbsp; greater part of their time&nbsp;&nbsp; to attending as witnesses in court or delivering their depositions before an officer. The work&nbsp; of Administration of government&nbsp; and&nbsp; the interest&nbsp; of the public having&nbsp; business with officials&nbsp; would&nbsp; alike suffer&nbsp; in consequence."</p></blockquote><p>And this Court added:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"The law reposes&nbsp; a&nbsp; particular confidence in public officers that ' it presumes they will discharge their several trusts with accuracy and fidelity; and,&nbsp; therefore, whatever&nbsp; acts they do In discharge of their public duty may be given&nbsp; in evidence and shall be taken to be true under&nbsp; such a&nbsp; degree&nbsp; of caution as the nature and circumstances&nbsp; of each case&nbsp; may appear to require,"</blockquote><p>The appellant also contends that&nbsp; Articles&nbsp; 102 and 103 of the Revised Penal Code were repealed by the New Civil Code,&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; in 1950, particularly, by the&nbsp; repealing clause under&nbsp; which comes Article&nbsp; 2270&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said code.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find the contention untenable.&nbsp; Article 2177 of the New&nbsp; Civil Code expressly recognizes civil liabilities arising from negligence under the Penal Code, only that it provides that plaintiff cannot recover&nbsp; damages twice for the same act of omission of the defendant.</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"ART. 2177. Responsibility for fault or negligence under the preceding article is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence tinder the&nbsp; Penal Code:&nbsp; But the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the same act of omission of the defendant."</blockquote><p>Invoking prescription, appellant claims that the present action is barred by the Statute&nbsp; of limitations for the reason that it is an action either, upon an injury to the rights of the" plaintiff, or&nbsp; upon a quasi delict,&nbsp; and that according&nbsp; to&nbsp; Article 1146 of the New Civil&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; such action must be instituted&nbsp; within&nbsp; four&nbsp; years.&nbsp; We&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee that the present action&nbsp; is based&nbsp; upon a judgment, namely,&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal case, finding Hernandez guilty of homicide through reckless imprudence and sentencing him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P3,000,&nbsp; and, consequently may be instituted within ten&nbsp; years.</p><p>As regards the other errors assigned by appellant, we find it unnecessary to&nbsp; discuss&nbsp; and rule upon them. Finding the decision appealed from to be in accordance ;with&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the same is hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Buatista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ..</em> concur.</p></div>
