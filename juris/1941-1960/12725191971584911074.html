				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal taken by plaintiff Rafael Carreon from an order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Pampanga, granting a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants herein.<p>Plaintiff instituted this case on October 21,1953, against the&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Pampanga,&nbsp; and Rafael Lazatin, Emilio Cortez and Librado D.&nbsp; Santos.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his complaint,&nbsp; plaintiff alleges, as first cause of action, that he owes a&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; situated in Duck Island, barrio Sto. Nino, municipality of Guagua, province of Pampanga, which was then and&nbsp; is being&nbsp; subdivided into&nbsp; small&nbsp; lots;&nbsp; that, in order to facilitate the&nbsp; sale thereof&nbsp; to&nbsp; the public, at a good price, in January, 1948, he applied,&nbsp; from the Municipal&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of Guagua,&nbsp; Pampanga,&nbsp; for authority to construct,&nbsp; at&nbsp; his expense, a&nbsp; bridge across&nbsp; the Guagua River, between said Duck Island and the market site of Guagua; that said council referred his application&nbsp; to the Provincial Fiscal, for opinion on the feasibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; granting&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority prayed for;&nbsp; that on June&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1949, said&nbsp; council passed Resolution&nbsp; No. 70,&nbsp; requesting the proper&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; to patronize&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction of the bridge aforementioned; that on April 12, 1950, the Provincial&nbsp; Board of Pampanga passed&nbsp; Resolution No. 303 appropriating P15,000 for said bridge and providing that the additional sum of F9,480,&nbsp; more or less, needed&nbsp; to complete its construction,&nbsp; be borne&nbsp; by the municipality of Guagua; that on April&nbsp; 18, 1950, the municipal mayor of Guagua wrote to plaintiff a letter suggesting that he donate&nbsp; P10,000&nbsp; for the completion of said bridge; that on August&nbsp; 14, 1950, plaintiff&nbsp; wrote to Jose B. Lingad, the then Provincial Governor&nbsp; of Pampanga, offering&nbsp; to make said donation; that this officer signified the intention of the&nbsp; Province of Pampanga to accept&nbsp; the donation; that on April 25, 1961, plaintiff delivered to the provincial treasurer of Pampanga the sum of P5,000 on account of said donation, which the Provincial Board of Pampanga accepted by&nbsp; Resolution No. 930, dated&nbsp; June 30,&nbsp; 1951; that on August 3,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; the Office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; District Engineer of Pampanga advised Carreon in writing that the construction of the bridge' had begun already&nbsp; and&nbsp; requested him to pay&nbsp; the balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; said donation; that on August&nbsp; 16, 1951, Carreon&nbsp; caused to be delivered&nbsp; to the provincial treasurer of Pampanga the sum of P3,000, with the understanding that the balance of P2,000 would be paid later, "to cover expenses for the finishing touches of the bridge in question";&nbsp; that, while said bridge was being constructed, on June 30, 1952, the new Provincial Board of Pampanga, composed of&nbsp; defendants Rafael Lazatin, as Provincial Governor, and&nbsp; Emilio Cortez and Librado D. Santos, as members, passed Resolution No.&nbsp; 1687, whereby "without any&nbsp; valid reason",&nbsp; they "illegally and maliciously&nbsp; stopped the work" of construction&nbsp; of said bridge,&nbsp; and "illegally and&nbsp; maliciously"&nbsp; diverted the application of the balance of the funds appropriated therefor by the Province "to the construction of another bridge along the road between Angeles and Magalang"; and that, despite&nbsp; repeated demands,&nbsp; defendants had failed and refused, and still fail and refuse, to authorize&nbsp; the continuation of the construction of the bridge in question.</p><p>By way of second cause of action, it is alleged in the complaint that, by reason of said "illegal and malicious" acts of defendants herein,&nbsp; "particularly, librado D. Santos ", who is said to "have a grudge against the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; because the&nbsp; latter had work in the&nbsp; last elections for the candidacy of&nbsp; their&nbsp; opponents,"&nbsp; plaintiff had sustained damages&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggregate sum of P150,000, in&nbsp; view of&nbsp; which he prayed that judgment be rendered in his favor for said sum of P150,000,&nbsp; apart from "ordering the defendants&nbsp; to&nbsp; immediately cause&nbsp; the resumption of&nbsp; the construction of the bridge in question until the&nbsp; same is&nbsp; fully completed." </p><p>On December 19, 1953, the Provincial Fiscal&nbsp; of Pampanga,&nbsp; purporting&nbsp; to&nbsp; act&nbsp; on behalf of&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; filed an answer&nbsp; admitting some&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of the complaint and denying other allegations thereof,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; setting up several special defenses and a P50,000 counter-claim for actual and moral damages&nbsp; allegedly sustained&nbsp; by them.&nbsp; The court having later considered this answer as that of&nbsp; the Province of Pampanga&nbsp; only, defendant Cortes submitted his separate answer, whereas Atty. Eligio G,. Lagman,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on behalf of defendant Santos&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; to dismiss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon thereafter, Atty. Pablo D.&nbsp; Cabrera filed, on behalf of "the defendants", another motion to dismiss upon the ground "that the complaint states no cause of action."&nbsp; After due hearing the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Pampanga issued&nbsp; an order dated March 29, 1954, granting said motion to dismiss and,&nbsp; accordingly, dismissing plaintiff's&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp; This order was predicated&nbsp; upon the following reasons:</p><blockquote><p>"The Provincial Board of Pampanga, in passing&nbsp; Resolution No. 303 dated April 12, 1953, no doubt had in its mind the welfare of the people&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Municipality of&nbsp; Guagua especially those&nbsp; people who were already living or would transfer their residences&nbsp; to the Duck Island of the said Municipality,&nbsp; and&nbsp; likewise had in mind that during: the time when they passed the aforementioned&nbsp; resolution, they had only at their disposal the limited amount of P15, 000.00 so they&nbsp; made a&nbsp; proviso in the aforesaid resolution&nbsp; that&nbsp; for the completion of the construction of the aforementioned bridge, the Municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Guagna should have to defray&nbsp; the&nbsp; difference in the costs of construction.&nbsp; When the&nbsp; Provincial Board accepted the donation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff herein,&nbsp; the members thereof might&nbsp; have or might not have&nbsp; known&nbsp; that the&nbsp; prime interest of the plaintiff in offering the donation to defray&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; for the construction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bridge was&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; business&nbsp; purpose,&nbsp; that of realizing big profits from the lots&nbsp; that have been subdivided in the&nbsp; Duck Island.&nbsp; In the offer of&nbsp; the plaintiff to&nbsp; defray the expenses of P10,000, he did not make or given&nbsp; any condition to the Provincial Board that&nbsp; would&nbsp; bind&nbsp; the Provincial&nbsp; Board,&nbsp; happen what&nbsp; may, to complete the&nbsp; construction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; bridge&nbsp; now in question.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; Mr. Carreon's purpose in giving&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of P10,000, and in himself, he&nbsp; might have considered it&nbsp; a business transaction and was expecting&nbsp; big profit, therefore, he should have made clear his offer in such a way that the offer of P10,000&nbsp; and the acceptance by the Provincial Board&nbsp; thereof would constitute a sort of a&nbsp; contract.&nbsp; Scanning very well&nbsp; Exhibits 'A' and&nbsp; '1'&nbsp; and '2', we could not see anything therein where&nbsp; a contract&nbsp; existed either express or implied. We&nbsp; can&nbsp; see only&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Provincial Board wanted&nbsp; to have a biridge across the&nbsp; Guagua&nbsp; River&nbsp; connecting the barrio of Sto. Nino, Guagua to the&nbsp; Duck&nbsp; Island, and Mr. Carreon, with a big heart wanted&nbsp; to have the said bridge constructed. We only can see from the letter&nbsp; of Mr. Carreon that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; being philanthropic without in the least suspecting&nbsp; that between the lines what he means&nbsp; was profit and gain. The Provincial Board&nbsp; in its Resolution No.&nbsp; 1687&nbsp; dated July 30,&nbsp; 1952, in&nbsp; reverting the&nbsp; funds originally appropriated for the construction&nbsp; of the bridge&nbsp; to connect Duek Island to the poblacion&nbsp; of Guagua to the&nbsp; construction of a concrete bridge along the&nbsp; road&nbsp; between Angeles and Magalang, was in the exercise of its power and authority.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; not within the province of any officer but that of the members of the Provincial&nbsp; Board to judge the&nbsp; needs of the people of the province and the feasibility and reasonableness&nbsp; of its&nbsp; improvements.&nbsp; The Provincial&nbsp; Board, in passing the aforementioned last&nbsp; resolution may have in&nbsp; fact prejudiced the&nbsp; private&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff herein but&nbsp; we&nbsp; do not&nbsp; see therefrom&nbsp; that&nbsp; the real&nbsp; and true&nbsp; intention&nbsp; of the members of the board in&nbsp; passing the said resolution&nbsp; was for the&nbsp; sole purpose of&nbsp; prejudicing or damaging the&nbsp; interest of the plaintiff as&nbsp; he&nbsp; had alleged in his&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court, in the exercise of&nbsp; its&nbsp; jurisdiction, does not have&nbsp; to interfere with the soundness of the&nbsp; actions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial Board because&nbsp; it&nbsp; is only the said board that can decide whether what they have done is good or not for the&nbsp; province, as the&nbsp; members of the Provincial Board&nbsp; has done in Resolution No. 1687.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Provincial Board of Pampanga, in passing its Resolution No. 303 dated April&nbsp; 12, 1950 might&nbsp; have&nbsp; believed&nbsp; that the construction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bridge over the barrio&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sto.&nbsp; Nino and the Duck Island was&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; best interest&nbsp; of the people concerned, and the&nbsp; Provincial Board,&nbsp; in&nbsp; passing Resolution No. 1687, might have also in mind the best interest of the province and it is not for the Court to&nbsp; question as we have aforestated, the&nbsp; reasonableness&nbsp; and&nbsp; soundness&nbsp; of their actuations.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have&nbsp; aforestated, the. Court cannot see that&nbsp; there was a contract&nbsp; either&nbsp; express or implied,&nbsp; between the Provincial Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pampanga, and&nbsp; the members&nbsp; composing it on the one hand and the plaintiff&nbsp; herein on the other hand&nbsp; for the completion of the construction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned bridge. We only could see that the plaintiff wanted&nbsp; to have big gains in the&nbsp; guise of a philanthropic gesture which unluckily backfired.&nbsp; This&nbsp; being the case, we are of the opinion and so hold&nbsp; that the plaintiff cannot compel the Province of Pampanga&nbsp; and&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of its board to resume the construction of the bridge to connect the barrio of Sto. Nino, Guagua to&nbsp; the Duck Island if in the decision of the Provincial Board, they&nbsp; are not&nbsp; yet in a position&nbsp; to&nbsp; construct the same and if they believe that the&nbsp; resumption of&nbsp; the construction of the same is not yet&nbsp; timely. We likewise believe that the&nbsp; members of the Provincial&nbsp; Board of Pampanga,&nbsp; namely: Defendants, Hon. Rafael&nbsp; Lazatin, Hon. Emilio&nbsp; P. Cortez&nbsp; and Dr.&nbsp; Librado. D. Santos, should not be held liable for any damage that the plaintiff herein may have sustained in the former's passing Resolution No. 1687, dated&nbsp; July 80, 1952, because&nbsp; in passing the same they have acted in their official capacities and within&nbsp; the scope of the authority and power vested&nbsp; in&nbsp; them as members of the aforementioned provincial board.</p><p>"In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of&nbsp; all&nbsp; the foregoing, the&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; filed against the&nbsp; defendants herein&nbsp; is&nbsp; ordered dismissed. without&nbsp; pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs."</p></blockquote><p>It would appear,&nbsp; therefore, that this&nbsp; order of dismissal is premised, in effect, upon the theory that the&nbsp; Chairman and members of the Provincial&nbsp; Board&nbsp; had acted in&nbsp; good faith&nbsp; and within the scope of&nbsp; their authority and that the allegations of the complaint to the contrary&nbsp; are not true This&nbsp; is clearly&nbsp; a&nbsp; reversible&nbsp; error.&nbsp; A motion to dismiss the complaint generally partakes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature of a&nbsp; demurrer, and, as such, it&nbsp; hypothetically admits the truth of the&nbsp; allegations of fact made in&nbsp; the complaint. If said motion&nbsp; assails directly or indirectly, the&nbsp; veracity of the aforementioned allegations, it is improper to grant the motion upon the assumption&nbsp; that the&nbsp; averments therein are true and that those of the complaint are not.&nbsp; The court should, either deny the motion, without prejudice to defendants'&nbsp; right to plead,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; special&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; in his answer,&nbsp; the&nbsp; very issue upon which said motion is predicated,&nbsp; or&nbsp; proceed&nbsp; to the reception&nbsp; of evidence on the issue of&nbsp; fact thus&nbsp; raised,&nbsp; before&nbsp; settling the same. In the case&nbsp; of Palma <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Garciano, et al., L-7240&nbsp; (supra, p 72), we said:</p><blockquote><p>"* * * The order of&nbsp; dismissal complained of is predicated&nbsp; upon the theory that the&nbsp; filing of the&nbsp; informations above referred to, is 'presumed'' to have been&nbsp; made 'in good faith' and that, in fact, the proper court had found&nbsp; the existence of probable cause against plaintiff herein, contrary to&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; in the complaint, which specifically charges 'bad faith', lack of 'any probable cause', desire to give vent to 'personal&nbsp; hatred&nbsp; and vengeance', and&nbsp; intent' to harass and embarrass the plaintiff&nbsp; and to besmirch his&nbsp; honor and reputation. The only question for&nbsp; determination&nbsp; by the court, at the&nbsp; time of the issuance of said&nbsp; order, was whether or not the complaint&nbsp; states a cause of action.&nbsp; This&nbsp; implied that&nbsp; said&nbsp; issue was&nbsp; to be passed upon&nbsp; on the basis of&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations of the complaint, assuming&nbsp; them to be true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead,&nbsp; His Honor, the trial&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; inquired, into the truth of said allegations and, in effect, found them to be false. And this it&nbsp; did without&nbsp; giving the plaintiff an opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove his aforesaid allegations.&nbsp; Thus, the lower court had, not only exceeded its jurisdiction,&nbsp; by going beyond the purview of&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue posed by defendants motions to dismiss, but,&nbsp; also, denied due process&nbsp; of law&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff herein, by,&nbsp; in effect deciding the case on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits,&nbsp; before it&nbsp; had been submitted&nbsp; for&nbsp; decision&nbsp; and&nbsp; before&nbsp; plaintiff had had&nbsp; a chance to introduce evidence&nbsp; in support of the&nbsp; allegations of his complaint."</p></blockquote><p>Again, the very emphasis given in the order appealed from, to the&nbsp; possible&nbsp; good&nbsp; faith of the&nbsp; members of&nbsp; the provincial&nbsp; board&nbsp; indicates&nbsp; that,&nbsp; otherwise, a cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; would exist against them.&nbsp; Indeed, as stated&nbsp; in the Palma case:</p><blockquote><p>"* * * it is wen settled that&nbsp; when a public&nbsp; officer goes outside scope&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; duty,&nbsp; particularly when acting tortiously, he is not entitled to protection on account of his&nbsp; office, but&nbsp; is liable for his acts like&nbsp; any private&nbsp; individual (46 C. J. 1046; 22 R.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; L. -&nbsp; 478-479)."</p></blockquote><p>Thus in&nbsp; Mendoza <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; (33 Phil.,&nbsp; 508, 513)&nbsp; it was&nbsp; held:</p><blockquote><p>"Not are officer&nbsp; or agent of the&nbsp; Government charged with performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; governmental duties which are in their nature&nbsp; legislative, or quasi judicial, liable for the consequences of&nbsp; their official acts, unless it be shown that they act willfully&nbsp; and maliciously, and with the express purpose&nbsp; of inflicting injury&nbsp; upon the plaintiff" (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>'The liability becomes even&nbsp; clearer&nbsp; when the act&nbsp; performed involves&nbsp; the exercise of corporate&nbsp; or proprietary functions, rather than of duties which&nbsp; are&nbsp; strictly&nbsp; governmental or&nbsp; political&nbsp; in&nbsp; nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring&nbsp; to the&nbsp; rescission, by&nbsp; a municipal council of&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract of lease for the operation of&nbsp; a ferry, this Court declared, in said&nbsp; case of Mendoza&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De Leon (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>):</p><blockquote><p>"* * * it should&nbsp; be&nbsp; clear that&nbsp; a municipality is not&nbsp; exempt from&nbsp; liability for the negligent&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; its corporate or proprietary or business functions.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; administration&nbsp; of&nbsp; its patrimonial property, it is&nbsp; to be&nbsp; regarded as a private&nbsp; corporation or individual&nbsp; so far as&nbsp; its liability to&nbsp; third&nbsp; persons on contract or in tort is concerned.' Its contracts, validly entered into, may be enforced and&nbsp; damages may be collected from&nbsp; it&nbsp; for the torts of its officers or agents&nbsp; within&nbsp; the scope of&nbsp; their employment in precisely the&nbsp; same&nbsp; manner and&nbsp; to&nbsp; the same&nbsp; extent as those of private&nbsp; corporations or&nbsp; individuals.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to such matters the principles&nbsp; of respondent superior applies.&nbsp; It is for&nbsp; these purposes that the municipality is made liable to suits in the courts."</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * in&nbsp; administering&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; patrimonial property&nbsp; of&nbsp; municipalities,&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal council&nbsp; occupies, for&nbsp; most&nbsp; purposes,&nbsp; the position of a board of directors of a private corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; disposing of&nbsp; the local" public utilities, if the term be&nbsp; used,&nbsp; such as the fishing&nbsp; and ferry rights, etc., they must execrise considerable judgment.&nbsp; It&nbsp; requires some considerable amount&nbsp; of business&nbsp; acumen to compel performance on the part of lessees of these privileges in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of their leases and in&nbsp; a manner which will not cause the property to deteriorate.&nbsp; Questions must continually arise which&nbsp; are not expressly provided for&nbsp; in the contracts and which must be settled, if&nbsp; possible, in a manner&nbsp; that will preserve the just&nbsp; claims&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is not at&nbsp; all improbable that on&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; the councilors&nbsp; may have reason to believe that a particular contract has been rescinded by the other party or has&nbsp; never been legally entered into,&nbsp; in both&nbsp; of which cases, decisive steps must be taken to safeguard the interest of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; in&nbsp; Municipality of&nbsp; Moncada <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cajuigah&nbsp; (21&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 184), the&nbsp; lessee&nbsp; of a&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; fishery&nbsp; was evicted&nbsp; for failing to pay&nbsp; his quarterly rents.&nbsp; The municipal authorities rightly held that the&nbsp; contract was rescinded but forcibly evicted&nbsp; the lessee&nbsp; instead or resorting to&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; in an&nbsp; action by&nbsp; the municipality against the lessee and his bondsmen to&nbsp; recover rent&nbsp; arrears, damages were allowed&nbsp; the lessee on&nbsp; his counterclaim for the loss caused&nbsp; by the forcible eviction.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp; we do not think the councilors could&nbsp; have been held personally liable for their&nbsp; error in&nbsp; resorting&nbsp; to&nbsp; forcible&nbsp; eviction&nbsp; of the lessee.&nbsp; Theirs was an error of judgment, and honest mistake on&nbsp; their part as to the rights of&nbsp; the municipality in the premises. We think&nbsp; the rule&nbsp; of personal&nbsp; liability&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; with municipal councilors&nbsp; in&nbsp; such matters as it is with the directors&nbsp; or managers of&nbsp; an ordinary private&nbsp; corporation.</p><p>"'Under the&nbsp; rule&nbsp; that directors are not liable for mistakes&nbsp; of judgment,&nbsp; it&nbsp; follows naturally&nbsp; that they&nbsp; are not liable for&nbsp; the mismanagement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporate affairs where&nbsp; such mismanagement is a mistake&nbsp; of judgment.&nbsp; The&nbsp; wisdom of this rule&nbsp; is&nbsp; not only&nbsp; approved by common experience&nbsp; but&nbsp; by&nbsp; law&nbsp; writers and all courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; A rule so rigid as to hold directors&nbsp; personally liable&nbsp; for honest&nbsp; mistakes in&nbsp; corporate management&nbsp; would deter all prudent business men for accepting such&nbsp; positions.&nbsp; The remedy of stockholders in all such cases is by a change&nbsp; of the directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; * * * The rule is that courts will not&nbsp; interfere even&nbsp; in&nbsp; doubtful&nbsp; cases. But directors and managing officers may be liable&nbsp; for mismanagement to warrant the interposition of a court&nbsp; either&nbsp; as&nbsp; against the contemplated action&nbsp; of the&nbsp; directors,&nbsp; or a majority of&nbsp; the stockholders,&nbsp; or to&nbsp; give&nbsp; relief by way&nbsp; of&nbsp; damages&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp; the action&nbsp; has been taken; a case&nbsp; must&nbsp; be made out which plainly shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; such action is so&nbsp; far opposed to the true interests of&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; itself&nbsp; as&nbsp; to lead&nbsp; to the&nbsp; clear inference&nbsp; that no one thus&nbsp; acting could have been influenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; any&nbsp; honest desire to secure such interests,&nbsp; but that he must have&nbsp; acted with an&nbsp; intent&nbsp; to&nbsp; subserve&nbsp; some outside&nbsp; purpose,&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; the consequences&nbsp; to the corporation, and in a manner inconsistent with its interest.'&nbsp; (Thompson on Corporations,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1298.)</p><p>"In the case at&nbsp; bar, there&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a&nbsp; scintilla of evidence&nbsp; that there was any&nbsp; justifiable reason for forcibly&nbsp; evicting the plaintiff from the&nbsp; ferry which&nbsp; he had&nbsp; leased. On the&nbsp; contrary, the&nbsp; defendant councilors attempted to justify their action on the&nbsp; ground that the ferry which he was operating was&nbsp; not the one leased to him; this, inspite&nbsp; of&nbsp; the fact that the vice president had personally placed him in possession of it more than&nbsp; a year&nbsp; before, and&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that he had&nbsp; operated his ferry for over a year, evidently with the knowledge of the N defendants. The evidence is so clear that&nbsp; the ferry of which the plaintiff was dispossessed was the one which he had. leased&nbsp; that&nbsp; no&nbsp; reasonable man would&nbsp; entertain any doubt whatever upon the question.&nbsp; Hence, we cannot say&nbsp; that in&nbsp; rescinding&nbsp; the contract with&nbsp; the plaintiff, thereby making the municipality. liable to an action for damages&nbsp; for&nbsp; no valid reason at all,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant councilors were honestly acting for the interests of the municipality.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">We are, therefore,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion that&nbsp; the defendants are liable&nbsp; jointly and severally&nbsp; for the damages sustained by the&nbsp; plaintiff from the rescission of his contract </span>of&nbsp; lease of&nbsp; the&nbsp; ferry&nbsp; privilege&nbsp; in&nbsp; question."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.).</p></blockquote><p>It is not&nbsp; necessary for&nbsp; us,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we do&nbsp; not&nbsp; mean,&nbsp; to determine,&nbsp; at this stage of the proceedings, whether the function involved&nbsp; in the approval&nbsp; of Resolution&nbsp; No. 1687 of&nbsp; the Provincial Board of Pampanga,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; July 30, 1952, is&nbsp; governmental&nbsp; or&nbsp; corporate&nbsp; in&nbsp; character. The resolution of such&nbsp; question may&nbsp; be deferred until such time as the case may be ready&nbsp; for decision on the merits. We&nbsp; do hold, however, that the allegations of the complaint state <span style="font-style: italic;">prima fade&nbsp;</span> a cause of action against the defendants and that,&nbsp; consequently, plaintiff is&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; an opportunity&nbsp; to prove the allegations of his complaint, before the validity of his claim could be passed upon.</p><p>Wherefore, the&nbsp; order appealed from&nbsp; is hereby reversed and let the records of this case be remanded to the lower court for further proceedings,&nbsp; in conformity&nbsp; with this decision with the costs&nbsp; of this instance&nbsp; against the defendants.&nbsp; It is so of ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J,,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.
