				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals,&nbsp; as&nbsp; later&nbsp; modified, declaring petitioner liable for the total sum of P33,187.00 as deficiency&nbsp; income tax due for the years&nbsp; 1950, 1951&nbsp; and 1952.<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; a domestic corporation&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the importation of&nbsp; textiles, hardware, sundries,&nbsp; chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, lumbers, groceries, wines and liquor; in insurance and lumber; and in some exports.&nbsp; In the income tax returns for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952 it filed with respondent, petitioner&nbsp; deducted from its&nbsp; gross&nbsp; income certain items&nbsp; representing salaries,&nbsp; directors' fees&nbsp; and bonuses&nbsp; of its non-resident president and vice-president bonuses of&nbsp; some of&nbsp; its resident officers&nbsp; and employees; and interests on earned but unpaid salaries and bonuses of its officers and employees.&nbsp; The income tax computed in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; these returns was&nbsp; duly paid&nbsp; by petitioner.<br><br>On July&nbsp; 2, 1953,&nbsp; after&nbsp; disallowing the&nbsp; deductions of the items representing directors'&nbsp; fees, salaries and bonuses of petitioner's&nbsp; non-resident president and vice president; the bonus participation of certain resident officers&nbsp; and employees; and the interests on earned but unpaid salaries and bonuses, respondent assessed and demanded from petitioner the payment of deficiency income taxes in the sums of&nbsp; P26,370.00,&nbsp; P53,865.00&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; P44,112.00 for the years 1950, 1951 and&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; respectively.&nbsp; Petitioner requested for the re-examination&nbsp; of&nbsp; this assessment, and on June 8, 1955, respondent modified the same by allowing as deductible all items comprising directors' fees and salaries of the non-resident president and vice president, bull disallowing the bonuses insofar as they exceed the salaries of the recipients, as well as the interests on&nbsp; earned but unpaid salaries and bonuses. Hence, for the years&nbsp; 1950, 1951&nbsp; and 1952,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; made&nbsp; a new assessment and demanded from&nbsp; petitioner as deficiency income taxes the amounts of&nbsp; P10,147.00,&nbsp; P26,783.00&nbsp; and,&nbsp; P20,481.00, respectively. Petitioner having taken the case on appeal&nbsp; to the Court of Tax Appeals, the latter modified the assessment of respondent as stated in&nbsp; the early part of this decision.<br><br>From this decision both parties have appealed, petitioner from that portion which holds&nbsp; that the&nbsp; measure of the reasonableness of&nbsp; the bonuses&nbsp; paid to&nbsp; its non-resident president and vice president&nbsp; should&nbsp; be applied&nbsp; to the bonuses given to resident officers and employees in determining&nbsp; their&nbsp; deducibility and&nbsp; so only so&nbsp; much of said bonuses&nbsp; as applied to&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter should be&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; as deduction,&nbsp; and respondent from that portion&nbsp; of the decision&nbsp; which allows the&nbsp; deduction&nbsp; of so&nbsp; much of the bonuses&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess of&nbsp; the yearly&nbsp; salaries paid to the respective recipients&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>The law involved here is Section 30 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; (1) and (&amp;) (1) of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code, the&nbsp; pertinent provisions of which we quote:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 30. Deductions from gross income.—In&nbsp; computing net&nbsp; income there shall be allowed as deductions—<br><br>(a)<span style="font-style: italic;"> Expenses:</span><br><br>(1) <span style="font-style: italic;">In general</span>—All the&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; and necessary expenses paid or incurred&nbsp; during1 the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for salaries&nbsp; or other compensation for personal services&nbsp; actually rendered; * * *<br><br>(b)<span style="font-style: italic;"> Interest:</span><br><br>(1)<span style="font-style: italic;"> In general</span>—The amount&nbsp; of interest paid&nbsp; within&nbsp; the taxable year on indebtedness, except on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase&nbsp; or carry obligations the&nbsp; interest upon which is exempt from taxation&nbsp; as income under this&nbsp; Title."<br></blockquote>It would appear that all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on a trade or business, including a reasonable&nbsp; allowance&nbsp; for salaries&nbsp; or other compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; personal services actually&nbsp; rendered, may be&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; as deductions in&nbsp; computing the taxable income during the year.&nbsp;&nbsp; It likewise appears&nbsp; that the amount of interests paid within&nbsp; the taxable year on any indebtedness may also be deducted&nbsp; from the gross income. Here it is admitted that the bonuses paid to&nbsp; the officers and employees of petitioner, whether resident or non-resident, were&nbsp; paid to them as additional compensation for personal services actually rendered and as such can be considered as ordinary&nbsp; and necessary expenses incurred in the business within the meaning of the law, the only question in dispute being how&nbsp; much of&nbsp; said bonuses may be considered reasonable in order that it&nbsp; may be allowed as&nbsp; deduction.<br><br>It should be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; that petitioner gave to its non-resident president and vice president for the years&nbsp; 1950 and 1951&nbsp; bonuses equal to 133-½ %&nbsp; of their annual salaries and&nbsp; bonuses equal to&nbsp; 125 2/3%&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; year&nbsp;&nbsp; 1952, whereas with regard to its resident officers and employees it gave them much more on the alleged reason&nbsp; that they deserved them&nbsp; because of their&nbsp; valuable contribution to the business of the corporation which has made it possible for&nbsp; it to realize&nbsp; huge profits during the&nbsp; aforesaid years.&nbsp; And&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals ruled that while the bonuses given to&nbsp; the non-resident officers&nbsp; are reasonable&nbsp; considering their yearly salaries&nbsp; and the services actually rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; them, the&nbsp; bonuses given&nbsp; to the resident officers and employees are, however, quite excessive,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; saying&nbsp; on&nbsp; this&nbsp; point&nbsp; that&nbsp; "there is no special reason for granting greater bonuses to such lower ranking officers than those&nbsp; given to Messrs. Kuenzle and Streiff,"&nbsp; Petitioner now disputes this&nbsp; ruling insofar as the&nbsp; resident officers&nbsp; and&nbsp; employees are concerned&nbsp; contending that the&nbsp; same is not in accordance with the&nbsp; usual pattern to be followed in determining the reasonableness of&nbsp; a given compensation because it&nbsp; ignores the nature, extent and quality&nbsp; of the services actually&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by its resident officers&nbsp; and employees.<br><br>It is a general rule that "Bonuses to employees made in&nbsp; good faith and&nbsp; as&nbsp; additional compensation&nbsp; for the services actually rendered by the employees are deductible, provided&nbsp; such payments, when added to the&nbsp; stipulated salaries, do&nbsp; not exceed&nbsp; a&nbsp; reasonable compensation for the&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered"&nbsp; (4 Mertens, Law&nbsp; of Federal Income Taxation, Sec. 25.50,&nbsp; p. 410). The condition precedents to the&nbsp; deduction of bonuses to&nbsp; employees are: (1)&nbsp; the payment of the bonuses is in fact compensation; (2)&nbsp; it must be for personal services actually rendered; and (3) the bonuses, when added to&nbsp; the salaries, are "reasonable&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; when measured by the amount and quality&nbsp; of the services performed with&nbsp; relation&nbsp; to the business of the particular taxpayer" (Idem, Sec.&nbsp; 25.44, p. 395).&nbsp; Here it&nbsp; is&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that the&nbsp; bonuses&nbsp; are&nbsp; in fact compensation&nbsp; and&nbsp; were paid for&nbsp; services&nbsp; actually rendered.&nbsp; The only question is whether the payment of said bonuses is <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonable</span>.<br><br>There is no&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; test for&nbsp; determining&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">reasonableness </span>of&nbsp; a&nbsp; given&nbsp; bonus as compensation.&nbsp; This depends upon many factors, one of them being "the amount and&nbsp; quality of the&nbsp; services performed with relation&nbsp; to the business."&nbsp; Other&nbsp; tests suggested are: payment must be "made in good faith"; "the character of the taxpayer's business,&nbsp; the volume&nbsp; and amount of its net earnings, its locality, the type and extent of the services rendered, the&nbsp; salary policy of the&nbsp; corporation";&nbsp; "the size&nbsp; of the particular&nbsp; business";&nbsp; "the employees' qualifications and contributions to the business venture"; and 'general economic&nbsp; conditions"&nbsp; (4 Mertens,&nbsp; Law of Federal&nbsp; Income Taxation, Sec.&nbsp; 25.44,&nbsp; 25.49, 25.50, 25.51,&nbsp; pp. 407-412). However, "in determining&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; particular salary or compensation payment is reasonable, the situation must be considered as a whole.&nbsp; Ordinarily, no single factor is decisive.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * it is important to keep in mind that it seldom happens that the application of one test can give satisfactory answer, and that ordinarily it is the interplay of several factors, properly weighted for the particular case, which must furnish the final answer" (Idem.).<br><br>Considering the different tests&nbsp; formulated above,&nbsp; was the trial court justified in holding that the reasonableness of the amount of bonuses given to resident officers and employees should follow the same pattern for determining the&nbsp; reasonableness&nbsp; of the amount&nbsp; of bonuses given to non- resident officers?<br><br>Petitioner contends that it is error to apply the same measure of&nbsp; reasonableness to both resident and non-resident officers because the nature, extent and quality of the services performed&nbsp; by each with&nbsp; relation to&nbsp; the business of the corporation&nbsp; widely differ, as can be plainly seen by&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; factors already&nbsp; mentioned above, to wit, the character,&nbsp; size and volume of the business of the taxpayer, the profits made, the volume and amount of its earnings, the salary policy of the taxpayer, the amount and quality of the&nbsp; services performed,&nbsp; the employee's qualifications&nbsp; and contributions&nbsp; to&nbsp; the business&nbsp; venture, and the general economic conditions prevailing in&nbsp; the place of business.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; elaborating&nbsp; on these factors in connection with&nbsp; the business of petitioner, its&nbsp; counsel made a detailed exposition of the facts and figures showing in a nutshell that&nbsp; through the efficient&nbsp; management, personal effort and&nbsp; valuable contribution rendered by the resident officers&nbsp; and employees,&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation realized huge profits during the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, which entitle them to the bonuses that were given to them for those years, especially having in&nbsp; mind, the after-liberation policy of the corporation of giving&nbsp; salaries&nbsp; at low levels because&nbsp; of the unsettled conditions&nbsp; that prevailed&nbsp; after the war and the imposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; controls&nbsp; on exports&nbsp; and imports and on the uses of foreign&nbsp; exchange without prejudice of making up later&nbsp; for&nbsp; that shortcoming&nbsp; by giving them additional compensation in the form of bonuses if the financial situation of the&nbsp; corporation would warrant. As the&nbsp; General Manager&nbsp; Jung&nbsp; testified,&nbsp; the payments of bonuses were strictly based&nbsp; on the amount of work performed, the nature of responsibility, the years of service, and&nbsp; the cost of living.<br><br>While it&nbsp; may be&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that the resident officers and&nbsp; employees had performed their duty well and rendered&nbsp; efficient&nbsp; service and for&nbsp; that&nbsp; reason&nbsp; were&nbsp; given greater compensation than the non-resident officers, it does not necessarily follow that they should be given greater amount of additional compensation&nbsp; in the form&nbsp; of&nbsp; bonuses than what was given to&nbsp; the non-resident officers. The&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; this is&nbsp; that, in the opinion of the management itself of the corporation, said non-resident officers had rendered the same amount of efficient personal service and contribution to deserve equal&nbsp; treatment in compensation&nbsp; and other emoluments with the particularity that their liberation&nbsp; yearly&nbsp; salaries had&nbsp; been much&nbsp; smaller.<br><br>Thus, according to counsel for petitioner, the following is the&nbsp; contribution made&nbsp; by&nbsp; said non- resident officers of the corporation: "A.P.&nbsp; Kuenzle&nbsp; and H.A.&nbsp; Streiff, had dedicated&nbsp; abroad, especially in New York City, New York, U.S.A. and&nbsp; Zurich, Switzerland, their full time&nbsp; and attention to the services&nbsp; of Kuenzle &amp; Streiff, Inc.;&nbsp; engaging themselves exclusively&nbsp; in the&nbsp; purchases abroad of the merchandise for the supply of the import business of the Kuenzle &amp;&nbsp; Streiff,&nbsp; Inc., taking&nbsp; care of its orders of the importation of the&nbsp; merchandise and also of their shipments to the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; making contacts and effecting transactions with the suppliers abroad,&nbsp; and directing, controlling and supervising&nbsp; the business operations and&nbsp; affairs of the company&nbsp; by directives. * * * They have been the policy-makers for the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; All&nbsp; decisions to be made by the&nbsp; company on&nbsp; important matters and&nbsp; anything and everything outside of the routinary have always been first determined by them and made only upon their&nbsp; instructions&nbsp; which had been strictly adhered to by the management&nbsp; of the Company.&nbsp;&nbsp; A. P. Kuenzle and H. A. Streiff have been the president and vice president, respectively, of the company for many years before 1950, 1951&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1952 and during these particular&nbsp; years up to the present."&nbsp; Indeed, the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; was justified in expressing the&nbsp; view&nbsp; that&nbsp; "there is&nbsp; no special reason for granting greater bonuses to such&nbsp; lower&nbsp; ranking officers&nbsp; than those&nbsp; given&nbsp; to Messrs.&nbsp; Kuenzle and&nbsp; Streiff." We&nbsp; concur in this observation.<br><br>The contention of respondent that the trial court erred also&nbsp; in allowing&nbsp; as&nbsp; deduction&nbsp; bonuses in excess of the yearly salaries&nbsp; of their respective recipients predicated upon his&nbsp; own decision that the deductible amount of said bonuses should be <span style="font-style: italic;">only equal</span>&nbsp; to&nbsp; their respective yearly salaries cannot&nbsp; also&nbsp; be&nbsp; sustained.&nbsp; This claim cannot be justified&nbsp; considering the factors we have already mentioned that&nbsp; play in the determination of the reasonableness of the bonuses&nbsp; or additional compensation that may be given to&nbsp; an officer&nbsp; or&nbsp; an employee which, if&nbsp; properly considered, warrant the payment of the bonuses in question&nbsp; to the extent allowed&nbsp; by the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is specially&nbsp; so considering the post-war policy of&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; in giving salaries at&nbsp; low levels&nbsp; because&nbsp; of the unsettled conditions resulting from war and the imposition of government controls on imports and exports and on the use of foreign exchange which resulted in the diminution of the amount&nbsp; of business and the&nbsp; consequent loss&nbsp; of profits on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; payment of bonuses&nbsp; in&nbsp; amounts a little&nbsp; more&nbsp; than&nbsp; the&nbsp; yearly salaries received considering the prevailing circumstances is in our opinion reasonable.<br><br>As regards the amount of interests disallowed, we also find&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling of the trial court justified. There is no dispute that these items accrued&nbsp; on unclaimed&nbsp; salaries and&nbsp; bonus&nbsp; participation of shareholders&nbsp; and employees.<br><br>Under the law, in order that interest may be deductible, it must&nbsp; be paid "on indebtedness" (Section 30, (b)&nbsp; (1) of&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code).&nbsp; It is therefore imperative to show that there is an existing indebtedness which may be subjected to the payment of interest. Here the items involved are unclaimed salaries and bonus participation&nbsp; which in our opinion cannot constitute indebtedness within the meaning of the law because&nbsp; while they constitute an obligation on the part of the corporation, it is not the&nbsp; latter's fault if they remained unclaimed. It is a&nbsp; well-settled&nbsp; rule&nbsp; that&nbsp; the term indebtedness is restricted to its usual import which "is the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Since the&nbsp; corporation had&nbsp; at&nbsp; all times&nbsp; sufficient funds to pay the salaries of its employees, whatever an employee may fail to collect cannot&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; an indebtedness for it is the concern of the employee to collect it in due time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The willingness of the corporation to pay interest thereon cannot be considered a justification&nbsp; to warrant deduction.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; without pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
