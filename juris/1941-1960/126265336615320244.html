				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 19, 1952, Kantong Ali was&nbsp; charged with illegal possession&nbsp; of firearms in&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace court of Dulawan, Cotabato, and&nbsp; a warrant of arrest was issued against&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once arrested, on February&nbsp; 5, 1952, the Luzon Surety&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc., filed for his provisional release, a bond in the&nbsp; amount of P2,000, which was approved by&nbsp; said&nbsp; justice of the peace court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter,&nbsp; the case was forwarded to the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Cotabato where on February 21, 1952 the corresponding information was filed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was&nbsp; set&nbsp; for&nbsp; arraignment&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; July 29, 1952&nbsp; 'but&nbsp; was&nbsp; postponed to September&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1952 and' again&nbsp; to October&nbsp; 6, 1952&nbsp; upon motion of&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for the accused.<br><br>On October&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to appear for arraignment; hence, upon petition of the Provincial Fiscal, the court ordered the confiscation of&nbsp; the bond, giving the Luzon Surety&nbsp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; 30 days within which to&nbsp; produce the body of the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; to explain why&nbsp; judgment should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; rendered against it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Luzon Surety Co., Inc. was&nbsp; duly&nbsp; notified&nbsp; of&nbsp; this order but, instead of producing the body of&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; and explaining why no&nbsp; judgment should be&nbsp; rendered for the amount&nbsp; of the bond, it filed on November 24, 1952, an ex-parte motion for the immediate issuance of the order of arrest of the accused&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that "the said accused could not be&nbsp; contacted by the&nbsp; representatives&nbsp; of&nbsp; the undersigned at his usual place of residence everytime service of notification was attempted and, according to&nbsp; reliable information received by the undersigned, said&nbsp; accused&nbsp; has been concealing himself trying to evade&nbsp; service of subpoena, thus making sufficient ground, to believe that he&nbsp; has a deliberate intent to&nbsp; jump this bail."&nbsp; On the same date, this motion was granted by the court.&nbsp; Since then,&nbsp; Luzon Surety&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.'&nbsp; did nothing to&nbsp; arrest the accused or to procure&nbsp; said arrest by&nbsp; virtue of the warrant of&nbsp; arrest on&nbsp; January 26,&nbsp; 195S, the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal of&nbsp; Cotabato filed a&nbsp; motion for final judgment on the&nbsp; bond for the reason&nbsp; that the&nbsp; 30-day period granted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of the Court of October&nbsp; 6, 1952 has long elapsed without the accused&nbsp; having been produced or&nbsp; an&nbsp; explanation given therefor. The court&nbsp; took&nbsp; no&nbsp; immediate action on&nbsp; this motion, but on March 11, 1953,&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; that said motion be&nbsp; held in&nbsp; abeyance&nbsp; until March 30, 1953 because the record, fails to show&nbsp; that&nbsp; the order of arrest has been returned to the&nbsp; court duly served,&nbsp; stating therein that if on that&nbsp; day&nbsp; the body,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; would not be produced before the court, judgment&nbsp; on&nbsp; the bond shall be rendered.<br><br>On March 27, 1953,&nbsp; the Luzon Surety.&nbsp; Co., Inc. filed a motion praying for an additional&nbsp; time to produce the body of the accused for the reason&nbsp; that "lately definite&nbsp; information has&nbsp; been&nbsp; received by the undersigned to the effect that the accused Kantong Ali&nbsp; can&nbsp; be found&nbsp; in Domalen, Zamboanga del Sur, where he is presently residing and, to&nbsp; carry out&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; arrest,&nbsp; the undersigned has dispatched Giapal&nbsp; Amba, counterbondsman of the said accused,&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; get,&nbsp; him&nbsp; and&nbsp; bring&nbsp; him here&nbsp; to Cotabato; that the undersigned, in view of the above circumstances, 1 has high hopes that the immediate&nbsp; arrest of the accused can be effected within'30 days from now, as he has also made a written request to the Philippine Constabulary, Zamboanga del Sur,&nbsp; to&nbsp; help execute the&nbsp; order of arrest." And on March SO, 195S, the Luzon&nbsp; Surety Co., Inc.&nbsp; filed an&nbsp; urgent&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; cancellation&nbsp; of the bond&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that the accused had died on the last&nbsp; week&nbsp; of January, 1953&nbsp; at&nbsp; Buburaj',&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Dimataling, Zamboanga del Sur, as shown by the affidavits&nbsp; of Cadil Salik, Chief of Folice,&nbsp; and Hadji Magunto Kablo, a Moro 1&nbsp; priest, which were made part of the motion.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal opposed this&nbsp; motion&nbsp; contending&nbsp; that&nbsp; the death of the accused on the last week of January,&nbsp; 195S, or several months&nbsp; after&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; was declared&nbsp; forfeited, is not sufficient excuse&nbsp; for his failure to appear on October 6, 1952, the day&nbsp; set&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; for&nbsp; his arraignment and neither does it constitute sufficient cause to exonerate the Luzon Surety Co., Inc.&nbsp; from its obligation on the bond. Notwithstanding&nbsp; this&nbsp; opposition,&nbsp; the lower court in&nbsp; its order dated April&nbsp; 22, 1.953 cancelled the bond in&nbsp; question and relieved the Luzon Surety Co., Inc. from any liability therefrom.&nbsp; Hence, the present appeal on the ground that the trial court erred: (1) in holding that the death of the accused exonerated the appellee from its&nbsp; obligation under the bail filed by it; (2) in declaring the appellee relieved of its obligation and in ordering the cancellations of the bond; and (3) in&nbsp; not ordering judgment&nbsp; on the bond.<br><br>It is&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; that under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of section&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 110&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of' Court, the Luzon Surety Co., Inc. should have produced the bodÂ» of the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; within&nbsp; 30&nbsp; days&nbsp; or give&nbsp; satisfactory&nbsp; explanation for&nbsp; its non-production and that failure to comply&nbsp; with this&nbsp; requirement justifies&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; on&nbsp; the bond.&nbsp; The Luzon Surety Co., Inc. failed to comply with this&nbsp; requisite of the law, hence, the lower court erred in completely exonerating&nbsp; said Luzon Surety Co., Inc. and cancelling entirely&nbsp; the bond in&nbsp; question.&nbsp; If at all, the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; contends, the&nbsp; Luzon Surety Co.,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; may be entitled only to a partial discharge. <br><br>Appellee contends, in&nbsp; turn, that it having been&nbsp; given time up to March 30, 1958, within which to&nbsp; produce the body of the accused Kantong Ali&nbsp; and that within the said&nbsp; period&nbsp; it failed to surrender the accused because of his death, the disputed order of the court is well justified and the appellee was therefore exonerated properly from&nbsp; what ever&nbsp; liability it incurred from the non-appearance of the accused on October 6,&nbsp; 1952 when the case was&nbsp; called for&nbsp; arraignment.&nbsp; Appellee further&nbsp; contends that the courts are&nbsp; supplied with&nbsp; ample discretion to extend the period of time within which&nbsp; the body of an accused&nbsp; should be&nbsp; produced in court.<br><br>After a careful examination of the conflicting&nbsp; theories of the&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; we find appellant's contention well taken.&nbsp; We&nbsp; find the appellee negligent in the performance&nbsp; of its&nbsp; duty as bondsmen of&nbsp; the accused from&nbsp; October&nbsp; 6, 1952,&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the confiscation of the&nbsp; bond, up to January 20,&nbsp; 1953 when the Fiscal&nbsp; asked for judgment&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; for,&nbsp; during that period&nbsp; of 106 days the appellee did nothing&nbsp; to produce the body&nbsp; of the accused or&nbsp; to&nbsp; explain why&nbsp; they could not produce&nbsp; it before the court.&nbsp; And&nbsp; while&nbsp; it is true that on November 4, 1952 the&nbsp; appellee secured&nbsp; from the court a warrant for the arrest of the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; it did nothing&nbsp; to make effective such warrant and neither&nbsp; did&nbsp; it try to offer any explanation&nbsp; why&nbsp; the body of the&nbsp; accused cannot be&nbsp; produced&nbsp; in court.&nbsp; Under the aforementioned Section 15&nbsp; of Rule 110, within 30 days&nbsp; from October 6, 1952, appellee should have produced the&nbsp; body of their principal or&nbsp; should hare&nbsp; given&nbsp; the. reason&nbsp; for its non-production&nbsp; and should have explained satisfactorily why the&nbsp; defendant did not&nbsp; appear&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; court when first required&nbsp; to&nbsp; do so.&nbsp; The record fails to&nbsp; show that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee complied&nbsp; with the provisions&nbsp; of law mentioned&nbsp; above,&nbsp; conseguently. it&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; justifiably exonerated from its obligations under the&nbsp; bond in question. At&nbsp; most, the appellee is entitled to a partial exoneration in view of&nbsp; the fact that the accused died the&nbsp; last week of January, 1953,&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; the death&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused, which occurred&nbsp; long after the&nbsp; expiration of the&nbsp; period of 30&nbsp; days when&nbsp; the appellee&nbsp; should have produced the body of the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; cannot constitute sufficient cause for a full discharge of its responsibility arising from a violation v of the terms and conditions of the bond.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby reversed and judgment rendered on the&nbsp; bond&nbsp; in the amount of P1,000.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A,, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Reyes J.
