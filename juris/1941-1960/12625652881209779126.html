				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners-appellants   Paulino  Cramen   and  Alfredo Erauda  were  both  temporary employees,  without civil service qualifications, in the Office of the City Veterinarian in Cebu City, the first having been appointed  on March 81,  1953, as abattoir cleaner, and the second, on December 16,  1951, as cleaner.  On July 22,  1953, without any investigation or hearing, they were summarily removed by respondent Vicente S. del Rosario,  Acting Mayor of the City  of Cebu, through the following  communication:<br><blockquote>"Considering that you are holding only  a temporary appointment, and in line with  my policy  of reorganizing the City Government, consequent upon my designation  as  Acting Mayor, and in order to insure more efficiency  in  the service,  please be advised that your services shall be termmated at the close of business hours  on July 22, 1852." </blockquote>   Paulino Cramen was replaced by  intervenor Antonio Hermosilla, and  Alfredo Erauda  by Felix  Magallanes who was also ousted and replaced by intervenor Marcelo Ibañez. After their removal, they made  demand  upon respondent Del Rosario for their reinstatement,  but it was  denied. Later on Vicente S. del Rosario was  substituted by  Jose S.  Rodriguez as City Mayor of  Cebu, so  petitioners  also made  demand  upon Mayor  Rodriguez  for their  reinstatement, but in  vain.  Hence  on February 17, 1955,  they filed in the Court of First Instance of  Cebu Civil Case No. 3904,  entitled  Mandamus with Damages,  to  secure their reinstatement,  their back salaries from the  date of their removal and to  obtain  judgment against Vicente  S.  del Rosario for the sum of P2,000 as attorney's fees and  P3,000 as moral and exemplary damages on the ground that their removal was unlawful, illegal and void.  After due trial, the  complaint  was dismissed,  hence  the  present  appeal wherein petitioners claim  that  the court erred  (1) in holding that petitioners'  summary removal was lawful; and (2) in allowing payment of salaries to  intervenors pending trial of the case on its  merit. <br><br>The question involved is mainly whether the removal of petitioners was lawful or otherwise, and whether the  action was brought in  due time  in view  of the fact that the removal took place  in July 22, 1955 and the present  action was brought  only on February 17, 1955. <br><br>There is no  dispute that the petitioners were  non-Civil Service eligibles and their appointment  as abattoir cleaners was temporary in character. The provision of law regarding temporary  emergency employees is Section 682 of the Revised Administrative  Code, which provides—<br><blockquote>"Temporary appointment without examination and certification by the  Commissioner of Civil Service or his local representative shall not be made to a competitive position in any case, except when the public interest so  require, and then only upon  the  prior authorization of the Commissioner of Civil Service;  and any temporary appointment so authorized shall continue only for such period not exceeding three months as  may be necessary  to make appointment through certification of eligibles, and in no case shall extend  beyond thirty days  from  receipt  by the chief  of  the  bureau  or  office  of  the Commissioner's certification of eligibles;  * * *"</blockquote>Under  this provision of  law, the appointment  of  the petitioners expires  every three  months,  after  which they could be replaced if the corresponding appointing authority believes it convenient.  Accordingly,  on July 22,  1953, respondent Vicente S. Del Rosario, as Acting  City  Mayor of Cebu,  could remove them  lawfully  and  replace them with  others; therefore, petitioner's removal by respondent Mayor Del Rosario  was lawful.  It follows that petitioners have no right to compel Mayor  Del Rosario or his successor, Mayor Rodriguez,  to  reinstate  them.  As  we have previously held,  temporary employees, because of the  nature of their  appointment, could be  removed  and replaced  by other non-eligibles  after the expiration  of  their appointment, or after 3  months' service, in  accordance with  the aforequoted Sec. 682 of the Revised  Administrative Code (Orais et al.  vs. Ribo,  93 Phil., 985;  49 Off. Gaz.,  5386). <br><br>Lastly, we find that petitioners filed their complaint for reinstatement on  February 17, 1955, or after a delay  of 1  year, 6 months 'and 25 days,  counted from July 22, 1958, the  date of their  removal, for which  reason they may  be considered as  having  abandoned  their  office for such  a long delay in  filing  action, for— <br><blockquote>"the Government must be immediately informed or advised  if any person claims to be  entitled to  an  office or a. position in the civil service as against another  actually holding" it, so that the Government  may not  be faced with  the  predicament  of having  to pay two salaries,  for the person actually holding  the office, although illegally, and another, for one not actually rendering service although entitled to do so. We  hold that in  view of the policy  of the State contained in the law fixing the period of  one year within which actions for  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> may be  instituted, any  person claiming right to a position in the civil service  should also be required to file his petition for reinstatement within  the period of one year, otherwise he is  thereby considered as having abandoned his office.<br><br>One  other point, merely procedural,  needs to be considered. This is  the  fact that the  objection as to the  delay in filing the  action is raised for the  first time in this Court, not  having  been  raised in the court below.  The  above  circumstance  (belated objection) would bar the consideration if it  were a  defense merely.  However, we consider it to be essential to tlie petitioner's right of action that the same is filed within a year from the illegal removal. The delay is not merely a defense which may be interposed against it subject to waiver.  It is essential to petitioner's cause of  action and may be considered even at this stage of the action. <br><br><bloclquote>'We would go further by holding that the period fixed in the rule is a condition precedent to the existence of the cause of action, with the result that, if  a complaint is not filed within one year, it cannot prosper although the matter is not set up in the answer or motion to dismiss.' (Abeto vs. Rodas, 46 Off. Gaz. [3], 930, 932.)"   (Unabia <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. City Mayor, et al., 99 PHI.,  258).</bloclquote></blockquote>As to  the second assignment of error, we deem unnecessary to decide it in view of the foregoing conclusion to the effect that the herein petitioners are  not  entitled to  reinstatement, and consequently to any  back salaries. Finding no errors  in the  decision appealed  from, the same is hereby affirmed with  costs  against the appellants.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
