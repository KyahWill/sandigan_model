				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Section 1 of Republic Act No. 267 provides:
<blockquote>
<p>"Cities and municipalities are authorized to contract loans from the 
Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Philippine National Bank, and/or any 
other entity or person at a rate of interest not exceeding eight per cent per 
annum for the purpose of purchasing or expropriating homesites within their 
respective territorial jurisdiction and reselling them at cost to residents of 
the said cities and municipalities."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court below ruled that this provision empowers cities to purchase but not 
to expropriate lands for the purpose of subdivision and resale, and so dismissed 
the present action, which seeks to condemn, for the purpose just stated, several 
parcels of land having a combined area of 7270 square meters and situated on 
Legarda Street, City of Manila.<br><br>In the cases of Guide <em>vs</em>. Rural 
Progress Administration, (G.R. No. L-2089),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Commonwealth of the Philippines 
<em>vs</em>. Borja, (G. R. No. L-1496),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
we discussed at great length the extent of the Philippine Government's power to 
condemn private property for resale. Among other things, we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has been truly said that the assertion of the right on the part of the 
legislature to take the property of one citizen and transfer it to another, even 
for a full compensation, when the public interest is not promoted thereby, is 
claiming a despotic power, and one inconsistent with every just principle and 
fundamental maxim of a free government. (29 G.J.S. 820.)</p>
<p>"In a broad sense, expropriation of large estates, trusts in perpetuity, and 
land that embraces a whole town, or a large section of a town or city, bears 
direct relation, to the public welfare. The size of the land expropriated, the 
large number of people benefited, and the extent of social and economic reform 
secured by the condemnation, clothes the expropriation with public interest and. 
public use. The expropriation in such cases tends to abolish economic slavery, 
feudalistic practices, endless conflicts between landlords and tenants, and 
other evils inimical to community prosperity and contentment and public peace 
and order. Although courts are not in agreement as to the tests to be applied in 
determining whether the use is public or not, some go so far in the direction of 
a liberal construction as to hold that public use is synonymous with public 
benefit, public utility, or public advantage, and to authorize the exercise of 
the power of eminent domain to promote such public benefit, etc., especially 
where the interests involved are of considerable magnitude. (29 C.J.S. 823, 82; 
<em>see also</em> People of Puerto Rico <em>vs</em>. Eastern Sugar Associates et 
al, 156 Fed. [2d] 316.) In some instances, slumsites have been, acquired by 
condemnation. The highest court of New York State has ruled that slum clearance 
and erection of houses for low-income families were public purposes for which 
New York City Housing authorities could exercise the power of condemnation. And 
this decision was followed by similar ones in other states. The underlying 
reasons for these decisions are that the destruction of congested areas and 
insanitary dwellings diminishes the potentialities of epidemics; crime and 
waste, prevents the spread of crime and diseases to unaffected areas, enhances 
the physical and moral value of the surrounding communities, and promotes the 
safety and welfare of the public in general. (Murray fit al. <em>vs</em>. La 
Guardia, 52 N.E. [2d] 884; General Development Coop. <em>vs</em>. City of 
Detroit, 33 N.W. [2d] 919; Weizner <em>vs</em>. Stichman, 64 N. Y. S. [2d] 50.) 
But it will be noted that in all these "cases and others of similar nature 
extensive areas were involved and numerous people and the general public 
benefited by the action taken.</p>
<p>"The condemnation of a small property in behalf of 10, 20 or 50 persons and 
their families does not inure to the benefit of the public to a degree 
sufficient to give the use public character. The expropriation proceedings at 
bar have been instituted for the economic relief of a few families devoid of any 
consideration of public health, public peace and order, or other public 
advantage. What is proposed to be done is to take plaintiff's property, which 
for all we know she acquired by sweat and sacrifice for her and her family's 
security, and sell it at cost to a few lessees who refuse to pay the stipulated 
rent or leave the premises.</p>
<p>"No fixed line of demarcation between what taking is for public use and what 
is not can be made; each case has to be judged according to its peculiar 
circumstances. It suffices to say for the purpose of this decision that the case 
under consideration is far wanting in those elements which make? for public 
convenience or public use. It is patterned upon an ideology far removed from 
that consecrated in our system of government and embraced by the majority of the 
citizens of this country. If upheld, this case would open the gates to .more 
oppressive expropriations. If this expropriation be constitutional, we see no 
reason why a 10-, 15-, or 25-hectare farm land might not be expropriated and 
subdivided, and sold to those who want to own a portion of it. To make the 
analogy closer, we find no reason why the Rural Progress Administration could 
not take by condemnation an urban lot containing an area of 1,000 or 2,000 
square meters for subdivision into tiny lots for resale to its occupants or 
those who want to build thereon.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are inclined to believe that Act No. 267 empowers cities to expropriate as 
well as to purchase lands for homesites. The word "expropriating", taken singly 
or the text, is susceptible of only one meaning. But this power to expropriate 
is necessarily subject to the limitations and conditions noted in the decisions 
above cited. The National Government nay not confer upon its instrumentalities 
authority which it itself may not exercise. A stream can not run higher than its 
source.</p>
<p>Viewed from another angle, the case at bar is we alter for the condemnor. In 
the first place, the land that is the subject of the present expropriation is 
only one-third of the land sought to be taken in the Guido case, and about 
two-thirds of that involved in the Borja condemnation proceeding. In the second 
place, the Arellano Colleges' land is situated in a highly commercial section of 
the city and is occupied by persons who are not <em>bona fide</em>, tenants. 
Lastly, this land was bought by the defendant for a university site to take the 
place of rented buildings that are unsuitable for schools of higher 
learning.</p>
<p>To authorize the condemnation of any particular land by a grantee of the 
power of eminent domain, a necessity must exist for the taking thereof for the 
proposed uses and purposes. (29 C. J. S. 884-885.) In City of Manila 
<em>vs</em>. Manila Chinese Community, (40 Phil., 349), this court, citing 
American decisions, laid down this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is a genuine 
necessity, and that necessity must be of a public character. The ascertainment 
of the necessity must precede or accompany, and not follow, the taking of the 
land. (Morrison <em>vs</em>. Indianapolis, etc. Ry. Co., 166 Ind., 511; Stearns 
<em>vs</em>. Barre, 73 Vt., 281; Wheeling, etc. R. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. Toledo, 
Ry. etc. Co., 72 Ohio St., 368.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>And this passage in Blackstone's Commentaries on the English Law is cited in 
that decisions "80 great is the regard of the law for private property that it 
will not authorize the least violation of it, even for the public good, unless 
there exists a very great necessity thereof."</p>
<p>Perhaps modern decisions are not so exigent. Necessity within the rule that 
the particular property to be expropriated must be necessary, does not mean an. 
absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, such as would combine the 
greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the 
condemning party and property owner consistent with such benefit, (29 C. T. S. 
386.) But. measured even by this standard, and forgetting for a moment the 
private character of the intended use, necessity for the condemnation has not 
been shown. The land in question has cost, the owner P140,000. The people for 
whose benefit the condemnation is being undertaken are so poor they could ill 
afford to meet this high price, unless they intend to borrow the money with a 
view to disposing of the property later for a profit. Cheaper lands not 
dedicated to a purpose so worthy as a school and more suited to the occupants' 
needs and means, if really they only want to own their own homes, are aplenty 
elsewhere. On the other hand, the defendant not only has invested a considerable 
amount for its property but had the plans for construction ready and would have 
completed the project a long time ago had it not been stopped by the city 
authorities. And again, while a handful of people stand to profit by the 
expropriation, the development of a university that has a present enrollment of 
9j000 students would be sacrificed. Any good that would accrue to the public 
from providing homes to a few families fades into insignificance in comparison 
with the preparation of young men and young women for useful citizenship and for 
service to the government and the community, a task which the government alone 
is not in a position to undertake. As the Rural Progress Administration, the 
national agency created by the Government to purchase or expropriate lands for 
resale as homesites, and to which the petition to purchase the land in question 
on behalf of the occupants was referred by the President, turned down the 
occupants' request after proper investigation, commenting that "the necessity of 
the Arellano Law College to acquire a permanent site of its own is imperative 
not only because denial of the same would hamper the objectives of that 
educational institution, but it would likewise be taking a property intended 
already for public benefit." The Mayor of the City of Manila himself confessed 
that he believes the plaintiff is entitled to keep this land.</p>
<p>The order of the Court of First Instance of Manila is affirmed without 
costs.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,
