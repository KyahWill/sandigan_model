				<H3>NICOLAS ADANTE, PETITIONER, VS. CANDIDO DAGPIN, RESPONDENT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 28, 1951, respondent Candido Dagpin was appointed by former 
President Elpidio Quirino Mayor of the newly created municipality of New Piñan, 
Zamboanga del Norte. He duly qualified, assumed office, and performed the 
functions thereof until July 23, 1953, when President Quirino, without apparent 
legal reason, removed him from office and appointed petitioner Nicolas Adante in 
his stead. Wherefore, respondent Dagpin filed a <em>quo warranto</em> proceeding 
in this Court (G. R. No. L-6995) questioning the legality of Adante's 
appointment. During the pendency of the proceedings, President Ramon Magsaysay 
came into office and appointed respondent Candido Dagpin Municipal Mayor of New 
Piñan, Zamboanga del Norte, vice petitioner Nicolas Adante. Having thus been 
returned to his former post, respondent moved in this Court for the dismissal of 
the <em>quo warranto</em> case filed by him against petitioner Adante upon the 
ground that the issues therein raised had become academic. Shortly after the 
dismissal of the case, however, the ousted Mayor Adante in turn filed petition 
for <em>quo warranto</em> in this Court against respondent Candido Dagpin, 
President Magsaysay's appointee.
<p>While it is true that under the doctrine laid down by this Court in the cases 
of Cometa <em>vs</em>. Andanar, 50 Off. Gaz., (8) 3594, and Ocupe <em>vs</em>. 
Martinez, L-7591, dated August 16, 1954, an appointive mayor is entitled to hold 
office until his successor is chosen in the next general election, unless 
earlier removed for cause, this doctrine can not be invoked in support of the 
present petition, for it clearly appears on record that petitioner himself has 
no legal right or title to the position of Mayor of New Piñan, Zamboanga del 
Norte. It appears that petitioner's appointment in 1953 caused the ouster of 
respondent Dagpin, the then incumbent, without just cause; hence, his 
(petitioner's) own appointment as Mayor was illegal and void. A private person 
who claims to have been deprived of a public office in a complaint for <em>quo 
warranto</em> must prove that he is entitled and has the right to the position 
which he alleges the respondent usurped or unlawfully holds; and when it does 
not appear that petitioner has a valid right or title to the public position 
allegedly usurped or unlawfully held by the respondent, he has no cause of 
action and his petition must be dismissed (Acosta <em>vs</em>. Flor, 5 Phil., 
18, 22-23; also Lomuntad <em>vs</em>. Cuenco, 41 Off. Gaz., 894).</p>
<p>It appearing that petitioner Nicolas Adante has no valid title in himself to 
the position of Mayor of New Pinan, Zamboanga del Norte, his petition for 
<em>quo warranto</em> must be, as it is hereby, dismissed. Costs against 
petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista 
Angelo</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition dismissed. </em></p></div>
