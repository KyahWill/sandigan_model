<p align="justify">"Nota:—Aqui no esta incluido un prestamo hecho a Don Vicente 
Singson Encarnacion el 19 de Sept. de 1944 y que caduca en la misma fecha en el 
año 1946 del que es solidaria y mancommunadamente fiador Don Benigno del Rio, 
prestamo que tiene que reconocer Don Carlos Palanca."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The action is base don article 1894 of the Civil code which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Cuando, sin conocimiento del obligado a prestar alimentos, los 
diese un extraño, este tendra derecho a reclamarlos de aquel, a no constar que 
los dio por oficio de piedad y sin animo de reciamarlos."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Analyzing the foregoing provision, this Court observed in 
Ramirez vs. Redfern, 49 Phil., 849. 889, that "For one to recover under the 
provisions of article 1894 of the Civil Code, it must be alleged and proved, 
first, that support has been furnished a dependent of ne bound to give support 
but who fails to do so, second, that the support was supplied by a stranger; and 
third, that the support was given without the knowledge of the person charged 
with the duty."</p>
<p align="justify">With reference to the first requisite, the record reveals that 
in a case for support intituted by Maria Dolores Cuartero in behalf of her 
children against the defendant, the Court of First Instance of Manila handed 
down a decision on September 22, 1943, approving an agreement by the parties 
whereby the defendant promised to pay the mother of the minors P1,500 a month 
for their maintenance. It also appears that before that date—on May 9, 1942—the 
parties had signed a <i>carta-convenio</i> for the same purpose but for a lower 
rate of allowance per month. It is not denied that the defendant more than 
complied with the terms of the above decsion. Besides P1,500 a month, he sent 
the children extra case and foodstuffs, shoes and clothings.</p>
<p align="justify">And the plaintiff admittedly was aware of the foregoing 
arrangement. What he says is that P1,500 a month was utterly insufficient. The 
remedy in that case was to ask the court ot inrease the allowance. It may be 
said in this connection that if the value of the prevailing Japanese currency 
had deteriorated, the court, in our opinion, retained the jurisdiction to 
increase or dimish the allowance as the circumstances might justify. However, as 
a matter of fact, P1,500 a month was deemed by the court as late as August 8, 
1944, to be adequate. In denying a motion of the children's mother to raise the 
allowance, teh court stated that P1,500 was sufficient to pull the children 
through those critical days in comparative comfort.</p>
<p align="justify">The third requirement of the law is also lacking. The plaintiff 
made the alleged advances not only with the knowledge but apparently against the 
wishes of the defendant. In Exhibit F, a memorandum dated January 1, 1943, and 
sent by the plaintiff to the defendant, Del Rio informed Palanca that up to 
December 31, 1942, he had handed Maria Dolores Cuartero P750 as a loan for the 
support and education fo teh defendant's children and requested that the amount 
be paid. It will be noted that in the same Exhibit, the plaintiff complained 
that the defendant had not answered his previous letters, "recordandole los 
prestamos que yo le hago a Doña Maria y Vd. se hace sordo."</p>
<p align="justify">In the face of this attitude of the defendant, the plaintiff 
was not justified in continuing supplying money to the mother of the children, 
unless he wanted to give it out of charity or without the expectation of 
recovering it from the defendant. His remedy is against Maria Dolores 
Cuartero.</p>
<p align="justify">This conclusion makes unnecessary a discussion of the second 
requirement. It suffices to state that the plaintiff and one fo the children 
were engaged and were married afterward.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the lower court dismissing the action is 
affirmed with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, J.:</p> I certify that the Chief Justice concurs in this decision.</div>
