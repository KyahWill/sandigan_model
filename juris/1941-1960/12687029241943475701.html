				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>On August 19, 1946, defendant and appellant filed a motion for new trial for 
the purpose of presenting the entire transcript of the testimony in the case of 
Dolores Vasquez toroyo <em>vs.</em><p> Mariano B. Arroyo, No. 9031 of the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo, or so much thereof as is pertinent, alleging that it 
is a newly discovered evidence on the existence of which appellant was notsware 
prior to the trial in the lower court, and that said evidence contradicts 
plaintiff and appellee's claim for salaries from May, 1911, to May, 1945, in the 
amount of P241,600, and which is of such a character as probably will change the 
result. Plaintiff-appellee opposed the motion.</p>
<p>Section 2 of Rule 55 indicates the procedure that may be followed in 
disposing of the motion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 2. <em>Hearing and Order.</em>â€” The motion, with the evidence, shall be 
heard with the record on appeal. The Court of Appeals shall consider the new 
evidence together with that adduced on the trial below, and may grant or refuse 
a new trial, or may make such order, with notice to both parties, as to taking 
further testimony, either orally in court, or by depositions, or render such 
other Judgment as ought, in view of the whole case, to be rendered, to be 
rendered, upon stich terms as it may deem just."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon deliberation on the allegations and arguments of both parties, and on 
the nature of the new evidence that defendant-appellant proposes to present, the 
Court arrived at the conclusion that, to better serve the interest of justice 
without any unnecessary delay, the defendant-appellant be granted the 
opportunity to present said evidence, so the same may be taken into 
consideration when this appeal is submitted for our decision, without the 
necessity of setting aside in the meantime the appealed decision.</p>
<p>It is resolved to order the lower court to set this oase for hearing as soon 
as practicable in order that defendant and appellant may present the transcript 
of the testimony in Civil Case No. 9031 of the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo, entitled Dolores Vasquez Arroyo <em>vs.</em> Mariano B. Arroyo, or so 
much thereof as is pertinent to this case, with the right of plaintiff-appellee 
to present such rebuttal evidence is pertinent, and as soon as possible to 
transmit said evidence to this Gourt, The time within which appellant must 
submit his brief is suspended pending receipt by this Court of said 
evidence.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla, </em>and 
<em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I vote to consider the motion for a new trial when the case is decided on the 
merits.</p>
