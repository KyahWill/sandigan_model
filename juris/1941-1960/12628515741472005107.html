				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In an information&nbsp; filed in&nbsp; 1952 by the provincial fiscal of Iloilo in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of that province, 94 persons were accused&nbsp; of "the crime of rebellion with multiple murder,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; kidnapping, rape, robbery and physical injuries."&nbsp; Only some of the accused&nbsp; were tried, the great majority&nbsp; being still at large.&nbsp; Of those tried some&nbsp; were acquitted and&nbsp; some convicted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among those convicted were Fernandito Togonon&nbsp; <i>alias</i> Andres Aldeguer and Coronacion Chiva&nbsp; <i>alias</i> Walingwaling.<br><br>Togonon was found&nbsp; by the trial&nbsp; judge&nbsp; to&nbsp; have joined the Huks—a group of persons who have risen publicly and taken&nbsp; arms against the Government for the purpose of removing&nbsp; from the allegiance to said Government the territory of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands—and to&nbsp; have participated in their activities in furtherance of that end, especially in the killing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Dolinog brothers—Juan&nbsp; and Abundio—who, for&nbsp; having&nbsp; denounced the&nbsp; Huks to&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary, were beheaded by Togonon while they&nbsp; had&nbsp; their hands bound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion that&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of rebellion cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; complexed with murder, the&nbsp; trial judge pronounced Togonon guilty of two separate&nbsp; offenses,&nbsp; namely, simple&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; and double murder, imposing&nbsp; upon him, for the crime of rebellion alone, the penalty&nbsp; of&nbsp; 6 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i>,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; for the crime of double murder,&nbsp; an indeterminate penalty of&nbsp; 12 years and 1 day of <i>prision, mayor</i> to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of <i>reclusidn temporal</i>, plus indemnity&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of each&nbsp; of the deceased.<br><br>Coronacion Chiva,&nbsp; on her part,&nbsp; was found&nbsp; guilty only of simple&nbsp; rebellion—in&nbsp; consonance, obviously,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the manifestation which,&nbsp; as stated in the decision of the Court below, the provincial fiscal made before the commencement of the trial to the effect that he&nbsp; was accusing the defendants,&nbsp; except&nbsp; Togonon, of having&nbsp; committed&nbsp; that crime only— and for that crime she was sentenced to a penalty of 6&nbsp; years and 1 day of <i>prision&nbsp; mayor</i>. <br><br>Both Togonon&nbsp; and Chiva appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals; but that&nbsp; court has certified the case to us, stating that&nbsp; Togonon's appeal raises&nbsp; a question of&nbsp; jurisdiction and&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; appellant would&nbsp; have&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; sentenced to life imprisonment&nbsp; or death should it be held that the crime of rebellion&nbsp; could be&nbsp; complexed with murder, while the case against&nbsp; the other appellant Chiva&nbsp; "arose&nbsp; out of the same occurrence or&nbsp; occasion as that giving&nbsp; rise to the more serious&nbsp; offense."<br><br>As to the&nbsp; appeal of Togonon,&nbsp; the brief filed on his be- half states that he&nbsp; is not&nbsp; appealing&nbsp; from&nbsp; Ms conviction for rebellion&nbsp; but only from that part of the sentence which<br><br>further declares him guilty of murder.&nbsp; That manifestation dispenses&nbsp; with the necessity of&nbsp; our&nbsp; going into the evidence on rebellion and gives finality to appellant's conviction&nbsp; for&nbsp; that crime.<br><br>Anent the conviction for murder, the Government presented proof to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that some time in&nbsp; April, 1950, Togonon,&nbsp; with&nbsp; other Huks, held a meeting in&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of Eleno&nbsp; Dolinog&nbsp; in the&nbsp; barrio of&nbsp; Oyung, municipality of Libacao, Capiz province, and&nbsp; asked the people there for foodstuff, such as rice, chickens and pigs,&nbsp; at the same time warning them,&nbsp; on pain of having their&nbsp; heads cut off, not to&nbsp; report the&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; Huks&nbsp; in&nbsp; those&nbsp; parts to the constabulary; that disregarding the warning,&nbsp; Eleno Dolinog's two&nbsp; sons—Juan&nbsp; and Abundio—denounced&nbsp; the Huks to the local constabulary detachment, with the result that&nbsp; the Huks&nbsp; were&nbsp; ambushed&nbsp; by the constabulary soldiers; that in retaliation for what the Dolinog brothers had&nbsp; done, a group of Huks led by Togonon&nbsp; returned to the barrio&nbsp; and apprehended&nbsp; them&nbsp; and then&nbsp; with their hands&nbsp; bound,&nbsp; Togonon cut off their heads;&nbsp; that thereafter, Togonon and&nbsp; his&nbsp; companions took everything they could use from&nbsp; Dolinog's house.<br><br>Denying the&nbsp; imputation&nbsp; of murder, Togonon disclaimed any part in the killing of the Dolinog brothers.&nbsp; And based on his protestation of innocence and&nbsp; on the further claim that the&nbsp; killing was&nbsp; already&nbsp; absorbed in the crime of rebellion as something done in furtherance thereof,&nbsp; and that, in any event, the said killing was perpetrated outside the territorial jurisdiction of the&nbsp; trial court,&nbsp; the defense now contends that the; conviction for murder&nbsp; should be annulled.<br><br>After&nbsp; going&nbsp; over the record we&nbsp; find that&nbsp; Togonon's conviction for murder cannot stand.&nbsp; While there appears to be clear&nbsp; proof that it. was this accused&nbsp; who beheaded the Dolinog brothers,&nbsp; there is no denying the fact that the act was perpetrated in furtherance of the&nbsp; rebellion and outside the territorial&nbsp; jurisdiction of the trial court.<br><br>That court, therefore,&nbsp; had no authority to convict him of murder as a separate crime.<br><br>The&nbsp; Solicitor General,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; recommends that&nbsp; Togonon should be convicted of the complex crime of&nbsp; rebellion with robbery&nbsp; and&nbsp; double murder.&nbsp; To&nbsp; this we cannot&nbsp; agree.&nbsp; In&nbsp; line&nbsp; with&nbsp; our&nbsp; resolution in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of People&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Hernandez,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; (99 Phil., 515; 52&nbsp; Off. Gaz., [10] 4612) we&nbsp; have in the case of&nbsp; People vs. Geronimo, et al, (100 Phil.,&nbsp; 90;&nbsp; 53&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 68) made the following&nbsp; pronouncement:<br><blockquote>" * * *&nbsp; As in treason where both intent&nbsp; and overt act are necessary, the crime of rebellion is integrated by the coexistence of both the armed uprising- for&nbsp; the purposes&nbsp; expressed in Art.&nbsp; 123&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, <i>and</i> the overt acts of violence described in the first paragraph of Art. 135.&nbsp; That <i>both</i> purpose and overt acts are essential components of one crime, and that without either of them the crime of&nbsp; rebellion legally does not exist, is&nbsp; shown by the absence of any penalty attached to Art. 134.&nbsp; It follows, therefore, that any or all of the acts described in Art. .135, when comitted as a&nbsp; 'means to or in <i>furtherance of</i> the subversive ends described in Art. 134, become absorbed in the crime of rebellion,&nbsp; and cannot be regarded or penalized as distinct crimes in themselves. In&nbsp; law they are part&nbsp; and parcel of the&nbsp; rebellion itself, and&nbsp; cannot be considered as giving&nbsp; rise to&nbsp; a&nbsp; separate&nbsp; crime&nbsp; that, under&nbsp; Art.&nbsp; 48&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Code,&nbsp; would&nbsp; constitute a complex one with that of&nbsp; rebellion." </blockquote>Consistently with&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; pronouncement,&nbsp; the&nbsp; recommendation&nbsp; to convict Togonon of rebellion with robbery and&nbsp; double murder must be&nbsp; rejected,&nbsp; as must also the view&nbsp; taken by&nbsp; the trial court that&nbsp; this appellant&nbsp; could, in addition to his conviction for&nbsp; rebellion, be furthermore declared guilty&nbsp; of murder despite the fact that the latter offense was proved&nbsp; to have been committed in furtherance of the&nbsp; former,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; further circumstance&nbsp; that the court below had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to try him of that separate offense&nbsp; because&nbsp; the same&nbsp; was committed outside its territorial&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should here&nbsp; be recorded, however, that the&nbsp; dissenting justices&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cases of&nbsp; Hernandez and Geronimo see no reason for&nbsp; altering their opinion on the question of whether or not the crime of rebellion may be&nbsp; complex&nbsp; with&nbsp; murder&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; crimes and that they sign the present decision in so far as it is&nbsp; not&nbsp; inconsistent with the view expressed by them in&nbsp; those cases.<br><br>As to the&nbsp; case against Coronacion Chiva,&nbsp; it is established&nbsp; by the testimony of the witnesses&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Galilea,&nbsp; Alfonso&nbsp; Hernaez, Igmedio&nbsp; Digdigan and Crispulo Fabillon,&nbsp; four surrendered&nbsp; Huks&nbsp; who testified&nbsp; for the prosecution,&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; appellant was with&nbsp; them&nbsp; in the mountains of Lambunao,&nbsp; Iloilo in 1950; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; became an officer of&nbsp; the Section&nbsp; Organization&nbsp; Committee&nbsp; (SOC) of the Huk organization&nbsp; in that&nbsp; region and that as such she collected&nbsp; supplies from the barrio people for the support of the Huks; that she later became chairman of the Huk medical corps and in that&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; devoted&nbsp; herself to the cure of wounded Huk soldiers;&nbsp; that she later became treasurer;&nbsp; that&nbsp; she became&nbsp; the common-law wife of her co-appelant Fernandito Togonon and that she used to go&nbsp; around armed with a&nbsp; revolver&nbsp; given her for her personal protection; but&nbsp; that she did&nbsp; not participate in the raids conducted by the Huks.<br><br>The testimony of the said&nbsp; witnesses is&nbsp; objected to&nbsp; on the grounds&nbsp; that&nbsp; as&nbsp; declarations of co-conspirators it is not admissible against&nbsp; her as proof that&nbsp; she&nbsp; was in the conspiracy without that conspiracy being first&nbsp; established by other evidence.&nbsp; In&nbsp; support of this objection,&nbsp; counsel cites section&nbsp; 12&nbsp; of Rule 123, which&nbsp; says that&nbsp; "the act or declaration of a conspirator relating to&nbsp; the conspiracy and during&nbsp; its existence, may be given in evidence&nbsp; against the co-conspirator after the&nbsp; conspiracy is shown&nbsp; by evidence other than&nbsp; such act&nbsp; or declaration."&nbsp; But&nbsp; the objection is without merit,&nbsp; because, as already held&nbsp; by this Court, the section refers to an&nbsp; extrajudicial&nbsp; declaration of a co-conspirator—not to his testimony by "way of direct evidence (Gardiner vs.&nbsp; Magsalin, et al., 73 Phil. 114).<br><br>Testifying&nbsp; in her&nbsp; own behalf, this&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; claimed that she was not herself a Huk;&nbsp; that what happened was that in&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; she was kidnapped&nbsp; from her&nbsp; barrio and brought to the mountains by Alfonso Hernaez <i>alias</i> Atila and&nbsp; then&nbsp; delivered to&nbsp; Huk&nbsp; Commander Nery Oti;&nbsp; that thereafter she lived maritally without benefit of marriage with her co-appellant Togonon; that being already under his power she came to love him by force of circumstances; that&nbsp; she could not return to her barrio because she was under&nbsp; constant surveillance;&nbsp; that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; constabulary forces&nbsp; were conducting continued&nbsp; raids&nbsp; against the Huks and she was considered as one of these although in reality she was not,&nbsp; she&nbsp; decided&nbsp; to give herself&nbsp; up and&nbsp; so&nbsp; in April, 1952 she surrendered together with her companions Deogracias Casipe and Francisco Castigador, she giving up her revolver and they their carbines.<br><br>It&nbsp; may well be true that this appellant, as&nbsp; she herself has testified and as the trial court has found, had&nbsp; been kidnapped by&nbsp; the Huks from her barrio and taken to the mountains.&nbsp; But even then, the evidence leaves&nbsp; no room for doubt that she thereafter became a real&nbsp; Huk by&nbsp; joining the Huk organization which had taken up arms against the Government for the purpose of overthrowing it, held important offices therein and took active part in some of its activities, such as the gathering or&nbsp; commandeering of supplies for the maintenance of the organization&nbsp; and the holding of meetings in different barrios for the&nbsp; purpose of winning the country people to the Huk cause.&nbsp; This is sufficient to make&nbsp; her&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering, however, that, as&nbsp; testified to by&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the government witnesses, she did not&nbsp; take part&nbsp; in the raids conducted by her fellow-Huks, and taking also into account the circumstances under&nbsp; which she became&nbsp; identified with the Huks, we are inclined to yield to counsel's&nbsp; plea that she is entitled to the&nbsp; mitigating circumstance mentioned&nbsp; in paragraph 13&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code in that she&nbsp; "had no intention to commit&nbsp; so grave a wrong as that commit- ted."&nbsp;&nbsp; This, together&nbsp; with the circumstance of voluntary surrender, which was appreciated by the lower court and amply&nbsp; supported by proof, entitles her to a penalty&nbsp; next lower in degree to that prescribed by law, which is <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>Wherefore, the judgment below, in so far as the&nbsp; appellants Fernandito&nbsp; Togonon&nbsp; and&nbsp; Coronacion Chiva&nbsp; are concerned,&nbsp; is&nbsp; modified&nbsp; as follows: Fernandito&nbsp; Togonon stands convicted only of simple rebellion and to&nbsp; suffer the corresponding penalty imposed by the lower court for that crime, that is,&nbsp; 6 years&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; day&nbsp; of <i>prision mayor</i>;&nbsp; but his conviction&nbsp; for&nbsp; double&nbsp; murder is&nbsp; annuled&nbsp; and&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp; Coronacion Chiva is&nbsp; likewise convicted&nbsp; of&nbsp; simple rebellion, and considering the presence of two mitigating circumstances, not offset by any aggravating circumstance, the penalty .imposed upon her is reduced&nbsp; to 2 years,&nbsp; 4 months and 1 day of <i>prision correctional</i> with a fine of P5,000.<br><br>Witout costs&nbsp; in this instance.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
