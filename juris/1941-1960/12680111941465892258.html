				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. SALVADOR ABAD SANTOS, RICARDO NEPOMUCENO, AND JOSE P. VELUZ, ALL ASSOCIATE JUDGES CONSTITUTING THE SECOND ARCACHE, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DE JOYA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>From the petition filed in this case, it appears that respondent Joseph 
Arcache has been accused of the crime of treason before the People's Court, in 
Criminal Case No. 729; thereof; that in counts 2 and 3 contained in the 
information, specifying the different kinds of properties alleged to have been 
sold by him to the Japanese Imperial Forces, in the City of Manila, during the 
enemy occupation, was also added the phrase "and other similar equipments"; that 
on March 8, 1946, said respondent was duly arraigned before the respondent 
judges of the People's Court, and entered a plea of not guilty, and the case was 
set for trial commencing April 8, 1946; that when the case was actually called 
or trial, on April 8, 1946, counsel for respondent Joseph Arcache verbally 
petitioned the respondent judges that the prosecution should make more specific 
said phrase "and other similar equipments" set north in counts two (2) and three 
(3) of the information or have stricken therefrom, unless the prosecution should 
furnish a bill of particulars specifying what those other similar equipments 
were; that the special prosecutor objected to said petition, on the ground that 
it was out of time, since respondent Joseph Arsache had already entered a plea 
of not guilty to the charge; that on the same date, April 8, 1946, considering 
that the allegation objected to was too broad and too indefinite to enable the 
accused to properly defend himself, the respondent judges granted the petition, 
and, at the request of the prosecution, postponed the trial of the case to April 
10, 1946, to give the special prosecutor time to prepare the bill of 
particulars, which he agreed to submit not later than April 31, 1946; that on 
the same date, April 9, 1946, instead 0f submitting a bill of particulars, the 
special prosecutor filed a motion for reconsideration of said order court, on 
the ground that it was contrary to law that the court had acted in excess of its 
jurisdiction and/or with abuse thereof, which motion for reconsideration was 
denied on April 10, 1946, on the ground that the alleged defect in the 
information could be cured by amendment, which might be properly ordered, in the 
interest of justice, so that the accused might is clearly informed of the 
charges against him, and thus avoid any possible surprise, without necessity in 
the part of the accused to plead anew to the amended information.
<p>On April 26, 1946, the respondent judges filed their answer to the petition 
for certiorari filed in this case, relying upon the reasons already stated, in 
their order dated April 10, 1946.</p>
<p>On April 30, 1946, respondent Joseph Arcache filed his answer to said 
petition, alleging that the special prosecutor was estopped to question the 
legality and validity of the two orders complained of as he had expressly agreed 
to submit the specifications or bills of particulars called for, and that it was 
precisely at the request of the special prosecutor that the trial of the case 
was postponed to April 10, 1946, to give him ample time to prepare and submit 
said bill of particulars; that the filing of specifications or bills of 
particulars may be ordered in criminal cases, in accordance with, existing law 
and American judicial precedents; that the defendant merely wanted to know 
specifically what the alleged "other similar equipments" were, without amending 
the information, in the strict sense of the term, which would require him to 
withdraw his previous plea of not guilty; and that the question whether to order 
the filing of a bill of particulars or not is purely discretionary on the part 
of the lower court.</p>
<p>As already stated by this Court long ago, there is no specific provision of 
law, in this jurisdiction, expressly authorizing the filing of specifications or 
bills of particulars in criminal cases. (United States vs. Schneer, 7 Phil. 523, 
525). But it is also true that, in a subsequent case, this Court held that a 
detailed complaint or information cannot be properly objected to, and that the 
details contained therein may be properly considered as specifications or bills 
of particulars. (United States <em>vs.</em> Cernias, 10 Phil. 682, 690). It is 
thus evident that, in the absence of specific provisions of law prohibiting the 
filing of specifications or bills of particulars in criminal cases, their 
submission may be permitted, as they cannot prejudice any substantial rights of 
the accused. On the contrary, they will serve to apprise the accused clearly of 
the charges filed against them, and thus enable them to prepare intelligently 
whatever defense or defenses they might have.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in criminal cases, any defect in the accusation other than that 
of lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter may be cured by good and 
sufficient evidence introduced by the prosecution, and admitted by the trial 
court, without any objection on the part of the defense, and the accused may be 
legally convicted of the crime or offense intended to be charged and so 
established by the evidence. (Serra <em>vs.</em> Mortiga, 11 Phil. 762; 204 TJ. 
S. 470; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Destrito et al., 23 Phil. 28, 30).</p>
<p>Of course, it is to be expected that the defense will object to any question, 
which is not based upon the allegations made in the complaint or information; 
but this does not preclude the possibility that immaterial evidence might be 
admitted, although not supported by such allegations, due to inadvertence on the 
part of the defense. And inasmuch as in criminal cases not only the liberty but 
even the life of the accused may be at stake, it is always wise and proper that 
the accused should be fully apprised of the true charges against them, and thus 
avoid all and any possible surprise, which might be detrimental to their rights 
and interests; and ambiguous phrases should not, therefore, be permitted in 
criminal complaints or informations; and if any such phrase has been included 
therein, on motion of the defense, before the commencement of the trial, the 
court should order either its elimination as surplusage or the filing of the 
necessary specification, which is but an amendment in mere matters of form.</p>
<p>Considering that the two orders complained of are legal and valid, and that 
they were issued by the respondent judges, in the exercise of sound judicial 
discretion, for the protection of the rights and interests of respondent Joseph 
Arcache, the petition for certiorari filed in this case is, therefore, hereby 
denied and dismissed, without costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result. </p>
