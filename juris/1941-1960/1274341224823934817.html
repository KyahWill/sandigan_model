				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners pray that the Court of First Instance of Iloilo be ordered to 
dismiss civil case No. 200 for lack of jurisdiction.
<p>The complaint in said case prays that defendants be ordered to return to the 
plaintiff the material possession of the parcel of public forest land described 
in the complaint and to pay plaintiff as damages P12,000, plus P4,000 for each 
year of illegal possession of the land in question. The land is located in the 
municipality of Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo; is the object of lease agreement No. 123, 
executed on February 12, 1941, between plaintiff and the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines, represented by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce; is now a 
fishpond; and is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The land covers lots Nos. 1096 and 1081 of Barotac Nuevo Cadastre, B. L. 
Case No. 4, bounded on the north by lot No. 1211, on the east by lot No. 1086, 
on the south by cultivated land, and on the west by cultivated land and lot No. 
1210; containing an area of approximately 23.60 hectares."</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 27, 1945, defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint 
upon the theory that the lower court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter 
of the case. Their theory is that the litigation properly belongs to the 
jurisdiction and competency of the Department of Agriculture and Commence, who 
had absolute and discretionary authority to decide cases of conflicting claims 
regarding the disposition of public lands for fishpond purposes.</p>
<p>After the parties were given full opportunity to argue the motion, the lower 
court denied it on January 15, 1946. On January 18, defendants filed their 
answer. On January 29, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, including Tereso 
Sason as defendant, who filed his answer on January 27. On March 11, plaintiff 
filed his reply to the answers.</p>
<p>On February 8, 1947, defendants moved for reconsideration of the order of 
January 15, 1946, insisting that the amended complaint be dismissed for lack of 
jurisdiction. The motion was denied on February 11, 1947. In his complaint, 
plaintiff alleged that since the date of the execution of the lease agreement 
entered into by him with the Commonwealth on February 12, 1941, he was in 
peaceful, continuous and open possession of the land in question, enjoying the 
exclusive use of its products, and complying with his duties and enjoying all 
rights granted him under said lease agreement; that in the month of February, 
1944, through force, intimidation, and strategy, and availing themselves of the 
aid and services of government officials, employees and soldiers, and taking 
advantage of the chaotic conditions incident to the war, defendants entered upon 
the land, claiming ownership thereto, and since February, 1944, they have been 
removing and taking all the products of the land, consisting mainly of milkfish, 
and selling the same and using the proceeds for their personal benefit; and that 
by reason of said illegal acts of defendants, plaintiff suffered damages in the 
sum of P8,000 and will suffer damages at the rate of P4,000 a year for each year 
of illegal possession.</p>
<p>The two original defendants alleged in their answer that the fishpond in 
question was formally granted in lease to Tereso Sason who, on April 24, 1936, 
mortgaged his rights to plaintiff in the form of sale with right to repurchase 
within eight years from said date; that on February 4, 1941, Sason sold for the 
sum of P6,000 his rights to repurchase to defendants who delivered to Sason the 
sum of P3,864, which Sason paid to plaintiff on February 14, 1944; that 
plaintiff has never been in the possession of the fishpond and that, in 
violation of his agreement with Sason, through false representations, obtained 
lease agreement No. 123. Sason alleged in his answer that the fishpond was 
adjudicated to him in 1927; that on February 27, 1930, he mortgaged it to 
plaintiff to guarantee a debt of P2,000, the document having been executed in 
the form of a <i>pacto de retro</i> sale; that on April 24, 1936, Sason and 
plaintiff executed another contract increasing the mortgage indebtedness to 
P3,864 payable within eight years, the document having been made also in the 
form of sale with right to repurchase; that plaintiff, taking advantage of the 
instrument, secured a fishpond permit over the area in litigation and 
subsequently converted the said permit into fishpond lease agreement No. 123; 
that on February 4, 1941, Sason sold his rights to defendant Marta Espinosa who 
took immediate possession of the fishpond, while Sason offered to pay the 
plaintiff his mortgage indebtedness of P3,864, but plaintiff refused to accept 
the same, and Marta Espinosa then assumed the payment of the yearly interest of 
P600 and had paid the same to plaintiff for three years; that on February 14, 
1944, Sason redeemed his mortgaged indebtedness by paying P3,864 to plaintiff, 
the amount having been supplied by Marta Espinosa. Sason counterclaimed from 
plaintiff P2,241, an amount in excess of the alleged usurious interest paid by 
him to plaintiff.</p>
<p>In support of their stand, petitioners invoke sections 3, 4 and 63 of Act 
4003, as amended by Commonwealth Act 471, paragraph (<i>o</i>) of section 33 of 
Administrative Order No. 14 of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and 
sections 2, 3, and 4 of Commonwealth Act 141. Apparently, petitioners are 
laboring under a misunderstanding of the provisions of law they themselves 
invoke, as nothing can be found in them to the effect of granting the Secretary 
of Agriculture and Commerce the judicial power, whether exclusive or concurrent, 
to decide the legal controversies as raised by the pleadings, of both parties, 
besides the fact that, even in the false hypothesis that such power has been 
granted by law, the grant shall not have any effect, as all judicial powers have 
been lodged by the Constitution exclusively in the Supreme Court and in such 
inferior tribunals as may have been established by law. (Section 1, Art. VIII, 
of the Constitution.) The powers granted to the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Commerce by the pertinent provisions of law invoked by petitioners are all of 
executive and administrative nature, such as granting of licenses, permits, 
leases, and contracts, or approving, rejecting, reinstating, or cancelling 
applications, or deciding conflicting applications. The controversies between 
the parties, as raised in the pleadings in case No. 200 of the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo appear to have arisen upon disagreements in civil or 
contractual relations between the litigants to which the legal provisions 
invoked by petitioner are not and cannot be applicable. It should be far-fetched 
to recognize in the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce the power of 
determining whether or not, as alleged by Paranpan, he has been deprived by 
defendants of the possession of the fishpond in question and of the legal 
effects of such alleged deprivation, or upon the nature of the two contracts of 
mortgage in the form of sale with right to repurchase between Sason and 
Paranpan, as alleged by defendants, or whether Paranpan has charged Sason with 
usurious interests. These are questions judicial in nature and only courts of 
justice can decide them.</p>

<p><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Padilla, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
