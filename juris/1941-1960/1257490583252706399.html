				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari from the decision of the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission, dated September 17, 1958, and its resolution <em>en banc</em>, dated 
December 4, 1958, awarding compensation for the death of Santos Romeo.
<p>The appeal raises issues of fact and of law, but since findings of fact by 
the Workmen's Compensation Commission are final, if supported by substantial 
evidence, (Batangas Transportation Co., <em>vs</em>. Galicano Rivera, et al., 
<em>supra</em>., p. 175; Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. <em>vs</em>. Consunto, et al., 
108 Phil., 62, and since the record shows that such evidence is not wanting, 
this Court will consider the case on the facts as found by the commission.</p>
<p>Santos Romeo was, on May 16, 1956, working for petitioner as 
<em>cargador</em> in loading and unloading copra at the former's warehouse at C. 
Padilla Street, Cebu City. In the morning of that day, after asking permission 
from his employer, Santos Romeo went to petitioner's house just across the 
street from the warehouse to get a drink of water, the water pump in the 
warehouse being out of order and no supply being available. Reaching the kitchen 
of said house and while he was drinking, he saw a puppy eating some fried nsh 
inside an open cabinet. He tried to drive away the puppy by saying 
<em>"tse,"</em> but as the puppy still continued to eat the fish, Santos made a 
motion with his hand to drive it away, in the course of which his right hand was 
bitten by said puppy. On June 26, 1958, Santos Romeo died of hydrophobia from 
the dog bite. It appears that the puppy was not owned by petitioner.</p>
<p>Appellant contends that, under the circumstances narrated, the death of the 
laborer can not be considered to arise "out of and in the course" of his 
employment.</p>
<p>We find no merit in this contention. The rule is well established that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Such acts as are reasonably necessary to the health and comfort of an 
employee while at work, such as satisfaction of his thirst, hunger, or other 
physical demands, or protecting himself from excessive cold, are nevertheless 
incidental to the employment, and injuries sustained in the performance of such 
act are generally held to be compensable as arising out of and in the course of 
the employment." (58 Am. Jur., sec. 236, p. 742, citing numerous 
cases.)</p></blockquote>
<p>That Santos Romeo was in the kitchen of appellant's house and not at his 
usual place of work does not bring the case out of the operation of the rule 
previously quoted, for the reason that the laborer was practically driven to 
that place through the appellant's fault in not providing an adequate supply of 
drinking water at the warehouse.</p>
<p>Appellant urges that the dog bite was provoked by Santos' trying to take the 
fish away from the puppy and hence, while he was engaged in an independent 
activity. We do not regard such act as a voluntary deviation from his duties, 
considering that the act of the deceased was practically an instinctive one, 
that would naturally be expected from any person in his position. Moreover, it 
was motivated by a sense of loyalty to his employer, a desire" to protect the 
latter's property, that can not be deemed wholly foreign to the duties of the 
laborer as such (71 C.J. 675). In fact, it has been held that the act of saving 
the employee's 'own property from an apparent danger, is compensable (in re 
Brightman, 107 N.E. 527, cited in 71 C. J. 670). There, it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the standard to be applied is not that which now, in the light of all that 
has happened, is seen to have been directly within the line of labor helpful to 
the master, but that which the ordinary-man required to act in such an emergency 
might do while actuated with a purpose to do his duty."</p></blockquote>
<p>Compensation has been granted, even if the injury occurred while the worker 
was not performing acts strictly within the scope of his duties, but engaged in 
an activity either related or incidental to his duties, or doing an act in the 
interest of his employer. Thus, injury to an employee of a bus firm, occurring 
outside of assigned territory, in undertaking to retrieve personal belongings of 
a passenger, was compensable (Vergoza <em>vs</em>. Arnaz Vda. de Cruz, L-7305, 
December 15, 1953); so was that of a laborer who, trying to alight from a truck 
to pick up a sack which had fallen, belonging to his employer, was caught 
between the wheels (Ramos <em>vs</em>. Poblete, 40 Off. Gaz., 3474); likewise, 
the death of a worker who tried to recover a piece of board which had fallen 
into a molasses tank, and died from the deadly fumes therein (Estandarte 
<em>vs</em>. Phil. Motor Alcohol Corp., G. R. No. 39733, Nov. 1, 1933). In the 
foregoing, an impelling factor considered by the court was the fact that the 
employee was acting in the interest of the employer.</p>
<p>To the argument that the employee sustained the injury not from drinking 
water but from driving away the puppy, suffice it to say that under the 
circumstances that impelled him to act without opportunity for deliberate 
reflection, we are not prepared to say that his act was unreasonable or 
negligent. Driving away a puppy is not so fraught with potent danger as to deter 
every man possessed of reasonable disposition. As has been said-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * he was doing a thing1 which a man while working may reasonably do-a 
workman of his sort may reasonably smoke, he may reasonably drop his pipe, and 
he may reasonably pick it up again." (Ramos <em>vs</em>. Poblete, 
<em>supra</em>,, citing M'Lauchan vs. Anderson, S.C. 529.)</p></blockquote>
<p>By analogy, the deceased in this case may reasonably get a drink of water to 
satisfy his thirst; while drinking, he may reasonably see a puppy eating some 
fried fish belonging to his employer; and he may reasonably be expected to make 
a motion with his hand to drive said puppy away.</p>
<p>At any rate, the resulting injury is not without causation in the conditions 
under which deceased was required to perform his work. It appears that there 
were no adequate and. sanitary means of water supply in the place of work; that 
petitioner's workers used, for drinking purposes, water from a well at the back 
of the warehouse; that this well was out of order at the time of the incident, 
so that the deceased had to cross a wide public street to petitioner's house 
just to get a drink, thereby exposing himself to hazards which may well have 
been avoided if there were drinking facilities at, or more proximate to, the 
place of work.</p>
<p>Finally, the Workmen's Compensation Act being a social legislation, and in 
line with the intent of the law to effect social justice, the provisions thereof 
should be liberally construed in favor of the workingman (Luzon Brokerage Co., 
Inc., <em>vs</em>. Dayao, et al., 106 Phil., 525; Madrigal Shipping Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Baens del Rosario, et al., L-13130, October 31, 1959).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision and the resolution appealed from are hereby affirmed. 
Costs against petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision and resolution affirmed.</em></p></div>
