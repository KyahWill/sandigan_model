				<H3>THE BACHRACH MOTOR CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION AND DOMINGO PANALIGAN, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Respondent Domingo Panaligan was an employee of the petitioner  Bachrach Motor  Co., Inc.   On November 23, 1953, he filed with the respondent Workmen's Compensation Commission a claim against the petitioner  for compensation for physical  disabilities resulting from an accident which took place  on July 15,  1953.   The respondent Commission immediately transmitted said claim to the petitioner which, without  controverting it  or  filing an opposition  thereto! within ten days, suggested to the respondent Commission that  a physician  from the  Philippine General Hospital, Dr.  Carlos P.  Yarabao, conduct the physical examination of respondent Panaligan  to  determine the extent of his injuries.  On March 27 and  April 19, 1954 the petitioner submitted  to  the respondent Commission its  physician's report of sickness  or accident and employer's report of accident or sickness.  On April 27,  1954  the respondent Commission sent to the petitioner a computation of the latter's liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, based on the findings of Dr. Yambao; and the petitioner was accordingly required by the  respondent Commission to pay P3,935.19, for the loss of eighty-five per cent of the: left eye of respondent Panaligan, the use of his right leg, and  temporary disability for  272 days.  The petitioner controverted said award,'contesting its liability under the Workmen's  Compensation Act, as well  as the period of temporary total disability and  the basis of compensation. The respondent Commission  called  the petitioner  to  a conference on October 29, 1954, during which the Commission explained its reasons for the  award.  Whereupon the petitioner filed  the  present proceedings for certiorari and mandamus,  to compel the respondent Commission to hold a trial for the  reception of evidence  which the petitioner may have against the claims of respondent Panaligan and allow the petitioner to cross-examine  claimant's witnesses. It is argued that  the respondent Commission made the award without  any trial and thereby acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. We disagree with petitioner's contentions.  Under section 37 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the petitioner was required, if it decided, to controvert the right to compensation of respondent Panaligan, to  file within 10 days after it had knowledge of the accident,  a notice with the Commission that compensation  was  not being  paid,  stating the reasons why it was not paid; and that failure to do so would constitute a renunciation of its right to  controvert the claim.  As in this case  the petitioner  not only did not file any opposition to the  claim  for compensation within the prescribed period, but admittedly paid respondent  Panaligan  compensation by  reason of  the  accident, the compensability  of the claim in question has been settled.</p>
<p>Neither was there  any necessity for  a formal  trial, because, at the very suggestion of the petitioner, the matter of determining the injuries sustained by respondent Panaligan, was referred to  Dr. Yambao  of the Philippine General  Hospital,  an  absolutely  disinterested referee;  and the award given by the respondent Commission in the favor of respondent Panaligan was in accordance with the joint report of the physicians  of the respondent Commission which was in turn based upon the findings of Dr. Yambao.</p>
<p>It is also argued that  the award  should  have been computed on the basic daily wage of  P4.80, without  including overtime pay and night service premium. This is likewise  untenable.  Under  section  19  of the Workmen's Compensation Act,  the average weekly wages should be computed in such manner that it shall be the best computation  that can be made of the weekly earnings  of the laborer during the  12 weeks next  preceeding his injury, and  under section 39  (<em>g</em>)  of said  Act "wages"  includes the commercial value of the board and lodging, subsistence, fuel  and  other amounts which the employee receives from the employer as part  of his compensation.  If the commercial value of  the board and lodging,  subsistence and fuel  is covered in "wages," there is more reason to include overtime pay  and night service premium  which, at any rate, may fall under "other amounts which the employee receives from the employer  as part of  his compensation." Wherefore, the petition is hereby dismissed with cost against the petitioner.</p>
