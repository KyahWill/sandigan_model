				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an&nbsp; original action of&nbsp; certiorari against Judge Jose Teodoro, Sr. of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Negros Occidental to annul two orders issued by him in the course of .the trial of&nbsp; Criminal Case No. S739, entitled People <i>vs.</i> Ruperto Angudong.&nbsp; In one order he rejected&nbsp; an attempt of the assistant provincial fiscal to identify a certified true copy of the service record&nbsp; of the defendant in the Bureau of Civil Service, one of the papers in said record&nbsp; being a certified copy of a certified true copy of a certificate issued by one Dra. Rosario Abeto.&nbsp; A witness of the&nbsp; Fiscal from the Bureau of Civil Service was&nbsp; testifying&nbsp; on and identifying the record, declaring that the original of the certificate could not be found in the files of the Bureau, when upon&nbsp; objection that the original certificate must&nbsp; be produced, the respondent judge ordered the whole testimony to be stricken out.<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; order respondent judge also blocked&nbsp; a similar attempt&nbsp; on the part of&nbsp; the Fiscal to identify&nbsp; a similar certified true copy of&nbsp; the service&nbsp; record&nbsp; of-&nbsp; the defendant in the&nbsp; Bureau of&nbsp; Health.&nbsp; Among the&nbsp; papers in the record was a certified true copy of a certificate by one Mrs.&nbsp; Florentina Decena de Torres.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both records were being&nbsp; identified as parts of public records when the court rejected the attempt to identify them,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; objection of counsel for defendant that as&nbsp; defendant in the criminal action was being accused of falsification, the original document falsified must be produced.<br><br>It is to be noted that the defendant in the criminal case is not being accused of falsifying or forging a certificate, but of using a false certificate&nbsp; under Article 175 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The pertinent parts of the information are as follows: <br><blockquote>The "undersigned&nbsp; City Attorney&nbsp; ex-officio accuses&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Roberto Angudong&nbsp; for <i>Violation of Article 175, of the Revised Penal Code,</i> committed&nbsp; as follows;<br><br>"That on or about the months of July and August, 1947, in the City&nbsp; of Bacolod, Philippines, and&nbsp; within the jurisdiction of&nbsp; this Hon. Court, the herein accused being then the temporary District Health Officer of Negros Occidental,&nbsp; with official station in the&nbsp; City of Bacolod, Philippines, fully knowing&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; not&nbsp; served as Puericulture Center&nbsp; Physician of the Puericulture Center of Himamaylan&nbsp; and Binalbagan,&nbsp; Negros Occidental, from 1932-1939, did, then&nbsp; and there, willfully, unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously&nbsp; cause to be prepared and issued a Certificate to the effect that he had served as such Puericulture Center&nbsp; Physician of Himamaylan and Binalbagan,&nbsp; Negros&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; during the said years, from 1932-1939, when in fact and in truth he did not so serve as such Puericulturu Center&nbsp; Physician of Himamaylan and&nbsp; Binalbagan,&nbsp; Negros Occidental,&nbsp; and after having received such Certificate and full&nbsp; conscious of its untruthfulness and falsity, he forthwith forwarded&nbsp; the same to the&nbsp; Commissioner of&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Service, Manila,&nbsp; in order to qualify for reinstatement and subsequent appointment as permanent District Health&nbsp; Officer&nbsp; of Negros&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; and he did&nbsp; in fact qualify and was consequently appointed&nbsp; as such permanent District Health Officer&nbsp; of Negros Occidental, on October 22,&nbsp; 1948, effective July 1, 1947, on the basis of the aforementioned false certificate."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See page 9 of the&nbsp; Record on Appeal).<br></blockquote>The false certificates used by defendant were evidently those&nbsp; documents,&nbsp; certified copies of which&nbsp; were in the official records of the Bureau of Health and the Bureau of Civil Service.&nbsp; But the offense&nbsp; charged&nbsp; is not the falsification of&nbsp; the certificates but the use thereof, by which defendant&nbsp; must have secured his appointment.<br><br>It must be noted that the Fiscal was only identifying the official records of service of the defendant preparatory to introducing them (the said records)&nbsp; as evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; That said official records can be proved by certified copies, there can be no&nbsp; question (section 41,&nbsp; Rule 123 of&nbsp; the Rules of Court).&nbsp; The time for the presentation of the records had not yet come; presentation was to be made&nbsp; after their identification.&nbsp; For what&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; and to&nbsp; what&nbsp;&nbsp; end the ¦Fiscal would&nbsp; introduce them as evidence was not yet stated or&nbsp; disclosed;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; records&nbsp; would at&nbsp; least&nbsp; prove&nbsp; that defendant's&nbsp; appointment&nbsp; as District&nbsp; Health Officer&nbsp; of Negros Occidental was&nbsp; in part occasioned by&nbsp; or related to the certificates.&nbsp; The objection of counsel for the&nbsp; defendant was, therefore,&nbsp; premature, especially as the Fiscal had not yet stated for&nbsp; what&nbsp; purpose he&nbsp; would introduce the said records,&nbsp; much&nbsp; less because he had not stated&nbsp; that he intended to&nbsp; prove the&nbsp; false certificates&nbsp; by&nbsp; said&nbsp; records. So was the ruling of the respondent judge&nbsp; sustaining the objection;&nbsp; both were premature and beside the point.&nbsp; In Employee's Welfare Assn. this connection,&nbsp; attention is invited to&nbsp; section 72&nbsp; of Rule 123&nbsp; of the Rules, which provides:<br><blockquote>"The court&nbsp; shall consider no&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; which&nbsp; has not been formally offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose for which the evidence is offerea must be specified."<br></blockquote>And the time for objecting to evidence is when the same is offered.<br><blockquote>"<i>Time of the objection.</i>—'Every&nbsp; objection to the admissibility of evidence shall be made&nbsp; at the time such evidence'is offered, or as soon thereafter as&nbsp; the&nbsp; objection to its admissibility shall have become apparent;&nbsp; otherwise,&nbsp; the objection&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; treated&nbsp; as waived.&nbsp; '* * * ."&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 ed., p. 555, citing the cases of Abrenica <i>vs. </i>Gonda, 34 Phil., 739 and Marsh&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Hand, 35 Md.&nbsp; 128)<br></blockquote>As the official&nbsp; records sought to&nbsp; be identified were not yet being&nbsp; presented, nor&nbsp; the purpose thereof&nbsp; disclosed, the objection thereto and the ruling sustaining the objection were both premature.<br><br>The writ is hereby granted, and&nbsp; the orders complained of annulled,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the respondent judge ordered to&nbsp; proceed in accordance herewith.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; against&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; Ruperto&nbsp; Angudong&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla,,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
