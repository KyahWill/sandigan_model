				G.R. No. 654, December 24, 1946</h4>
				<H3>URSU LUANGCO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE PROVINCIAL WARDEN OF LEYTE,. RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, 
which dismissed the appellant's petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> on the 
ground of pendency of another action, because in case G. R. No. Lâ€”142 (p. 473, 
ante), the petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> filed by the same appellant and 
others in the Court of First Instance of Leyte on the ground of nullity of the 
sentence of the Court of Special Criminal Jurisdiction of Leyte, on which is 
based the petition in the present case, was denied, and their appeal from the 
order denying the writ in said case G. R, No. L-142 was pending in this Court 
when the order now on appeal was rendered.</p>
<p>The office of the Solicitor General submits in its brief that "the lower 
court did not err in denying the present petition," but contends that the crime 
of robbery charged in the <br>information in cases Nos. 2 and 3 in which the 
defendant was convicted and sentenced to death, the nullity of which is being 
assailed not only in this but in the previous case, is the one penalized in 
article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, because the crime charged was robbery 
with homicide, and Act No. 65 of the Assembly of the so-called Republic of the 
Philippines adopted only article 293 and not article 294 of the said Code.</p>
<p>It is'true that-in the said cases Nos. 2 and 3, the felony charged is robbery 
and homicide committed by reason thereof, and the information does not say 
whether the appellant was being charged for violation of said Act No. 65 or of 
article 294 of the Revised Penal Code. But it is not less true that said Act No. 
65 in penalizing the crime of robbery in general as defined in article 293 of 
the Revised Penal Code, if committed by persons charged with the supervision and 
control of the production, procurement, and distribution of foods and other 
necessaries, has adopted and penalized all kinds of robbery embraced in the 
definition thereof in said article 293. This article does not punish but only 
defines the crime of robbery in general, saying that "any person who with intent 
to gain, shall take any personal property, belonging to another, by means of 
violence against or intimidation of any person, or using force upon anything, 
shall be guilty of robbery." The different kinds or forms of robbery so defined 
are penalized by said Act No. 65, not with the penalties fixed in articles 294 
to 300 for each kind or form of robbery therein described, but with a heavier 
penalty the maximum of which was life imprisonment or death, at the discretion 
of the Court of Special Criminal Jurisdiction, depending upon the form and 
manner of, and the circumstances attending, its commission. In other words said 
Act No. 65 penalized all cases of robbery as defined in general in said article 
293, committed by means of either violence against or intimidation of person, or 
force upon a thing, in whatever form and manner, in any place, and under any 
circumstance, with a penalty ranging from imprisonment to death in the 
discretion of the court; and did not adopt the provisions of articles 294 to 300 
because they penalized with fixed penalties each and every one of the different 
forms and manners of committing the robberies therein described.<br>Although in 
the complaint filed against the appellant in the cases Nos. 2 and 3 in the Court 
of First Instance of Leyte, acting as Court of Special Criminal Jurisdiction, no 
reference was made, either to Act No. 65 of the so-called Republic of the 
Philippines, or to article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, there is no doubt that 
the appellant was charged with violation of Act No. 65, for he was then H member 
of the Philippine Constabulary; the information was filed with, and the 
appellant was convicted by, a Court of Special Criminal Jurisdiction; the order 
appealed from states that the petitioner is serving sentence rendered by the 
Court of Special Criminal Jurisdiction of Leyte under said Act No, 65; and this 
Court has already so held in tho case G. R. No. L-142.</p>
<p>The lower court did not, therefore, err in holding that there was another 
action pending between the same parties and for the same cause, and dismissing 
the petition for <em>Habeas corpus</em> filed by the appellant (sec. 2, Rule 73, 
in connection with sec. 1 id]. Rule 8, Rules of Court).</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is therefore affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result for the same reasons stated in my dissenting opinion 
in case No. L-142.</p>
<p><strong>PABLO, M.: </strong></p>
<p>Conforme con la parte dispositiva.</p>
