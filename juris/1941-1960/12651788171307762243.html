				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">During the years 1950 and 1951, petitioner Crispulo Malicse&nbsp; was the proprietor and operator of the Palo&nbsp; Alto Hotel and Restaurant located at 417 Isaac Peral, Manila, where he maintained rooms for lodging of his hotel guests, a restaurant&nbsp; where meals, wines&nbsp; and liquors&nbsp; are&nbsp; served not only to hotel guests but also to other customers who are not hotel guests, and a place where cigars and cigarettes&nbsp; are sold to everybody.&nbsp; He was duly provided with the required privilege tax receipts&nbsp; as hotelkeeper, keeper of a&nbsp; restaurant, fermented liquor dealer&nbsp; and retail tobacco dealer&nbsp; as prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 182 in&nbsp; relation&nbsp; to section 191, section 193 (<em>k</em>)&nbsp; and section 193 (<em>n</em>)&nbsp; of the Tax Code.&nbsp; And for the aforesaid years, he rendered separate returns: one&nbsp; for his business&nbsp; as hotel keeper and another for his&nbsp; business as keeper of a&nbsp; restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp; As hotel-keeper, he paid the 3 per cent percentage tax on his gross receipts&nbsp; and&nbsp; for his business as keeper of&nbsp; a restaurant where wines or liquors are served,&nbsp; he paid the 5 per cent percentage tax prescribed in section 191 of&nbsp; the Tax Code amounting to P6,433.53.<p>On March 31, 1952, the petitioner demanded refund&nbsp; of the amount claiming that the restaurant which he operated in the Palo&nbsp; Alto Hotel&nbsp; and Restaurant is&nbsp; not separate nor distinct from his hotel business; that the operation&nbsp; of said restaurant is merely&nbsp; incidental to and&nbsp; necessarily connected with the&nbsp; hotel business and as such his receipts from&nbsp; said restaurant should be considered receipts&nbsp; of his hotel&nbsp; business, subject to the 3 per cent percentage tax due from him as hotelkeeper and, lastly, that the sales&nbsp; of cigars and cigarettes in said restaurant do not form part of his gross&nbsp; receipts as restaurant keeper and therefore not subject to the&nbsp; 5&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; tax.&nbsp; On January&nbsp; 21, 1953, the&nbsp; demand was denied by the&nbsp; respondent who ruled that a keeper of a restaurant where wines and liquors are served is subject to 5 per cent percentage tax prescribed in section 191 of the Tax Code and that petitioner's receipts from sales of cigars and cigarettes in his restaurant form part of his gross&nbsp; receipts as keeper of the restaurant. Thereupon the petitioner requested the respondent that his petition be submitted, for resolution, to the Conference&nbsp; Staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue;, the request was&nbsp; granted and the&nbsp; Conference Staff took cognizance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case. It found, however, no reason to reverse or modify the&nbsp; decision of the respondent and, accordingly, the petitioner was notified of the final decision denying the demand&nbsp; for refund&nbsp; of&nbsp; the alleged overpayment&nbsp; of the 5&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; percentage tax&nbsp; on the gross receipts from his restaurant business.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; satisfied with the decision, petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No.&nbsp; 401—A, series of 1951.&nbsp; On February 4, 1954, the Board of Tax Appeals&nbsp; affirmed the decision of the respondent,&nbsp; hence&nbsp; this present petition&nbsp; for review of the decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tax Appeals in accordance with section 20 of Executive Order No. 401-A,&nbsp; dated January 5, 1951.</p><p>The facts of the case are not.disputed. Petitioner admits that during the years 1950 and 1951 he engaged in hotel&nbsp; business,&nbsp; operating at the same time a restaurant within&nbsp; the premises of the hotel,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that in&nbsp; said restaurant he served&nbsp; meals, wines or liquors and sold cigars and cigarettes not only to hotel&nbsp; guests but also to outsiders.&nbsp; And&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; on record&nbsp; conclusively shows that&nbsp; petitioner was then&nbsp; duly&nbsp; provided&nbsp; with privilege tax-receipt as&nbsp; hotel keeper&nbsp; and&nbsp; another&nbsp; privilege&nbsp; tax receipt as keeper of a restaurant, which clearly proves that during&nbsp; the aforesaid years the&nbsp; petitioner ran&nbsp; and operated a&nbsp; restaurant business&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; from his&nbsp; business as&nbsp; hotelkeeper.</p><p>The present case calls for the interpretation and application of section 191 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Code which reads as follows: "Keepers of restaurants,&nbsp; refreshment parlors and other eating places shall pay a tax&nbsp; of 3%, and keepers of bars and cafes where wines or liquors are served, 5% of their gross receipts."</p><p>The word&nbsp; "restaurant"&nbsp; seems not to be included in the aforequoted provision of law, where there&nbsp; are only&nbsp; mentioned the&nbsp; "keepers of bars and cafes where wines or liquors are served" as&nbsp; the persons bound to pay 5 per cent percentage tax on their&nbsp; gross receipts.&nbsp; But, as correctly contended&nbsp; by the respondent, "cafe" is a&nbsp; general&nbsp; term which includes restaurants; "cafe" is denned in Webster's International&nbsp; Dictionary as "a coffee-house; a room for coffee and light refreshment; a restaurant; formerly in the U. S. a barroom." Consequently, a restaurant where wines or liquors&nbsp; are served comes within the purview of the phrase "bars and cafes where wines or liquors&nbsp; are served" as contemplated in section 191&nbsp; of the Tax Code and therefore subject to the 5 per cent percentage tax prescribed therein.</p><p>Petitioner contends, however, that his restaurant&nbsp; business cannot be subject to&nbsp; the 5 per cent percentage tax because section 191 of the Tax Code is&nbsp; only applicable to, purely&nbsp; drinking&nbsp; establishments. This&nbsp; contention&nbsp; is untenable for, as pointed out by the Solicitor General in his brief,&nbsp; "if this theory is sustained,&nbsp; it would be easy for taxpayers to&nbsp; evade the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of the 5 per cent percentage tax prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 191 on&nbsp; bars and&nbsp; cafes where wines&nbsp; or&nbsp; liquors are served by the simple expedient of not maintaining a purely drinking&nbsp; establishment and&nbsp; keeping just a sort of&nbsp; an&nbsp; eating establishment but at the same time serving&nbsp; therein wines&nbsp; or liquors—which could not have been the intention of our legislators."</p><p>In conclusion, we find that the petitioner rendered separate&nbsp; returns for his&nbsp; business&nbsp; as hotelkeeper and&nbsp; as keeper of a restaurant; that he paid 3 per cent percentage tax on the gross receipts&nbsp; from hotel guest for&nbsp; lodging, meals, drinks, cigars and cigarettes and other services furnished them;&nbsp; that he paid the questioned 5&nbsp; per cent percentage tax for his restaurant business on&nbsp; the gross receipts from meals, wines,&nbsp; liquors, cigars&nbsp; and&nbsp; cigarettes served or sold to his customers who were not hotel guests, and for these gross receipts, he was properly taxed under section 191 of the Tax Code.</p><p>Wherefore, finding&nbsp; no&nbsp; errors in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, </em>and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
