				<H3>H.P. HOSKYNS, AS ADMINISTRATOR OF INTESTATE ESTATE OF J.E.H. STEVENOT, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT; WELLS FARGO BANK AND UNION TRUST COMPANY, INTERVENOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an action for a declaratory relief filed in the Court 
of First Instance of Manila. The judgment is in favor of the plaintiff, H.P. 
Hoskyns, and the National City Bank of New York, defendant, and Wells Fargo Bank 
and Union Trust Co., intervenor, has appealed.
<p align="justify">The facts and allegations necessary to a proper under standing 
and determination of the case may be condensed as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">J.E.H. Stevenot, a citizen of the United States and of the 
State of California, died in New Caledonia on June 8, 1943, while serving as an 
officer of the U. S. Army. He was survived by his widow, Elma Kimball Stevenot, 
and two daughters, Myre Gene Stevenot and Shirley Joanne Stevenot, who are all 
at present in the United States. For more than ten years immediately prior to 
his death, J. E. H. Stevenot had been a resident of the Philippines and upon his 
death left real and personal properties situated therein, properties which he 
acquired during his married life.</p>
<p align="justify">On April 19, 1943, while in California, Stevenot executed a 
private written instrument, agreed to by his wife, in which he appointed himself 
as trustor or trustee of his properties and declared that he was holding them in 
trust for the beneficiaries named therein including his wife, daughters, and 
other relatives. The deed of trust provided that Stevenot should himself have a 
life interest in the trust properties and that after his death the income and 
corpus should go principally to his wife and family.</p>
<p align="justify">The trust indenture provided finally that upon Stevenot's 
death, Wells Fargo Bank and Union Trust Co. should succeed as trustee for the 
properties located in the United States and the National City Bank of New York 
at Manila for the properties in the Philippines. Both of these trustees accepted 
the trust.</p>
<p align="justify">After Stevenot's death, administration proceedings were 
commenced in the Court of First Instance of Manila, H. P. Hoskyns, plaintiff in 
the instantaction, being appointed as administrator. The application for 
Hoskyns' appointment as administrator was made by the present attorneys for the 
defendant and appellant and intervenor and appellant on behalf of Stevenot's 
widow.</p>
<p align="justify">The action for declaratory relief prays that the court 
"determine the question of construction or validity of the declaration of trust 
and for the declaration of the rights and duties of the defendant hereunder." In 
an amended complaint plaintiff alleges, besides the facts set forth above, that 
defendant National City Bank of New York and intervenor Wells Fargo Bank and 
Union Trust Co. claim the real and personal properties of Stevenot in the 
Philippines which are under his administration, alleging that as Stevenot's 
successor trustees they are entitled to their possession and administration in 
order to be able to dis charge their obligation under the trust for the benefits 
of Stevenot's widow, daughters, brothers and sisters, for whose accounts and 
benefits the declaration of trust was created; that contrary to this claim of 
the defendant and intervenor, the plaintiff believes that as administrator duly 
appointed by the court of the Philippines in Special Proceeding No. 71768 of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, he has the right, to the exclusion of all 
others, to the possession and administration of the deceased's properties 
located in the Philippines, subject only to the supervision, control and 
approval of the estate court; that in the above intestate proceeding claims have 
been presented against the estate, claims which have not yet been admitted; that 
the laws and rules which outline the procedure for the admission and payment of 
these claims can not be enforced if the declaration of trust be given force and 
effect in the Philippines; that in view of these conflicting claims "it is 
expedient to determine the construction or validity arising under the 
declaration of trust above stated and for a declaration of rights and duties of 
the defendant therein with respect to the properties of the deceased located in 
the Philippines."</p>
<p align="justify">The defendant and the intervenor maintain that the declaration 
of trust is valid under the laws of California where it was executed and should 
be recognized as valid in the Philippines, and pray, upon the facts stated in 
the complaint, that the plaintiff be ordered to turn over to the trustees for 
administration, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the declaration 
of trust, all properties located in the Philippines and subject to the said 
trust and which are now or which may at any time here after come into his 
possession or under his control. In a well written decision, Hon. Conrado 
Sanchez, Judge, held "that plaintiff H.P. Hoskyns, as administrator of the 
intestate estate of the deceased J.E.H. Stevenot, is entitled to the 
possession of the properties under his administration and described in Annex B 
of the original complaint." The decision is silent regarding the validity of the 
trust.</p>
<p align="justify">In appellant's brief (first assignment of error) the trial 
court is alleged to have "erred in not holding that J.E.H. Stevenot created a 
valid trust and in not giving effect to the provisions of the trust 
indenture."</p>
<p align="justify">We think that the court below properly declined or omitted to 
make declarations regarding the validity of the trust agreement. Section 3 of 
Rule 66 enjoins that "when declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be 
made parties who have or claim any interest which will be affected by the 
declaration," while section 6 authorizes the courts to "refuse to exercise the 
power to declare rights and to construe instruments where a decision under it 
would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise to the 
action."</p>
<p align="justify">The persons most vitally if not solely affected by the validity 
or invalidity of the trust are the widow, daughters, other heirs, and the 
creditors of the deceased. None of them are before the court now, and without 
them any decision on the validity or invalidity of the trust would not put an 
end to the uncertainty or controversy which the administrator and the trustees 
wish to have clarified and adjudicated. Not being parties to this suit, the 
heirs and the creditors would not be bound by any judgment holding the trust 
valid or invalid and might later "raise the identical issue and deprive the 
declaration of that final and pacifying function it is calculated to 
subserve."</p>
<p align="justify">The judicial administrator and the trustees, it is evident, are 
not concerned about the intrinsic validity of the trust. They are concerned at 
the most with who, as between them, should have possesssion of and manage the 
properties involved in the trust. The latter question is independent of, and 
would not be concluded by, a declaration that that instrument should be given 
force and effect in this jurisdiction. Regardless of the validity or invalidity 
of the trust, the Philippine courts may assert jurisdiction in the 
administration of trust properties located in the Philippines to protect the 
beneficiaries or creditors. (Sections 1 and 5, Rule 99.)</p>
<p align="justify">The appellants object that the basic question on this appeal is 
as to whether the trust was validly created; they are not, they insist, 
interested in the estate proceedings now pending in court. If this were correct, 
we could stop right here, having dismissed and disposed of the first point. The 
truth of the matter, however, is that the second assignment of error assails the 
decision precisely for "not directing H.P. Hoskyns, * * *, to turn over to the 
successor-trustees under the trust created by J.E.H. Stevenot possession and 
control of the properties located in the Philippines which were the subject of 
the trust." And in defendant's and intervenor's answers and in their motions 
for summary judgments on the pleadings they asked the same relief. More, the 
ultimate desire of the trustees, as we see it, is the virtual revocation of the 
plaintiff's appointment as administrator, the quashing of intestate proceeding 
No. 71768, and the turning over of the estate to them. It can be gathered from 
the pleadings and argument that the parties seek a declaration of the validity 
of the trust indenture mainly because of the notion that if the trust is valid 
the right of the trustees to take charge of the estate for administration and 
settlement should follow. This belief can also be inferred from the contention 
in the first assignment of error transcribed above, namely, that effect should 
be given to the provisions of the trust indenture on the premise that that 
instrument was validly created. The effect referred to can be no other than the 
delivery of the properties to the trustees.</p>
<p align="justify">Nevertheless, His Honor the trial Judge should have refrained, 
in our opinion, from entering a judgment on the conflicting claims of the 
parties over the control and administration of the estate, just as he refrained 
from passing on the validity of the trust. The parties should be referred to the 
intestate proceeding where this matter belongs and where the purpose of the 
parties, which in effect is the removal or revocation of the appointment of the 
plaintiff as administrator, can be more than conveniently accomplished with the 
simple device of filing a motion or petition to that end. In fact, it is in that 
proceeding and in the court which appointed him where the plaintiff could, with 
absolute propriety and without violating the prescribed practice and procedure, 
obtain a ruling on his right to continue as administrator. If the plaintiff does 
not want to move—as indeed he need not, since the initiative should come not 
from him but from the trustees—a petition of the nature suggested above, filed 
by the trustees in the intestate proceeding already commenced, will afford a 
complete remedy for the attainment of the desired objective.</p>
<p align="justify">The courts are given discretionary power to refuse to, make a 
declaration of rights "in any case where the declaration is not necessary and 
proper at the time under all the circumstances." (Section 6, Rule 66.) The 
reason for this rule is thus stated in Corpus Juris Secundum. "A declaratory 
judgment proceeding is intended to supplement, and not to be a substitute for, 
or supersede, other existing remedies, in use at the time of the enactment of 
the declaratory judgment acts; it may be used as an alternative or auxiliary to 
other proceedings for an executory judgment; and it is within the discretion of 
the court to permit such an action or proceeding to be maintained where another 
remedy is available to plaintiff. As a general rule, however, to justify such an 
action the situation must be such that adequate relief is not presently 
available through the means of other existing forms of action or proceeding, 
and, conversely, jurisdiction for a declaratory judgment ordinarily will not be 
entertained where another equally adequate and appropriate remedy is already 
available for the issues or rights sought to be determined and declared, as 
where another equally serviceable statutory remedy has been specially provided 
in cases of similar import, and particularly where such statutory remedy is 
exclusive." (1 C. J. S., 1027, 1028.)</p>
<p align="justify">It has been seen that there is at present a pending in testate 
proceeding (case No. 71768) in which the plaintiff was appointed administrator. 
And as has been pointed out also, a petition for the closing or termination of 
that proceeding will at least be equally serviceable for the purpose for which 
the present action was brought. Such petition has the additional advantage over 
one for a mere declaration of the comparative rights of the plaintiff and the 
defendant and intervenor, in that the relief in the first case would be 
conclusive and executory and would dispose of the dispute once and for all, 
aside from the fact that conflict of jurisdiction would be avoided, and the 
issues would be placed before the forum qr branch of the court which by law 
deals with testate, intestate, and trust matters under Part II, entitled 
"Special Proceedings," of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, the objection noted above regarding the non joinder 
of necessary parties also obtains here, making improper if not useless any 
declaration that might be made in the instant suit concerning the rights of the 
trustees to the possession and administration of the trust properties. It is 
undoubted that the intervention of at least Mr. Stevenot's widow and of the 
creditors in the proposed change in the methods of settling the estate and in 
the men to carry out the settlement is not only expedient but essential for the 
reason already emphasized. Mrs. Stevenot, as has been seen, initiated the 
intestate proceed ing, and it was on her application that the administrator was 
appointed. As to the creditors, these already have filed claims in that 
proceeding aggregating P162,455.30. Under the circumstances, the heirs and the 
creditors are of right entitled to be heard on a matter so vital to their 
interest.</p>
<p align="justify">Incidentally, an ordinary motion or petition in the in testate 
proceeding for the desired change will afford an opportunity to cure the defect; 
the probate court handling the estate has the authority and the duty to require 
the heirs and the creditors to appear, if they do not voluntarily do so, so that 
they may contest the petition or motion if they so desire. And with all the 
interested parties intervening, the case will be ripe for the adjudication in a 
definite manner of the validity of the declaration of trust, if that be material 
to the issues and if any of the parties should question such validity.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the foregoing considerations, the action will be 
dismissed, without costs. It is so ordered.</p> <em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla,
