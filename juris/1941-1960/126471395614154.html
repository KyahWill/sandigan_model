				<H3>MANUEL  C. MANARANG AND LUCIA  D. MANARANG, PETITIONERS  AND  APPELLANTS, VS. MACARIO  M.  OFILADA, SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA AND ERNESTO  ESTEBAN, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On September 8, 1951, petitioner Lucia D.  Manarang obtained a loan of P200 from Ernesto Esteban,  and to secure its payment she executed a chattel mortgage over a house of mixed materials erected on a lot on Alvarado Street, Manila.   As Manarang did not pay the  loan as agreed upon,  Esteban brought an action  against her in the municipal court of Manila for its recovery,  alleging that the loan was secured by a chattel mortgage on her property.  Judgment haying been entered  in plaintiff's favor, execution was  issued against  the  same property mortgaged.</p>
<p>Before the property could be sold Manarang offered to pay the sum of P277, which represented the amount of the judgment of  P250, the interest thereon, the costs, and the sheriff's fees, but the sheriff refused the tender unless the additional amount  of  P260 representing  the  publication of the notice of sale in two newspapers be paid also.  So defendants therein brought  this suit to compel the sheriff to accept the amount of P277 as full payment of the judgment and to annul the  published notice of sale.</p>
<p>It  is to be noted that in the  complaint filed in the municipal court, a  copy of the chattel mortgage is  attached and mention made of its registration,  and in the prayer request  is made that  the house mortgaged be sold at public auction to satisfy the debt.  It is  also important to  note  that  the  house  mortgaged  was levied upon at plaintiffs request (Exhibit  "E").</p>
<p>On the  basis  of the  above facts counsel  for  Manarang contended in the  court  below that the house in  question should be  considered as personal property and the publication of the notice  of its  sale at public auction in execution considered unnecessary.   The Court of First Instance held that although real property may sometimes be  considered as  personal property, the sheriff was  in duty bound  to cause  the publication of  the notice  of  its sale in order ip  make the sale valid  or to prevent  its being  declared void or voidable, and he did  not, therefore,  err  in  causing such publication of the  notice.  So it denied the  petition.</p>
<p>There can not be any question that a building of mixed materials  may be the  subject of a  chattel  mortgage,  in which case  it is  considered as between  the  parties  as personal property.  We held so expressly in the  cases  of Luna <em>vs</em>. Encaraacion, et al.,<span class="style1">*</span> 48 Off. Gaz., No. 7, p. 2664; Standard Oil Co. of New York <em>vs</em>. Jaranillo, 44  Phil.,  630; and De Jesus <em>vs</em>.  Guan  Dee  Co., Inc., 72 Phil,  464.   The matter depends on the circumstances  and the intention of  the  parties.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * The general principle  of law  is that a building permanently fixed to the freehold becomes a  part  of  it,  that  prima facie a house  is real estate, belonging  to the owner of the land gn.  which it  stands, even  though  it  was  erected against  the will  of the landowner, or  without his consent. * *  *  The general rule is otherwise, however, where the improvement is made with the' consent of the landowner, and pursuant to  an understanding either expressed or implied that it shall remain personal property. Nor  does the general rule apply to a building which is wrongfully removed  from  the land  and placed  on the land  of the person removing it."  (42 Am. Jur. 199-200.)</p>
  <p>"* * *  Among the principal  criteria for  determining  whether property' remains  personaly  or  becomes realty are annexation to the! sail,  either actual or construction,  and  the intention  of  the parties. * * *</p>
  <p>"Personal property may retain its character as such where it is so agreed  by  the parties interested even though  annexed to the realty, or where it is affixed in the soil to be used for' a particular purpose  for a  short period and then removed as soon as it.has served its  purpose. * *  *."  (<em>Ibid.,</em> 209-210.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question  now  before us, however, is Does the fact that the  parties  entering  into  a  contract  regarding a house  gave  said  property the  consideration of personal property  in their  contract, bind the sheriff in advertising the property's sale at public auction as personal property? It is to be remembered that in the case at bar the action was to collect a  loan secured by a chattel mortgage on the house.  It is  also to be remembered that in practice it is the  judgment creditor who points out  to the sheriff the properties that the sheriff  is to levy upon in execution, and the judgment creditor in the case at bar is the party in whose favor the  owner of the house  and conveyed  it by way of  chattel mortgage  and, therefore, knew  its  consideration as personal property.</p>
<p>These considerations notwithstanding, we  hold that the rules on  execution do not allow, and we should  not interpret them in such a way as to allow, the special  consideration that parties to a contract may  have desired to impart  to real estate, for example,  as personal property, when they are not   ordinarily so.   Sales  on execution affect the public  and third  persons.  The  regulation  governing sales  on  execution are  for public officials to follow. The form of proceedings  prescribed  for each kind of property  is suited to its character, not to  the character which the parties have  given to it or desire to give it. When  the rules  speak  of personal  property,  property which is ordinarily  so  considered  is meant;  and when real property is  spoken of, it  means  property which  is generally known  as real property.   The regulations were never intended to suit the consideration that parties,  may have  privately  given to the  property levied  upon.  Enforcement of regulations would be  difficult were the  convenience  or  agreement  of  private  parties  to  determine or govern the nature of the proceedings.  We, therefore, hold that the mere fact that a house was the subject of a chattel mortgage and was considered as personal property by  the parties does not make  said  house personal proper for purposes of the notice to be given  for  its sale at public auction.   This ruling is demanded  by the need for a definite, orderly and well-defined regulation for official and public guidance and  which  would  prevent confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>We, therefore, declare that the  house  of mixed materials  levied upon  on execution,  although subject of  a contract  of chattel mortgage between  the owner and a third person, is real  property within the purview of Rule  39, section 16, of the Rules of Court as it has become a permanent fixture oh the land, which is real property;   (42 Am. Jur.  190-200; Leung Yee <em>vs</em>.  Strong Machinery Co.,  37 Phil., 644; Republic <em>vs</em>. Ceniza, et alt 90 Phil., 544; Ladera, et al. <em>vs</em>. Hedges, et al., [C. A], 48 Off, Gaz., 5374.)</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from is hereby  affirmed, with</p>
<p>costs.  So ordered.</p>
