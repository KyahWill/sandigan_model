				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, PETITIONER, VS. MAGDALENA A. VDA. DE SAYSON, ETC.,  RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Alejandro V.  Sayson was  an employee of  the Manila Railroad Company from February 21,  1938 to July 21, 1952, when he died.   During this  entire period he was ar member  of  the Government Service Insurance  System, petitioner herein, which issued life insurance policy No. T-13929 in his favor.  The premium was two per cent of his monthly salary, one half to be paid by him  and the other half by his employer.  After the death of Sayson, his widow Magdalena A. Vda. de Sayson, respondent herein, filed the  necessary  claim  over the insurance proceeds, but as no payment was made, she filed  on September 18, 1952 with the Court of First Instance of Manila a  petition for mandamus to compel the petitioner to pay.  On October  8, 1952, the latter paid  to the  respondent the sum of P1,194.11, representing only one half of the amount due, it being contended  that the petitioner was not bound to pay  the other half because the share of  the Manila Railroad Company in the insurance premiums of all  its employees including Sayson, had not been paid.  On October 27, 1952, the petition for mandamus was amended so as to include as party respondent  the Manila Railroad Company which, in view of its failure to file an answer, was declared in  default.   On September 24, 1953, the court rendered  judgment  in  favor of  the respondent.  Upon appeal by the petitioner, the Court of  Appeals rendered a decision the dispositive part of which reads1 as  follows: "Wherefore, in view  of the foregoing and finding no error in the conclusion reached by the  court Delow, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the addendum that appellant Government Service Insurance System and the Manila Railroad  Company are hereby ordered, jointly and  severally, to pay appellee Magdalena A. Vda. de Sayson, in her capacity  as legal guardian of the minors Lina and  Rosario, both. surnamed Sayson, the balance of the insurance benefits still due on the policy of the deceased Alejandro V. Sayson in the sum of one thousand one hundred ninety four pesos and eleven centavos  (P1, 194.11)." The petitioner has appealed to this Court by way of certiorari.</p>
<p>The basis of the petitioner in refusing to pay one half of the insurance benefits was that section 9 of  Republic Act No. 728 provides that "notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary, and in order to insure the solvency  of the System and protect  the  interest of all its  members,  the Board is  hereby authorized to  make readjustment in any of the benefits payable to an employee under this Act in accordance with such rules and regulations  it may prescribe if his employer fails to pay for him its share of the contributions or premiums required by  this Act and no  person, regardless  of  the  date  of his retirement, may allege, vested right by reason of this readjustment"; and that in pursuance thereof the Board of Trustees 'of the petitioner adopted resolution No.  355 to the following effect:  Resolved: That the  readjustment recommended by the Associate Actuary and Acting Manager Production Department, for  retirement insurance benefits be postponed until the next regular meeting of the Board, while that for life insurance benefits 'that in case of a death claim under a term policy, the adjusted benefit be one half of the amount of insurance less indebtedness of the insured, if his employer fails to pay for him its share of the contributions or premiums required by Republic Act No. 660, be approved  effective June 15, 1952, when Republic Act No. 728 was approved."</p>
<p>Even assuming that section 6 of Republic Act No. 728 authorizes the Board  to readjust benefits payable  to  an employee's beneficiary, we are  inclined to hold that resolution No. 355 adopted on  September 16, 1952, or after the death  of Alejandro V. Sayson  on July 21, 1952, should not be made applicable  to the latter's policy, because  its benefits had  already accrued upon the death of Sayson or, as held by the Court of Appeals,  the liability of the petitioner had  "previously attached."   It is  but fair that the insured employee, unaware of and helpless in the failure of his employer to pay its share in the required premiums, should be made to understand and expect that his outstanding policy is in full force, unaffected by conditions imposed by the  System subsequent  to  his death.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed without pronouncement as to  costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,  j. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia,  JJ.,</em>  concur.</p>
