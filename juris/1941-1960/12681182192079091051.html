L. Moya vs. John Barton, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff and against 
defendant, and the latter was notified thereof on February 14, 1946. On March 
14, 1946, that is, 28 days after notice, defendant filed a motion for new trial 
which was denied, and the order denying said motion was served upon said 
defendant on April 1, 1946. The latter filed on April 2, 1946, a notice of 
appeal and an appeal bond, and at the same time a motion requesting an extension 
of 5 days within which to file his record on appeal, on the ground that it was 
impossible for him to have the same typewritten and filed in one day or on April 
3, the last day of the period fixed by law, and the court granted the motion on 
the same day it was presented. The defendant-appellant filed his appeal on time, 
and the case is now pending before this Court.
<p>A motion for dismissal of defendant's appeal has been filed by plaintiff in 
this Court on the ground that (1) the lower court had no power to extend the 
period for filing the record on appeal,'and that (2) plaintiff-appellee was not 
notified of defendant's motion for extension of time to file it and the motion 
was not set for hearing.</p>
<p>As to the first ground, without deciding whether or not the period within 
which an appellant must file his notice of appeal and appeal bond may be 
extended by the court, we ere of the opinion that the court has power and 
discretion to extend the period for filing the record on appeal in the interest 
of justice, if it appears that the appellant has not sufficient time to prepare 
and file it within the period limited by law, either because the remaining 
period is very short, or the record on appeal voluminous, or because of some 
other justifiable reason, provided the motion for extension is filed before the 
expiration of the period fixed by law. The law must be construed liberally and 
reasonably. It goes without saying that a motion, pleading or other paper filed 
within the extended period legally or validly granted by a court, is a motion 
filed within the period fixed by law.</p>
<p>This conclusion is corroborated by the provision of sec. 7 of Rule 41 which 
empowers a court to order the amendment of a record on appeal if appellee's 
objection to it is well taken, and to grant appellant time within which to 
submit or file the amended record on appeal, for if appellant may secure 
indirectly an extension of time by filing an incomplete or defective record on 
(3) appeal, there is no reason why he can, not obtain such extension, or the 
court grant it, directly. It is a legal maxim that what can not be done directly 
can not be done indirectly. Therefore what can be done or granted indirectly can 
be done or granted directly.</p>
<p>It is also supported by analogy by the previous ruling of this Court, 
specially in the case of Lim vs. Singian (37 Phil. 817) and Layda vs. Legaspi 
(39 Phil. 83) in which it was held that the court had power to extend the period 
of ten days withbiwhich to present the bill of exceptions, notwithstanding the 
provision of Sec. 143 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the effect that the bill 
of exceptions must be filed within ten days from notice of his intention to 
present it.</p>
<p>With respect to the other ground, sec. 2 of Rule 27 provides that "every 
written motion othe than one which may be heard <em>ex-parte</em> * * * shall be 
filed with the court and served upon the parties affected thereby." Taking in to 
consideration that the extension of time applied for may be shorter than the 
time required to have a motion set for hearing and acted on by the court, and 
that the court has, as above stated, discretion to grant the petition, the 
motion for extension filed in. the present case may be considered as one which 
may be heard ex-parte. The lower court did not err, therefore, in granting the 
petition for extension <em>ex-parte.</em></p>
<p>The motion for dismissal of appeal is denied.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla, 
</em>and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
