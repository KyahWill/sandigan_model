				<H3>LUIS DEL CASTILLO, IN HIS CAPACITY AS ADMINISTRATOR OF INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED ANDRES GRIMALT Y PASTOR, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. METROPOLITAN INSURANCE COMPANY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken from a decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila absolving the defendant Metropolitan Insurance Company from the complaint 
filed by Luis del Castillo as administrator of the estate of the deceased Andres 
Grimalt y Pastor.
<p>According to the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, the deceased 
Andres Grimalt y Pastor, was the owner of "Panaderia la Magdalena" situated 
between O'Donnel and Misericordia streets in the city of Manila which was 
insured against fire and lightning and covered by Policies nos. 21489, 21105 and 
21106 issued by the Metropolitan Insurance Company which were in full force and 
effect at the time said property was partially destroyed by fire. Said Policies 
have their face value of p15,000.00, P30,000.00, and P40,000.00 respectively and 
were worded identically there having been paid by the insured to the defendant 
company as premiums the amounts of P300 for Policy No. 21489, P600 for Policy 
No. 21105 and P800 for Policy No. 21106 for the period comprised between 
September 23, 1941, and September 23, 1942.</p>
<p>Paragraph six (6) of each of these Policies is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This insurance does not cover any loss or damage which either in origin or 
extent is directly or indirectly, proximately or remotely, occasioned by or 
contributed to by any of the following occurrences, or which, either in origin 
or extent directly or indirectly, proximately or remotely, arises out of or in 
connection with any of such occurrences, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Earthquake, volcanic eruption, typhoon, hurricane, tornado, cyclone, or 
other convulsion of nature or atmospheric disturbance.</p>
<p>"(2) War, invasion, act of foreign enemy, hostilities or warlike operations 
(whether war be declared or not), mutiny, riot, civil commotion, insurrection, 
rebellion, revolution, conspiracy, military naval or usurped power, martial law 
or state of siege, or any of the events or causes which determine the 
proclamation or maintenance of martial law or state of siege.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Any loss or damage happening during the existence of abnormal conditions 
(whether physical or otherwise), directly or indirectly, proximately or 
remotely, occasioned by or contributed to by or arising out of or in connection 
with any of the said occurrences shall be deemed to be loss or damage which is 
not covered by this insurance, except to the extent that the Insured shall prove 
that such loss or damage happened independently of the existence of such 
abnormal conditions.</p>
<p>"In any action, suit or other proceeding, where the Company alleges that by 
reason of the provisions of this condition any loss or damage is not covered by 
this insurance, the burden of proving that such loss or damage is covered shall 
be upon the Insured."</p></blockquote>
<p>Early in the afternoon of January 2, 1942, a fire broke out in a grocery 
store owned by Yu Dian Chiang, then being looted, and caught and destroyed two 
doors of the "Panaderia la Magdalena" building, thus causing a damage in the 
amount of P62,000.</p>
<p>The main issue here is whether or not the defendant, Metropolitan Insurance 
Company, is liable for the damage thus caused to the bakery above mentioned.</p>
<p>As above indicated, one of the conditions stipulated in the Policies is that 
any loss or damage caused by war or invasion or "any loss or damage happening 
during the existence of abnormal conditions (whether physical or otherwise) 
directly or indirectly, proximately or remotely, occasioned by or contributed to 
by or arising out of or in connection with any of the said occurrences shall be 
deemed to be loss or damage which is not covered by this insurance" and that 
"where the Company alleges that by reason of the provisions of this condition 
any loss or damage is not covered by this insurance, the burden of proving that 
such loss or damage is covered shall be upon the Insured".</p>
<p>Insurance companies, generally, are willing to assume only ordinary risks or 
losses that may happen under ordinary conditions or in times of peace. Insurance 
companies are entitled to protect themselves and maintain their stability in the 
interest of the people whom they insure and accordingly they should avoid 
assuming extra-ordinary risks due to unusual and peculiarly destructive causes 
which are disproportionate to the amount of premium paid. It is for this reason 
that extraordinary causes of loss for which no augmented premium has been paid 
are excluded from the coverage of the Policies issued by the defendant company.

<p>On January 2, 1942, when the bakery owned by plaintiff was destroyed 
partially by fire, the conditions in Manila were entirely abnormal on account of 
the war. In the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties, It is stated that 
in the city of Manila from December 29, 1941 up to January 3, 1942, due 
undoubtedly to the evacuation of the Philippine and U.S. Army and to the 
imminence of Japanese invasion, the conditions of peace and order were totally 
abnormal and beyond control for they were characterized by panic and confusion 
and accompanied by unchecked looting, uncontrolled mobs, and outbreaks of fire. 
Prom December 8, 1941 to January 4, 1942 there had been at least fifty (50) 
fires in Manila and on January 2, 1942 there had been at least eight (8) fires 
in the city. And on January 6, a fire gutted the building opposite and directly 
in front of the bakery owned by plaintiff. Since 2/3 of the population and 2/3 
of the police force of the city had evacuated to the provinces, many houses were 
left without vigilance and were the subject of general looting, and fire, in 
several instances, was the consequence. Looting and robbery were rampant in the 
city because only a handful of policemen were left and they were generally 
ignored by the mob of looters. Fires breaking out in houses being looted were 
beyond control because a great portion of Manila's firemen had also evacuated to 
the provinces or failed to report for duty in fear of imminent danger and calls 
for assistance received no response from the fire department.</p>
<p>The fire which destroyed partially the bakery in question, came from a 
grocery that was being looted. Such fire was the effect of abnormal conditions 
caused by war.</p>
<p>There is another reason why plaintiff's action should be dismissed. In 
paragraph thirteen (13) of the Policies it is stipulated that "if the claim is 
made and rejected and an action or suit be not commenced within twelve (12) 
months after such rejection * * * all benefit under this Policy shall be 
forfeited." According to the stipulation of facts, plaintiff's claim was 
rejected on February 1942, and yet the complaint in this case was filed on May 
22, 1946. The action, therefore, is barred by the limitation agreed upon by the 
parties.</p>
<p>Judgment is affirmed with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Reyes</em>, and <em>Torres, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Montemayor, J</em>., concurs in the result.</p>
<p>Moran, C.<em>J</em>.:</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Paras voted for affirmance. </p></div>
