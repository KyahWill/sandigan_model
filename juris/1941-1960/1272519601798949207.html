				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 15,1935, Matea Piconada, single, was&nbsp; delivered of a baby girl at the Maternity and Children's Hospital, City of&nbsp; Manila, Philippines.&nbsp; Thereupon, Matea told the hospital&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; that the&nbsp; child's name&nbsp; is Henrietta Piconada, and that her&nbsp; father&nbsp; is&nbsp; unknown, and&nbsp; it&nbsp; was so stated in the report of the hospital to the office of the local civil registrar, and in the corresponding entry in the records&nbsp; of the latter, as well as&nbsp; in the birth certificate (Exhibit A)&nbsp; of said child.&nbsp; Almost twenty&nbsp; (20)&nbsp; years thereafter,&nbsp; or in June 6; 1955, William H.&nbsp; Brown instituted&nbsp; the present case in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his petition he stated the foregoing facts and alleged that Henrietta Piconada is&nbsp; his daughter; that ever since she began attending school, she had been registered and known as&nbsp; Henrietta&nbsp; Brown;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; since early childhood she has been, and up&nbsp; to the. present&nbsp; she&nbsp; is, under his custody "for her education and support * * * with the knowledge and consent of her, mother aforementioned." His prayer is-<blockquote>&nbsp;"that an order be issued directing the Civil Registrar of the City of Manila, to correct name and fill the blanks&nbsp; appearing in the certificate of birth of Henrietta Piconada as unknown and change the nationality,&nbsp; as. follows: <blockquote><p>(1) 'Henrietta Piconada' to read as Henrietta Piconada Brown<br>(2) 'Nationality' from 'Filipino' to 'American'<br>(3) Under the column 'FATHER—PADRE', the following: 1935: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Pull name'—William H. Brown <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Residence'—1235 Azcarraga St., Manila<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Citizenship'—American<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Age last birthday—65<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Birthplace—Beecher City, Illinois, U.S.A.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Civil Status'—Widower: 'Religion'&nbsp; Roman Catholic<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Occupation'—Businessman.</p></blockquote><p>to conform with the provision of Article 412 of&nbsp; New Civil Code." Record on Appeal, pp.&nbsp; 3&nbsp; and 4.)</p></blockquote><p>An&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; was filed by the Solicitor&nbsp; General,&nbsp; on behalf of the Government, and, after appropriate proceedings,&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila rendered a decision granting said petition, except as to the correction prayed for relative to the nationality of&nbsp; Henrietta Piconada. The dispositive part of said decision reads&nbsp; as follows:</p><blockquote><p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the&nbsp; Civil Registrar of the City of Manila is ordered&nbsp; to add to the name of the Child Henrietta Piconada the surname 'Brown' and to&nbsp; fill up the blanks under the&nbsp; column 'father' with the data hereinabove stated." </p></blockquote><p>The Government has appealed&nbsp; from said decision, relying, mainly, upon the case of Ty&nbsp; Kong Tin <em>vs.</em> Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; (50 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 1078-1079), in which, referring to Article 412 of the Civil&nbsp; Code of the Philippines&nbsp; (cited in the petition&nbsp; of herein appellee), it was held:</p><blockquote><p>"This article provides that 'No&nbsp; entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected, without a judicial order.'&nbsp; The bone of contention was the extent or scope of the matters that may be changed or corrected as contemplated in said legal provision.&nbsp; After a mature deliberation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion was reached that what was contemplated therein are <em>mere corrections of mistakes that are clerical in&nbsp; nature</em> and not those which may affect the civil status&nbsp; or the nationality or citizenship of the persons involved.&nbsp; If the purpose of the petition is merely to correct a clerical&nbsp; error then the court&nbsp; may issue an order in&nbsp; order that the error&nbsp; or mistake may be&nbsp; corrected.&nbsp; If It refers to a substantial change, which affects the <em>status&nbsp; or citizenship</em> of a party, the&nbsp; matter&nbsp; should be threshed out in a&nbsp; proper action.depending upon the nature of the issue involved.&nbsp; * * * This opinion is predicated upon&nbsp; the theory that&nbsp; the&nbsp; procedure contemplated in article 412 is&nbsp; summary in&nbsp; nature&nbsp; which cannot cover cases involving.controversial issues."</p></blockquote><p>The appeal&nbsp; is well-taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; The very&nbsp; petition&nbsp; indicates that the entries in the office of the Local Civil Registrar were made in conformity with the&nbsp; data furnished by Matea Piconada&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; birth of&nbsp; her&nbsp; daughter,&nbsp; Henrietta Piconada.&nbsp; In fact, when Matea Piconada then advised the hospital&nbsp; authorities that. Henrietta 's father was unknown,&nbsp; she merely&nbsp; <em>complied</em>&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Article 280&nbsp; of our Civil Code&nbsp; reading:</p><blockquote><p>"When the father or the mother makes the recognition&nbsp; separately, he or she shall&nbsp; not reveal&nbsp; the name of&nbsp; the person with whom he or she had the child; neither shall he or she state any circumstance whereby the other parent may be identified."</p></blockquote><p>Then again, the&nbsp; allegations of the petition suggest that petitioner&nbsp; had acknowledged&nbsp; Henrietta as his natural child<em> by acts&nbsp; subsequent to her birth</em>, more&nbsp; particularly since her schooling&nbsp; had began.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, a decision directing the change or&nbsp; correction of the official entries relative to Henrietta's <em>birth</em>, as prayed for in the petition,&nbsp; would cause the records&nbsp; of the local Civil Registrar&nbsp; to state&nbsp; as&nbsp; a fact something which was hot so <em>at the time of the event referred to in said entries</em>.&nbsp; What is more, this retrospective operation sought by herein petitioner would, in effect, sanction the recognition of a.minor, made otherwise&nbsp; than "in a record&nbsp; of birth or in a will", without the&nbsp; previous judicial&nbsp; approval&nbsp; specifically required&nbsp; therefor&nbsp; by&nbsp; law. (Article 281, Civil Code of the Philippines.)</p><p>Considering, however, that petitioner might have meant to secure, through this case, said judicial&nbsp; approval to the recognition of Henrietta Piconada, let the records hereof be&nbsp; remanded to the&nbsp; lower court,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; corresponding amendments to the pleadings—if petitioner wishes to&nbsp; do so,&nbsp; within such reasonable time as said court shall fix, and it is his intention to&nbsp; acknowledge&nbsp; Henrietta Piconada as his natural&nbsp; child,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; approval of the court—and, thereafter, for such further proceedings as the nature of the case may then demand or justify.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should petitioner, however, fail or refuse to make said amendments,&nbsp; this case should be dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without special pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</em>,&nbsp; and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
