				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by way of certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals reversing&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental in civil case No.&nbsp; 1161,&nbsp; entitled The&nbsp; Inter provincial Autobus&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc., ,plaintiff&nbsp; <i>versus</i> Eibiano L.&nbsp; Meer as Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue, defendant and absolving the defendant-appellant therein from&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.<br><br>Plaintiff is a common carrier engaged in transporting passenger and freight by means of TPU buses in Misamis Occidental and Northern Zamboanga.&nbsp; Sometime in the year 1941&nbsp; the provincial revenue agent for Misamis Occidental&nbsp; examined the stubs of the freight receipts that had been issued by the plaintiff.&nbsp; He found&nbsp; that the&nbsp; stubs of the receipts issued&nbsp; during&nbsp; the years&nbsp; 1938 to 1938 were not preserved; but those for the years 1939 to&nbsp; 1940 were available.&nbsp; By referring, however,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; conductors' daily reports for 1936 to 1938, he&nbsp; was able to ascertain the number of receipts for those years and these, together with those for 1939 to&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp; gave&nbsp; a total during the 5-year period from 1936&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1940, of&nbsp; 194,406&nbsp; freight&nbsp; receipts issued.&nbsp; Both the said daily reports of plaintiff's conductors and the available stubs did.not&nbsp; state the value of the goods transported thereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; to&nbsp; sections 121&nbsp; and&nbsp; 127&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Documentary&nbsp; Stamp Tax Regulations of the Department of Finance promulgated on September 16, 1924, he assumed that the value of the goods covered by&nbsp; each&nbsp; of the&nbsp; above-mentioned freight&nbsp; receipts amounted to more&nbsp; than. P5,&nbsp; and assessed a documentary stamp tax of P0.04 on each of the 194,406&nbsp; receipts.&nbsp; The tax thus assessed amounted to P7,776.24, which was collected&nbsp; from the&nbsp; deposit of the&nbsp; plaintiff in the Misamis Occidental branch of the Philippine National Bank.&nbsp; Plaintiff demanded the refund&nbsp; of the amount, and upon refusal of the defendant, plaintiff filed the action.&nbsp; The Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Misamis&nbsp; Occidental having&nbsp; rendered judgment.in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff, the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; This court&nbsp; reversed the decision appealed from&nbsp; and absolved the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; from the complaint,&nbsp; Hence, this appeal.<br><br>In this Court petitioner-appellant presents the following propositions: (1) that the.judgment of the Court of Appeals is&nbsp; null and void, because it had no&nbsp; jurisdiction of the case, which&nbsp; involves" the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of an assessment; (2) that the decision of the Court of Appeals is erroneous because freight receipts are not bills of lading within the meaning of Section 1449, sub-paragraph (<i>r</i>), of the Revised Administrative Code of&nbsp; 1917,&nbsp; and because the provision of section 121 of&nbsp; the Revised Documentary Stamp Tax Regulations, to the effect that if the bill of lading fails to state the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the goods&nbsp; shipped, it must be held that the tax is due, is illegal; (3) that the documentary stamp tax on freight receipts should be paid by the shipper of the merchandise, not by the carrier; and&nbsp; (4) that the collection of the tax is illegal because&nbsp; it was done beyond the period of limitation fixed by law for its. collection.<br><br>The first proposition,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Court of Appeals&nbsp; had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from the.&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance, is&nbsp; well founded.&nbsp; Both the Constitution and the Judiciary&nbsp; Act of&nbsp; 1948&nbsp; grant to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court exclusive Appellate&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over all&nbsp; cases involving the legality&nbsp; of. any tax, assessment, or toll,&nbsp; or&nbsp; any penalty in relation&nbsp; thereto. The Court of Appeals in turn has no jurisdiction.over cases the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of which is&nbsp; granted the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; As tn% legality or&nbsp; validity of the tax is involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; appeal the Supreme Court is&nbsp; the one that had jurisdiction thereof and the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals had none.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; decision of the Court of Appeals&nbsp; was, therefore, null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void.<br><br>But the claim that&nbsp; freight tickets&nbsp; of bus companies are not "bills of lading or receipts"&nbsp; within the meaning of the Documentary Stamp&nbsp; Tax Law is without&nbsp; merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bills of lading, in modern jurisprudence,&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; those issued by masters&nbsp; of vessels alone; they now comprehend&nbsp; all forms of transportation,&nbsp; whether by sea or land, and includes bus receipts&nbsp; for cargo transported.<br><blockquote>"The term 'bill of lading is frequently&nbsp; defined, especially by the older authorities, as a writing signed by the master of a vessel acknowledging the receipt of goods&nbsp; on board&nbsp; to. be transported&nbsp; to a certain part and&nbsp; there delivered&nbsp; to a&nbsp; designated&nbsp; person or on his order.&nbsp; <i>This definition was formulated&nbsp; at a&nbsp; time when&nbsp; goods were principally transported&nbsp; by sea and, while adequate&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; conditions existing at that early&nbsp; day, is&nbsp; too narrow to suit present conditions.</i>&nbsp; As&nbsp; comprehending&nbsp; all methods of transportation, a bill of lading may&nbsp; be. defined as a&nbsp; written&nbsp; acknowledgment of the receipt of goods&nbsp; and . an agreement to&nbsp; transport and&nbsp; to deliver them at a specified place&nbsp; to a person named&nbsp; or on his order.&nbsp; Such instruments are sometimes called&nbsp; 'shipping receipts,' 'forwarders' receipts' and 'receipts for transportation.' <i>The designation, however, is not material, and neither is the form of the instrument. If it contains an acknowledgment by the carrier of the receipt of goods for transportation, it is, in legal&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; a bill of lading."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; (9&nbsp; Am. Jur. 662, Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</blockquote>Section&nbsp; 227&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code imposes&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; on receipts for&nbsp; goods,or&nbsp; effects&nbsp; shipped from one port <i>or&nbsp; place</i> to another port&nbsp; or place&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp;&nbsp; The use&nbsp; of the&nbsp; word place&nbsp; after port&nbsp; and of the word&nbsp; "receipt"&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; the receipts for&nbsp; goods shipped on&nbsp; land are included.<br><br>The. next claim involves the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; Department of Finance&nbsp; Regulation&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 26&nbsp; dated&nbsp; September 16;&nbsp; 1924, which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 121. <i>Basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; and affixture&nbsp; of&nbsp; stamps.</i>—Bills of lading are exempt&nbsp; from the documentary stamp tax imposed by paragraphs (<i>q</i>),and (<i>r</i>) of section 1449 of the Administrative Code when the value of the goods shipped is P5&nbsp; or&nbsp; less. Unless the bill&nbsp; of lading states that the goods are&nbsp; worth P5 or less,&nbsp; it must be held that&nbsp; the tax is due,&nbsp; and&nbsp; internal revenue officers will see to it that the tax is paid in P11 cases where the bill&nbsp; of lading&nbsp; doea not state that the shipment is worth P5 or less."<br><br>"Sec. 127. 'Chits,' memorandum slips, and&nbsp; other papers not in the usual commercial form of bills of lading, when used by common carriers in the&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; merchandise or goods for the collection&nbsp; of fees .therefor&nbsp; are' considered&nbsp; as bills of lading,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinal thereof issued or used should&nbsp; bear&nbsp; the documentary stamp as provided by paragraphs (<i>q</i>)' and (<i>r</i>) of section&nbsp; 1449 of the Administrative Code."<br></blockquote>The above regulations were promulgated under the&nbsp; authority of section 79 (B) of the Administrative&nbsp; Code, (originally section 2&nbsp; of Act 2803),&nbsp; which&nbsp; expressly provides:<br><blockquote> "The Department Head shall have&nbsp; power to promulgate, whenever he may see fit to do&nbsp; so,&nbsp; all rules, regulations,&nbsp; orders,&nbsp; circulars, memorandums, and other instructions, not contrary to law, necessary . to regulate the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; working&nbsp; and&nbsp; harmonious&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; efficient administration of each and' all&nbsp; of the offices&nbsp; and dependencies of , his Department, and for the strict enforcement and proper execution of the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to&nbsp; matters under the&nbsp; jurisdiction of .said Department;&nbsp; but none&nbsp; of said rules or , orders shall&nbsp; prescribe penalties for&nbsp; the&nbsp; violation thereof, except&nbsp; as&nbsp; expressly authorized by law.* * *" </blockquote>Did the Secretary of&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; infringe&nbsp; or&nbsp; violate any right of the taxpayer when he&nbsp; directed that tfre tax is to be collected in all cases where the bill of lading or receipt does not state that the shipment&nbsp; is worth ?5 or less, or, m the language of the petitioner-appellant, when he (Secretary) created&nbsp; a presumption of liability to&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax if the receipt, fails to state.such value?&nbsp; It can not be denied that the regulation is merely a directive to the tax officers; it does not purport to change or&nbsp; modify the law; it does not&nbsp; create&nbsp; a&nbsp; liability&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; stamp&nbsp; tax when&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the goods&nbsp; does not appear on&nbsp; the face of the receipt. The practical usefulness of the directive becomes evident when account is&nbsp; taken of the&nbsp; fact that tax officers are in no position to witness the issuance of&nbsp; receipts and&nbsp; check the value of the&nbsp; goods for which&nbsp; they are&nbsp; issued.&nbsp; If tax officers were to assess or collect the tax&nbsp; only&nbsp; when they find&nbsp; that the value of the goods covered by the&nbsp; receipts is more than five pesos, the&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; and collection of the tax would&nbsp; be&nbsp; well-nigh impossible, as it is impossible for tax collectors to determine from the receipts alone, if they do not contain the value of the goods, whether the&nbsp; goods receipted for exceed P5, or not. The regulation impliedly required the statement of the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of the goods in the receipts; so that&nbsp; the collection .of the&nbsp; tax can be enforced. This the petitioner-appellant failed to do and he now claims the unreasonableness of the provision as, a basis for his exemption.&nbsp; We find that the regulation is not only useful, practical and necessary for the enforcement of the law on the tax on bills of lading and receipts, but&nbsp; also&nbsp; reasonable in its provisions.<br><br>The&nbsp; regulation&nbsp; above quoted&nbsp; falls&nbsp; within the&nbsp; scope of the administrative power&nbsp; of the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance, as authorized in Section 79 (B) of the Revised Administrative Code, because it is essential to the strict enforcement&nbsp; and proper execution of the law which it seeks to implement. Said regulations&nbsp; have the force and effect&nbsp; of law.<br><blockquote>"In the very nature of things in&nbsp; many cases it becomes impracticable for the legislative department of the Government to provide general&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; for tlic various, and varying details'.for the management&nbsp; of a&nbsp; particular&nbsp; department of the&nbsp; Government.&nbsp; It therefore becomes .convenient for the legislative department, of the Government,&nbsp; by Law, in a&nbsp; most general way,&nbsp; to provide for the conduct,&nbsp; control and&nbsp; management of the work of the particular department&nbsp; of the Government;&nbsp; to authorize certain&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; in charge of the management, control, and direction&nbsp; of the particular department, to adopt certain&nbsp; rules and&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; providing&nbsp; for the detail&nbsp; of the management&nbsp; and control&nbsp; of such&nbsp; department. Such&nbsp; regulations have uniformly been held to have the force&nbsp; of law, whenever they are found&nbsp; to be in consonance&nbsp; and&nbsp; in harmony with&nbsp; the general&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; and&nbsp; objects&nbsp; of ' the&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many&nbsp; illustrations&nbsp; might he&nbsp; given.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the Civil&nbsp; Service Board is given authority to examine&nbsp; applicants' for various&nbsp; positions within the Government service.&nbsp; The law generally provides&nbsp; the conditions in a&nbsp; most general&nbsp; way,&nbsp; authorizing the. chief of&nbsp; such Bureau&nbsp; to provide rules and regulations for the management of the conduct of examinations, etc.&nbsp; The law&nbsp; provides that the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs shall&nbsp; examine persons who&nbsp; become applicants to&nbsp; act&nbsp; as&nbsp; captains of ships&nbsp; for&nbsp; the coast wise trade, providing at the" same time&nbsp; that the Collector of Customs shall establish&nbsp; rules and regulations&nbsp; for such&nbsp; examinations.&nbsp; Such regulations, once&nbsp; established&nbsp; and&nbsp; found to be in&nbsp; conformity with&nbsp; the general purposes of the law,&nbsp; are&nbsp; just as binding upon all of the parties, as if the regulations had been written in the original law itself.&nbsp; (United States&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Grimaud, 22 U. S., 506;&nbsp; Williamson <i>vs.</i> United&nbsp; States, 207 U.&nbsp; S., 425;&nbsp; United States <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; United&nbsp; Verde Copper&nbsp; Co., 196&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S.,&nbsp; 207.)"&nbsp; (United States <i>vs.</i> Tupasi Molina, 29 Phil, 119, 125.)</blockquote>Another reason for&nbsp; sustaining&nbsp; the validity of the regulation may be found in the principle&nbsp; of legislative approval by re-enactment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulations were approved on September&nbsp;&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1924.&nbsp; When&nbsp; the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code was approved on February 18, 1939,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same provisions&nbsp; on&nbsp; stamp tax, bills&nbsp; of lading and&nbsp; receipts&nbsp; were reenacted.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a&nbsp; presumption that the Legislature reenacted the law on&nbsp; the tax with&nbsp; full knowledge of the contents of the&nbsp; regulations then in force regarding bills of lading and receipts, and that it approved or&nbsp; confirmed them because they&nbsp; carry out&nbsp; the legislative purpose.<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; of course, the rule does not operate to freeze a meaning which is&nbsp; in evident conflict with the clearly expressed legislative intent.

Ct.&nbsp; 444; 84 L.&nbsp; Ed. 604 A.L.R.,&nbsp; 1368.&nbsp; But&nbsp; where a statute&nbsp; is susceptible of the meaning placed upon it by Treasury ruling and Congress thereafter reenacts the provision ¦without substantial change,&nbsp; such action is to some extent confirmatory that the ruling carries out the congressional purpose."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Mead&nbsp; Corporation vs. Commissioner&nbsp; of Internal Revenue, 116 F [2d] 187, p. 194)<br><br>"The&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; an&nbsp; identical Treasury Regulation with regard&nbsp; to computation of stamp tax on conveyances had been in effect during several re-enactments&nbsp; of the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; was pursuasive evidence&nbsp; of congressional approval thereof.&nbsp; * *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Railroad Federal&nbsp; Sav. and Loan Ass'n. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> United States, 135 F [2d], p. 290)<br><br>"The law, I&nbsp; believe, is now settled that substantial re-enactment of legislation which has&nbsp; been construed by Treasury Regulations&nbsp; is at least strong evidence of legislative approval of such construction. It is presumed that Congress knew of&nbsp; the existing administrative interpretations of the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Cargill&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> United States, 46 F. Supp. 712, 716.)<br><br>"Regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Internal, Revenue . under authority of the Revenue&nbsp; Act of&nbsp; 1928 acquired the effect&nbsp; of law by substantial re-enactment of provision of the 1928 Act in the 1932 Revenue Act.&nbsp; * * *."&nbsp; (S. Slater &amp; Sons, Inc., <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; White, etc., 33&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Supp.&nbsp; 329, 330.)</blockquote>It is&nbsp; to&nbsp; be noted that&nbsp; the regulation&nbsp; does not purport to modify&nbsp; or change&nbsp; the&nbsp; law in&nbsp; the sense&nbsp; that&nbsp; when the value of the merchandise&nbsp; (for which the receipt&nbsp; is issued) does not appear thereon the tax&nbsp; shall always be impose. Such a meaning would&nbsp; have the&nbsp; effect of changing the law; the regulation should not be understood in this illegal or authorized sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulation should be considered merely as a directive to internal&nbsp; revenue officers to assess the tax and&nbsp; collect the same.&nbsp; As already&nbsp; adverted to,&nbsp; it only creates a presumption of the&nbsp; liability of the taxpayer, which&nbsp; presumption,&nbsp; however, is&nbsp; not conclusive&nbsp; upon the taxpayer&nbsp; who&nbsp; can adduce&nbsp; evidence that the tax&nbsp; is&nbsp; not collectible because&nbsp; the value of the merchandise&nbsp; concerned does not exceed the&nbsp; amount of P5.&nbsp; It was in&nbsp; pursuance of this interpretation of the regulation&nbsp; that the trial court permitted evidence to be introduced to&nbsp; show that the petitioner-appellant is not subject to&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax on the receipts. Claim is made that the evidence submitted by the petitioner-appellant proved that the&nbsp; freight&nbsp; receipts&nbsp; covered shipment of merchandise worth not more&nbsp; than P5.&nbsp; It is argued in support of this claim&nbsp; that the said freight&nbsp; receipts were issued to people carrying agricultural produce from one place to, another,&nbsp; perhaps from their&nbsp; farms to the towns or to their residences.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals' decision,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which the claim&nbsp; is made,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; state that said receipts&nbsp; were actually issued for shipments the value of which was not more than P5&nbsp; each.&nbsp; The decision of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals in fact is that the petitioner- appellant "merely tried to establish through his witnesses", the&nbsp; facts above mentioned,&nbsp; which is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; finding that' the receipts covered merchandise more than P5&nbsp; in value. Upon&nbsp; consideration of the claim&nbsp; and the testimonies with which it is supported, we&nbsp; are unable&nbsp; to&nbsp; agree with said contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a common knowledge that when barrio residents or those living in&nbsp; farms go to&nbsp; town and bring along&nbsp; with&nbsp; them their daily needs on their daily "produce, they&nbsp; ordinarily do not secure receipts for these&nbsp; baggages or cargoes but keep these under their seats.&nbsp; The common , practice&nbsp; is for a passenger carrying cargoes&nbsp; of small value not to secure receipts therefor; for convenience and economy he keeps them under his seat in the bus so as to make&nbsp; them easily accessible when he goes down, and at the same time save the few centavos that the&nbsp; issuance of the receipt&nbsp; entails.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; receipts for valuable cargo&nbsp; are demanded, to&nbsp; insure against their loss. Our conclusion is&nbsp; that the&nbsp; receipts must have been issued for&nbsp; shipments&nbsp; or&nbsp; merchandise in excess of P5&nbsp; in value. The evidence submitted notwithstanding, the fact that it has not been contradicted fails to prove to&nbsp; our satisfaction that the merchandise for which receipts were issued were actually worth P5 or less.&nbsp; Furthermore,1 the rule is that in actions for the recovery of&nbsp; taxes assessed and&nbsp; collected, the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the assessment is illegal.<br><blockquote>"All presumptions&nbsp; are in favor of the correctness of tax assessments. The&nbsp; good faith of tax assessors and the validity of their actions are presumed. They will be presumed to have&nbsp; taken into consideration all the facts to which their attention was called.&nbsp;&nbsp; No presumption can be indulged that all of the public officials of the state in&nbsp; the various counties who have to&nbsp; do 'with the assessment of .property for taxation will knowingly violate the duties imposed upon them by law."<br><br>"As a&nbsp; logical outgrowth of&nbsp; the&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; in favor of the validity&nbsp; of assessments, when&nbsp; such assessments&nbsp; are&nbsp; assailed, the burden of proof is upon the complaining' party.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is incumbent upon the property owner clearly to&nbsp; show that the assessment&nbsp; was erroneous, in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; relieve&nbsp; himself from it."&nbsp; (51 Am.&nbsp; Jur. pp. 620-621.)<br><br>"The burden is on him who seeks the recovery of a tax already paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; those facts which show its invalidity.'

But the&nbsp; presumption is that&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; paid are rightly collected&nbsp; upon&nbsp; assessments correctly made by the commissioner,&nbsp; and in a suit to recover them the burden rests upon&nbsp; the taxpayer to prove all&nbsp; the facts necessary to establish the illegality of the&nbsp; collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; United States vs. Anderson, supra.&nbsp; See&nbsp; United States vs. Rindskopt, 100 U.&nbsp; S. 419, 26&nbsp; L.&nbsp; ed.,&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Niles Bement Pond Co.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> United States, 74 L. ed., 901,&nbsp; 904.)</blockquote>The rule above-mentioned has not&nbsp; been complied with and the action for recovery must be denied.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also contended&nbsp; that the tax&nbsp; should be collected from the <i>holder </i> of the receipt, and not from the one who . collected it, which is the transportation company. There is no&nbsp; merit&nbsp; in this&nbsp; contention because the&nbsp; law expressly provides that the tax should be paid by the one "<i>making</i>, signing, <i> issuing,</i> accepting,&nbsp; or&nbsp; transferring&nbsp; the&nbsp; same." (Section 1449, Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code of 1917).&nbsp; The receipts were made, and issued by the transportation&nbsp; company; it is therefore&nbsp; liable for the&nbsp; payment of the tax thereon.<br><br>The last contention of the petitioner-appellant&nbsp; is that the tax could no&nbsp; longer be collectible because the same was assessed and collected after&nbsp; seven years, the tax&nbsp; having been due in&nbsp; 1936-1938&nbsp; and the assessment having&nbsp; been made in the year. 1947.&nbsp; The period&nbsp; within which a tax may be&nbsp; assessed is ten years after the discovery of the falsity, fraud&nbsp; or&nbsp; omission&nbsp; (section 332, paragraph&nbsp; (<i>a</i>), National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner-appellant cites, in support of his contention, paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the same action.&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph refers to the&nbsp; collection of the tax <i>by distraint or by levy or by a proceeding in court,</i> and the period prescribed&nbsp; is within five years after the assessment of the tax.<br><br>Was the levy justified?&nbsp; The discovery, according to the pleadings, took place in the year&nbsp; 1941&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; warrant of&nbsp; distraint&nbsp; or levy was&nbsp; issued on September&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1946 (paragraphs 3 and.4 of the complaint).&nbsp; The&nbsp; pleadings do not show, neither&nbsp; does&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence, the specific date of the assessment.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; only&nbsp; alleged in the complaint that the examination of the books took place&nbsp; in the year 1941. In order to sustain the claim, of&nbsp; the invalidity of the levy, it is necessary for the&nbsp; plaintiff to allege and prove that the levy took place after five years from the date of the assessments.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the date, of the assessment has not been proved.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a material matter that the petitioner- appellant should have proved to assail the levy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of his failure to do so the exemption&nbsp; from levy may not be invoked by&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Besides, the question was not raised in the pleadings as a ground to&nbsp; void the collection of the amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court cannot&nbsp; assume&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; levy&nbsp; and distraint took place beyond the period prescribed by law. This conclusion is supported by the&nbsp; presumption of the regularity of the acts of public officers.&nbsp; In any event the collection was&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1947, within ten years after the discovery in&nbsp; 1941,&nbsp; and the liability of&nbsp; petitioner-appellant is not thereby&nbsp; affected.<br><br>For&nbsp; the foregoing considerations, the&nbsp; judgment of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; is&nbsp; declared void and that of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance, reversed and the&nbsp; respondent-appellee absolved from the complaint.&nbsp; With costs against the petitioner-appellant.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
