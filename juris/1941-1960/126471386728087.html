				<H3>THE PEOPLE  OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.  EUSEBIO MOLIJON,  ET  AL.,  DEFENDANTS, EUSEBIO MOLIJON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal by Eusebio Molijon from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, finding him and his co-accused Gervasio Flores,   Corhelio Hernando and Marcelo  Hernando, guilty of the crime of attempted robbery with multiple murder for the killing of Nicanor Cantay, his wife and five children, and sentencing him to death as instigator of the crime, and jointly with his three  co-accused to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000.   His co-accused did not appeal from the judgment, which sentenced them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> only.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted at his trial proves the following: On or about July 13,  1950, Nicanor Cantay, a farmer, his wife Lucia  Frias, and  their  five  children, Sabino, 9 years, Paulino, 8 years, Jose, 4  years, Timoteo,  3 years, and Juanito,  1 1/2  years,  lived in their house in  barrio Lugo,  municipality  of Borbon,   province  of Cebu.  At  around 7:00 o'clock in the morning of that day, which was Wednesday, Nicanor's sister, Epifania, went to their house  to help her sister-in-law in her farm work.   As Epifania  approached  the house, she  called  for  her sister-in-law,  but nobody answered, so she thought that they had  already gone to work.  But upon approaching the house and  reaching the stairs,  she was surprised to find blood stains around.  As she went inside, she also found blood stains from the door to the kitchen, and upon going in further, she found all the  members of the family  lying on the floor, all smeared  with blood, with wounds in their persons.   Nicanor Cantay,  his  wife and three  of  the boys were  already  dead  and only two were still alive.  So she headed back home and reported the matter to her father, Anastacio Cantay.   Anastacio and some of the  relatives,  among whom was  Celedonio Hortezano, immediately proceeded to the house of Nicanor Cantay.  The two boys who were still alive were brought by Hortezano to  Cebu City for treatment, but one of them died before reaching the hospital.  The other also died in Cebu City.</p>
<p>When the authorities came to the house of the unfortunate family, they began to investigate who the probable authors of the horrible crime could have been.  Anastacio Cantay, father of the deceased Nicanor Cantay, promptly disclosed that the  Sunday before, some four days before the incident,  he witnessed an altercation between the deceased and  appellant Molijon.  He  stated that on  that occasion and  in the  special market place  of  Lugo,  Nicanor Cantay demanded from Molijon the payment of the latter's debt  of P4  to him; that Molijon offered to pay the debt with corn, but Nicanor refused; and that upon Nicanor's refusal, Molijon said to  Nicanor, "Wait for  me till next Wednesday."</p>
<p>Celedonio Hortezano also told the authorities that early at dawn on that Wednesday, he had gone to a place where he had tied his carabao; that just as he was untying the rope of the animal, four persons  suddenly passed  by in a hurry; and that  one  of them he recognized as appellant Molijon, another, as Gervasio Flores,  and the two others, as Marcelo Hernando and Cornelio Hernando.   Flores, Marcelo Hernando and Cornelio Hernando were living at about one-half kilometer  away from the house of Nicanor Cantay, while Molijon lived  8 kilometers  away.</p>
<p>Suspicions  having been directed against Molijon, steps were taken to locate him.  So some soldiers went to his house. But upon  reaching it, his  wife informed the soldiers that Molijon had gone away four days before.  Upon learning that Molijon had  a sister in Udlot, a barrio of Bogo, Cpl.  Capaning of  the Philippine  Constabulary was sent there  on July 19, 1950.  Capaning was  not able to reach Molijon there as the latter's sister said that Molijon  had gone to Cantubaon, where Molijon's mother was living.  But as Capaning remembered that Molijon's wife had  told  that she  had  a relative  in barrio,  Maitom Bogo, they went to said barrio.  There they met the barrio lieutenant, who, upon  inquiry, informed  them that a few days before a person was hired by Nicolas Catana to  clean his farm.   They went to  the house of Catana and  there found Molijon  working.   At that time,  he was  wearing a reddish  undershirt, a blue deniin pant and a buri hat. When asked if he had clothes other than those he wore, he answered that he had some in the house of one  Simeona Catadhan  where he  slept  the night before.  There  Molijon produced from a corner of the house a bundle  of clothing.   Upon being opened it was found to  contain a pair of pants, Exhibit C, and a shirt, Exhibit D.  The said clothes had  stains, which Cpl. Capaning suspected to be human blood.   From this place Molijon was brought to the Constabulary  headquarters and there subjected to examination by a certain Sergeant Ceferino Cuevas.   Molijon admitted that he  had participated in the commission of the  murders of Nicanor Cantay,  his wife and children,  and disclosed that his companions  were  Gervasio  Flores and two others whom he  did  not know.</p>
<p>Thereupon Cuevas reported the  matter  to his Commanding Officer, who cause Flores to be apprehended.  Flores was  arrested   that  same  day,  July  20,  1950.  Flores also  admitted participation in the  crime and disclosed that the two other  companions of theirs  were Cornelio  Hernando and Marcelo Hernando.   So the arrest of the other two was also ordered.  The statements of all the  four  accused, Molijon, Flores, Cornelio  Hernando and  Marcelo Hernando, were taken  down in  writing on July 21.  That of Molijon was introduced  as Exhibit A, translation is Exhibit A-l.</p>
<p>In his confession, Molijon stated he had used a hunting knife, which he threw away after the commission of the crime.   He said that he remembered the place where it was  thrown away, and so two  soldiers accompanied him there to and they were able to find the hunting knife, which was presented as Exhibit G.  This  knife was identified during the trial as a bolo belonging  to the deceased.</p>
<p>In his confession, Exhibit A, Molijon further states that their intention in killing  Nicanor Cantay and his family was to  rob him of his money; that they had  agreed to commit  the robbery at about  7:00 o'clock in the  evening of July  12, but that they went to Cantay's place at early dawn of July 18,  1950; that upon reaching  the house of Cantay, he and his companions promptly went up and then inside, and immediately started stabbing all the occupants, who were then asleep; that he himself stabbed the wife of Nicanor Cantay with the hunting knife which he later threw away as they ran" away from the place; and that after  they had finished hacking  ail the members of  the family inside the house, they were suddenly seized with a terrible  fright and ran away, without carrying out their original intent of robbing Cantay.</p>
<p>At the  time of the trial, Molijon denied  having been indebted to Nicahor Cantay, or that he had any altercation with him about  the  said indebtedness.   He  also denied that he  had ever confessed participation in  the crime to the policeman  who had investigated him, and explained that he  gave the answers contained in Exhibit A  because he was  maltreated and boxed  at the stomach, and threatened to  be beaten with a  piece of wood, for which reason he was  forced to  tell lies.  But  when, questioned by  the presiding  judge, Molijon  admitted  having  gone to  the house of the deceased on the night in question, but shifted the blame to Flores, stating that  it  was Flores who first entered  the house  and after  passing the door took  the bolo of  the deceased from a place where it  was hanging in the wall; that  once inside Flores hacked  the  wife of Cantay with the said bolo; that the house was lighted with a kerosene lamp at that time, so he could see Nicanor Cantay with his wife and children; that when they were  hacked, Cantay and the members of his family were asleep  and so they were not able  to  defend themselves; that when Flores tried  to  attack  the wife, he  (Molijon)  tried  to  block him, but was pushed away by his companions and he fell down near Cantay's wife; and that thereafter,  he stood up and jumped out through the door and ran away,  while Flores and his companions followed him.</p>
<p>After disclosing the above facts and upon being further questioned by his counsel, he again explained that he made the declarations  in his  confession because he was being maltreated; but  upon being asked by the judge, again,  he again admitted having  accompanied Flores and  his companions because  he feared they might kill him;  and that: it was Flores and his companions who  compelled  him to go with them to  rob the deceased Nicanor Cantay.</p>
<p>It is  also important  to  note  the the  clothes,  Exhibits C and D, were admitted by Molijon to be his own clothing on the morning  of the  incident in question.  These were  subjected  to a scientific examination by  a chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation, and the stains contained therein were  found to be human blood.</p>
<p>The trial court found the accused guilty of the  offense charged.   It  also  found that  appellant  Molijon  was  the instigator of  the crime,  and that the crime is  attended by the aggravating  circumstances of nighttime,  dwelling  of  the offended  party and treachery, because the  deceased were killed while they were asleep. Counsel <em>de oficio</em> for the appellant states in his brief that, after a conscientious study of the case, he is led to the belief that the conclusions of the trial court are correct and that all that he, as an officer of the  court, could in conscience do is to ask mercy from this court.   The Solicitor  General, in view of this statement of counsel for the appellant, has made no analysis  of  the evidence submitted,  or  of  the facts  proved therefrom, and his brief is limited to asking that the sentence of death be affirmed in view of the aggravating circumstances attending the  commission of the  crime.  We  desire to invite attention to the fact that  the conformity of  counsel  for the appellant  with the decision  of the trial judge does no relieve the Solicitor  General from the obligation of  setting forth the facts proved, and upon  which he bases  his  recommendations.  An  appeal  in criminal cases throws the whole case open to review, whether  errors of fact are raised in the appeal or not.   (Rule 120, section 11; Lontac <em>vs.</em> People,  74  Phil.,  513.)   Especially is this true in  capital cases, for the reason that they are automatically transmitted to this court for review, without need of appeal  by the accused.  Under the old procedure, from which the nature of appeal in capital cases is derived, the decisions  of the trial  judge is merely  a  sort  of recommendation and does not relieve the court from the obligation of  reviewing the  evidence to  find out if the capital punishment recommended  is or is  not to be imposed. (Section 50, Off.  Gaz., No. 58; U,  S.<em> vs.</em> Kepner, 1 Phil., 397; U.  S.<em> vs.</em> Laguna, 17 Phil, 532; Rule  118, sectipn 9, Rules of Court.)   Consequent with this  duty  of the court to review  the evidence, the duty  is also  imposed upon the Solicitor General in capital  cases to submit  his  analysis i of the facts as supported by the evidence,  so we may be enlightened thereon and be helped  in the performance of our duty.   However,  the absence  of  any  assignment of error  in appellant's brief or of any similar brief by the Solicitor General has not deterred us from going over the evidence, or analyzing the facts proved.  We have carefully examined the confessions of  the  appellant  and the testimonies of the witnesses and the documentary evidence presented  which fully corroborate said confessions, and we find these to support the findings of the trial court.</p>
<p>We find that the guilt of the appellant Eusebio Molijon, as  a  co-principal in the commission of the crime of attempted  robbery with multiple murder, has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.   While we believe that there is no sufficient evidence to support the finding  of the trial court  that he was the instigator  of the  crime,  we  are satisfied that he voluntarily participated in  its commission, and was not, as he claims  at the trial, forced to participate therein as  an unwilling participant  compelled by fear of his co-conspirators.  We do  not agree with  the trial court that evident premeditation was proved beyond reasonable doubt.  But treachery was conclusively shown, because opportunity was taken of the  fact that the victims were fast asleep  when  they were mercilessly stabbed to death,  and this qualifies  the crime  as murder, instead of evident premeditation.  And as  to aggravating  circumstances two have attended the commission  of the crime, namely, nighttime,  which  was taken advantage  of, and dwelling.  Even if nighttime be considered included in that of treachery, one aggravating circumstance  would still be present and this is sufficient to authorize the imposition of the maximum of the penalty prescribed by law  for  the offense, which is  death.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant invokes mercy for  the  appellant. No reason has, however, been adduced for the appeal for mercy.  Anyway, petition for mercy can not be  addressed to us.   Our duty and our  power is to enforce the  law as  justice  demands.  Petitions  for  mercy  are  to  be addressed to the President of the Philippines, and not to this court.</p>
<p>With the two aggravating circumstances  found  to have attended the commission of the crime, we have sufficient grounds and reasons for confirming the capital punishment imposed  upon  the  appellant.  We  also feel  justified  in doing so,  in view of the brazen cruelty and depravity of the appellant  manifested  by the unnecessary murder of innocent and  defenseless children.   Justice would  be a mockery were we to allow the appellant a reduction of the penalty meted out to him by the trial court.</p>
<p>The  judgment  of  the court below  with respect to  appellant Eusebio Molijon is hereby affirmed,  with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</em>, and<em> Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
