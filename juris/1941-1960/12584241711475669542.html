				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal,&nbsp; taken by&nbsp; defendant Joseph Arcache, from&nbsp; a decision of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal. The facts are:<br><br>On&nbsp; July 1,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; plaintiff, Ayala y&nbsp; Compañia,&nbsp; a commercial partnership&nbsp; organized in conformity&nbsp; with the Philippine laws, and defendant Joseph Arcache, executed the deed Exhibit B, whereby&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; agreed to sell to defendant, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; agreed to&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; from the former, four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; lots&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in the municipality of Makati, Province of Rizal,&nbsp; more particularly described in Annexes A-l to A-4 of said document, at the&nbsp; rate of P6 per square meter, or the aggregate sum of P447,972, payable as follows: P100,000 by promissory note (Exhibit C), executed and delivered simultaneously with said Exhibit B, and payable on or before August 9,&nbsp; 1948, and the balance of P347,972 in annual installments of P100,000 each,&nbsp; payable&nbsp; on August 9 of the&nbsp; subsequent years, except the last installment, which&nbsp; shall be P47.972,&nbsp; with interest, at the rate&nbsp; of 6 per cent&nbsp; per annum on the&nbsp; outstanding balances.&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; B provided, also, among&nbsp; other things that,&nbsp; upon payment of the first annual installment, with interests on the outstanding balances, title to the property would be transferred to the defendant, who, simultaneously, would&nbsp; secure&nbsp; and&nbsp; guarantee the payment of the&nbsp; balance due and the interests thereon with a first mortgage on said lots and the improvements thereon; that defendant could not sell or dispose of any portion thereof without the plaintiff's written consent,, which would, not be withheld upon&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; an additional&nbsp; sum of P6.00&nbsp; per square metar sought to be released; that defendant would expedite to the&nbsp; best&nbsp; of his ability, the paving&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Buendia Avenue—which adjoins the lots in question—by the National Government, in accordance with the terms of certain&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; of donation executed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; plaintiff in favor&nbsp; of the Government on&nbsp; February 2,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1948; that, should the Government decide&nbsp; to&nbsp; pave&nbsp; Buendia Avenue with&nbsp; concrete, defendant&nbsp; shall&nbsp; pay&nbsp; plaintiff's share in "the difference between&nbsp; the cost of paving the road with concrete and that with asphalt";&nbsp; that real estate taxes and special assessments on said&nbsp; lots shall be paid by the defendant; that the latter may take&nbsp; immediate possession of said lots,&nbsp; but, until&nbsp; title thereto is transferred to&nbsp; him as above stated,&nbsp; his possession shall be that of a tenant, with option to purchase; that the ejectment of any occupant or intruder, after the ouster of the present occupants by the plaintiff, shall be made by the defendant&nbsp; and for his account; and that the defendant shall have,&nbsp; within&nbsp; one year from August 9, 1948, an option to purchase eight (8) additional parcels of land described in a sketch annexed to said deed, under the terms and conditions&nbsp; therein&nbsp; set forth.<br><br>On August 9,&nbsp; 1948, when defendant's promissory note for P100,000 fell due, he did not pay said sum.&nbsp; However, on&nbsp; August 10, 1948,&nbsp; he delivered,&nbsp; and&nbsp; plaintiff accepted, the sum of PI,000 as&nbsp; interest on said note, from August 9 to October 8, 1948, to which last date the due&nbsp; date of&nbsp; said promissory note was thereupon extended&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; D). On August 30, 1948, defendant&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to plaintiff the&nbsp; sum of P50,000 "as earnest&nbsp; money to guarantee the fulfillment of&nbsp; all his&nbsp; obligations"&nbsp; under&nbsp; Exhibit B, as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as on account&nbsp; of said promissory note for P100,000, subject to the following conditions.<br><ol type="1"><li>"That the due date of said promissory note of&nbsp; July 1, 1948 is hereby extended to January 31,&nbsp; 1949, Provided, however, That should on or before such date the said Mr. Joseph Arcache pays or causes to be&nbsp; paid the sum of fifty thousand (50,000) PESOS together with interest thereon at the rate of six (6%)&nbsp; PER CENT per annum from date hereof to date of payment, then this earnest&nbsp; money shall be considered as partial payment of the said promissory note of July 1, 1948;<br><br></li><li>"On the other hand, should&nbsp; the said Mr. Joseph Arcache fail to pay the additional sum of fifty thousand (P50,000) pesos mentioned in&nbsp; the preceding subparagraph, then this- earnest money of fifty thousand&nbsp; (P50,000) pesos&nbsp; shall be automatically forfeited in favor of this Company, by way&nbsp; of&nbsp; liquidated&nbsp; damages under the 'Agreement to Purchase and&nbsp; Sell' of July&nbsp; 1, 1948, and the latter shall, by&nbsp; the&nbsp; mere&nbsp; fact&nbsp; of such nonpayment,&nbsp; be automatically rescinded&nbsp; as though it had never been entered into."&nbsp; (Exh 1.)</li></ol>Although the date of maturity of said promissory note was&nbsp; thereby extended,&nbsp; once&nbsp; more, to January 31,&nbsp; 1949, defendant did not seasonably honor it.&nbsp; On March 7,&nbsp; 1949, both parties executed the "amended agreement to purchase and sell" Exhibit E, in which it was stipulated that&nbsp; upon subdivision&nbsp; survey,&nbsp; the lots&nbsp; above referred to&nbsp; appear to have an&nbsp; area of 76,234 square&nbsp; meters, instead of 74,662 square meters,&nbsp; as stated in the annexes to Exhibit B; that the stipulated price was, therefore, increased from P447,972 to P457,404; that plaintiff had received from the defendant on August 30, 1948, the sum of P50,000, by way of "earnest money";&nbsp; that defendant bound himself to pay, on or about April 4,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; the&nbsp; additional sum of P50.000&nbsp; (balance of his promissory&nbsp; note of July 1, 1948) ; that should he comply with this obligation,&nbsp; the earnest money of P50.000 "shall be considered as part of the&nbsp; purchase price"; that, otherwise, said earnest money would be "automatically forfeited" to the plaintiff&nbsp; "by way of liquidated damages" and the amended agreement Exhibit E automatically annulled and cancelled, "except as to such&nbsp; portions of the property sold to third parties and duly released" by&nbsp; the plaintiff "in the form of absolute sales"; that&nbsp; upon payment of the&nbsp; balance of P50,000 due on defendant's&nbsp; promissory note (Exhibit C), title to the lots in question would be transferred&nbsp; to him, and he would simultaneously secure and guarantee, with a first mortgage&nbsp; on&nbsp; said lots, the payment of the balance of the purchase price thereof; and that defendant renounced his option under&nbsp; Exhibit B&nbsp; to&nbsp; purchase the additional parcels of land therein mentioned.&nbsp; In all other respects, Exhibit E is substantially identical to Exhibit B.<br><br>On March&nbsp; 16, 1949, defendant paid to plaintiff the sum of P50,000 with interests thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; the first annual installment of&nbsp; H.00,000 fell due, on August 9, 1949, said amount was not&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp; Instead, both parties executed the deed Exhibit F, entitled "Amendment to the Amended Agreement to Purchase and Sell of March 7, 1949",&nbsp; which provided, among other things, that payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; annual&nbsp; installment&nbsp; of&nbsp; P100,000,&nbsp; including interest, was extended to February 9, 1950; that plaintiff was relieved of its&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; to&nbsp; eject&nbsp; the&nbsp; "remaining squatters" on the&nbsp; lots in question;&nbsp; and that, in all&nbsp; other respects,. the amended agreement Exhibit E shall remain in full force&nbsp; and effect.<br><br>It is not&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; first&nbsp; annual installment of P100.000 was not paid within the extended&nbsp; period, expiring on&nbsp; February 9, 1950.&nbsp; Soon thereafter,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 13, 1950,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; the present case, for the rescission&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contracts, Exhibits&nbsp; B, E and&nbsp; F, and&nbsp; the recovery of the following sums:&nbsp; (1) P47,000, representing plaintiff's&nbsp; share in&nbsp; the&nbsp; difference between&nbsp; the&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of paving Buendia Avenue with concrete and&nbsp; that of asphalt; (2) P10.000, allegedly spent by the plaintiff&nbsp; to eject its tenants, so as&nbsp; to&nbsp; be in&nbsp; a position&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver the lots in question to&nbsp; the defendants;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; P1, 680.35 paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiff, on account of the defendant, by way of real estate taxes; and (4) PI,000&nbsp; as attorney's fees, in&nbsp; addition to costs.<br><br>Defendants answered&nbsp; alleging that his obligation was not fulfilled owing to the prior failure of the plaintiff to comply with its own part of their contract; that the sum of&nbsp; P47.000 is not,&nbsp; as yet,&nbsp; due and demandable; that&nbsp; he has no sufficient knowledge of the facts upon which plaintiff relies in support of its&nbsp; claim for reimbursement&nbsp; of P10,000,&nbsp; which&nbsp; at any rate, should&nbsp; not be entertained because of plaintiff's default in the&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; its own obligations and that such default, on the part of the plaintiff, rendered it "iniquituous and burdensome" for the defendant to comply&nbsp; with his part of their agreement.<br><br>In&nbsp; due course, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal rendered judgment, the&nbsp; dispositive part of&nbsp; which&nbsp; reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"POR LAS CONSIDERACIONES EXPUESTAS, el Juzgado dicta decis a favor de la demandante&nbsp; Ayala y Compafiia,&nbsp; ordcnando la resohici6n del contrato de compra y yenta de fecha 7 de marzo de 1949 (Exhibito&nbsp; 'E'), tal como ha sido ultimamente enmendado el 9 de agosto del mismo afio, 1949 (Exhibito 'F'), y otros convenios poateriores; declarando a la demandante ser duena de todos los lotes o parcelas de terreno envueltas en este litigio, con derecho a su pose con derecho a cobrar y deducir de la&nbsp; suma de&nbsp; P50,000&nbsp; la de P8.520.54 y otra de P3.000 en concepto de&nbsp; danos y honorarios de abogado, respectivamente; y ordena a la demandante&nbsp; a devolver al demandado cualquiera otra suma remanente a balance&nbsp; de loa P50,000, despues de&nbsp; deducidas las sumas&nbsp; aqui autoriaadas, con las costas d juicio contra el demandado."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, pp. 98-99.)<br></blockquote>The main issue in this case is whether or not&nbsp; defendant did not pay the first installment of P100,000, originally due on August 9, 1949, and subsequently extended to February 9,&nbsp; 1950, due&nbsp; to the alleged prior default of plaintiff herein. In this connection, defendant maintains that upon payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sum of P100,000 due on&nbsp; his promissory note (Exhibit C), which amount&nbsp; was fully paid on March&nbsp; 16, 1949,&nbsp; plaintiff was bound, under Exhibit E, to convey the lots in&nbsp; question to&nbsp; him;&nbsp; that,&nbsp; having&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, plaintiff was in default in the performance of said&nbsp; obligation;&nbsp; and that, consequently, defendant cannot be compelled to pay the first annual installment, which became due&nbsp; on February 9,&nbsp; 1950.<br><br>Upon the other hand, plaintiff&nbsp; tried to prove that it had caused the deed of conveyance in favor of the defendant to be prepared; that said instrument was ready for signature sometime after March 16, 1949; that, this notwithstanding, the deed was not executed,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the request of the defendant, inasmuch as&nbsp; his creditors had&nbsp; filed several suits against him.&nbsp; In support of this pretense, plaintiff introduced&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; its counsel, , Messrs.&nbsp; McVittie, Tellechea, and Lorayes, which the&nbsp; lower court found more worthy of credence than that of defendant Joseph Arcache, not only because the latter's testimony is uncorroborated, but also, because the testimony of said&nbsp; witnesses for the plaintiff is borne out&nbsp; by documentary evidence.<br><br>Indeed,&nbsp; it appears&nbsp; that the&nbsp; following cases and&nbsp; proceedings against the defendant&nbsp; were&nbsp; filed and took place, to wit:<br><ol type="1"><li>On or&nbsp; about&nbsp; August 5, 1948, the Philippine Relief&nbsp; and Trade Rehabilitation Administration instituted&nbsp; civil case&nbsp; No. 6058 of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila, for&nbsp; the recovery of P55,118.06, with interests and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; A writ of garnishment was issued therein on August 30, 1948 (Exhibit P);<br><br></li><li>On or about August 17, 1948, Dr. Simplicio Ocampo&nbsp; commenced civil case No.&nbsp; 6120 of the same&nbsp; court,&nbsp; for the recovery of P8,000, with interests and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; The case was, later,&nbsp; settled amicably and then dismissed, by&nbsp; an order dated March 4, 1949 (Exhibit Q);<br><br></li><li>On or about&nbsp; October 16, 1948,&nbsp; Brias&nbsp; Roxas,&nbsp; Inc., began civil case No. 6867 of&nbsp; the same court, for the&nbsp; recovery of $6,000, plus $3,000&nbsp; monthly, from&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1, 1948, in addition to attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp; On March 3, 1949, judgment was rendered for said plaintiff, in&nbsp; the sum of P24.000, plus P2,400 by way of attorney's fees, and costs. The corresponding writ of execution was issued on August&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1949 (Exhibits R and R-l);<br><br></li><li>On May 28,&nbsp; 1949, the Manila&nbsp; Surety and Fidelity Co.,&nbsp; Inc., brought civil case No.&nbsp; 8179&nbsp; of the same court of Manila.&nbsp; On November 9,&nbsp; 1949, judgment was rendered therein for the&nbsp; sum of P2,8G0,&nbsp; plus attorney's&nbsp; fees, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P285, and costs.&nbsp; The corresponding&nbsp; writ of execution was issued on February 8, 1950, and returned unsatisfied on April 27, 1950&nbsp; (Exhibits S and&nbsp; R-1);<br><br></li><li>On October&nbsp; 3, 1949, Hilaria&nbsp; Uy&nbsp; Isabelo initiated civil&nbsp; case No. 9046 of the municipal court of Manila for unlawful detainer, plus damages and attorney's fees.&nbsp; On&nbsp; appeal, the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila—in which it was docketed as case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 9937— rendered a&nbsp; decision on&nbsp; October 6, 1950, in&nbsp; conformity with a compromise agreement between the parties, whereby defendant acknowledged an indebtedness of P17,000, which he promised to pay on or before April 6, 1951.&nbsp; Owing, evidently, to&nbsp; defendant's to comply with this promise, a writ of execution was issued May 1, 1951 (Exhibit T) ;<br><br></li><li>On&nbsp; September 3,&nbsp; 1949, the South&nbsp; Sea&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; and Insurance Co., Inc., filed&nbsp; civil case No. 9100 of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of first&nbsp; Instance of Manila,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery of P10,000, plus&nbsp; attorney fees&nbsp; and costs.&nbsp; On March 3, 1950, said&nbsp; court rendered&nbsp; judgment prayed for&nbsp; and the corresponding writ of execution was issued on May 12, 1950 (Exhibits U and&nbsp; U-1);<br><br></li><li>On&nbsp; December 22,&nbsp; 1949, the Central Surety and Insurance&nbsp; Co., commenced civil case No. 9801 of the&nbsp; same court,&nbsp; for the recovery of P6,000, plus attorney's fees, in the sum of P900, for which amounts judgement was rendered on March 23, 1950, and a writ of execution issued on May 23, 1950 (Exhibit V);<br><br></li><li>On&nbsp; December 22,&nbsp; 1949, the Central Surety and Insurance&nbsp; Co., brought&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 9972 of&nbsp; said&nbsp; court,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery of P21,463.03, plus attorney's&nbsp; fees,&nbsp; in the sum of P3,219, costs. Decision was rendered, substantially as prayed for, on June 21, 1951 (Exhibit W);<br><br></li><li>On&nbsp; April&nbsp; 10, 1950, the Philippine Air Lines began civil case No. 10789 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same court, to recover P4,386.65,&nbsp; with interests and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 8, 1950, a decision was&nbsp; rendered in conformity with a compromise agreement&nbsp; between&nbsp; the parties whereby Areache&nbsp; undertook to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; aforesaid sum&nbsp; of P4,386.65,&nbsp; in monthly&nbsp; installments of P200 each, beginning from November, 1950 (Exhibit X).<br></li></ol>In other words, prior to March 16, 1949, three&nbsp; (3) civil actions&nbsp; for the&nbsp; recovery of sums&nbsp; of&nbsp; money, aggregating P92.518.06, had been filed against the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; Thereafter, or within the period from&nbsp; May 28, 1949&nbsp; to&nbsp; April 10, 1950, six (6)&nbsp; additional civil actions, for the&nbsp; total sum of P94,113.68 more or less, were instituted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In every one of these cases—except the&nbsp; first,&nbsp; the status of which has not been&nbsp; sufficiently established, and the&nbsp; second&nbsp; which was settled&nbsp; amicably—judgment&nbsp; was eventually&nbsp; rendered against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; What&nbsp; is more, the&nbsp; transactions from which&nbsp; the corresponding causes&nbsp; of&nbsp; action arose, and the acts, omissions and conflicts leading to said litigations, took place sometime before the commencement of the corresponding suits.Consequently, the defendant must have anticipated, not only the institution of the cases filed subsequently to March 16, 1949, but,&nbsp; also, the measures that the plaintiffs therein, as well as the plaintiffs in the actions begun before&nbsp; said date,&nbsp; could, and,&nbsp; in&nbsp; all&nbsp; probability, would have taken,&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with the lots&nbsp; in question if conveyed by the&nbsp; plaintiff to&nbsp; him, with a view to holding said lots&nbsp; responsible for&nbsp; the payment of their respective credits.<br><br>It is also, important to&nbsp; note that—despite&nbsp; defendant's testimony to the contrary—during the period from March 16 to August 9, 1949,&nbsp; and, subsequently thereto, .defendant did not have the money required to meet his obligations in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff, and was trying to raise the&nbsp; funds necessary therefor, by enlisting&nbsp; the help, assistance&nbsp; or support&nbsp; of&nbsp; other persons,&nbsp; whose&nbsp; interest in&nbsp; the lots&nbsp; in question he had been.endeavoring&nbsp; to prick.&nbsp; This he could not hope to achieve, if plaintiff executed the corresponding deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; conveyance in his favor&nbsp; and&nbsp; caused the title&nbsp; to said lots to be transferred to his name, for the same&nbsp; would require the registration of said deed of conveyance, with the result that defendant's creditors would come to know about it,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; levy&nbsp; attachment upon said lots,&nbsp; in which event nobody&nbsp; would&nbsp; care&nbsp; to finance&nbsp; defendant's venture in connection&nbsp; therewith.<br><br>Moreover, it clearly appears that the plaintiff was well-meaning, considerate&nbsp; and&nbsp; accommodating in dealing with the defendant. Thus, although in his&nbsp; letter of May 11, 1948&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; A), offering&nbsp; to purchase said property, defendant undertook&nbsp; to pay P100,000 in&nbsp; cash, upon the signing of the agreement,&nbsp; Exhibit B, he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not comply with&nbsp; this part of the&nbsp; offer.&nbsp; Plaintiff could have&nbsp; refused, therefore, to execute said deed and cancel the deal.&nbsp; Yet, it did not do so.&nbsp; What is&nbsp; more, it allowed the defendant to give a <i>promissory note</i> for P100,000, payable on August 9, 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; had another chance to demand a rescission of their contract when defendant failed to honor his promissory note on the date last mentioned, but, instead, it&nbsp; gave him up to&nbsp; October 8,&nbsp; 1948, to pay said amount. Neither did plaintiff&nbsp; take&nbsp; advantage of a&nbsp; similar opportunity, as defendant&nbsp; was&nbsp; unable&nbsp; to fulfill his obligation within the extension of time&nbsp; thus granted&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Upon payment of one-half (½) of the amount of said promissory note on August 30,&nbsp; 1948, he got a third extension of time, which expired on January 31, 1949, without full settlement of said obligation.&nbsp; Once again, plaintiff&nbsp; refrained from ,&nbsp; taking,&nbsp; against the defendant, any drastic action, which would have been more&nbsp; justified than before not only because of his repeated defaults, but also, because prior to January 31, 1948, he&nbsp; had secured no further extension of time.&nbsp; As if&nbsp; this were not enough, over&nbsp; a month later, or on March 7, 1949,&nbsp; plaintiff executed Exhibit E, giving defendant a fifth extension, to expire on April 4, 1949.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true that, eventually, or on&nbsp; March 16, 1949, defendant paid the balance of P50.000 due on his promissory note (Exhibit C).&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, however, when the first annual installment of P100,000 fell due on August 9,&nbsp; 1949, defendant became delinquent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of availing of this development, to relieve itself of its obligations, plaintiff gave him an extension up to February 9, 1950, within which to pay said installment.<br><br>After such display&nbsp; of a degree of morality higher than that which was absolutely demanded by the circumstances, we find it difficult to conceive that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; would fail to comply with its&nbsp; legal obligation to&nbsp; convey&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots in dispute to the defendant and&nbsp; cause&nbsp; the title thereto&nbsp; to be issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; his name.&nbsp; In the light of this&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; of the plaintiff towards&nbsp; the defendant,&nbsp; it would be- unjust and unfair to&nbsp; assume and hold in the absence of concrete, tangible, clear, unbiased and corroborated&nbsp; evidence to the contrary—and&nbsp; there&nbsp; is none on&nbsp; record&nbsp; to this effect— that, realizing, all of&nbsp; a sudden&nbsp; (as&nbsp; if it were incapable of visualizing it&nbsp; before) that the market value of the land in question would rise,&nbsp; or had, meanwhile, risen already, plaintiff became, as suggested by the defendant, possessed of the desire to exclude him from&nbsp; the&nbsp; enjoyment of the corresponding&nbsp; profits,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; cast aside its&nbsp; moral scruples—to&nbsp; which it had consistently adhered in the near past—in order, not&nbsp; only to&nbsp; dishonor. its formal commitments in favor of the defendant, but also, and this is worse, to add&nbsp; insult to injury, by imputing to him a breach of his own contractual undertaking.<br><br>Any possible doubts&nbsp; on&nbsp; this point are dispelled by the fact that the&nbsp; deed, Exhibit F, executed&nbsp; on&nbsp; August 9, 1949—granting the defendant an extension up tp» February 9, 1950, for&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of the first annual installment of P100,000—states that the reason therefor&nbsp; was that he "found&nbsp; himself in a&nbsp; position not to be able to pay the obligation falling due on August 9, 1949" and had, accordingly,<i> "requested"</i>&nbsp; the plaintiff "to grant him&nbsp; an extension of six&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) months within which to&nbsp; pay the first annual installment of&nbsp; P100,000."&nbsp; Had he felt that plaintiff was, then, in default in the performance of its obligation to execute&nbsp; the deed of assignment in his favor, it would have been unnecessary for the defendant to request said extention of&nbsp; time, for plaintiff would have had no right to demand payment of&nbsp; the first annual installment of P100,000 on said&nbsp; date.&nbsp; The express acknowledgment made by the defendant in Exhibit F of the fact that he was unable to pay said installment of P100,000 on&nbsp; August 9, 1949, and his aforementioned request for an extension of time within which to settle said obligation—which eventually was not satisfied—clearly show that he did not regard the plaintiff in default in the performance of any of its undertakings under Exhibits B, E&nbsp; and F&nbsp; and strongly corroborate the evidence for the plaintiff to the effect that, although it had prepared, and was ready to sign, the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; conveyance, in favor of the defendant, the same was not executed&nbsp; upon the letter's request,&nbsp; for fear&nbsp; that his creditors may step in and&nbsp; deprive him of the&nbsp; lots in question.<br><br>Said&nbsp; evidence for the plaintiff is further bolstered up by three (3) additional facts, namely: (<i>a</i>) the defendant had&nbsp; never demanded,&nbsp; in&nbsp; writing, from the plaintiff, the performance of its aforesaid obligation; (<i>b</i>) on March 16 and&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; plaintiff <i>actually executed</i> in favor of the. defendant&nbsp; the deeds of sale Exhibits G&nbsp; and H, whereby the former conveyed to the latter, for&nbsp; the sums of P30,000 and&nbsp; P15,000&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; under the first&nbsp; instrument, four (4)&nbsp; lots, with&nbsp; a total area of 4,992 square&nbsp; meters&nbsp; (which defendant&nbsp; forthwith conveyed to Senator Jose C. Zulueta for P60.000), and, under&nbsp; the second instrument, two (2) lots&nbsp; aggregating 2,500 square meters&nbsp; (Exhibits G, H and 3) ;&nbsp; and (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; plaintiff had&nbsp; disbursed the sum of P8,520,54 in order to eject the occupants of the lots&nbsp; in question, so that possession thereof could be turned over to defendant herein.<br><br>It is next urged&nbsp; by the defendant that plaintiff was, also, in&nbsp; default in its duty&nbsp; to pave the&nbsp; Buendia Avenue in&nbsp; its&nbsp; entirety.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; ocular inspection&nbsp; made by His Honor the Trial&nbsp; Judge, it appeared, however, that&nbsp; said road is completely paved with concrete,&nbsp; except a portion thereof forming part of the railroad track,&nbsp; which does not&nbsp; belong to plaintiff herein.&nbsp; We agree with the lower court that the contract between the parties should not be construed—in&nbsp; the absence of explicit stipulation to the contrary—as imposing upon the&nbsp; plaintiff the obligation to attend to&nbsp; the paving of such portions of said avenue as were the property of others.&nbsp; Apart&nbsp; from containing no such stipulation, Exhibits B, E and F indicate clearly the contrary, for, in these instruments, the <i>defendant</i> agreed "to expedite, to the best of&nbsp; his ability, the paving of the Buendia Avenue by the National Government, <i>in accordance with the&nbsp; terms of&nbsp; the donations of&nbsp; February 2,&nbsp; 1948, between the donors and the Government." </i> Inasmuch as the deeds of donation have not been introduced in evidence, we&nbsp; must&nbsp; assume that the&nbsp; paving therein contemplated referred to the portions&nbsp; donated by&nbsp; the plaintiff to the Government, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; no other property.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate it was the defendant, not plaintiff, who undertook to expedite the paving by&nbsp; the National&nbsp; <i>Government. </i> Insofar as the&nbsp; decision appealed&nbsp; from sentences&nbsp; him to pay the&nbsp; sum of P8,520.54 disbursed by&nbsp; the plaintiff for the ejectment of the tenants of the lots in&nbsp; question, defendant herein assails it upon the ground that plaintiff was&nbsp; bound&nbsp; to&nbsp; incur in&nbsp; such expense, pursuant to&nbsp; the provisions of their contract.&nbsp; This fact does not warrant the conclusion&nbsp; drawn therefrom by appellant herein.&nbsp; To begin with,&nbsp; plaintiff assumed said obligation,&nbsp; in Consideration of the obligations, in turn, contracted by the defendant. In other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; plaintiff undertook&nbsp; to&nbsp; defray,&nbsp; and&nbsp; did defray, said expenses, because the defendant had, on his part, bound himself, among other things, to pay the annual installment&nbsp; of&nbsp; P100,000, at first, on August 9,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; and, subsequently, on February 9, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of defendant's delinquency in&nbsp; the payment of this sum, it is but fair and just that the indemnity the&nbsp; plaintiff for what&nbsp; the latter would not have disbursed had it not been for the representations and promises made—and, subsequently,&nbsp; broken— by him.&nbsp; In other words, said expenditures now represent damages sustained by the plaintiff on account of the&nbsp; non- performance of defendant's&nbsp; obligation.<br><br>Lastly, defendant maintains, invoking&nbsp; Article 1592 of the Civil Code of the Philippines&nbsp; (which is substantially identical to Article 1504 of the Civil Code of Spain)&nbsp; that rescission or resolution should not have been ordered without giving&nbsp; him&nbsp; an opportunity to&nbsp; pay the first annual installment of P100,000, which, he claims,&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; ready, willing and able to pay and offered to pay in open court. There is no merit in&nbsp; this pretense.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cases cited In support thereof refer to slight or casual violations of contractual obligations, whereas the breach of contract in the present ease is substantial.&nbsp; Besides, the records abundantly show that defendant was neither ready nor able to pay said sum of P100,000 either on August 9, 1949, or on&nbsp; February 9, 1950,&nbsp; or at any time during the hearing of this ease in the lower court,, In fact, he never deposited, or made a formal offer to&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; in&nbsp; court said&nbsp; amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, said&nbsp; legal provision governs&nbsp; contracts' of&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; and sale,&nbsp; but has no&nbsp; application to a promise to sell (Caridad Estates Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Santero, 71 Phil. 114; Alfrea <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Inauimboy, 47 Off, Gaz.,&nbsp; Supp. 131; Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of October 7, 1896)&nbsp; such as the one involved in the contract between the parties herein.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; we find&nbsp; no&nbsp; merit in&nbsp; the appeal taken&nbsp; by defendant-appellant, and, accordingly, the decision appealed from, is,&nbsp; hereby,&nbsp; affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>, with costs against said defendant-appellant.
