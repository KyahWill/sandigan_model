				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal by the People against a judgment of the Court of First Instance of  Misamis Occidental, absolving Juliana Uba and Calixta Uba of the offense of oral defamation of which they are charged in  an information filed by the provincial fiscal. </p>
<p>On August 1,1952, Demetria Somod-ong filed a complaint in the justice  of the peace court of Oroquieta,  Misamis  , Occidental, charging above-named Juliana and Calixta Uba with having uttered' in public against complainant certain defamatory words and expressions.  The  complaint was supported by the affidavits, of Pastora Somod-ong, Marciano Calibog and Anacoreta Rocaldo.   The court found the existence  of  probable cause and forwarded  the case to the Court of First Instance, where the provincial fiscal  filed the information Charging the accused Juliana and Calixta Uba  of  serious  oral defamation.  However, instead of mentioning the complainant  Demetria Somod-ong as the offended party, the information named Pastora Somod-ong as the person  offended.</p>
<p>When the case came for trial  both Demetria and Pastora testified for the prosecution.  Demetria is the daughter of Pastora and when the latter testified she (declared that it was her daughter Demetria who  was insulted by the accused. When Demetria testified she declared the the accused insulted her corroborating  her  mother's  testimony.  Two other witnesses testified that the accused insulted Demetria Somod-ong calling her lascivious and a prostitute.  When the prosecution had rested, counsel for the accused promptly moved for the dismissal of the  case on the ground that all the defamatory statements  supposed to have been uttered by  the accused were against Demetria, not against the offended party, Pastora.  The (judge then ordered counsel for the parties to  present the motion  and the answer thereto in writing which they did.  The judge sustained the motion to dismiss and entered decision acquitting the accused of the  charge.   Hence, this appeal.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General  contends  in this appeal that the trial  court should have  ordered the fiscal to  amend the information by changing the  name of  the offended party so as to make it conform with the evidence.  It is claimed that the change would merely be one  of form, permitted by  Section 13 of Rule  106, which  provides:</p>
<blockquote>"Sec.  13.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Amendment</span>.â€”The information  or complaint  may be amended, in substance or form, without leave of court, at any time before the defendant pleads; and  thereafter and during the  trial as to all matters of form, by  leave and at the discretion of the court, when the same can be done without prejudice to the rights of the defendant.<p></p>
<p>If it appears at any time before judgment  that mistake has been made  in charging1 the proper offense,  the court may dismiss the original complaint or information and order the filing of a  new one charging the proper offense, provided the defendant would not be placed thereby in double jeopardy, and may also require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial."</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p>While it is probably true that the fiscal or his clerk made a clerical error in putting in the information the name of Pastora Somod-ong instead of that of Demetria Somod-ong, as  the offended party,  the mistake thus committed  was on  a  very material matter in  the  case,  such that it necessarily affected the identification of the act charged.   The act of insulting X is distinct  from a similar act of insult against Y, even if the  insult is  proferred by the same person, in the same language  and  at about the same time. Note that the pleading that give the court jurisdiction to try the offense is  not the complaint of  the offended party, but the information by the fiscal, because the charge is the utterance  of insulting or defamatory  language, not the imputation of an  offense which  can be prosecuted only at the instance of the offended party.  (People<em> vs.</em> Marquez, 68  Phil.,  521;  Blanco <em>vs.</em> People,  70 Phil, 735.)</p>
<p>The case of  Lahoylahoy, 38 Phil., 330, appears to us to be in point and decisive of the case.  The reasons for the decision in that case  were,  first, because, to convict a person of robbing X when the person robbed is Y is violative of the principles of pleading and,  second, because then the plea of double jeopardy would be of no avail to an accused. To this  same effect is our decision in People <em>vs.</em> Balboa, 90  Phil., 5.</p>
<p>We, therefore, find that the court a quo did not err in dismissing the case for variance between the allegations of the information and  the proof.  But the evidence showed thatthe accused were guilty of another act, that of insulting Demetria Somod-ong.  The Court should  have,  therefore, ordered the fiscal to file another information with Demetria Somod-ong as the offended party  and hold the accused in custody  to answer the new charge.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal is hereby affirmed, but the provincial  fiscal of Misamis Occidental is hereby ordered to file a new information  charging the same accused with the offense  of  serious  oral defamation against Demetria Somod-ong.   Judgment modified.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,  J. B. L.,</em> and<em> Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
