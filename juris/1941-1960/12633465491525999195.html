				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This Is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan 
which dismissed the complaint of the appellant upon motion of the appellees, on 
the ground that the complaint does not state a cause of action.
<p>The plaintiff's action is to compel the defendants to accept the sum of money 
offered by the former for the redemption of a parcel of land which, according to 
the allegations in the complaint, was sold on execution sale by one of the 
defendants, as sheriff of Bulacan, to the other defendants on March 1941. In the 
complaint it is averred that "the period of redemption of said property sold at 
public auction should have expired on March 22, 1942, according to the 
certificate of sale, but because of the war declared on December 8, 1941 by the 
Japanese Empire against the United States of America, and the Commonwealth 
Government of the Philippines was under the sovereignty of the latter, the 
period of redemption was extended or interrupted." </p>
<p>The lower court did not err in dismissing the plaintiff's action, for the 
plaintiff's contention that the period of redemption of his property sold on 
execution was suspended or interrupted by the war is untenable. The period 
within which a property sold on execution may be redeemed is not a limitation of 
action. But even if it be so considered, the ruling of this Court in the case of 
España <em>vs</em>. Lucido (8 Phil., 419) can not be applied to the present 
case. Because, as we have said in Rivero vs. Rivero<span class="style1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span> (G. R. No. L-578, April 30, 1948) promulgated 
recently, "the fundamental reason underlying statutes providing for suspension 
or extension of period of limitation is the legal or physical impossibility for 
the interested party to enforce or exercise in time his right of action"; and the war did not make it impossible for the herein plaintiff to exercise his 
right of redemption. </p>
<p>In the said case of Rivero <em>vs</em>. Rivero, et al., applicable a 
<em>fortiori</em> to the present case, this Court held the following: </p>
<p></p><blockquote>"* * * Assuming as true the appellant's allegation that the 
'defendant-appellee was a 'guerrillero' and hence it was difficult to contact 
him', such fact did not prevent the plaintiff-appellant from exercising his 
right during the period of redemption. Because a vendor who decide to redeem or 
repurchase a property-sold with <em>pacto de retro</em> stands as the debtor and 
the vendee as the creditor of the repurchase price. And the plaintiff-appellant 
could and should have exercised his right of redemption against the 
defendant-appellee, if the latter was absent, by filing a suit against him and 
making a consignation with the court of the amount due for the redemption, under 
the provisions of article 1176 of the Civil Code which provides:&nbsp;
<blockquote><p>'ART. 1176. If a creditor to whom tender of payment has been made should 
refuse without reason to accept it, the debtor may relieve himself of liability 
by the consignation of the thing due. </p>
<p>'The same effect shall be produced by consignation alone when made in the 
absence of the creditor, or if the latter should be incapacitated to accept the 
payment when it is due, or when several persons claim to be entitled to receive 
it, or when the muniments of the obligation have been lost or mislaid.' 
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="center">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><p>"The 'dictum,' in the case of España <em>vs</em>. Lucido (8 Phil., 419) cited 
by the appellant, to the effect that the statute of limitation is suspended by 
war, rebellion, or insurrection when the regular course of justice is 
interrupted to such extent that the courts can not be kept open." even if such 
suspension were applicable to the period within which to redeem a thing sold 
under <em>pacto de retro</em>, has no application to the present case because, 
as above stated, the courts of justice in the province of Camarines Sur were 
open and transacting business since October, 1942. </p></blockquote>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, the appealed order is affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant. So ordered. </p><em>Parás, Actg. C.J., Perfecto, 
Bengzon,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br>
