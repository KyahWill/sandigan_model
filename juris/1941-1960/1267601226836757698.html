				<H3>CATALINA OSMEÑA DE VALENCIA ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. EMILIA RODRIGUEZ ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an action instituted In the Court of First Instance of Cebu, 
the plaintiffs prayed for an injunction restraining the defendants from using 
the surname "Valencia". The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and this was 
sustained by the lower court. Hence this appeal by the plaintiffs.
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs allege, on the one hand, that they (except 
Catalina Osmeña) are the legitimate children of the defendant Pio E. Valencia in 
the latter's lawful wedlock with plaintiff Catalina Osmeña; and, upon the other 
hand, that the defendants, (except Emilia Rodriguez and Pio E. Valencia) are the 
illegitimate children of Pio E. Valencia with his common-law-wife, defendant 
Emilia Rodriguez. It Is accordingly contended by the plaintiffs that they alone 
have the right to bear the surname "Valencia", in accordance with article 114 of 
the Civil Code which provides that legitimate children have the right to bear 
the surname of the father. To complete their argument, the plaintiffs point out 
that, under articles 139 and 845 of the Civil Code, illegitimate children (who 
are not natural) are entitled only to support.</p>
<p align="justify">We concede that the plaintiffs may use the surname of their 
father as a matter of right by reason of the mere fact that they are legitimate 
children; but we cannot agree to the view that article 114 of the Civil Code, 
without more, grants monopolistic proprietary control to legitimate children 
over the surname of their father. In other words, said article has marked a 
right of which legitimate children may not be deprived, but it cannot be 
interpreted as a prohibition against the use by others of what may happen to be 
the surname of their father. If plaintiff's theory were correct, they can stop 
countless inhabitants from bearing the surname "Valencia."</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants' case becomes the stronger when it is remembered 
that, from all appearances, Pio E. Valencia (the father) acquiesces in the 
adoption of his surname by the defendants. But even if he objects, the 
defendants can still use the surname "Valencia," in the absence of any law 
granting exclusive ownership over a surname.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed order is affirmed, and it is so ordered with costs 
against the plaintiffs and appellants.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Perfecto, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">FERIA, J.:</p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the result.</p>

<p align="center"><b>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING </b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>OZAETA, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the affirmance of the order appealed from on the 
following ground: It appears from paragraph 5 of the complaint that the 
defendant Pio E. Valencia has allowed his illegitimate children by his 
codefendant Emilia Rodriguez to bear his surname even after they had reached the 
age of reason. From this allegation it may be inferred that since their birth 
these illegitimate children have been given and have borne the surname of their 
father with the latter's consent. The plaintiffs predicate their case upon 
articles 114, 139, and 845 of the Civil Code and Rule 103 of the Rules of Court. 
Article 114 says that legitimate children shall have the right to bear the 
surnames of their father and mother; and articles 139 and 845 say that 
illegitimate children who have not the status of natural children shall be 
entitled only to support. Rule 103 of the Rules of Court prescribes the 
procedure for change of name. Upon the facts alleged in the complaint, these 
statutory provisions are not sufficient, in my opinion, to entitle the 
plaintiffs to the relief sought by their complaint. The mere fact that 
legitimate children have the right to bear the surnames of their parents and 
illegitimate children are entitled only to support, does not necessarily imply 
that the father may not voluntarily permit his illegitimate children to bear his 
surname. Rule 103 is not applicable because it is not alleged in the complaint 
that the twelve defendants who are alleged to be illegitimate children of their 
codefendant Pio E. Valencia have illegally changed their surname from some other 
to that of Valencia. On the contrary we infer from the complaint that since 
their birth they have always borne that surname with the knowledge and consent 
of their putative father.</p> I dissent from so much of the majority opinion as may convey 
the idea (1) that a person who claims to be the illegitimate child of another 
may use or adopt the surname of the latter even against his will and without his 
consent, and without authorization from the court; and (2) that any person is 
free to use any surname he may have a fancy for without the authorization of the 
court even though he may not have originally borne that surname. Concerning the 
first idea, I am of the opinion that a person cannot adjudicate to himself a 
status which adversely affects another without the latter's consent or without 
the intervention of the court. And as to the second idea, it is clear from Rule 
103 that a person cannot adopt a new name, or use one other than that he has 
originally borne, without complying with the requisites provided for in said 
rule.</div>
