				<H3>IN RE ATTORNEY FELIX P. DAVID
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The respondent, Felix P. David, a member of the Philippine Bar, 
is charged with malpractice for misappropriating funds entrusted to him by his 
client, the complainant Briccio S. Henson. Respondent having answered denying 
the charge, the complaint was referred to the Solicitor General for 
investigation. After investigation the Solicitor General rendered his report 
finding the respondent guilty of professional misconduct and recommending 
disciplinary action. The Solicitor General reports the following facts to have 
been conclusively established:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * that on February 15, 1947, respondent obtained P840 from 
his client Briccio Henson to be applied to the payment of inheritance and real 
estate taxes due from the estate of Esteban Henson for 1945, 1946 and 1947 (p. 
3, t. s. n.), for which he signed a receipt (Annex 'A'; p. 3, t. s. n.). On 
several occasions, complainant asked the respondent to show him the official tax 
receipt evidencing the payment of said taxes, to which the latter answered that 
he had already paid them, but the receipts were left with his friend in San 
Fernando. Respondent promised to give the receipt later. Complainant waited 
patiently for it but it was never delivered. After the respondent had failed to 
deliver the receipt, complainant became suspicious and inquired from the 
provincial treasurer of Pampanga about the matter. Said official gave the 
information that the taxes were never paid. Consequently, complainant requested 
the respondent to refund the money given him for the payment of said taxes (p. 
7, t. s. n., OSG), but he failed to do so. Respondent made several promises to 
return the money which he never complied. Neither had he done anything to 
transfer the titles of the land in the name of the heirs of Esteban Henson up to 
the present (p. 9, t. s. n.). In view of this failure of the respondent, the 
complainant was ultimately forced to pay the taxes out of his own pocket (p. 8, 
t. s. n.)."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Required to answer the complaint formulated by the Solicitor 
General on the basis of his report, respondent failed to do so. And despite due 
notice he likewise failed to appear at the hearing before this Court. Indeed, we 
note from the Solicitor General's report that respondent, instead of welcoming 
every opportunity for hearing, seems to have wanted to avoid it. On this point 
the report says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"At the hearing held on May 26, 1948, both parties appeared and 
the complainant testified. After the complainant had testified, the hearing was 
set for continuance the following day. Both parties agreed in the presence of 
the investigator to postpone said hearing for June 5, 1948. One June 5, 1948, 
complainant appeared, but respondent did not show up, so to give the respondent 
a chance, the investigator postponed the continuation of the hearing to June 17. 
Both parties were duly supoenaed (attached to the records). On June 15th, 
respondent sent a letter (attached to the records) to Assistant Solicitor 
General Ruperto Kapunan, asking that the hearing be postponed to June 25, 1948. 
Acceding to the request, both parties were again duly subpoenaed for June 25, 
1948 (attached to the records). In the subpoena went to respondent, his 
attention was invited to Rule 127, section 28, of the Rules of Court, which 
provides that if he fails to appear and answer the charge, the Solicitor in 
charge will proceed to hear the case <i>ex parte</i>. In spite of this, on the 
morning of June 25, he again sent another letter (attached to the records) to 
Assistant Solicitor General Kapunan, asking that the hearing be transferred to 
July 7 or 8, 1948. In order that respondent may be given all the chances to 
defend himself, his request was granted. In the subpoena sent him setting the 
hearing for July 8, 1948, as requested, the following remark was stated:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">'Failure on your part to appear will cause the investigator to 
proceed with the investigation and to file the corresponding recommendation to 
the Supreme Court. No further postponement will be entertained.'</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is worthwhile mentioning that every time the case was set 
for hearing the complainant made his appearance.</p>
<p align="justify">"On the morning of July 8, 1948, both parties appeared; 
respondent made a formal request in person to the investigator asking that the 
hearing be postponed to 2 o'clock p.m. of the same day. Out of consideration to 
him, even to the discomfiture of complainant, respondents request was again 
granted. But contrary to his assurance, the respondent again failed to 
appear."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There is no question that respondent received from complainant 
the sum of P840 for the specific purpose of applying the same to the payment of 
taxes due from the estate which he was engaged to settle. The receipt which he 
issued for said amount as well as for the sum of P110 and a sack of rice paid to 
him for his expenses and fee reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<i>February 15, 1947</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">"Received from Mr. Briccio S. Henson the sum of eight hundred 
and forty (P840) pesos to be paid as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"P210—Inheritance tax of the heirs of late Don Esteban 
Henson.</p>
<p align="justify">"P630—Land taxes for 1945-1947.</p>
<p align="justify">"Failure on my part to deliver to him the official receipts 
corresponding to the above mentioned amount I promise to return to him the whole 
amount of P840 not later than April 16, 1947 without any obligation on his part. 
<br><br>"A separate amount of one hundred and ten (P110) pesos and a sack of 
rice was paid to me for my expenses and fee.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Atty. FELIX DAVID"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Respondent did not care to testify. But through his unverified 
answer, he would make it appear that he was entitled to and had been promised a 
legal fee for his services and that, as this promise was not complied with, he 
"saw it fit to withhold said amount (the P840.00 for taxes) until he is paid." 
This explanation is obviously an afterthought and clearly unfounded. For the 
established fact is that respondent at first made complainant believe that the 
sum in question had already been applied by him to the payment of taxes, and, as 
testified to by complainant, for the little that respondent was able to do in 
connection with the case entrusted to him, he has already received his fee as 
shown by the above-copied receipt. The conclusion is therefore irresistible that 
respondent misappropriated the money of his client. This makes him guilty of 
unprofessional conduct.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the gravity of the misconduct committed, the 
respondent Felix P. David is hereby ordered suspended from the practice of law 
for a period of five years from the date this decision becomes final, without 
prejudice to a more severe action if the sum misappropriated is not refunded 
within one month from the same date.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
