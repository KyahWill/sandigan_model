				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On May 28, 1957, plaintiff brought an action against defendant 
before the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte for breach of marital
 obligation and recovery of sums of money representing the value of 
certain personal effects.
  <p>  On June 11, 1957, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the 
ground that there was another action pending between the same parties 
for the same cause. After plaintiff has submitted his written 
opposition, the court sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint, 
whereupon plaintiff took the case to the Court of Appeals. The case was 
however certified to us on the ground that only questions of law are 
involved.</p>
  <p>  It is contended that the court <u>a quo</u> erred in dismissing 
the complaint on the ground that there is another action pending between
 the same parties for the same cause for the reason that the two cases 
do not involve the same facts and issues even if they involve the same 
parties.</p>
  <p>  This contention has no  merit. A cursory reading of the 
complaints filed in the two cases would readily reveal that they involve
 the same causes of action. Thus, in Civil Case No. 2569, the instant 
case, the complaint contains the following important allegations:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"3. That the defendant on or about the 15th day of September, 
1955, left the conjugal dwelling surreptitiously and without just cause 
after the plaintiff proposes to her that they should temporarily reside 
at Solsona, Ilocos Norte, to work in the farms and to hand the money of 
the plaintiff which he gave to her for safekeepings;</p>
    <p>"4. That since the said defendant left the conjugal dwelling she 
did never return and refused and still refuses to follow the domicile of
 the plaintiff without just cause;"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  In Civil Case No. 2385, which was pending between the same 
parties when the instant case was filed, the complaint likewise contains
 the following important allegations:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"4. That on or about the 15th day of September, 1955, the 
defendant, without any justifiable cause or reason, abandoned the 
plaintiffs and left them in their conjugal dwelling without leaving them
 any money or provisions for their support and maintenance;</p>
    <p>"5. That since that time on, the defendant has never returned to 
his wife and children nor has he ever sent provisions or money for the 
use and support of his abandoned family and refuses and continues to 
refuse to go back to them, thereby leaving the plaintiffs in total 
hardship and misery of living;"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    As it would appear, in one case, Monica Ligot charges her 
husband, Pablo Viloria, with abandonment committed against her and her 
minor children on September 15, 1955, while in the other case the same 
husband charges his wife also with abandonment committed against him on 
the same occasion, with the only difference that the husband merely 
inverted the situation by imputing the commission of the same act to his
 wife though the truth was, as claimed in the first case, it was he who 
abandoned the conjugal dwelling leaving behind his wife and his two 
children without support and protection.</p>
  <p>    The reliefs prayed for in both cases are also essentially the 
same. In one case, Monica Ligot and her children pray for maintenance 
and support, alimony <u>pendente lite</u>, accounting and delivery of 
conjugal funds and properties, moral damages and attorney's fees. In the
 other, Pablo Viloria prays for an order to compel his wife to live with
 him, for an accounting and delivery of the conjugal funds and 
properties, moral damages and attorney's fees.</p>
  <p>    From the foregoing, it is obvious that in the two cases there 
is identity of parties, issues and reliefs, and so the second case has 
no reason to exist. The lower court, therefore, did not err in 
dismissing the same.</p>
  <p>    It is worthy to note that Pablo Viloria filed the complaint in 
the present case almost one year after his wife had filed the previous 
one, and he did so despite the fact that  he could set up as a defense 
in the previous case the charges he is now imputing to his wife in the 
second. Why he took the instant case he was declared in default. He must
 have filed the instant case to circumvent the order of the court and 
avoid the legal consequences that may flow from his shortcoming.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs 
against appellant.</p>
