				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
ordering the defendant to vacate the upper part of the house located at 563 
Legarda, Manila, and to pay to the plaintiff the rents, from February 1945 until 
the premises are vacated, at the rate of P27.50 a month, and the costs.
<p>For some years previous to 1945 the defendant had been occupying the premises 
in question, paying a monthly rent therefor to the plaintiff and her 
predecessors in interest. On February 8, 1945, the plaintiff, having lost her 
residence on Soler street, notified the defendant to vacate the said premises. 
The defendant not only failed and refused to do so but likewise failed to pay 
the rents for the months of February and March 1945, for which reasons the 
plaintiff commenced in the Municipal Court of Manila this action, which.in the 
course of time was appealed to the Court of First Instance, with the result 
already indicated above.</p>
<p>In her first assignment of error the appellant invokes article 1566 of the 
Civil Code, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1566. If, on the expiration of the contract, the lessee, with the 
acquiescence of the lessor, continues for fifteen days to enjoy the thing 
leased, it shall be deemed that there has been an implied renewal for the time 
mentioned in Articles 1577 and 1581, unless notice to vacate has previously been 
given."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant's argument is that she having been permitted by the appellee to 
occupy the premises in question during the months of February and March, there 
was an implied renewal of the contract under the article above quoted. This 
contention is clearly untenable. Under article 1581 of the Civil Code, in the 
absence of an agreement as to the duration of the lease it is understood as 
being from month to month when the rent is on a monthly basis, and "the lease 
shall terminate without necessity of a special notice, upon the expiration of 
the term." (Estrella <em>vs</em>. Sangalang, p. 108, <em>ante</em>.) Moreover, 
the trial court found, and we find no basis in the record upon which to reverse 
its finding, that on February 8 the plaintiff, "braving the perils incident to 
the war," went to the defendant and told her to pay the rent for that month and 
vacate the premises. There is therefore the additional consideration in this 
case that the plaintiff had given the defendant notice to vacate before 
commencing the action. Furthermore, the defendant admits having failed to pay 
the rents corresponding to February and March 1945. Hence plaintiff's right to 
eject the defendant is indisputable.</p>
<p>In her second assignment of error the defendant and appellant contends that 
the trial court should have held that under the circumstances of emergency and 
as a matter of equity she cannot be deprived of the possession of the leased 
premises. A similar contention was advanced by the appellant and rejected by 
this Court in the case of Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Prudencio, (p. 111, <em>ante</em>). In the instant case the defendant has been 
unlawfully withholding from the plaintiff the possession of the premises in 
question for more than a year; and the plaintiff pleads before us that she was 
compelled to bring the present action not so much to collect the rent as to 
acquire a place where she and her nine children could live, "they being victims 
of the general conflagration occasioned by the Japanese armed forces upon the 
liberation of Manila," and that "the said appellee is a widow who, but for the 
accommodation extended to her by her sister-in-law, with her nine children would 
be sleeping in the streets."</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p><em>De Joya, Perfecto, Hilado,</em> 
and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
