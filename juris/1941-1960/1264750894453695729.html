				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Mariano Villamor and Eustaquia Leopoldo were husband and wife.&nbsp; Both died intestate, the former on October 20, 1952,&nbsp; and the latter in December,&nbsp; 1&amp;41, in the municipality of Oroquieta, Misamis&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was their&nbsp; last known residence at the time of their demise. Upon their&nbsp; death, they left conjugal properties, real&nbsp; and personal, said to be worth 15,000.<br><br>These&nbsp; spouses had five children, to wit: Calixta Villamor (now deceased and mother of Doroteo, Matias, Victor&nbsp; and Wilijado, surnamed Romero);&nbsp; and Pedro, Hilaria, Aniceta and Eusebia,&nbsp; also&nbsp; surnamed Villamor.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears from the record that on January 23,&nbsp; 1949, the estate of&nbsp; said couple was&nbsp; partitioned extra judicially inter&nbsp; vivos by the widower&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; Villamor among&nbsp; the four&nbsp; surviving children&nbsp; of&nbsp; said spouses and their grandchildren, issue of the predeceased&nbsp; daughter Calixta,&nbsp; who were represented by their&nbsp; father Luciano Romero, as their natural guardian; but apparently,&nbsp; the children of Luciano Romero and&nbsp; Calixta&nbsp; Villamor were not&nbsp; agreeable to said partition,&nbsp; and questioning the validity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; partition&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as the authority of their father&nbsp; to&nbsp; represent them because he had not&nbsp; been judicially appointed&nbsp; as their administrator, they asked&nbsp; their uncle and&nbsp; aunts&nbsp; to cause the institution of an&nbsp; intestate proceeding for the adjudication of the properties left by their&nbsp; parents or grandparents.&nbsp; As his uncle and&nbsp; aunts refused to do so, Doroteo&nbsp; Romero instituted special proceedings&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 225&nbsp; on March 23, 1953,&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Misamis&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; praying in the&nbsp; petition that letters of administration of the estate of the deceased couple Mariano Villamor and Eustaquia Leopoldo&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to him,&nbsp; and that in the&nbsp; meantime, pending hearing of the petition and for the protection, of the interests of&nbsp; the&nbsp; surviving heirs in the estate&nbsp; left by said&nbsp; deceased spouses, the petitioner&nbsp; or any other person that&nbsp; the Honorable Court may deem capable, be appointed as special administrator upon filing a bond with.Sufficient solvent sureties&nbsp; in the amount to be fixed by the Court, The&nbsp; petition for the&nbsp; opening of these&nbsp; intestate proceedings was&nbsp; objected to&nbsp; by Pedro, Aniceta and Eusebia Villamor, who&nbsp; moved for the dismissal of the petition, on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; already&nbsp; partitioned&nbsp; since 1949; notwithstanding which and after the usual procedure. for such cases provided, the Court, by order of August 15, 1958, delegated the Clerk of Court to receive the evidence as to the propriety of the&nbsp; appointment of an administrator in this case,&nbsp; and by order of October 3,&nbsp; 1953, designated Doroteo Romero to check, without compensation, on all the produce of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property listed or mentioned in&nbsp; the so-called&nbsp; extrajudicial&nbsp; partition dated&nbsp; January 23,&nbsp; 1041 (Exhibit&nbsp; 1).<br><br>On October 12,&nbsp; 1953, the oppositors above named&nbsp; filed a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of the orders of August. 15 and&nbsp; October 3,&nbsp; 1953, and&nbsp; after considering the arguments adduced by both parties, the Court, by&nbsp; order of March 5, 1954, denied the motion for reconsideration of the orders. of the&nbsp; Court of August 15 and October 3, 1953, as without merit.&nbsp; In view of this&nbsp; outcome, the oppositors&nbsp; filed on March 17, 1954, their notice of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Supreme Court from the&nbsp; orders of the court dated August&nbsp; 15 and October 3, 1953, and March 5,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that they were contrary to&nbsp; law; but when&nbsp; the record on appeal was&nbsp; approved,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; judge&nbsp; erroneously directed the clerk of his court to forward the&nbsp; records&nbsp; of&nbsp; this case to the Court of Appeals, which certified the case to this Court. It&nbsp; is&nbsp; immediately apparent that the widower Mariano Villamor had no legal authority to&nbsp; liquidate and distribute the estate&nbsp; of his predeceased wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; power of&nbsp; the widower under the Civil&nbsp; Code of 1889, to liquidate&nbsp; the conjugal partnership upon his wife's demise&nbsp; had disappeared as of 24 November 1924 with the&nbsp; passage of&nbsp; Act 3176 of the Philippine Legislature (Calma vs.&nbsp; Tafiedo, 66 Phil.&nbsp; 594), now embodied in Rule&nbsp; 75,&nbsp; section 2 of&nbsp; the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Clearly,&nbsp; therefore, the respondents&nbsp; had the right to&nbsp; commence intestate proceedings for the&nbsp; distribution of&nbsp; their grandmother's&nbsp; estate, since&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter was&nbsp; not validly partitioned.<br><br>With regard to the estate of Mariano Villamor himself the (basic issue and the one&nbsp; of which all&nbsp; the others&nbsp; are subordinate,&nbsp; is the validity of the extrajudicial partition inter vivos made on January 23, 1949, with the intervention of Mariano Villamor and his children, as well as the father of the respondents, who&nbsp; were minors at the time.&nbsp; It is upon this&nbsp; partition&nbsp; that appellants predicate their&nbsp; opposition to the judicial estate proceedings. While Article 1056&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1889,&nbsp; which was&nbsp; the government law in 1949,&nbsp; authorizes a testator to make a partition of his estate by act inter vivos, this Court has&nbsp; ruled that the validity of any such distribution rests upon the prior making of a&nbsp; valid testament,&nbsp; with all the formalities prescribed&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; the&nbsp; partition&nbsp; inter vivos being but&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution thereof (Legasto&nbsp; vs. Verzosa, 54 Phil. 766;&nbsp; Fajardo&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Fajardo, 54 Phil. 842).&nbsp; Since Mariano Villamor died intestate, on&nbsp; 20 October 1952,&nbsp; and this&nbsp; fact is&nbsp; not controverted, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the inescapable&nbsp; conclusion that&nbsp; the partition inter vivos of his estate is&nbsp; void and&nbsp; of no effect.&nbsp; In Legasto vs. Verzosa, supra, this Court<br><br>"It is thus&nbsp; seen that both&nbsp; the&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; Supreme Court and the learned&nbsp; and authoritive commentator, Manresa, affe&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opinion that a testator may, by an act inter vivos, partition his property, but he must first make&nbsp; a "will with all the formalities provided for by law. And it could not be otherwise, for&nbsp; without a will there can be no testator; when the&nbsp; law, therefore,&nbsp; speaks of the&nbsp; partition inter vivos made&nbsp; by a testator of his property,&nbsp; it necessarily refers to that property&nbsp; which he has&nbsp; devised to his heirs.&nbsp; A person who dispose&nbsp; of his property gratis inter vivos is not called&nbsp; a&nbsp; testator, but a donor.&nbsp; In employing' the word&nbsp; "testator", the law evidently desired to&nbsp; distinguished between one who freely donates his&nbsp; property in life and one who disposes of it by will to&nbsp; take effect after death." (Rec. App., pp. 25-26.)<br><br>It is true&nbsp; that when&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; Villamor died,&nbsp; the new Civil Code was already in effect,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that its Article 1080 now permits&nbsp; any person&nbsp; (not&nbsp; a testator,&nbsp; as under&nbsp; the&nbsp; old law) to&nbsp; partition his&nbsp; estate by&nbsp; act inter&nbsp; vivos; but&nbsp; the validity of any such partition must be&nbsp; determined as&nbsp; of the date&nbsp; it&nbsp; was executed or&nbsp; accomplished, not&nbsp; the date when the&nbsp; author&nbsp; dies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code so&nbsp; provides in&nbsp; its Article 2256:<br><blockquote>"Art. 2256.&nbsp; Acts and contracts under&nbsp; the regime of the old laws, if they&nbsp; are&nbsp; valid in accordance therewith, shall&nbsp; continue&nbsp; to be fully operative as provided in the same, with the limitations&nbsp; established in&nbsp; these rules.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; revocation&nbsp; or modification of&nbsp; these&nbsp; acts and contracts&nbsp; after&nbsp; the beginning of the effectivity of&nbsp; this Code, shall be subject to the&nbsp; provisions of this new body of laws."</blockquote>There is no rule in the new&nbsp; Civil Code giving its Article 1080 retroactive effect; on the other hand, Art. 4&nbsp; expressly provides that "laws shall have no&nbsp; retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided."&nbsp; The law in force at the demise of the decedent simply determines the legal shares of the heirs,&nbsp; but respects the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of his&nbsp; prior dispositions in so far&nbsp; as compatible with&nbsp; the&nbsp; new&nbsp; law.&nbsp; Article 2263 provides:<br><br>"Art. 2263. Rights to the inheritance of&nbsp; a person who died, with or without a will, before the effectivity of this Code, shall be governed by the&nbsp; Civil Code of 1889, by other previous laws, and by the Rules of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inheritance of those who,&nbsp; with or&nbsp; without" a&nbsp; will, die after the&nbsp; beginning of&nbsp; the effectivity of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Code, shall&nbsp; be adjudicated and distributed in accordance&nbsp; with this&nbsp; new body&nbsp; of laws and by&nbsp; the Rules of Court;&nbsp; but&nbsp; the testamentary provisions shall be carried out insofar as&nbsp; they may be permitted by the Code. Therefore,&nbsp; legitimes, betterments, legacies and&nbsp; bequests&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be respected;&nbsp; however, their amount shall be reduced&nbsp; if in&nbsp; no other manner can every compulsory heir be given his full share according to this Code,"<br><br>The proposed partition inter vivos of the estate of Mariano Viliamor not being valid or effective, it is unnecessary to&nbsp; inquire whether or not&nbsp; the father of the&nbsp; appellees had authority to represent them&nbsp; therein.<br><br>Premises&nbsp; considered,&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from are affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coats against appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C, J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
