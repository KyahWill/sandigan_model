during&nbsp; the first&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; (20)&nbsp; days of July,&nbsp; 1948, defendant Macondray &amp; Co., Inc., has paid to the Bureau of Customs the sum of eleven thousand&nbsp; two hundred ninety seven and 85/100 pesos&nbsp; (P11,297.85)&nbsp; as advance&nbsp; percentage tax on importation during the said first&nbsp; twenty (20)&nbsp; days&nbsp; of&nbsp; July,&nbsp; 1948, which is&nbsp; within the third quarter of 1948;<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; the defendant Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. applied the sum of eleven&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; two&nbsp; hundred ninety&nbsp; seven&nbsp; and&nbsp; 85/100&nbsp; pesos (P11,297.85)&nbsp; to the portion of the taxes due during the first twenty (20) days of July, 1948, thereby leaving a balance&nbsp;

After the&nbsp; parties had&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; their memoranda, the Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; judgment absolving the defendant&nbsp; taxpayer&nbsp; from liability&nbsp; for alleged unpaid percentage&nbsp; tax due in&nbsp; 1933 and surcharge thereon&nbsp; in&nbsp; the total&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P587.60 on the sole basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; index card Exhibit&nbsp; A, but holding it liable for payment of P2,844.46 due as 25% surcharge on P11,297.85 for late payment of percentage tax for the second quarter&nbsp; of 1948.&nbsp; The dispositive&nbsp; part of the judgment reads as&nbsp; follows':<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, Macondray &amp; Company, Inc., together with the Fidelity &amp; Surety Company of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands are hereby ordered to pay jointly and severally&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P2,844.46 to the plaintiff&nbsp; Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines thru the&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; The defendants are hereby absolved of the plaintiff's claim of P587.60 and&nbsp; the bond executed by defendants for said sum&nbsp; is hereby declared of no effect.<br><br>In the&nbsp; event the defendant Fidelity &amp; Surety Company of the Philippine Islands should pay the herein sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P2,844.46 unto the plaintiff, the defendant Macondray &amp; Company, Inc. is hereby ordered to reimburse the said Fidelity&nbsp; &amp; Surety&nbsp; Company&nbsp; the same amount. With costs against defendants.<br><br>SO ORDERED<br><br>Manila, Philippines, September 28, 1956.<br></blockquote>The defendant taxpayer filed a petition&nbsp; to review&nbsp; that part of the judgment adverse to it.&nbsp; The defendant surety company did&nbsp; not. Section&nbsp; 183,&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (A), of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 253, partly provides:<br><blockquote>The percentage&nbsp; taxes, on business shall be payable at the end of each calendar quarter&nbsp; in the amount lawfully due on the business transacted during each quarter; and it shall be the duty of every person conducting a business on which&nbsp; a percentage tax is imposed under this Title, within twenty days after the end of each calendar quarter, to make a true and complete return of the amount of the gross sales, receipts, or earnings,&nbsp; or gross value of output actually removed from the factory or mill warehouse, during the preceding calendar quarter and pay the tax thereon: * * *.<br></blockquote>Paragraph (B)&nbsp; of the same section and Code, as amended, partly provides:<br><blockquote>In the case of imported articles, the&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; taxes established in sections one&nbsp; hundred and eighty-four, one hundred&nbsp; eighty-five, and one hundred and eighty-six of this Code shall be paid in advance by the importer, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Finance and prior to the release of such articles from customs' custody, based on the total value thereof&nbsp; at the time they are received by the importer, including freight, postage, insurance, commission, customs duty, and all similar charges.&nbsp; In the case of locally&nbsp; produced or&nbsp; manufactured&nbsp; articles,&nbsp; the&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; taxes established in the said sections shall likewise be paid&nbsp; in advance on the&nbsp; total value thereof prior to&nbsp; removal from the&nbsp; producer's or manufacturer's warehouse.&nbsp; The amount so paid in advance in accordance with this subsection shall be credited against the percentage taxes due on the sales by the taxpayer for each calendar quarter.<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the foregoing&nbsp; provision of law,&nbsp; on&nbsp; 16&nbsp; June 1948 the&nbsp; Secretary of Finance&nbsp; promulgated Revenue Regulations No. V-3 (Exhibit D), published in 44&nbsp; Off. Gaz. 1459-1461.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 5&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>It shall be the duty of every importer, manufacturer or producer, within twenty days after the end&nbsp; of&nbsp; every&nbsp; calendar quarter, to make a true and complete return&nbsp; of the amount of the gross sales during the preceding calendar quarter and pay the tax due thereon. (Sec. 183(A),&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code, as&nbsp; amended by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 253.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount paid in&nbsp; advance&nbsp; by&nbsp; importers, manufacturers&nbsp; and producers shall be credited against the percentage&nbsp; taxes due&nbsp; on&nbsp; their&nbsp; sales&nbsp; for&nbsp; each&nbsp; calendar quarter.&nbsp; (Sec. 183, Id.)<br></blockquote>The percentage tax on business&nbsp; due from the petitioner during the second&nbsp; quarter of 1948&nbsp; (April to June)&nbsp; was P177,058.26 payable&nbsp; within the first twenty days of&nbsp; July 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the first twenty days of July&nbsp; 1948 the&nbsp; petitioner paid the&nbsp; sum of P11,297.85 as advance percentage tax on goods or merchandise already imported and to be imported during the third quarter of 1948.&nbsp; When on 20 July 1948 the petitioner paid the&nbsp; percentage tax due for the&nbsp; second quarter, it considered and credited&nbsp; the sum of P11,297.85 as payment of the percentage tax&nbsp; on business due during the second&nbsp; quarter of 1948&nbsp; (Exhibit 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; and did&nbsp; not&nbsp; claim any credit for the amount when it paid the percentage tax due&nbsp; for the&nbsp; third quarter&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 2). This the petitioner cannot do because the&nbsp; sum of P11,297.85 was paid in Advance as percentage tax on goods or merchandise already imported and to be&nbsp; imported during the third quarter of 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the sum of P11,297.85 which was due for the second&nbsp; quarter of&nbsp; 1948 was not paid within the first twenty days of&nbsp; July 1048 as by law provided, and&nbsp; for that reason the surcharge&nbsp; of 25% or P2,844.46 was lawfully imposed.&nbsp; In other words, the sum of P11,297.85 paid in advance by the petitioner for goods or merchandise already imported and to be imported cannot be imputed to the&nbsp; percentage tax on business due for the second quarter of&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; because&nbsp; such sum was paid in advance,&nbsp; as&nbsp; provided for in section 183&nbsp; (B)&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 253, and not as a percentage tax on business, as provided&nbsp; for in section&nbsp; 183&nbsp; (A)&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; Code, as amended.<br><br>The judgment under review is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
