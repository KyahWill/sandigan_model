				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On or about April 13, 1952, Lionel D. Hargis, an American citizen, died in 
the City of Oakland, County of Alameda, California, U.S.A. He left real and 
personal properties in the United. States apprised at P430,952.14 and personal 
properties in the Philippines consisting mostly of shares of stock and equities 
finally appraised at P927,835.07. The respondents are the heirs of the deceased 
except Thomas M. Jordan who is merely a legatee and the ancillary executor in 
the Philippines of his Testate Estate. In view of the reappraisal of the estate, 
an amended assessment notice was issued on May 21, 1954, demanding the payment 
of (1) an estate tax in the amount of P87,397.54, instead of the original 
P88,270.46 which had been paid and (2) a total deficiency inheritance tax, 
surcharge, interest and penalty from the heirs and legatee in the amount of 
P147,192.19, after crediting the estate with a previous partial payment of 
P25,715.53. The respondents contested the assessment of the deficiency 
inheritance tax in the sum of P147,192.19 and requested the refund of the sum of 
P25,715,53. Upon refusal of the petitioner, the case was brought before the 
Court of Tax Appeals which rendered a decision in favor of the respondents. The 
petitioner has appealed.<p></p>
<p>In claiming exemption from the inheritance tax on the transmission of 
intangible personal properties of the deceased in the Philippines, the 
respondents rely on the reciprocity prevision contained in section 122 of the 
Tax Code which reads as follows; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"xxx And provided, further, That no tax shall be collected under this Title 
in respect of intangible personal property (a) if the decedent at the time of 
his death was a resident of a foreign country which at the time of his death did not impose a transfer tax or death tax cf any character in respect of Intangible 
personal property of citizens of the Philippines not residing in that country, 
or (b) if the laws of the foreign country of which the decedent was a resident 
at the time of his death allow a similar exemption from transfer taxes or death 
taxes of every character in respect of intangible personal property owned by 
citizens of the Philippines net residing in that foreign country,"</p>
</blockquote><p>The foregoing reciprocity provision, according to the respondents, finds its 
complement in Section 13351 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of California (of 
which the deceased was a citizen and resident) which provides as follows; 
<br></p><blockquote><p><br>"Intangible personal property is exempt from the tax imposed by this 
part if the decedent at the time of his death was a resident of territory or 
another State of the United States or of a foreign state or country which then 
imposed a legacy, succession, or death tax in respect to intangible personal 
property of its own residents but either: (a) Did not impose a legacy, 
succession, or death tax of any character in respect to intangible personal 
property of residents of this State; or (b) Had in its laws a reciprocal 
provision under which intangible personal property of a nonresident was exempt 
from legacy, succession, or death taxes of every character if the Territory or 
other State of United States or foreign state or country in which the 
nonresident reside allowed a similar exemption in respect to intangible personal 
property of residents of the Territory or State of tho United States or foreign 
state or country of residence of the decedent."<br><br></p></blockquote><p>Section 122 of the Tax Code imposes the following conditions for exemption from estate and inheritance 
taxes: <br></p><blockquote><p>Under provision (a)-</p></blockquote>

<p>Section 122 (b), mainly relied upon by the respondents requires that "the laws 
cf the foreign country x x x allow a similar exemption." Contrary to 
petitioner's theory, foreign country as thus used may refer either to the 
Federal Government or to the individual States of the Union like California; for 
each State of the United States is supreme and independent, and has its own 
government with full powers of taxation and appropriation cf the revenue derived 
therefrom.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Section 13851 very clearly employs 
words allowing a similar exemption from transfer taxes or death taxes in respect 
to intangible personal property of residents of the "Territory or State of the 
United States or foreign state or country. By express phraseology, it accurately 
contemplates, aside from territory or other state of the United States, foreign 
state or country. Petitioner's contention, therefore, that the exemption in said 
section was intended only for states or territories of the United States is 
untenable. Reciprocity exists also with any "foreign state or country." </p>
<p>The petitioner further invoices the grammatical interpretation of the 
conjunction "or" in arguing that for reciprocity to exist, the exemption in one 
laws concerned must be on both inheritance and estate taxes. This is erroneous 
because section 122(b) plainly uses "or" in its ordinary meaning, to convey 
alternative relations. At any rate, the state of California does not impose 
"estate tax"; it is the Federal Government that imposes and collects the same 
under Section 860 (53 Stat. 129; see also Federal Code Annotated, Vol. 6, 1063) 
of the U. S. Federal Estate Tax Law. Under this promise, only exemption from the 
inheritance tax can be granted by the State of California. Moreover, as pointed 
out by the respondents, at the time of adoption of the National Internal Revenue 
Code in 1939, the Philippines was a dependency of the United States and there 
were many non-resident Filipinos owning intangible personal properties in 
several states of the United States, and on the other hand there were numerous 
American non-residents who owned similar properties here. The reciprocity 
involved was undoubtedly conceived for their benefit.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby, affirmed, without costs. So 
ordered.</p>
