				<H3>ADRIANO CHUA JOY, PETITIONER-APPELLEE, VS. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT-APPELLANT
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated May 
25, 1956, declaring null and void the distraint and levy issued by the Collector 
of Internal Revenue on January 26 same year, and ordering him to desist from 
taking any further proceedings thereunder and to return the properties 
seized,
<p>Said decision was issued upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings in a 
Petition for Review with Preliminary Injunction by Adriano Chua Joy, which was 
duly answered by respondent official. The facts as shown by the pleadings are 
these:</p>
<p>On August 10, 1948, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed against 
petitioner as war profits tax, surcharge included,the sum of P20,145.00 and as 
income tax, surcharge included, the total amount of P123,529.14 for the years 
1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1945 and 1946. Petitioner disputed the assessments, but 
expressed willingness to pay liabilities up to P19,187.74. The Collector 
insisted on his assessment and on January 26, 1956, issued a warrant of 
distraint and levy which was served upon petitioner and executed on February 9, 
1956, by the seizure of his three motorships Neptune, Apolo and Diana and some 
motor vehicles and office equipment. Sale at public auction of such properties 
was set for May 26, 1956.</p>
<p>On March 9, 1956, this petition was filed.</p>
<p>After considering memoranda submitted by the parties, the Court of Tax 
Appeals held that in view of the number of years that had passed from the time 
of assessment in 1948 the Collector of Internal Revenue lost the power to 
collect in 1956 the taxes allegedly due by the summary method of distraint and 
levy, in view of the provision of sec. 51(d) of the National Internal Revenue 
Code, which is also applicable to war profits taxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the case at bar," explained the Court below, "the records do not show the 
dates when the returns were made and filed. Even if we were to be very liberal 
to the respondent and assume that the returns were made and filed on the same 
day when the assessment was made, that is, on August 10, 1948, and count the 
three-year statutory period of limitation from said date, undoubtedly, the 
authority of the Collector of Internal Revenue to collect the income tax 
assessed against petitioner for the years 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1945 and 1946 
by distraint and levy or by any other summary method had already long prescribed 
when the warrant of distraint and levy was issued and executed on February 9, 
1956, more than seven (7) years and five (5) months after the assessment in 
question was made. Accordingly, the said warrant of distraint and levy was 
issued in violation of sec. 51(d) of the Revenue Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Court cited several decisions of this Tribunal in support of its 
view.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>The appellant insists that the Court of Tax Appeals has no power or 
jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin the collection of taxes by distraint. This 
issue has been decided against the Government in Collector v. Reyes, G. R. No. 
L-8695, January 21, 1957 and Collector v. Zulueta G. R. No. L-8840, February 8, 
1957; Collector v. Avelino L-9202, November 19, 1956; Collector v. Aznar 
L-10370, January 31, 1958, which are cases similar to this. In fairness to 
appellant, however, it must be stated that this appeal was perfected and the 
appellant's brief was filed on or before October 12, 1956.</p>
<p>Appellant further insists that the prescription period for the collection of 
these taxes has been suspended by the several requests for reconsideration filed 
by respondent Adriano Chua Joy. However, this case was submitted to the Court of 
Tax Appeals on the parties' pleadings, which do not mention such requests. And 
the expediente before us does not show any document in support of such defense 
against the taxpayer's plea of prescription.</p>
<p>No reversible error in the appealed decision. It is therefore affirmed.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</p>
