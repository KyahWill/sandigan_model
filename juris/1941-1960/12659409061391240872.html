				<H3>MIGUEL FLORENDO, CELEDONIO FLORENDO, TRINIDAD FLORENDO, ESPERANZA F. VDA. DE ITCHON, AND FELIX VERZOSA, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOCOS SUR AND JUAN S. FLORENTINO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On August 17, 1955, the now respondent Juan S. Florentino filed a petition in 
the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur for the probate of the will of 
Concepcion Ontanon and for his appointment as administrator of her estate. The 
petition alleged that the testatrix died on the 8th of that same month, leaving 
properties worth not less than P37,450.00; that she was survived by no forced 
heirs; and that, according to information, her nearest relatives were Miguel, 
Celedonio, Trinidad and Esperanza, all surnamed Florendo. <p></p>
<p>Probate of the will was opposed by several sets of alleged relatives, who, on 
the basis of their respective claims, may be grouped into two categories: third 
degree relatives (alleged nephews and nieces of the testatrix) and fourth degree 
relatives (her alleged first cousins). However, at the instance of the proponent 
of the will, the court ordered the opposition of the first cousins discarded on 
the theory that, in case of intestacy and absence of forced heirs, the nearest 
relatives exclude the more distant ones and that, as held in Paras <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> 
Narciso (39 Phil. 244), "strangers should not be permitted, over the objections 
of the real parties in interest, to embarrass the proceedings by meddling or 
intruding themselves in matters with which they have no concern." </p>
<p>Reconsideration of this order was asked by the Florendos, four of the alleged 
first cousins, on the ground that though their relationship to the testatrix was 
more remote than that of her alleged nephews and nieces, the latter were, on the 
other hand, illegitimate relatives and hence not entitled to inherit from her. 
But the court, after hearing evidence, found no reason to alter its ruling and 
resolved to maintain the order sought to be reconsidered. </p>
<p>Some five months after this resolution, the Florendos, now joined by Felix 
Verzosa, another alleged first cousin of the deceased, filed a second motion for 
reconsideration. At first, the court, at that time already presided by another 
judge, resolved "to give the movants opportunity to present their evidence in 
support of their motion"; but it later desisted from doing so upon becoming 
aware that the order whose reconsideration was being sought for the second time 
and which had already become final, "was not interlocutory hut a final order in 
so far as they (the movants) were concerned because it effectively excluded them 
from participating in the proceedings (Angel Ortiz <i>vs.</i> Grant Trent, 13 
Phil. 131)" and no appeal was taken therefrom within the reglementary period. 
The court, therefore, rejected the second motion for reconsideration by 
reaffirming the order sought to be reconsidered. </p>
<p>Two months after the denial of their second motion for reconsideration, the 
Florendos, later joined by Felix Verzosa, came to this Court with the present 
petition for certiorari and mandamus, asking that the order discarding their 
opposition to the probate of the will and whose reconsideration had already been 
denied twice be set aside and the lower court compelled to allow them to 
prosecute the said opposition. </p>
<p>Answering the petition, the respondents called attention to the fact that the 
order complained of had long become final and could, for that reason, no longer 
be disturbed. </p>
<p>The petition must, in our opinion, be denied. As pointed out by the learned 
trial judge, the order discarding petitioners' opposition to the probate of the 
will was a final one in so far as they were concerned and, therefore, 
appealable. This view is in accord with the opinion of this Court in the 
above-cited case of Angel Ortiz <i>vs.</i> Grant Trent. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span>, also, section 1[e] 
of Rule 105.) Petitioners could, therefore, have appealed the order to cure any 
defect or infirmity therein. But they neglected to do so and allowed the order 
to become final. Having thus lost their remedy by appeal due to their own 
neglect, they cannot now seek redress by certiorari and mandamus, it not 
appearing that the lower court has acted without jurisdiction. (Profeta et al. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Gutierrez David et al., 71 Phil, 582.) Certiorari and mandamus will 
not lie as a substitute for an appeal. Especialty would this be true where, as 
in the present case, the factual basis of the order complained of is challenged 
so that there is need of going into the sufficiency of the evidence presented. 
</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition for certiorari and mandamus is denied, with costs 
against the petitioners. </p>

Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur. </p></div>
