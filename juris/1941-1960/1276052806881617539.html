				<H3>RODOLFO GERARDO (ALIAS MAGELLAN GERARDO), PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOCOS NORTE, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner, accused of murder in Criminal Case No. 938 of the
Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, files this petition for
certiorari to set aside certain orders of that court, to revoke an order
of the Justice of the Peace of Laoag, to order his release on bail for
P20,000 so that he can prepare for his trial, and to issue a
preliminary injunction to restrain the respondent Judge from hearing
his case until after this petition shall have been decided. The prayer
for preliminary injunction was granted.
<p>It appears that the Justice oft the Peace of Laoag, after
conducting a preliminary investigation set the defendant's bail at
P40,000 for his temporary release. Having failed to put up a bond and
having been bound over to the Court of First Instance for trial, the
defendant asked the latter court to reduce the amount required by the
Justice of the Peace to P20,000.00, The Provincial Fiscal not only
objected to the requested reduction but moved that the accused's
application for bail be totally denied. Thereupon Judge Manuel P.
Barcelona directed the prosecution "to introduce such of its witnesses
on the witness stand as he may deem sufficient so as to give a chance
to the defense to cross examine them," and authorized the defense to
present counter evidence.</p>
<p> But such hearing was postponed four times and trial on the merits
twice, all at the instance of the accused. Impatient at these repeated
continuances, Judge Belmonte (Judge Barcelona having been detailed to
another court) set the case for trial on the merits for November 14,
1949 apparently with a warning that no further request for postponement
would be entertained.</p>
<p> It was that trial which, the defendant succeeded in preventing,
thanks to this Court's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.
And he would not under any circumstances go to trial, if he could have
his way, unless he was first set free on bail at the amount fixed by
him. </p>
<p>In Ocampo <em>vs</em>. Bernabe (43 Off. Gaz., 1632 August), <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
this Court held that, since the discretion to grant bail in capital
offenses depends on the weight of evidence, such, evidence should be
exhibited before the court. This Court added that the hearing of an
application for bail may be summary or otherwise, in the court's
discretion.</p>
<p> This ruling implies that the court is not obliged to conduct a
separate proceeding to determine the right of an accused to be admitted
to bail.</p>
<p> It appearing that the trial which the defendant has succeeded in
having suspended had for one of its purposes, as the respondent Judge
alleges, precisely to determine whether bail should be allowed, it is
clear that His Honor did not exceed his jurisdiction or abused his
discretion. In a way, a regular trial has advantage over a summary one
as a means of reaching a decision on an application for bail, in that
"new presumptions as to the prisoner's guilt or innocence are raised
with each step of the prosecution." At any rate, the court has the
choice of method to attain this end.</p>
<p> This Court can not pass upon the question of the petitioner's right
to bail as there is nothing before us showing the character and extent
of the proof the prosecution has against him. Not even a copy of the
information is attached to the petition, nor are there allegations
touching upon such evidence.</p>
<p> The most the defendant could ask for would be an order issued to
the Court of First Instance to grant him an opportunity to show that he
is entitled to bail. But such opportunity was offered to or even
pressed upon him and he refused to take advantage of it for reasons
which we do not think were meritorious at all.</p>
<p> The petition is denied and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued is dissolved, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<em>Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor</em>, and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur.
