</style><div align="justify">On November 1, 1926, the defendants herein, Pedro Bucag and Bibiano Bucag, 
their sister, Irene Bucag, and their mother, Ambrocia Malenab, conveyed a 
certain parcel of land (unirrigated) situated in Angadanan, Isabela, to the 
spouses Faustino Andres and Petra Abara, in consideration of an amount of 
P1,620, which the former had received from the latter by way of indebtedness. 
The pertinent parts of the deed of conveyance are as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Declaramos que hemos tomado prestados, ademas, de dichos esposo P140.00, 
montando con esto, por tanto, todo el dinero recibido de elloss por nosotros 
incluyendo 1os P700.00 tomados por el difunto Hermenegildo Bucag a MIL SEIS 
CIENTOS VIENTO PESOS (P1620.00), y convenimos, coma asi lo habia prometido el 
difunto Hermenegildo Bucag que nuestro referido terreno quedara en poder de 
Faustino Andres y Petra Abara para que lo cultivan de tabaco y maiz, o lo manden 
cultivar, si asi lo desean, sin que ellos tangan que pagarnos conon o alquiler 
del terreno, en consideracion a que no les pagamos tampoco intereses del dinero 
que les hemos tomado en prestamo."</p>
<p>"Declaramos tambien que , en cuanto tengamos dinero con que rescatar el 
referido terreno, o para devolverles en los años venideros a Faustino Andres y 
Petra Abara los P1620.00 con que hemos hipotecado el terreno, dichos esposos 
deberan devolvernos el terreno, despues de recibir de nosotros la citada 
cantidad de P1620.00."</p>
<p>x x x x x x</p>
<p>"Prometemos que mientras no hayomos de vuelto la referidad cantidad, no 
podremos caltivarlo ni quitarlo del poder do los mencionados esposos, ni 
podremos venderlo, a menos de que antes paguemos el dinero mencionado en este 
documento, con que hepotecamos el arriba mencionado terreno." (Traduccion del 
Exhibito "A").</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the stipulation of facts entered into by the parties, the land 
produces 60 bales of tobacco, 20 measures (<u>tancales</u>) of corn and 40 
cavans of peanuts, valued at P8.00 per bale, P8.00 per measure (<u>tancal</u>) 
and P5.00 per cavan, respectively. According to 1ocal custom, one-third of the 
products is the share of the owner or possessor of land in the produce.</p>
<p>The heirs of Faustino Andres and Petra Abara tranferred the land to Victorino 
Verzosa, plaintiff herein, in 1948, in consideration of the sum of Pl,000, and 
plaintiff was in possession and enjoyment thereof from then until November 29, 
1950, when the defendants took possession without the consent of the plaintiff 
and without returning the amount of indebtedness. The defendants are two of the 
signers of the original deed of conveyance, Exhibit A.</p>
<p>The present action was instituted on January 24, 1951. The plaintiff alleges 
that he is entitled to the possession of the land by virtue of deeds of 
conveyance, Exhibit A and Exhibit B. The defendants in answer allege that the 
deed of conveyance, Exhibit A, by virtue of which plaintiff’s predecessors in 
interest were in possession of the property, is null and void us the contract 
contained the rein is usurious, and that their (defendants) original 
indebtedness has been sufficiently paid from the products of the land during the 
time that it was in the possession of the plaintiff and his predecessors in 
interest. The parties submitted the case for decision upon a stipulation of 
facts, .the most important of which have been set forth above. The trial court 
held that the claim of the defendants that the indebtedness has already been 
paid from the products of the laid so as to make the contract one of antichresis 
is not justified by the evidence, and that neither was the transaction usurious 
or contrary to good morals or public policy. It further held that defendants 
could not recover the property without first paying the amount of the 
indebtedness. The trial court, therefore, ordered the defendants to return the 
possession of the land to the plaintiff, and for their wrongful possession of 
the property, the defendants were also ordered to pay to the plaintiff the sum 
of P200.00 as liquidated damages and P200.00 every year from November 29, 1950 
until the possession of the land in returned. Against this decision, an appeal 
was prosecuted in the Court of Appeals, which, however, certified the case to us 
on the ground that only questions of law are involved.</p>
<p>The principal contentions of the appellants are: that the contract Exhibit A 
is usurious and, therefore, void; that the trial court erred in not declaring 
that the contract (Exhibit A) is antichretic in character, and that the 
appellants have fully paid the amount of indebtedness and in ordering them to 
return the possession of the property to the plaintiff and the payment to him of 
damages.</p>
<p>A careful study of the contract Exhibit A discloses the existence of three 
provisions which are indicative of the contract as one mortgage and not of 
antichresis. In the first place, it is agreed that the full amount of the 
indebtedness of P1,620 must be returned to the lenders before the borrowers 
could demand the return of the property. This is contrary to an antichretic 
contract wherein the products of the land should be applied to the interest and 
then to the principal. In the second place, the contracting parties used the 
term mortgage (hipoteca) in various parts of the contract, thus: (1) "con que 
hemos hipotecado el terreno," (2) "El terreno que <u>hipotecamos</u> and (3) 
"con que <u>hipotecamos</u> el arriba mencionado terreno." In the third place, 
the parties agreed that the lenders are not to pay rentals on the property in 
consideration of the fact that the borrowers do not pay interest on the land 
which they obtained as a loan.</p>
<p>A similar case has already been decided by this Court, the case of Salcedo 
vs. Celestial, 66 Phil. 372. In said case the court found that one deed called 
the agreement "contract of mortgage and another "contract of antichresis”; that 
it is not stipulated that the net produce of the property shall be first applied 
to the payment of the interest, if any, and afterwards to that of the principal; 
that the property is security for the payment of the loan and the fruits 
thereof, assigned to the lender by way of compensation for their sacrifice in 
lending money. It was held that the contract was a mortgage because it contains 
the essential requisites of a mortgage enumerated in Article 1857 of the old 
Civil Code.</p>
<p>The most important claim of the defendants-appellants in this appeal is that 
the produce that the plaintiff and his predecessors in interest received 
exceeded the 6% legal interest fixed by the Usury Law. The appellant makes a 
mistake in assuming that an interest above the legal interest is usurious. Under 
the Usury Law, the amount allowable as interest when the property conveyed as 
security is not registered land is 14% not 6% (Sec. 3, Act No. 2655, as amended 
by C.A. 399). 14% of P1,620 is P226.80. Under the stipulation of facts, the 
yearly products of the land are valued at P645.00 and of this sum the holder of 
the property or owner thereof receives one-third or P215.00. The contract, 
therefore, cannot be considered as usurious because the value of the products 
received does not exceed 14% of the money loaned.</p>
<p>But even if the value of the actual selling price of one-third exceeded the 
14% interest provided for by law, the excess the case at bar would not be 
palpable as to show a corrupt intent to violate and evade the Usury Law. This 
principle was established by us in the case of Toquera, et. al., vs. Villegas, 
et al.,40 O.G. No. 15, p. 10, wherein we said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view, however, of the rule that a creditor’s return need not be limited 
to the statutory rate when it is affected by a contingency putting whole of it 
at hazard, a contract is ordinarily not usurious under which the creditor is to 
receive, consideration of his loan or forbearance, property or services of 
uncertain value, even though probable value is greater than lawful interest 
unless the excess is so palpable as to show a corrupt intent to violate and 
evade the usury laws, or unless the contract is made for the purpose of such 
violation or evasion.’ (66 C.J., 212)"</p>
<p>'So an agreement that instead, of interest the lender of money would receive 
the rents and profits of certain land for a term of years, is not usurious where 
no intention to evade the statute is shown; and the fact that such rents and 
profits happen to amount to more than lawful interest does not render the 
contract usurious.’ (Webb on Usury, p. 85)."</p></blockquote>
<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in toto, with costs against the 
defendants-appellants.</p>
