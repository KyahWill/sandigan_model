				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Bautista from&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissing his petition in civil case No.&nbsp; 1649.<br><br>It appears that on&nbsp; February 19, 1952, plaintiff Bautista filed&nbsp; in the court&nbsp; below against&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Council and&nbsp; Mayor&nbsp; of the municipality&nbsp; of Mandaluyong, province of Rizal, the following petition:<br><ol type="1">"Comes NOW petitioner, by and through&nbsp; his undersigned counsel and to this Honorable Court, most respectively alleges:<br><br><li>That petitioner is of legal age and residing at 1067 Int. 1, Dart, Paco,&nbsp; Manila, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; are the Municipal Council of . Mandaluyohg, Rizal and Bonifacio Javier, Mayor of the said municipality of Mandaluyong, Bizal,-where they&nbsp; may both be served with summons;<br><br></li><li>That petitioner is&nbsp; engaged' in guard&nbsp; and watchman&nbsp; business, duly&nbsp; licensed&nbsp; and&nbsp; doing&nbsp; business, under the firm&nbsp; name 'Allied Investigation&nbsp; Bureau', the&nbsp; principal office of which&nbsp; is&nbsp; at Manila, Philippines;<br><br></li><li>That on September 22, 1946, the respondent Municipal Council of the municipality of&nbsp; Mandaluyong, Rizal,&nbsp; passed and promulgated Ordinance No.&nbsp; 13, series&nbsp; of 1946, hereto' attached as Annex "A" and made an&nbsp; integral part&nbsp; hereof;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp;That a portion of section 3 of the said ordinance is as follows: .<br><br>* * * * Provided&nbsp; however,&nbsp; only&nbsp; one&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Watchmen's Agency shall be granted the exclusive privilege or right to conduct a special watchman's agency within the territorial Jinyts of this municipality subject to the power of the Municipal Mayor to revoke their license in view of&nbsp; the reasons provided elsewhere in this Ordinance.'<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; said&nbsp; ordinance wasv&nbsp; approved by respondent&nbsp; Bonifacio Javier, as Mayor of the 'Municipality of Mandaluyon£', Rizal;<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; the. aforementioned ordinance, is&nbsp; invalid,&nbsp; being1 in viola- tion of the&nbsp; law;<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; petitioner, being1 engaged&nbsp; and duly licensed in the guard and watchmen business, has contracted&nbsp; to guard and has in fact guards&nbsp; assigned to watch the Wack Wack Golf and .County Club at&nbsp; Mandaluyong, Rizal;<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; his rights as one engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; Guard and watchmen's business arc affected by the ordinance aforesaid. Wherefore, it is most respectively prayed of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Honorable Court, that judgment&nbsp; be rendered&nbsp; declaring the Municipal .Ordinance No. 13, series of 1946 of the municipality of Mandaluyong, Rizal&nbsp; on September 22, 1946, null and void, it being violative of the law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rec.&nbsp; App., pp.&nbsp; 1-3.)</li></ol>The defendants, represented by the provincial fiscal, moved on March 14, 1952 for the dismissal of the petition on the ground of lack of a cause of action, or for a bill of particulars for failure of the petition to specify which particular law was allegedly violated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the -ordinance in&nbsp; question. The said motion was set&nbsp; for hearing on March&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1952. On March&nbsp; 17, plaintiff's counsel filed&nbsp; a written motion to postpone the&nbsp; hearing of defendants' motion to dismiss&nbsp; or for a bill of&nbsp; particulars,&nbsp; because&nbsp; he&nbsp; was to&nbsp; appear in&nbsp; a legistration proceeding m&nbsp; Pampanga&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; date. The Court,&nbsp; however, denied the motion for postponement in&nbsp; its&nbsp; order&nbsp; of March 19,&nbsp; 1952 and, at the&nbsp; same&nbsp; time, planted&nbsp; defendants' motion&nbsp; to dismiss&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; moved but&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to have the order of dismissal&nbsp; reconsidered, so he appealed to this court.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; some reason or another, the&nbsp; records were sent' to .the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the case to us&nbsp; for raising only questions of law.<br><br>We find no merit in the appeal.<br><br>In the first place, the motion was not&nbsp; made&nbsp; with the three days' advance notice required by the rules (Rule 26), and the lower&nbsp; court had discretion to refuse to hear a motion on&nbsp; shorter notice.<br><br>In the second&nbsp; place, motions&nbsp; for continuance are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and we can not consider the lower&nbsp; court's denial of appellant's motion to postpone an abuse of discretion, for as it correctly held, appellant was represented by the law&nbsp; firm of Macapagal, Punzalan,&nbsp; and Yabut;&nbsp; so the absence of one attorney did not excuse&nbsp; the failure of another member of the law firm to appear at the date of the hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And even granting that Attorney. Canilao,&nbsp; was sole counsel for appellant, he had no right to assume that his motion to&nbsp; postpone would be granted&nbsp; (specially on less than S days' notice) and should have sent a representative at&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing in his behalf to argue the merits of his&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; continuance,&nbsp; or else, he could have simply submitted a&nbsp; written, answer or reply to the motion to&nbsp; dismiss,&nbsp; or even amended his petition.<br><br>In the third place, appellant's petition was correctly dismissed by. the Court below;&nbsp; for&nbsp; failure'to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&nbsp; The rule is that a person who questions the validity of a statute or law must show that he has sustained, or&nbsp; is in immediate danger of sustaining,&nbsp; some&nbsp; direct injury&nbsp; as&nbsp; the result&nbsp; of its&nbsp; enforcement (Custodio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> President of Senate, (42 OS. Gat. 1243) November&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1945; Manila&nbsp; Race Horse Trainers' Assn. vs. De la Fuente, (88 Phil., 60)&nbsp; January 11, 1951). Appellant's petition does not show&nbsp; that his interests are, or about to be, adversely affected or prejudiced by the enforcement of the ordinance which he claims to be invalid. On&nbsp; the other hand, it appears&nbsp; that he&nbsp; still has a license to engage in the guard and watchman business, and there is no showing of any threat that his license would be revoked or&nbsp; cancelled.<br><br>The order appealed from is affirmed, without prejudice to appellant's right to&nbsp; file another complaint&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; a sufficient cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against&nbsp; appellant Juan Bautista.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angela,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
