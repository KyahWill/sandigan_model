				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal by certiorari from  the decision of the Court of  Appeals from which we  are reproducing  the following basic findings of fact:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"STASIKINOCEY is a  partnership doing business  at No.  58, Aurora Boulevard,  San Juan,  Rizal,  and formed by Alan W. Gorcey, Louis F. da  Costa, Jr., William Kusik and Emma Badong Gavino.   This partnership was  denied registration in the Securities and Exchange Commission, and while it is  confusing to see  in this ease  that the  Cardinal Rattan, sometimes  called  the Cardinal  Rattan Factory, is treated as a copartnership, of which  defendants Gorcey and  da Costa  are  considered  general partners,  we  are  satisfied that, as alleged  in  various  instruments appearing of record,  said Cardinal Rattan is merely the business name or style used by the partnership Stasikinocey.</p>
  <p>"Prior to June 3, 1949,  defendant Stasikinocey had  an overdraft account with The National City Bank of New York, a foreign banking association duly licensed  to do business in the Philippines. On June 3, 1949, the overdraft  showed a balance of F6,134.92 against the defendant Stasikinocey  or  the Cardinal  Rattan (Exhibit D), which  account, due to the failure of the  partnership  to make the required payment, was converted  into an  ordinary loan for which the corresponding promissory 'joint note—non-negotiable' was  executed on June 3, 1949, by Louis F. da Costa  for and in the name of the  Cardinal Rattan,  Louis  F.  da  Costa and  Alan Gorcey (Exhibit D).  This promissory note was  secured on June  7,  1949, by a chattel mortgage executed by Louis  F. da Costa, Jr., General Partner for and in the name of Stasikinocey, alleged'  to be a  duly registered  Philippine  partnership, doing business under the name and style of Cardinal  Rattan,  with principal office  at 69 Riverside, San  Juan,  Rizal  (Exhibit A).  The chattels mortgaged were the following, motor  vehicles:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"(<em>a</em>) Fargo truck with  motor  No.  T-118-202839,  Serial No. 81410206 and with plate No. T-7333  (1949);</p>
    <p>"(<em>b</em>) Plymouth  Sedan  automobile motor  No. T-S638876, Serial No. 11872718 and with  plate No. 10372;  and</p>
    <p>"(<em>c</em>) Fargo Pick-up FKI-16,  with motor No.  T-112800032, Serial  No. 8869225 and with plate No. T-7222  (1949).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The mortgage deed was  fully registered by  the mortgagee  on June  11,  1949, in  the  Office  of  the  Register Of  Deeds for the province of Rizal, at Pasig, (Exhibit A), and  among  other provisions  it contained the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"'(<em>a</em>) That the mortgagor shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the said chattels without the mortgagee's written consent; and "</p>
    <p>"'(<em>b</em>) That the  mortgagee  may foreclose  the  mortgage  at any time,  after  breach of any condition thereof, the mortgagor waiving the 30-day notice of foreclosure.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"On June 7,. 1949, the same  day of the execution of the chattel mortgage aforementioned, Gorcey and Da Costa executed an agreer ment  purporting to  convey and transfer all their rights, title and participation  in defendant  partnership  to Shaeffer,  allegedly  in" consideration of the cancellation  of an. indebtedness of  P25,000 owed  by them and  defendant  partnership  to the latter  (Exhibit J), which transaction is said to be in violation of the Bulk Sales Law  (Act  No. 3952 of the  Philippine Legislature).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"While the said loan was still unpaid and  the  chattel mortgage subsisting,  defendant partnership,  through  defendants Gorcey and Da Costa, transferred to defendant McDonald the Fargo truck and Plymouth sedan on  June 24, 1949 (Exhibit L).   The Fargo  pick-up  was also sold  on June 28,  1949, by  William  Shaeffer to  Paul McDonald. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On or about July  19, 1944, Paul McDonald,  notwithstanding plaintiff's existing mortgage lien,  in turn  transferred the Fargo truck  and the  Plymouth sedan  to  Benjamin Gonzales."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National City Bank of New York, respondent herein,  upon learning  of the transfers made by the partnership Stasikinocey to  William Shaeffer, from  the latter to Paui McDonald, and from Paul McDonald to Benjamin Gonzales of the  vehicles previously pledged by Stasikinocey to the respondent, filed  an  action against Stasikinocey  and its alleged partners  Gorcey and  Da  Costa, as  well  as Paul McDonald and Benjamin Gonzales, to  recover  its  credit and to  foreclose the  corresponding chattel mortgage.   McDonald and Gonzales were  made defendants because they claimed to have a better right over, the  pledged vehicle.</p>
<p>After  trial the Court of First  Instance  of  Manila rendered judgment in favor  of  the respondent, annulling the  sale  of the  vehicles in  question to  Benjamin  Gonzales; sentencing Da Costa and  Gorcey to pay to the respondent jointly and severally the sum of P6,134.92, with legal interest from  the debt of the promissory note  involved; sentencing the petitioner Gonzales to  deliver the vehicles in question to the respondent1 for sale at public auction if  Da Costa and Gorcey should fail to  pay the money judgment; and sentencing  Da Costa,  Gorcey and Shaeffers to  pay to the  respondent jointly and  severally any  deficiency that may remain unpaid should the proceeds of the sale not be sufficient;, and  sentencing Gorcey, Da Costa,  McDonald  and  Shaeffer  to pay the costs.   Only Paul McDonald  and  Benjamin  Gonzales appealed to the Court of Appeals which  rendered  a decision the dispositive part of which reads as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore,  the  decision appealed from is  hereby  modified, relieving appellant William Shaeffer of  the obligation of paying, jointly and severally, together with Alan  W. Ooreey and  Louis F. da  Costa, Jr.,  any deficiency  that  may remain unpaid after applying the proceeds of the  sale  of  the said motor vehicles which shall be undertaken upon the lapse of 90 days from the date this decision becomes final,  if by then defendants Louis F.  da Costa, Jr., and Alan W, Gorcey had not  paid the amount of the judgment debt.  With this modification the  decision appealed  from is in all other respects affirmed, with costs  against appellants.  This decision is without prejudice to  whatever action Louis F.  da Costa, Jr., and Alan  W. Gorcey may take  against their co-partners  in  the Stasikinocey  unregistered partnership"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appeal by certiorari was taken by Paul McDonald and  Benjamin Gonzales,  petitioners  herein,  who  have assigned the following errors:</p>
<p align="center">"I</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"IN  RULING THAT  AN UNREGISTERED  COMMERCIAL  CO-PARTNER. SHIP  WHICH  HAS NO INDEPENDENT  JURIDICAL PERSONALITY  CAN HAVE A 'DOMICILE' SO THAT A CHATTEL MORTGAGE REGISTERED JN THAT 'DOMICILE' WOULD  BIND THIRD  PERSONS  WHO ARK  INNOCENT PURCHASERS FOR VALUE. </p>

<p align="center">"III</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"IN NOT RULING THAT, WHEN A CHATTEJL MORTGAGOR EXECUTES AN AFFIDAVIT OF GOOD FAITH BEFORE  A NOTARY PUBLIC OUTSIDE OF THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE LATTER, THE AFFIDAVIT IS VOID  AND THE CHATTEL MORTGAGE  IS NOT BINDING ON THIRD PERSONS WHO ARE  INNOCENT PURCHASERS  FOR VALUE;  AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE THEREOF, IN NOT MAKING ANY FINDING OF FACT AS TO WHERE THE DEED WAS IN FACT EXECUTED, DESPITE APPELLANTS' RAISING THAT QUESTION PROPERLY BEFORE IT AND EXPRESSLY  REQUESTING A RULING THERE0N.</p>

WITH THE NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK' IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY ALL MATTERS  RELATIVE TO LCS CABLE TRANSFERS.  DRAFTS, OR  OTHER BANKING MEDIUMS.' WAS. SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY FOR THE SAID MEMBER TO  EXECUTE A CHATTEL MORTGAGE IN ORDER  TO GIVE THE BANK SECURITY  FOR A PRE-EXISTING OVERDRAFT, GRANTED WITHOUT SECURITY, WHICH THE BANK HAD CONVERTED INTO A DEMAND LOAN UPON FAILURE TO PAY SAME AND  BEFORE THE CHATTEL   MORTGAGE WAS  EXECUTED."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first question propounded by the petitioners: "Since an unregistered commercial  partnership unquestionably has no juridical personality,  can it have a domicile so  that the registration of  a chattel  mortgage  therein is notice to the world?"</p>
<p>While an unregistered  commercial partnership  has  no juridical personality, nevertheless, where two  or  more persons attempt to create a partnership failing to comply with all the legal formalities, the  law considers them  as partners and  the association is  a  partnership  in  so  far as  it  is a  favorable to third persons,  by reason  of  the equitable principle  of estoppel.   In Jo  Chung Chang <em>vs.</em> Pacific Commercial  Co., 45  Phil.,  145, it  was held "that although the  partnership with  the firm  name  of  'Teck Seing and  Co. Ltd."  could  not  be regarded as a partnership de  jure, yet with respect to third persons  it will be considered  a  partnership with  all  the consequent obligations  for the purpose of enforcing  the rights of such third persons."  Da Costa  and Gorcey  cannot deny that they are partners of the partnership Stasikinocey, because in all their transactions with  the respondent they  represented themselves  as such.   Petitioner  McDonald cannot disclaim knowledge  of the  partnership  Stasikinocey  because he dealt with  said entity in purchasing two  of  the vehicles  in  question  through Gorcey  and Da Costa.  As was held in Behn Meyer &amp;  Co. <em>vs.</em> Rosatzin,5 Phil., 660, where a partnership  not duly organized has been  recognized  as  such  in  its dealings with  certain  persons,  it shall  be  considered as "partnership  by estoppel and the persons dealing with  it are estopped from denying its partnership existence.  The  sale of  the vehicles in question being void  as to petitioner  McDonald, the transfer from the latter to  petitioner Benjamin Gonzales is also void, as the buyer  cannot have a better  right than  the  seller.</p>
<p>It results that if the  law recognizes  a defectively  organized partnership  as de facto  as  far  as third persons are concerned, for purposes of its  de facto  existence  it should have such attribute  of  a  partnership  as domicile. In Hung-Man Yoc  <em>vs.</em> Kieng-Chiong-Seng, 6 Phil.., 498, it was  held  that although  "it has  no legal standing,  it  is a partnership de facto and  the general  provisions of the Code applicable to  all partnerships apply to it."  The  registration of  the chattel mortgage  in question  with the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal,  the residence or place  of business of  the partnership  Stasikinocey  being San Juan, Rizal, was therefore in accordance with section 4 of the  Chattel  Mortgage Law.</p>
<p>The second question propounded by the petitioners is: "If not, is  a  chattel  mortgage executed by only one  of the 'partners' of an unregistered commercial  partnership validly registered so as to constitute  notice to the world if it is hot  registered at  the  place where the aforesaid 'partner' actually reside$  but only in the place where the deed  states that he resides, which is not his real residence?"  And the  third  question  is as follows: "If the actual residence of the chattel mortgagor—not the residence stated in the deed  of chattel mortgage—is controlling, may the Court of Appeals refuse to make a finding of fact as to where the  mortgagor resided despite your petitioners having properly raised that  question before it and expressly requested  a ruling thereon?"</p>
<p>These  two questions  have become academic by reason of the answer to  the  first question, namely, that  as a de facto  partnership, Stasikinocey had its  domicile in San Juan,  Rizal.</p>
<p>The fourth  question asked  by the  petitioners is as follows:  "Is a chattel mortgage executed  by only one of the 'partners' of an unregistered commercial  partnership valid as  to third persons  when that 'partner' executed the affidavit of good faith in  Quezon City  before notary public whose appointment is only for the  City of Manila? If not, may the Court of Appeals refuse to make a finding of fact as to where the  deed was executed,, despite your petitioners' having properly  raised  that  issue before  it and expressly  requested  a  ruling thereon?"</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the chattel mortgage in question is in the  form required by law,  and there is  therefore the  presumption of its  due execution which cannot be easily destroyed by the biased  testimony  of the  one who executed it.  The interested version of Da Costa that the affidavit of good faith  appearing in the chattel mortgage was executed in Quezon  City before  a notary public for and in the City of Manila was correctly rejected by the trial court and the Court  of Appeals.   Indeed, cumbersome legal formalities are imposed to prevent fraud.   As aptly pointed  but in El Hogar Filipino <em>vs.</em> Olviga, 60 Phil., 17, "If the biased and interested testimony of a grantor and the vague  and uncertain  testimony of his son are deemed sufficient to overcome a public instrument drawn up with all the formalities prescribed by the law then there will have been established  a very dangerous doctrine which would throw  wide open the doors to fraud."</p>
<p>The last question raised by the petitioners is as follows:. "Does only one of several 'partners'  of an unregistered commercial partnership have authority, by himself alone, to execute a  valid chattel mortgage over property owned by the unregistered commercial  partnership in order  to guarantee a  pre-existing overdraft  previously  granted, without guaranty, by the bank?"</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion that Stasikinocey is a de facto partnership, and Da Costa appears as a  co-manager  in the letter of  Gorcey to the respondent  and in the promissory note executed by  Da Costa,  and  that even the partners  considered  him as such,  as stated in  the affidavit of  April  21, 1948, to the effect that "That we  as the majority  partners  hereby agree to appoint Louis  da Costa co-managing partner of Alan W.  Gorcey, duly approved managing partner of the  said firm," the "partner" who  executed the chattel  mortgage in question must  be deemed to be  so fully authorized.  Section 6 of the Chattel Mortgage Law provides that when a partnership is a party to the mortgage, the affidavit may be made and subscribed by one member thereof.  In this case the affidavit was executed  and  subscribed by Da Costa, not only as a partner but  as a managing partner.</p>
<p>There is no merit in petitioners' pretense that the motor vehicles in question are the common property of Da Costa and Gorcey.  Petitioners invoke  article 24 of the Code  of Commerce in arguing that an  unregistered commercial partnership has no juridical personality  and cannot execute  any act  that would adversely affect innocent third persons.  Petitioners forget that the respondent is a third person  with respect to the partnership, and the chattel mortgage executed by Da Costa  cannot therefore be impugned by Gorcey on the ground that there is no  partnership between them and that the vehicles in question belonged to them in common.  As a matter of  fact, the respondent and the petitioners are all third persons  as regards the partnership Stasikinocey and even assuming that the petitioners are purchasers in good faith and for value the respondent having transacted with Stasikinocey earlier than the petitioners, it should enjoy and  be given priority.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with costs against the petitioners.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo,  Bautista Angelo Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B, L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
