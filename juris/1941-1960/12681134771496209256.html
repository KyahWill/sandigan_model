Jalandoni et&nbsp; al., defendants,&nbsp; for recovery of possession and ownership of two parcels&nbsp; of land (ejectment), upon motion of the plaintiffs,&nbsp; the Court issued a writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; restraining&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Amado B. Parreno, in his capacity as judicial administrator&nbsp; of the estate of the late spouses Wenceslao B. Parreno and Virginia Villanueva, from&nbsp; continuing with the construction of a house on one of the lots&nbsp; (Lot No. 983 of the Cadastral Survey of Bago) involved in the litigation and from exercising acts of possession over said lot during the pendency of the case, upon the filing of a bond in the sum of P3,000 with sufficient sureties&nbsp; (Annex F).&nbsp; A&nbsp; bond&nbsp; for such amount filed by the plaintiffs was approved by the Court (Annex G).&nbsp; Seven days after, or&nbsp; on 30 May 1955, the defendant Amado B. Parreno,&nbsp; in his&nbsp; capacity aforesaid, filed a&nbsp; motion to dissolve&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ thus issued,&nbsp; on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to serve upon him a copy of the bond; that the amount of the bond filed by them was insufficient to answer for all the damage that the&nbsp; defendant may sustain&nbsp; by reason of the writ should&nbsp; the Court finally decide that they are not entitled to the issuance thereof, not only because the sureties have not shown or proved their solvency but also because they have not stated and described the properties that would guarantee the fulfillment of their undertaking.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant moving for the dissolution of the writ offered&nbsp; to&nbsp; file a bond in the amount of P10,000 or in such amount as the Court may fix with sufficient sureties, conditioned that the moving defendant will pay all damages that the plaintiffs may suffer by reason of the continuance during the&nbsp; action of the acts complained of.&nbsp; The plaintiffs objected to&nbsp; the defendant's motion&nbsp; to dissolve the&nbsp; injunction on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; by refusing to receive a copy of the bond, he waived his right to question its sufficiency and the solvency of the sureties and cannot claim that he was not furnished with a copy thereof, and that there is no valid reason why the writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; should&nbsp; be dissolved.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 4 June 1955 the Court dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction theretofore issued and approved the&nbsp; bond for P10,000 filed by the defendant&nbsp; Amado B. Parreño.<p>Claiming that the Court acted with grave abuse of discretion in&nbsp; dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction and that there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the petitioners, plaintiffs in the court below, filed this petition for a writ of certiorari to set aside the order of 4 June 1955&nbsp; that&nbsp; dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction theretofore issued&nbsp; and prayed&nbsp; for a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction to restrain the respondent court from carrying out or giving effect to the order dissolving the writ of injunction.&nbsp; On 20 June 1955 this Court issued the writ of preliminary injunction as prayed for.</p><p>The facts pleaded in the amended complaint filed by the petitioners in the respondent court,&nbsp; if established&nbsp; by&nbsp; admissible, competent and credible evidence, would affect only the title of the defendants Amado P. Jalandoni&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ramon O. Matti who, it is alleged, knew&nbsp; or had knowledge of the&nbsp; defective title of Amado&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Jalandoni,&nbsp; his predecessor-in-interest,&nbsp; but there is&nbsp; nothing alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the amended complaint that would place the defendant Amado B. Parrefio, in his capacity as administrator of the estate of the&nbsp; late spouses Wenceslao B. Parrefio and&nbsp; Virginia Villanueva,&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; same&nbsp; level&nbsp; as&nbsp; his&nbsp; co-defendants Amado P. Jalandoni and Ramon O.&nbsp; Matti.&nbsp; The only allegation affecting&nbsp; him is that in purchasing the lots from Ramon&nbsp; O. Matti he "acted&nbsp; with negligence amounting to bad faith <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> in failing&nbsp; to take&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary steps so that he would have&nbsp; come to know positively of&nbsp; the claim of ownership and actual possession which the plaintiffs have over Lot 983 aforesaid, as alleged in paragraphs IV, V and VI hereof."&nbsp; (Annex B.)&nbsp; From this allegation it may&nbsp; be inferred that after acquiring the two&nbsp; lots&nbsp; for the estate of the late spouses Wenceslao B. Parreñio and Virginia Villanueva&nbsp; and once in possesion of the&nbsp; Torrens transfer certificate of title No. 16897 for Lot No. 983 of the Cadastral Survey of Bago issued in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of the late&nbsp; spouses, the respondent Amado B. Parreñio, in 'his capacity as administrator of the estate of&nbsp; the late spouses,&nbsp; took possession&nbsp; of the two lots and started to build a house&nbsp; on Lot No. 983.&nbsp; Even granting that petitioners&nbsp; have been in&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two lots,&nbsp; the Torrens "title."give" 'the&nbsp; owner the right io take possession of the property registered in his name.</p><p>The petitioners further contend that the&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction should not issue to deprive a person of the possession of a parcels of land.&nbsp;&nbsp; They claim that they have been in&nbsp; possession of the two parcels of land.&nbsp; The writ issued by the respondent court protected the possession of the petitioners if they were in possession&nbsp; of Lot No.&nbsp; 983.&nbsp; If they were not but the respondent Amado B. Parreñio, the latter was deprived thereof by the writ.&nbsp; The dissolution&nbsp; of the writ did not give or deprive anyone of the possession of the land but restored the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> before the&nbsp; issuance of the writ.</p><p>A&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction is an&nbsp; interlocutory order and is&nbsp; under the control of the&nbsp; Court before final judgment in the case.&nbsp; The writ issued may be dissolved for&nbsp; reasons stated in the rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p><p>Considering that the bond&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the petitioners, as found fey the respondent&nbsp; court, is merely a character bond and does not state and&nbsp; describe the properties that will answer for the payment of aU the damage that the defendant may&nbsp; suffer by reason&nbsp; of the issuance of the&nbsp; writ; that had the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; court been apprised of the defect it Would not have approved the bond; and it appearing, on the&nbsp; other, hand, that the&nbsp; respondent Amado B. Parreñio, in his&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; aforesaid, was&nbsp; willing and&nbsp; ready to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a bond with sufficient sureties&nbsp; to answer&nbsp; and pay&nbsp; for all damages that the plaintiffs,&nbsp; petitioners herein,&nbsp; may suffer&nbsp; by reason of the continuance during the action&nbsp; of the acts complained&nbsp; of <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> —a bond for PI0,000 was filed by the respondent Amado&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parreñio and&nbsp; approved by the respondent court—we cannot say&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent court abused its&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; dissolving&nbsp; the writ of preliminary injunction theretofore issued.</p><p>Petition denied&nbsp; and&nbsp; the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued&nbsp; dissolved, with costs against&nbsp; the petitioners.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J,&nbsp; B.
