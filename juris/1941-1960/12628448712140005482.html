				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a suit to recover the sum of&nbsp; ?4,630&nbsp; (with interest)&nbsp; which plaintiff paid to the City&nbsp; of Manila as inspection fees of&nbsp; its steam boilers, in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; 117,&nbsp; Title&nbsp;&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Ordinances of said city.&nbsp; Such provisions, plaintiff alleged, have been repealed&nbsp; by&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; legislation.&nbsp; It&nbsp; also alleged that the fees were grossly disproportionate to the services rendered.<br><br>The&nbsp; Manila court of&nbsp; first instance,&nbsp; after&nbsp; hearing the parties, rendered judgment dismissing the complaint,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Edilberto&nbsp; Barot made&nbsp; the following statement of the&nbsp; case:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; facts are&nbsp; not&nbsp; in&nbsp; dispute.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; operates&nbsp;&nbsp; seven steam boilers of more than 100 horse&nbsp; power each for&nbsp; generating electricity in the&nbsp; City of Manila, As&nbsp; fees&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; inspection of its boilers by inspectors&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; of Labor under&nbsp; regulations promulgated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Labor pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 104, as&nbsp; amended by&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 696,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; paid the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Government&nbsp; P2,390&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; 1946, P2.044.10 in 1947,&nbsp; P2,826.50&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; and P3,326, in 1949.&nbsp; (Paragraph II, complaint:&nbsp; paragraph I, defendant's answer,)&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, upon&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; demand,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; also&nbsp; paid,&nbsp; but&nbsp; under protest,&nbsp; to defendant city, the sum of P3,524 on January 24,&nbsp; 1949, and Pl,506 on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 11, 1949, or a total of P4,630&nbsp; as&nbsp; fees for inspection of the same boilers by the office of the City Engineer, pursuant to the provisions of Title 15, Chapter 117, of the Revised Ordinances.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Paragraphs IV&nbsp; and V,&nbsp; complaint;&nbsp; paragraphs II and III, defendant's answer.)" <br></blockquote>The Manila Charter (1917)&nbsp; authorized the Municipal Board "to&nbsp; tax&nbsp;&nbsp; * * * steam boilers"&nbsp; and to&nbsp; regulate * * * steam&nbsp; engines and boilers"&nbsp; and&nbsp; provide for&nbsp; the inspection&nbsp; thereof and for a reasonable&nbsp; fee for&nbsp; such inspection".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to this statute the&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; in question was approved,&nbsp; and the payment&nbsp; demanded and received.&nbsp; However plaintiff&nbsp; insists&nbsp; that Commonwealth Act No. 104&nbsp; (1936)&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended by&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 696&nbsp; (1945) repealed the above portions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Manila Charter, because these two enactment direct that&nbsp; "for inspection&nbsp; of boilers&nbsp; and pressure vessels,&nbsp; the Secretary of Labor *&nbsp; * * shall fix and collect reasonable inspection fees."&nbsp; (section&nbsp; S).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>His Honor&nbsp; perceived no repeal by implication, and believed there was no&nbsp; legislative&nbsp; intention to deprive&nbsp; the City of its&nbsp; power to tax and license steam&nbsp; boilers, pointing to the&nbsp; subsequent enactment in&nbsp; 1949 of the Revised Charter of the City of Manila&nbsp; (Republic Act No.&nbsp; 409) repeating the&nbsp; identical provisions,of the Administrative Code above quoted.&nbsp; There was no&nbsp; repeal,&nbsp; in&nbsp; our opinion too. In the first place&nbsp; the City's power to tax&nbsp; steam boilers could not have been affected by the Department of Labor's&nbsp; power to regulate or inspect them:&nbsp; one is taxation,&nbsp; the other regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second place, the&nbsp; power&nbsp; of inspection&nbsp; of the Secretary&nbsp; of Labor&nbsp; does not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; conflict with that of the&nbsp; City authorities, because the former has&nbsp; particular relation to the "safety of laborers and&nbsp; employees"&nbsp; (section 1) of industrial enterprises,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp;&nbsp; that of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila is not limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; such&nbsp; purpose, but is related to the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the City,&nbsp; particularly of the neighborhood wherein the boilers are located.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Smoke, noise, vibration, fire hazards etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Different purposes, are served by the two inspections. Anyway,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court has already declared&nbsp; in&nbsp; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Chan&nbsp; Tienco, 25 Phil., 89:<br><blockquote>"The mere fact that a municipality, for the purpose of protecting the health of its&nbsp; people,&nbsp; requires&nbsp; a permit from the&nbsp; president of the municipal board of&nbsp; health for the slaughtering1 of&nbsp; large cattle,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; contravene nor&nbsp; is it&nbsp; repugnant to the provisions of the&nbsp; general law of the State requiring, for the purposes&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in the&nbsp; general&nbsp; law, a permit from&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; treasurer for the slaughtering of large cattle.&nbsp; The&nbsp; purposes of the two Jaws are distinct.&nbsp; Many instances&nbsp; might be given&nbsp; showing that an&nbsp; inhabitant of&nbsp; a municipality, before he can do a particular thing&nbsp; or&nbsp; engage in a&nbsp; particular class of business, should secure two permits,&nbsp; one&nbsp; from the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; and another from&nbsp; the State."<br></blockquote>Mr. Justice&nbsp; Johnson who wrote the above quotation had previously had&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; to&nbsp; make a lengthy&nbsp; exposition, replete with precedents of the principle that a&nbsp; municipal regulation or prohibition&nbsp; of a certain line of activity may co-exist&nbsp; with&nbsp; national regulation&nbsp; or prohibition&nbsp; of the same.&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Joson, 26 Phil.,&nbsp; 1) Because in the opinion of judicial authorities there is nothing "inherently obnoxious in the requirement that a person engaging in a business shall&nbsp; have two licenses, one&nbsp; issued by the&nbsp; state and another by a&nbsp; political subdivision or public corporation."&nbsp; (33&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Jur.&nbsp; 345).<br><br>In&nbsp;&nbsp; its last&nbsp; assignment of&nbsp; error&nbsp; the plaintiff,&nbsp; asserts that the inspection fees charged by the City are "excessive, unreasonable, and grossly disproportionate&nbsp; to the services rendered" by it.&nbsp; This point does not seem to be material. If the inspection fees had been demanded solely by virtue of the City's power to regulate&nbsp; and license<span style="font-style: italic;"> steam boilers,</span> it might be&nbsp; pertinent to&nbsp; inquire&nbsp; into the reasonability of the charges.&nbsp; However, the City has also authority to tax steam, boilers;&nbsp; and&nbsp; there is&nbsp; every indication that herein charges were&nbsp; collected under both the power to&nbsp; tax and the power to regulate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name "fee" is not conclusive taxes are often times&nbsp; called fees.<br><blockquote>"Where under undoubted charter power&nbsp; to&nbsp; tax&nbsp; is imposed&nbsp; for revenue alone,&nbsp; or&nbsp; for&nbsp; police&nbsp; regulation and revenue,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount thereof is&nbsp; usually a matter&nbsp; for&nbsp; determination by&nbsp; the legislative branch&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipal government.&nbsp; Ordinarily the courts will decline&nbsp; to interfere on the ground that the amount is oppressive or unreasonably large,"&nbsp;&nbsp; (McQuillen on Municipal Corporations, 2nd. ed., Vol. 3, pp. 686-693).<br></blockquote>The appealed judgment will therefore&nbsp; be affirmed&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B.
