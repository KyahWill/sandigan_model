				<H3>IN  THE MATTER, OF THE PETITION OF TIU PENG HONG TO BE ADMITTED AS CITIZEN OF  THE  PHILIPPINES.  TIU PENG HONG, PETITIONER  AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF  THE PHILIPPINES,  OPPOSITOR  AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 30, 1952, the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila rendered judgment No. 11304 thereof, entitled&nbsp; "In&nbsp; the matter of the petition&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tiu Hong admitted as citizen&nbsp; of. the Philippines,"&nbsp; granting the petition naturalization said&nbsp; Tiu Peng Hong. Over two years later, or, to be exact, on September 27, 1954, the latter asked that a date be set for the reception evidence pursuant the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 580.&nbsp; As prayed for, said court receive evidence on&nbsp; October 9,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; on&nbsp; which date&nbsp; it thereafter, issued an&nbsp; order declaring that&nbsp; petitioner, had complied&nbsp; with requirements&nbsp; of said Act&nbsp; a accordingly,&nbsp; authorizing him to&nbsp; take the corresponding oath of&nbsp; allegiance a naturalized citizen of the Philip Petitioner did so on&nbsp; said date, where corresponding certificate of naturalization in&nbsp; his favor&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; T later, or on October 1954, he filed a motion praying that his daughter, Tiu Lu—who was a minor at the time of the rendition of said decision of; July 30, but had b of age on March 15, 1953—"be allowed to take her own oath of allegiance, as a confirmation of her intention&nbsp; to continue&nbsp; and retain,&nbsp; he inchoate Philippine citizenship, which was impressed upon&nbsp; her when herein petition his application for naturalization on June 9, 1950."&nbsp; Despite the Solicitor opposition thereto, the court,&nbsp; by an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated October&nbsp; 28, 1954,&nbsp; granted said motion.&nbsp; The Solicitor General now seeks a review of said order of October 23, 1954.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that he became a naturalized citizen of the Philippine the expiration&nbsp; of 30 days&nbsp; from notice of the decision of July 30,&nbsp; 1952,. copy of which was received by the Solicitor General on August 9,1952, in vi the&nbsp; failure of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal therefrom within&nbsp; said period, that,&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as his&nbsp; daughter Tiu Siok Lu, born in Amoy,&nbsp; China,&nbsp; on Ma 15,&nbsp; 1932, was on or about September 9, 1952,&nbsp; a minor,&nbsp; she then automatic became a citizen of the Philippines,&nbsp; pursuant to section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, reading:<br><blockquote> "A foreign-born minor child, if, dwelling in the Philippines a of the naturalization of the parent,&nbsp; shall automatically become a Philippine citizen and a foreign-born&nbsp; minor&nbsp; child, who is not in the Philippines a time the parent is naturalized, shall be deemed a Philippine citizen only d minority he begins to reside permanently in the Philippines when s minor, in which will continue to be a&nbsp; Philippine citizen even aft becoming of age." </blockquote>We find no merit in the theory of the petitioner. Section&nbsp; 2 of&nbsp; Republic A provides that,&nbsp; after finding&nbsp; that the applicant for&nbsp; naturalization, whose a favor a judgment had&nbsp; been rendered, has complied&nbsp; with the requirements of section 1 of said statute, "the order of the court granting citizenship shall be registered and the oath provided by existing laws shall be taken by the applicant, whereupon,&nbsp; <i>and not before,</i> he will be entitled all the privileges of a citizen."&nbsp; It is&nbsp; clear, therefore,&nbsp; that for&nbsp; naturalization becomes a Filipino only upon the taking&nbsp; of his oath of allegiance and <i>not before.</i>&nbsp; In other he does not acquire&nbsp; Phi nationality, by reason of the fact that&nbsp; the decision granting&nbsp; his application naturalization&nbsp; has become final.&nbsp; The, taking of the of allegiance, in conformity with said&nbsp; section 2, determines the beginning new status regular member of our citizenry.<br><br>Secondly, pursuant to section 1 of Republic Act No. 530, no decision granting application for naturalization&nbsp; shall become executory&nbsp; "the&nbsp; provisions of notwithstanding&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; until after two years from its promulgation after court, on&nbsp; proper&nbsp; hearing,* * * is satisfied and so finds that, intervening applicant" has complied with the conditions specified provision.&nbsp; In&nbsp; other the decision in favor of petitioner's&nbsp; application not become executory until October 9, 1954, when&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court issued its order of such date&nbsp; finding&nbsp; that petitioner had complied with said require of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 530. At,that Tiu Siok Lu was over 22 years of age and, hence, she is not entitled to the benefits of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 15 of&nbsp; Common Act No. 473, according&nbsp; to which, upon the naturalization of her father, hi minor children dwelling in the Philippine automatically become citizens thereof.<br><br>Thirdly, the theory of petitioner and appellee would lead to the result that whereas petitioner herein did not become a citizen of&nbsp; the Philippines until October 9, 1954, his daughter—whose claim to citizenship is based.upon the naturalization of her father—would&nbsp; become&nbsp; a citizen of the Philippines o about September 9,&nbsp; 1952, or over 2 years before her father had been naturalized. Hence, the accessory would come into existence long before the principal, upon which it is wholly dependent, had become a legal reality.<br><br>It is obvious, therefore,&nbsp; that petitioner's contention cannot be sustained court erred in authorizing the taking of oath by Tiu Siok Lu; and that accordingly, the order appealed from, dated October 23,1954, should be, as hereby, set aside and reversed, with costs against petitioner and appellee. so ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
