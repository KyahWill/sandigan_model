				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Vitaliano M. Cruz was a member of the Police Department of the City of&nbsp; Manila and way back&nbsp; in&nbsp; August, 1941, a criminal information for extortion was filed against him in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; entitled People of the Philippines vs. Vitaliano M. Cruz—No. 65940 of said Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 28, 1941, this&nbsp; defendant deposited with Sgt.&nbsp; Narciso Cabrera&nbsp;&nbsp; (now deceased)&nbsp; of Precinct No. 1 of the Manila Police Department, a&nbsp; cash bail bond in the sum&nbsp; of P500 for his provisional liberty (Official&nbsp; Receipt No. M-181276-Annex A).&nbsp;&nbsp; World&nbsp; War II broke out without the case having&nbsp; ever been heard or tried.&nbsp; After liberation&nbsp; it appeared&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; records of the case had been destroyed and an attempt to reconstitute said criminal case proved to be fruitless, as the records of both the Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City Fiscal and&nbsp; of the Clerk of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila had nothing to show about the&nbsp; same.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the&nbsp; reconstitution proceedings&nbsp; had to be, as they were, dismissed on July 9, 1946, by former Judge Emilio Pefia (now Justice of the Court of Appeals), as having been&nbsp; abandoned.&nbsp; After that dismissal Vitaliano M. Cruz sought the aid of several persons and officers of the government to secure the refund to him of said amount of&nbsp; P500,&nbsp; and&nbsp; his efforts&nbsp; being&nbsp; in&nbsp; vain,&nbsp; he filed on September 22,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; in the Municipal Court of Manila against the City of Manila et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 22632 to recover the&nbsp; amount of said bail&nbsp; of P500.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was assigned to Branch IV thereof, presided over by Hon. Crisanto Aragon, who dismissed it on October 6,&nbsp; 1952. <br><br>Then on February 2,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same complaint&nbsp; was refiled in said court (docketed as&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 24704), which&nbsp; was again&nbsp; assigned to the same Branch presided over by said Judge Crisanto Aragon,&nbsp; who dismissed&nbsp; the second complaint on June 30,&nbsp; 1953.<br><br>On November 29, 1954, again plaintiff filed for the third time the same&nbsp; complaint in the same court (docketed as Civil Case No. 34983), this time assigned&nbsp; to Branch III presided over&nbsp; by&nbsp; Judge Estrella Abad&nbsp;&nbsp; Santos.&nbsp; Upon written&nbsp; motion to dismiss filed by defendants therein, on the proposition that the complaint&nbsp; stated no&nbsp; cause of action,&nbsp; supplemented by oral argument&nbsp; at the&nbsp; hearing thereof,&nbsp; which counsel for the plaintiff failed to answer, on January 19, 1955, the Court dismissed the third complaint in&nbsp; the following language: <br><blockquote>"On January 12, 1955, the counsel for tile plaintiff was given until January 17th of this year within which&nbsp; to submit his written reply to the motion to dismiss filed by the counsel for the defendant. However,&nbsp; until the present&nbsp; time, he has failed to do so. <br>After a careful consideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said motion to dismiss as well as the oral argument advanced by Assistant&nbsp; Fiscal Abelardo M,&nbsp; Dayrit in support&nbsp; of said motion, the&nbsp; Court finds&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion to dismiss to be&nbsp; well&nbsp; founded. <br>Wherefore, it is hereby ordered that this case be, as it is hereby, dismissed.&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs." </blockquote>Plaintiff&nbsp; did&nbsp; not appeal from this order of&nbsp; dismissal, but instead he filed&nbsp; on March 4, 1955, with&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Manila, Branch I, the same complaint against the same defendants to&nbsp; attain the same purpose of recovering said cash bond he&nbsp; alleges to have deposited with Sgt. Narciso&nbsp; Cabrera in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P500 for his provisional liberty in&nbsp; said&nbsp; Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 65940 of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; In his complaint he prays the Court to sentence the defendants&nbsp; to pay him&nbsp; said sum of P500&nbsp; with legal&nbsp; interests until&nbsp; fully paid, plus P300 as plaintiff's damages and P100 for attorney's&nbsp; fees, and the costs of the suit. <br><br>On March 24, 1955, defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that (1) the&nbsp; complaint stated no&nbsp; cause of action&nbsp; against the defendants; and (2) that the action had been barred by a prior&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; After due consideration of the&nbsp; reasons,&nbsp; pro and&nbsp; con, of the motion to dismiss as submitted by both parties,&nbsp; Judge Ramon A. Icasiano, presiding over said Branch 1, held that the action had been already barred by a prior judgment which constituted res <i>adjudicata</i> and dismissed the case without pronouncement as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration was denied plaintiff appealed to the Court of First Instance where the defendants-appellees again submitted&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to dismiss based&nbsp; on the ground that the&nbsp; Court had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, the decision&nbsp; of the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila, Branch III,&nbsp; in the identical Civil Case&nbsp; No. 34983,&nbsp; dated January 19, 1955,&nbsp; having already become final, constituted in effect a prior judgment which barred the institution of the&nbsp; action now here&nbsp; on appeal.&nbsp; After hearing of the motion the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; held that none of&nbsp; the reasons&nbsp; alleged by&nbsp; the Fiscal in the motion to dismiss the appeal from the order of the Municipal Court are the grounds provided by&nbsp; law for dismissing, the appeal; consequently, the Court overruled the motion to dismiss the appeal but&nbsp; gave the parties time to be their respective memoranda in support of the question raised&nbsp; in the appeal, to wit: whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was&nbsp; correctly dismissed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila by order of March 30, 1955, which was then before the Court <i>ad quem</i> for review in accordance with Section 10, Rule 40, of the Rules of&nbsp; Court. <br><br>Once the parties had&nbsp; submitted the memoranda required of them, the Court by order of September 22, 1955, affirmed the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of Judge Ramon A.&nbsp; Icasiano&nbsp; dismissing the present case with costs against the plaintiff.&nbsp; From said ruling plaintiff&nbsp; appealed to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals which Tribunal certified the same&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Court for the&nbsp; reason that the only question&nbsp; raised in the appeal is purely&nbsp; of law. <br><br>In this instance counsel for the appellant maintains that: <br><br>"The lower court erred in holding that the order of dismissal of Tudg'e Estrella&nbsp; Abad Santos&nbsp; of tile Municipal Court of&nbsp; Manila, dated January 19, 1955, was adjudication upon the merits&nbsp; and the same is a bar to the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of a subsequent action for the same cause."<br><br>It will be remembered that in the inferior court counsel for defendants based his motion to dismiss on two grounds, to wit: (1) that the complaint states&nbsp; no cause of action against the defendants;&nbsp; and (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; the present action had been barred by a prior judgment, although in his order of dismissal Judge Icasiano relied only on the latter ground. <br><br>Although the first two complaints filed by appellant in the Municipal Court of Manila might be&nbsp; considered as dismissed without&nbsp; prejudice,&nbsp; the third&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 34983 of the Municipal Court of Manila, Branch III, presided&nbsp; over&nbsp; by Judge Estrella Abad Santos)&nbsp; was dismissed after due consideration and adjudication of the issues raised in the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such dismissal, therefore, cannot come&nbsp; within the provisions&nbsp; of Section&nbsp; 12, Rule 4, of the Rules of Court, but&nbsp; of Sections 3 and&nbsp; 4, Rule 30, of the same&nbsp; Rules of Court, which provide&nbsp; the following: <br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 3. Failure to Prosecute.—When plaintiff fails to appear at the time of the&nbsp; trial or&nbsp; to prosecute his action for an unreasonable length&nbsp; of time, <i>or to comply with</i> these Rules or <i>any order of the&nbsp; court</i>, the action may be dismissed upon motion&nbsp; of the defendant or upon the court's own&nbsp; motion. <i>The dismissal still have the&nbsp; effect of an adjudication upon&nbsp; the merits, unless&nbsp; otherwise provided by the court,</i>"<br><br>"Sec. 4. Effect of Dismissal on Other Grounds.—Unless otherwise ordered by the&nbsp; court&nbsp; any dismissal not provided for in this rule, <i>other than a dismissal for lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction&nbsp; operates as an adjudication upon&nbsp; the merits</i>" </blockquote>As appeal's&nbsp; from the order of Judge Estrella Abad Santos, counsel for the plaintiff in said&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 34983 of the Municipal Court failed to submit his written reply to the motion&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants, despite the&nbsp; fact that he&nbsp; was required and given a period within which&nbsp; to do&nbsp; so,&nbsp; and that upon such failure said Judge proceeded to consider the motion to dismiss as well as the oral&nbsp; arguments advanced by&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; Dayrit in support of said motion, and then dismissed&nbsp; the case as prayed for by the defendants.&nbsp; Consequently, in the light of these circumstances and&nbsp; of the provisions of Sections 3 and&nbsp; 4&nbsp; of Rule 30 just quoted, there can be no dispute that said third complaint was dismissed&nbsp; after&nbsp; due consideration of the issues raised therein&nbsp; and, therefore,&nbsp; said&nbsp; dismissal must have the effect of an adjudication&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; merits of the case. <br>&nbsp;<br>It may be said, as appellant does say,&nbsp; that Rule 30&nbsp; on "Dismissal of Actions"&nbsp; refers&nbsp; to&nbsp; procedure in the&nbsp; courts of first-instance, but this argument is of no&nbsp; consequence, because Section 19, Rule 4, of the Rules of Court (regarding "Procedure&nbsp; in Inferior Courts")&nbsp; prescribes&nbsp; that certain rules, <i>among&nbsp; which Rule 30 is expressly indicated</i>,&nbsp; "are applicable in inferior courts in cases falling&nbsp; within their jurisdiction and in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rule." <br>&nbsp;<br>The order of Judge Icasiano holding that&nbsp; "the present action has already been barred&nbsp; by a proper judgment and therefore&nbsp; constitutes <i>res adjudicata</i>", was affirmed by the Court <i>a quo</i> in the following language:<br><blockquote>"This order of dismissal (referring to the order of&nbsp; Judge TCstrella Abad Santos) constitutes, in tile opinion of the Court, an adjudication upon the merits.&nbsp; The&nbsp; same was not based&nbsp; on default,&nbsp; neither it is a dismissal for failure of the plaintiff to&nbsp; appear under&nbsp; Section 12, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court. • • •.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The failure of the plaintiff to answer the motion to dismiss does not constitute failure to appear in&nbsp; answer to&nbsp; the&nbsp; summons and consequently the dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case will&nbsp; bar the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; oi&nbsp; a subsequent action for the&nbsp; same cause.&nbsp; The order of dismissal&nbsp; of Judge Estrella Abad Santos is different from the order of dismissal contemplated in&nbsp; Section 12,&nbsp; Rule 4,&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, and her order operates as an adjudication' of the case on the merits." </blockquote>We are in full accord with&nbsp; these&nbsp; findings&nbsp; of&nbsp; both the inferior and lower courts. <br>&nbsp;<br>In view of&nbsp; this conclusion We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; need to discuss any more the other ground for dismissal of&nbsp; the case as submitted by defendants' counsel, to wit:&nbsp; that the complaint states no cause of action against&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; may briefly state,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that said&nbsp; ground was&nbsp; also&nbsp; well taken, because as contended by counsel for&nbsp; the defendants:&nbsp; (1)<br><br>according to General Rule No. 3,&nbsp; dated January 25, 1930, the bail bond plaintiff furnished for his temporary release during the pendency&nbsp; of said criminal case, became part of the insular&nbsp; funds,&nbsp; not funds&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City of&nbsp; Manila; hence neither defendant City of Manila&nbsp; nor its co-defendant officers can be&nbsp; held liable to refund the same even after the' alleged termination of his criminal case before&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila; and (2) the said cash bail&nbsp; bond&nbsp; being a pre-war deposit&nbsp; which&nbsp; remained&nbsp; unsettled or&nbsp; unliquidated&nbsp; soon after the war&nbsp; and until&nbsp; the present, clearly and truly constituted part of a, government account declared frozen by&nbsp; virtue of Executive Order&nbsp; No. 25 of&nbsp; the President of. the Philippines. <br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs in&nbsp; all three instances against plaintiff. It&nbsp; is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B. L</i>., and&nbsp; <i>Endencia, JJ</i>., concur. .</div>
