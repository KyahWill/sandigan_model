				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These are appeals from two decisions of the Land Registration
Commission dated 7 February and 30 April 1957, upholding the refusal of
the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Rizal to record the
claimants' adverse claims under the provisions of section 110, Act No.
496 (LRC Consultas Nos. 137 &amp; 149).<p></p>
<p>On 24 December 1956 Pedro Moraga filed in the Office of the
Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Rizal an affidavit of
adverse claim subscribed and sworn to by him, claiming ownership of a
parcel of land known as Lot No. 14, Block No. 51-C of the subdivision
plan Psd-15136, situate in barrio Calaanan, municipality of Caloocan,
province of Rizal, containing an area of 682.5 sq. m. more or less,
described in transfer certificate of title No. 47961 issued in the name
of John O. Yu, married to Aniceta T. Yu, registered on page 161, volume
516 of the registration book in the registry of deeds of Rizal, on the
ground that in or about the year 1945 the Philippine Realty Corporation
sold the said parcel of land to a Chinese citizen disqualified to
acquire public agricultural lands or to hold lands of the public domain
in the Philippines; that the contract of sale of the parcel of land in
question to the disqualified alien is null and void and neither the
vendor nor the vendee retained or acquired ownership thereof; that he
and his predecessors-in-interest have been in actual continuous,
public, exclusive and uninterrupted possession of the parcel of land in
question for more than ten years and built two houses thereon; that no
one has claimed from them ownership or possession of the parcel of land
in question or demanded from them payment of rentals for its use and
occupation and whatever right the alien vendee had in it already has
prescribed; and that the registered owner was aware that the appellant
had been in possession of the parcel of land in question when he bought
it from the Philippine Realty Corporation and that the transaction
between the Philippine Realty Corporation and the disqualified alien
was illegal. The appellant requested the Registrar of Deeds to record
his adverse claim pursuant to section 110, Act No. 496.</p>
<p>On 29 December 1956 the Registrar of Deeds referred the request and
submitted the following questions to the Land Registration Commission
for resolution pursuant to section 4, Republic Act No. 1151:</p>
<ol><li> Is not Pedro Moraga a mere squatter on registered private land?<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>
If Pedro Moraga is a mere squatter on registered private land, has he
the right to encumber the title to that land with an annotation of
adverse claim?<br>
    <br>
  </li><li> Is  the  adverse claim of  Pedro  Moraga  registerable?    (LRC Consulta No. 137.)</li></ol>
<p>On 7 February 1957 the Land Registration Commission rendered a
decision declining to answer the first and second queries on the ground
that it has no jurisdiction to pass upon and determine the first
question and the second question is hypothetical, but answering the
third question in the negative because the parcel of land in question
being registered under Act No. 496, the appellant's claim of
prescription and/or adverse possession is untenable for "No title to
registered land in derogation to that of the registered owner shall be
acquired by prescription or adverse possession."</p>
<p>On 26 February 1957 the appellant filed a motion for
reconsideration. On 12 March 1957 John O. Yu, the registered owner who
had intervened, filed an opposition to the motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p>On 28 February 1957 Juan Estella, Felicisimo Vargas, Maximo de Lara,
Domingo Samson and Florentina Tabocboc by counsel filed in the Land
Registration Commission a written consulta based upon an affidavit of
adverse claim subscribed and sworn to by them, the first two claiming
ownership to one-third; the rest, to one-third; and Pedro Moraga to
one-third of the parcel of land in question, on the same grounds
invoked by the latter in his affidavit of adverse claim filed in the
first case. They prayed that the Registrar of Deeds be ordered to
register their respective adverse claims under the provisions of
section 110, Act No. 496 (LRC Consulta No. 149).</p>
<p>On 30 April 1957 the Land Registration Commission denied the motion
for reconsideration of Pedro Moraga in LRC Consulta No. 137 and the
petition of the other appellants in LRC Consulta No. 149, reiterating
its decision dated 7 February 1957 in the first case.</p>
<p>The Land Registration Commission properly declined to answer the
first and second questions submitted to it for the reasons given and
correctly answered the third question in the first case, because the
parcel of land in question having been registered under the provisions
of Act No. 496, no title in derogation to that of the registered owner
may be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
The registration of the appellants' adverse claim would, serve no
useful purpose because it could not validly and legally affect the
parcel of land in question. The cases of Gurbax Singh Pabla and Co. <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 92 Phil., 177; 48 Off. Gaz., 4365 and Register of Deeds of Manila <em>vs</em>.
Tinoco, 53 Off. Gaz., 2804, cited by the appellants in support of their
contention that it is the ministerial duty of the Registrar of Deeds to
register their respective adverse claims, do not apply to the cases at
bar. There this Court upheld the registration of contracts of lease
affecting the real property as an adverse claim notwithstanding the
assertion of invalidity and nullity of the contracts of lease because
that question should be determined and passed upon in the proper
proceedings after registration. Here the appellant's adverse claim of
ownership is based upon prescription and adverse possession, the
registration of which, as already stated, would serve no useful purpose
and could not validly and legally affect the parcel of land.</p>
<p>The appellants claim that as neither the vendor nor the vendee could
claim ownership of it, it reverted to the State as patrimonial
property, which they may acquire by prescription or under the free
patent law. Even if their claim of reversion to the State be sustained,
still their respective adverse claims cannot be registered.
Prescription does not run against the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
Besides, the reversion to the State of the parcel of land in question
did not withdraw it from the operation of the provisions of Act No.
496. Neither could the fact that their adverse possession which might
entitle them to acquire it under the free patent law constitute a
registerable adverse claim.</p>
<p>The decisions appealed from are affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p>
