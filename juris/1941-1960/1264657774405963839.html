				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 17, 1956, plaintiffs filed an action against defendants before the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila praying that the court order the&nbsp; partition&nbsp; between the parties in accordance&nbsp; with law of a building designated as 760 Sisa St., Sampaloc, Manila, built on six&nbsp; parcels of land&nbsp; situated in said city; that the sale made&nbsp; by the Sheriff of Manila of the properties mortgaged by plaintiffs to defendant Vivencio&nbsp; D. Antonio in Civil Case No. 18142 be declared illegal; that&nbsp; the amended writ of possession issued by the sheriff to place defendant Antonio in possession of the property sold be also declared&nbsp; illegal; and that the sheriff be enjoined from carrying out said writ and from disturbing&nbsp; plaintiffs' possession&nbsp; of the aforesaid building designated as 760 Sisa St. On&nbsp; January&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1956, the court granted ex parte the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction prayed for in the complaint thereby enjoining the Sheriff of Manila and defendant Vivencio D. Antonio from molesting and disturbing plaintiffs'&nbsp; possession of the building designated&nbsp; as 760 Sisa St.&nbsp; On January 20, 1956, defendants filed a&nbsp; motion praying that the writ thus granted be dissolved&nbsp; on two grounds:&nbsp; (1) the court has no jurisdiction to issue the writ, and&nbsp; (2) the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of the complaint are insufficient to justify the issuance of the writ.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the opposition interposed thereto by plaintiffs, the court on January 24, 1956&nbsp; issued an order dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>On January 27, 1956, plaintiffs filed an urgent motion praying for&nbsp; the reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; order dissolving the injunction, which was granted, the court setting aside the order&nbsp; and reinstating the writ&nbsp; as originally issued. On February 7, 1056, defendants again filed a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; last order reinstating the injunction, which was vigorously&nbsp; opposed by plaintiffs, and after both parties had submitted memoranda in support of their contentions, the court on February&nbsp; 18, 1956 not only dissolved the writ of injunction previously&nbsp; issued but dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; case for lack of&nbsp; merit. The court ruled that the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; raised having already&nbsp; been threshed out in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 18142&nbsp; of the same court, it has no&nbsp; jurisdiction to nullify the orders issued&nbsp; in that case.<br><br>Plaintiffs appealed in due time and the case was certified to us by the Court of Appeals on the ground that the questions involved are&nbsp; purely of law.<br><br>Plaintiffs executed in favor&nbsp; of defendant Vivencio D. Antonio a real&nbsp; estate mortgage covering five&nbsp; parcels of land and a building designated&nbsp; as 760 Sisa St. Sampaloc, Manila, to secure the&nbsp; payment of certain indebtedness. Plaintiffs having failed to pay the indebtedness as agreed upon, Antonio&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an action for the foreclosure of the mortgage&nbsp; before the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila which was docketed&nbsp; as Civil Case No. 18142.&nbsp; After trial, the court ordered the foreclosure of the mortgage, and the decision having become final, a writ of execution was issued&nbsp; and the&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; sold the properties mortgaged at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; in accordance with law.&nbsp; The properties were sold to Antonio as the highest bidder and the sheriff executed&nbsp; in his favor a deed&nbsp; of sale on September&nbsp; 1, 1955.&nbsp; On September 19, 1955,&nbsp; Antonio filed a motion for a writ of possession, which was granted, and accordingly, the sheriff issued the&nbsp; corresponding writ&nbsp; but, through&nbsp; inadvertence, he failed&nbsp; to include&nbsp; therein&nbsp; the residential house designated as&nbsp; 760 Sisa St. Taking advantage of this omission, the Lacuna spouses, defendants therein,&nbsp; plaintiffs in&nbsp; the present case, wrote a&nbsp; letter to the sheriff registering&nbsp; their&nbsp; opposition to the placing of Antonio in possession of the building,&nbsp; alleging that the&nbsp; same was not included in the writ, and having been informed of the omission, Antonio also wrote a letter to the sheriff requesting that&nbsp; the error be&nbsp; rectified, to which request the sheriff&nbsp; acceded by issuing on November 15, 1955&nbsp; an <span style="font-style: italic;">amended writ of possession.&nbsp;</span> Thereupon, the Lacuna spouses filed a motion to&nbsp; suspend&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended writ contending&nbsp; that the same has been&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the sheriff in an&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; manner, to&nbsp; which&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; filed an opposition.&nbsp; After both parties&nbsp; had been heard, the court denied the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when their motion for reconsideration was denied, the Lacuna spouses initiated the present case labelling it as an action for partition though in substance its&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; thwart the&nbsp; amended writ of possession&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 18142.<br><br>There&nbsp; is no merit&nbsp; in the&nbsp; claim that&nbsp; the&nbsp; instant case is merely one of partition&nbsp; of the residential building designated as 760 Sisa St., which is erected on the six parcels of land mortgaged&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of defendant Vivencio D. Antonio and which was the subject of foreclosure in&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 18142 because in substance its purpose is to&nbsp; declare&nbsp; null and&nbsp; void&nbsp; not only the amended writ of possession issued&nbsp; by the sheriff on November 15, 1955 but also the certificate of sale issued in favor of defendant Antonio&nbsp; as a result&nbsp; of the&nbsp; auction sale carried out by the sheriff in said case.&nbsp; This can be clearly seen by a cursory examination&nbsp; of the allegations of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint wherein it is prayed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; steps taken by the sheriff in said case relative to the execution of the judgment and to the placing of creditor&nbsp; Antonio in possession of the property sold be nullified&nbsp; on the ground that the amendment&nbsp; made by the sheriff of the writ of possession by including the&nbsp; residential&nbsp; building designated&nbsp; as 760&nbsp; Sisa&nbsp; St., which was inadvertently omitted was made without authority of law. Evidently, this cannot be done&nbsp; for&nbsp; it is well-settled in law and in jurisprudence that a&nbsp; court of first instance&nbsp; has no power nor jurisdiction to annul judgments or decrees of&nbsp; a coordinate court because that&nbsp; function&nbsp; devolves upon the proper appellate court.<br><br>Thus,&nbsp; "it is settled by an overwhelming weight of authority that no court has power to interfere by injunction with the judgment or decrees of a,court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction having equal power to grant the relief sought by injunction.&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; The various branches&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila are in&nbsp; a&nbsp; sense coordinate courts and&nbsp; to&nbsp; allow them&nbsp; to interfere with&nbsp; each others'&nbsp; judgments&nbsp; or&nbsp; decrees by injunctions would obviously lead to&nbsp; confusion and might seriously hinder the administration of justice"&nbsp; (Cabigao <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Del Rosario, 44 Phil., 182).&nbsp; It has also been&nbsp; held that "The rule which prohibits a Judge from interfering with the&nbsp; actuations&nbsp; of the Judge of another branch of the same court&nbsp; is not infringed&nbsp; when the&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; who modifies or annuls the order issued by the other Judge acts in the&nbsp; same&nbsp; case&nbsp; and belongs to the same court. (Eleazar <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Zandueta,&nbsp; 48 Phil., 197.)&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">But the rule is infringed where&nbsp; the Judge&nbsp; of a branch of the court issues a writ of preliminary injunction in a&nbsp; case to enjoin the sheriff from carrying out an order&nbsp; of execution issued in&nbsp; another&nbsp; case&nbsp; by the Judge&nbsp; of another&nbsp; branch of the same&nbsp; court."</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Philippine&nbsp; National Bank <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Javellana, 92&nbsp; Phil., 525; 49 Off. Gaz., [1]&nbsp; 124; Italics supplied.)<br><br>Appellants cannot pretend that the residential building designated as 760 Sisa St., has been improperly included by the sheriff in the amended writ of possession he has issued in connection with&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of the&nbsp; judgment because the&nbsp; same is actually&nbsp; covered by the&nbsp; mortgage and was included in the judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 18142.&nbsp; It has only been inadvertently omitted from the original&nbsp; writ&nbsp; and&nbsp; the sheriff later&nbsp; on&nbsp; rectified the error&nbsp; by amending&nbsp; the writ.&nbsp; It being a mere&nbsp; clerical error, the same can be rectified without authority&nbsp; of the court.<br><br>In any event, it appears that this matter has been brought to the attention of the court by appellant themselves when they objected to the amendment of the writ, but that their objection&nbsp; has&nbsp; been overruled.&nbsp; We find, therefore no error when the&nbsp; court <span style="font-style: italic;">a&nbsp; quo</span> dismissed the present case for lack of merit.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
