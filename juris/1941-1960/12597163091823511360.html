				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition for a writ of certiorari to&nbsp; annul an order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo entered&nbsp; in civil case&nbsp; No. 4237 directing&nbsp; the plaintiff to amend&nbsp; its complaint to include&nbsp; therein Lot No.&nbsp; 662,&nbsp; owned&nbsp; by the Corporation de los Padres Agustinos.<br><br>After&nbsp; the institution of condemnation proceedings by the City Fiscal of Iloilo to acquire certain lands for the widening of the Iloilo South Road, the petitioner moved ex-parte for authority to take&nbsp; possession of the lands sought to be expropriated.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 19 and&nbsp; 23&nbsp; January 1957&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court granted&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion.&nbsp; On 30 January, the&nbsp; Corporacion&nbsp; de los&nbsp; Padres Agustinos filed a motion calling the&nbsp; attention of the Court to the fact that in the&nbsp; complaint and in the ex-parte motion for&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; take possession of the lands to be expropriated, Lot No. 662, described in&nbsp; transfer certificate of title No.&nbsp; 342,&nbsp; issued in its name by the Registrar of Deeds and&nbsp; valued at&nbsp; about P1,800, is not included and that no deposit of its&nbsp; provisional value has been made by the petitioner in the&nbsp; Office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Treasurer as provided for in section 3, Rule 69.&nbsp; It prayed that the&nbsp; petitioner be directed to deposit with the Office of the City Treasurer within five days the sum of P1,800, the provisional value of the lot, or to restore the possession thereof to the movant&nbsp; (Annex A).&nbsp; On 2&nbsp; February, the Court ordered the petitioner to amend its complaint, within ten&nbsp; days from notice, to include Lot No. 662&nbsp; and to submit the appraised value of the lot to enable the Court to ascertain and&nbsp; fix provisionally the value thereof to be deposited by&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; (Annex B).&nbsp; On 6 February the petitioner&nbsp; moved&nbsp; for reconsideration (Annex C)&nbsp; and on&nbsp; 8 February amended&nbsp; its motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration (Annex D) praying that the order of 2 February be set aside.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 7 February the Corporacion de los Padres Agustinos objected to&nbsp; the petitioner's motion for reconsideration (Annex&nbsp; E).&nbsp; On 9&nbsp; February&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration (Annex F).&nbsp; On 16 February the&nbsp; petitioner filed a&nbsp; motion praying&nbsp; that the execution of the&nbsp; order be&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; pending resolution of the petition for a writ&nbsp; of certiorari to be filed&nbsp; in this Court&nbsp; (Annex G).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 18 February the respondent Court granted its motion (Annex H).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 1 March this petition was filed.<br><br>To begin with,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; Corporacion de los&nbsp; Padres Agustinos, the entity&nbsp; interested in sustaining&nbsp; the order&nbsp; complained of, has not been included as co-respondent&nbsp; in this proceedings, contrary to section&nbsp; 5, Rule 67, which partly provides:<br><blockquote>When the petition&nbsp; filed&nbsp; relates to the acts or omissions of a&nbsp; court or judge, the petitioner shall join, as parties&nbsp; defendant with such court or judge,&nbsp; the&nbsp; person&nbsp; or persons&nbsp; interested in sustaining the proceedings in the court; and&nbsp; it shall be the duty of such person or persons to appear and defend, both in his or&nbsp; their own behalf and in&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court or judge&nbsp; affected&nbsp; by the&nbsp; proceedings,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *,<br></blockquote>the petition for a writ of certiorari is defective.<br><br>Even if the procedural defect be overlooked or corrected by ordering the&nbsp; impleading of&nbsp; the indispensable&nbsp; party as respondent, still&nbsp; the petition has to be denied, for condemnation proceedings are within the jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance, and orders issued in the exercise of that jurisdiction in the absence of abuse cannot-be disturbed by this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of the respondent court to the plaintiff to amend its&nbsp; complaint to include Lot No.&nbsp; 662 owned by and registered in the name of the Corporation de los Padres Agustinos and taken possession of by the plaintiff because&nbsp; it was not included in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; for&nbsp; expropriation,&nbsp; does not constitute an&nbsp; abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Moreover, the plaintiff's&nbsp; claim as alleged in its&nbsp; amended motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration, that the lot in question has been&nbsp; occupied by it&nbsp; as&nbsp; a sidewalk since time immemorial, the same being outside the fence of the property of&nbsp; the Corporation&nbsp; de los Padres&nbsp; Agusnos; and&nbsp; that the City Fiscal cannot amend the complaint to&nbsp; include the lot, because the authority granted by&nbsp; the President to institute condemnation&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; does&nbsp; not expressly include the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; expropriate&nbsp; Lot No. 662, having been denied by the Corporation de los Padres Agustinos in its&nbsp; answer,&nbsp; the proper course for the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Court to pursue was to hear and receive evidence to&nbsp; enable it to determine whether or not the lot&nbsp; should be&nbsp; included.&nbsp; However, this&nbsp; step&nbsp; need&nbsp; not&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; because no&nbsp; copy of the alleged fifth indorsement dated 22 October 1956 of the Executive Secretary containing a&nbsp; list of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land authorized and&nbsp; directed&nbsp; by the President to be acquired&nbsp; through condemnation&nbsp; proceedings pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; section 64 (h)&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code (p. 4,&nbsp; Annex D) is attached to the petition for a writ of certiorari, and the respondent Court asserts in its answer filed in this Court that the&nbsp; said indorsement does not mention&nbsp; or enumerate the specific lots to&nbsp; be&nbsp; expropriated&nbsp; (p&nbsp; 2).&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; did not&nbsp; deny&nbsp; this assertion.<br><br>The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied,&nbsp; without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B.&nbsp; L.,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
