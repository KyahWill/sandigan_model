				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October 18, 1954, herein respondents&nbsp; filed an application in the Court of First Instance of Albay&nbsp; for the issuance of letters of administration in favor of one of them, Jesus V. Samson, for the estate&nbsp; of the late Jose V. Samson.&nbsp; On the same date, Jesus V.&nbsp; Samson was&nbsp; appointed special&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; the estate.<br><br>The application was&nbsp; opposed by petitioners&nbsp; Josefina N. Samson, the widow of Jose V.&nbsp; Samson and her three minor children&nbsp; Glenda N.&nbsp; Samson, Manuel N.&nbsp; Samson and Felix N. Samson.&nbsp;&nbsp; They asked for the granting of letters of administration in favor of Josefina N.&nbsp; Samson, in the place of&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Samson.&nbsp; After&nbsp; hearings that dragged for&nbsp; almost two years, Judge&nbsp; Alcasid, on March 12,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; issued an&nbsp; order&nbsp; appointing&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; Conda, Municipal Treasurer of Libon,&nbsp; Albay,&nbsp; as regular administrator.&nbsp; In that order the special administrator Jesus V. Samson was&nbsp; instructed, at the&nbsp; same thing, that&nbsp; "twenty (20)&nbsp; days from the receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; this order&nbsp; he shall turn over all properties&nbsp; and funds&nbsp; of the&nbsp; estate in his possession to the regular administrator as soon as the latter qualified." Antonio Conda put up&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; fixed by the court and, on March 19, 1956,&nbsp; letters of administration were issued in his favor.&nbsp; On April 3,1956, upon motion of the widow, the court issued an order requiring the special administrator&nbsp; to "deliver the properties and funds of the estate now in&nbsp; his possession to the regular administrator within three (3) days&nbsp; from receipt of this order"&nbsp; (Annex B).<br><br>It also appears that on March 27, 1956, respondents filed an appeal from the order of the court granting letters of administration in favor of Antonio Conda, and their record on appeal&nbsp; was approved&nbsp; on April 17, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 20,&nbsp; 1956, they filed a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; to set aside the approval of the bond posted&nbsp; by Antonio Conda as well as the letters of administration&nbsp; issued in his favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion having been denied&nbsp; througn an order issued&nbsp; on May 9, 1956, respondents resorted to the appellate courts.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, upon certiorari&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; by the special administrator and&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; siding with&nbsp; him, held that, on the authority&nbsp; of our decision in Cotia vs. Pecson,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; 49 Off. Gaz., 4318, the order appointing Antonio Conda as regular administrator was stayed by the appeal taken&nbsp; against&nbsp; it,&nbsp; and thereafter, Conda should not&nbsp; have been allowed to qualify&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; meantime, unless execution pending appeal should be ordered for special reasons pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 39, section<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of Court; and that "should the special administrator be found, after due process of law, unfit to&nbsp; continue", he "could be dismissed and another appointed to look after the interests of the estate&nbsp; until the appeal filed against Conda's appointment is finally disposed of.&nbsp; For these&nbsp; reasons, the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; set aside the appointment of Conda and annulled his&nbsp; bond.<br><br>Against this decision, the&nbsp; interested parties applied&nbsp; to this Court for a review.&nbsp; We&nbsp; granted&nbsp; <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>This Court has repeatedly decided that the appointment and removal of a special administrator&nbsp; are&nbsp; interlocutory proceedings incidental to&nbsp; the main case,&nbsp; and lie in the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Roxas vs. Pecson,2 46 Off. Gaz. 2058; Junquera vs. Borromeo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 7611; De Gala vs. Gonzales,&nbsp; 53 Phil.&nbsp; 106; Garcia vs. Flores,&nbsp; 101 Phil., 781,&nbsp; 64 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 4049).<br><br>Thus, in Roxas&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Pecson, supra,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court ruled:<br><blockquote>"It is well settled that the statutory provisions as to the prior or preferred right of certain persons&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment of administrator under section 1, Rule 81, as well as&nbsp; the statutory provisions as to causes for&nbsp; removal of&nbsp; an executor&nbsp; or administrator under section 653 of Act No. 190, now section&nbsp; 2, Rule 83,&nbsp; do not apply to the&nbsp; selection or&nbsp; removal&nbsp; of special administrator.&nbsp; (21&nbsp; Am. Jur., 8SS; De Gala vs.&nbsp; Gonzales and Ona, 53 Phil., 104, 106).&nbsp; As the law does not say who shall be appointed as special administrator and the qualifications the appointee&nbsp; must have,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judge or court has discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the selection of the&nbsp; person to&nbsp; be appointed, discretion which must be sounds that is, not whimsical or contrary to reason, justice or&nbsp; equity."</blockquote>It is well to mark that, in the present case,&nbsp; the special administrator was not actually removed by the court, but that he was superseded by the regular administrator by operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 81, section&nbsp; 3, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; provides&nbsp; thatâ€”<br><blockquote>"When letters testamentary or of administration are granted on the estate of the&nbsp; deceased, the power of the special&nbsp; administrator shall cease, and&nbsp; he shall&nbsp; forthwith&nbsp; deliver&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; executor&nbsp; or administrator the goods, chattels, money and estate of the deceased in&nbsp; his&nbsp; hands."</blockquote>No question&nbsp; of&nbsp; abuse of&nbsp; discretion can therefore&nbsp; arise on account of the order of&nbsp; April 8, 1958, requiring Jesus V. Samson to turn over the&nbsp; administration to&nbsp; the regular administrator, such result&nbsp; being ordained by&nbsp; law.&nbsp; Upon the other&nbsp; hand, the conditions of the estate justified&nbsp; the appointment and qualification of a&nbsp; regular administrator, because the&nbsp; special&nbsp; administration&nbsp; had lasted&nbsp; nearly&nbsp; two years,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; prompt settlement of the estate&nbsp; had been unduly delayed.&nbsp; The Albay court&nbsp; said in&nbsp; its&nbsp; order of March&nbsp; 12:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; It is also the sense of this Court that the appointment of any&nbsp; of their immediate relations would&nbsp; not end the bitter conflict that has so&nbsp; far raged&nbsp; as&nbsp; can&nbsp; be seen&nbsp; from the voluminous records of&nbsp; this case&nbsp; which&nbsp; have accumulated&nbsp; within&nbsp; a very short time,&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment of a disinterested person as regular administrator would be conducive to a smooth and peaceful administration of the properties&nbsp; of the estate.&nbsp; At any rate, the appointment&nbsp; of Jesus V. Samson as special administrator was but done in a. state of emergency."</blockquote>These&nbsp; reasons were supplemented by the order of May 9, 1956:<br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; is certainly&nbsp; against the. interests of justice and a frustration of the policy&nbsp; of those rules to extend&nbsp; unduly the time within which estates should be&nbsp; administered and to keep&nbsp; thereby the property from the possession and use of those who are entitled thereto.&nbsp; The view advanced by counsel for the special&nbsp; administrator that&nbsp; the appointment of&nbsp; a regular administrator cannot be&nbsp; effective until after the appeal interposed&nbsp; by the special administrator&nbsp; is finally determined by the&nbsp; appellate court is contrary to&nbsp; the&nbsp; spirit&nbsp; of policy&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court above referred&nbsp; to and would&nbsp; unduly delay&nbsp; the prompt&nbsp; settlement&nbsp; of the estate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased Jose&nbsp; V. Samson,&nbsp; specially considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; this special proceeding&nbsp; was commenced&nbsp; as far back as&nbsp; October 18, 1954,&nbsp; or&nbsp; more than one and one-half years ago, and that&nbsp; the notice of the creditors, as provided in section&nbsp; 1, Rule&nbsp; 87, cf the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court, cannot even&nbsp; be issued until after letters of administration&nbsp; have&nbsp; been granted by&nbsp; the Court to the regular&nbsp; administrator."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Decision,&nbsp; Ct. App., p,&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)</blockquote>Even assuming1 that the rule in Cotia vs. Pecson, 49 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; 4313&nbsp; (tho it&nbsp; actually dealt with&nbsp; the removal&nbsp; of a <i>regular</i> administrator) is applicable to the&nbsp; case at bar,&nbsp; in the sense that&nbsp; the appointment&nbsp; of a&nbsp; new administrator should be made effective pending appeal&nbsp; only&nbsp; if&nbsp; Rule 39, section 2&nbsp; (execution&nbsp; pending&nbsp; appeal)&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with, such&nbsp; compliance exists&nbsp; in the present&nbsp; case, for the order of April 3, 1956 (issued upon motion of herein petitioners) that required&nbsp; the special administrator to&nbsp; turn over the properties and funds of the estate to the regular&nbsp; administrator, was&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect a&nbsp; special order&nbsp; for the carrying out of the regular&nbsp; administration notwithstanding the appeal of respondents&nbsp; that&nbsp; was not&nbsp; perfected&nbsp; until&nbsp; April 12, 1956;&nbsp; while the special&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; for&nbsp; immediately carrying the order&nbsp; into effect&nbsp; are given in the order of March 12, as supplemented by&nbsp; that of&nbsp; May 9,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; heretofore quoted.&nbsp; We find these reasons&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; (<i>cf.</i> De Borja vs. Encarnacion, 89 Phil., 239).<br><br>The fact that&nbsp; these reasons were&nbsp; not&nbsp; expressed in the very&nbsp; order of&nbsp; April 3, 1956, is not&nbsp; by&nbsp; itself fatal or constitutive of&nbsp; abuse of discretion; for&nbsp; while Rule 39, section 2,&nbsp; prescribes that execution&nbsp; pending&nbsp; appeal may issue for good reasons to be&nbsp; stated in a special order, this Court has&nbsp; decided that the element that gives validity to an order of immediate execution&nbsp; is the existence of good reasons, if they may be found distinctly somewhere in the record, altho not expressly stated in the&nbsp; order of execution itself&nbsp; (Lusk vs. Stevens, 54&nbsp; Phil. 154; Guevarra vs. Court of First Instance of Laguna,&nbsp; 70 Phil. 48; People's Bank vs. San Jose,&nbsp; 96&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 895, 51 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., [6] 2918; Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court&nbsp; [1957 ed.,] Vol. I, p.&nbsp; 540).<br><br>All&nbsp; told,&nbsp; the case boils&nbsp; down&nbsp; to this:&nbsp; The removal of the special administrator is at the court's sound discretion, and the orders of March 12&nbsp; and&nbsp; May&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1956 show that there were good&nbsp; reasons to&nbsp; terminate&nbsp; the special&nbsp; administration.&nbsp; This being so, the&nbsp; heirs can&nbsp; not seek to&nbsp; prolong the tenure&nbsp; of the removed special&nbsp; administrator by appealing&nbsp; Conda's appointment as regular&nbsp; administrator.&nbsp; It may be&nbsp; argued&nbsp; that during&nbsp; the appeal, the estate&nbsp; should be under special administration; but it&nbsp; does not&nbsp; appear that Amadeo Samson and his partisans have so asked the court nor&nbsp; have&nbsp; they proposed another administrator and therefore,&nbsp; their&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; against&nbsp; the court's action is unmeritorious.<br><br>A minor procedural point must&nbsp; be noted.&nbsp; In&nbsp; special proceedings, the judge whose&nbsp; order is under attack is merely a nominal party; wherefore, a judge in his&nbsp; official capacity should not&nbsp; be made to appear&nbsp; as&nbsp; a party&nbsp; seeking reversal of a decision&nbsp; that&nbsp; is unfavorable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; action taken by him.&nbsp; A decent regard for the judicial hierarchy bars a judge from&nbsp; suing against the&nbsp; adverse opinion of a&nbsp; higher court,&nbsp; and counsel&nbsp; should&nbsp; realize the fact&nbsp; and not include the Judge's name in ulterior proceedings.<br><br>We see no abuse of discretion in the orders of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; complained&nbsp; of.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals is reversed and the original petition for certiorari&nbsp; filed by the special&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; is ordered dismissed, and the writ&nbsp; denied, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the respondents&nbsp; in this&nbsp; Court, Jesus&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Samson, et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br>P<i>aras, C.
