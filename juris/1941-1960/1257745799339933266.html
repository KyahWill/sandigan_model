				<BR><BR><div align="justifiy">Petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain the respondent Judge of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila from trying herein petitioner Magdalena 
Sangalang in Criminal Case No. 46860 pending in that court on the ground of 
double jeopardy.
<p>No answer to the petition has been filed in behalf of the respondent Judge or 
of the People of the Philippines.</p>
<p>From the verified petition and the pleadings and documents annexed thereto, 
it appears that in an information filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Manila on April 18, 1952, petitioner Magdalena Sangalang was, together with 
Enriqueta Pascoquin, Nicodemus Domingo and Bayani de la Cruz, charged with 
qualified theft alleged to have been committed by them on or about January 15, 
1952 by taking and carrying away 15,000 empty jute bags belonging to the 
National Rice and Corn Corporation (NA-RIC). (Criminal Case No. 18659.) After 
the prosecution had rested its case, all of the accused filed their respective 
motions for dismissal based on insufficiency of evidence to establish their 
guilt. Sustaining the motion filed by the petitioner Magdalena Sangalang and 
Bayani de la Cruz, the Hon. Francisco E. Jose, Judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, issued an order dismissing the case as against them with 
costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p>More than four years later, or on September 3, 1957, the same assistant city 
fiscal for Manila, who filed the information in Criminal Case No. 18659 for 
qualified theft, again charged the petitioner and one Leandro Cas-telo, this 
time with the crime of estafa alleged to have been committed by them by inducing 
one Enriqueta Pascoquin to buy certain NARIC invoices for 15,000 empty sacks, 
which invoices turned out tabe fictitious and falsified. (Case No. 41366.) It 
will be noted that the complainant, Enriqueta Pascoquin, was one of the accused 
in Criminal Case No. 18659 of the same court and the crime charged, as in the 
first information, took place on January 15, 1952. Upon being arraigned, 
petitioner entered the plea of "not guilty". Thereafter, she asked the 
permission of the court to withdraw her plea of "not guilty" for the purpose of 
enabling her to file a motion to quash the information filed against her. The 
request having been granted, petitioner filed in due form a motion to quash the 
information on the grourtd of double jeopardy. Sustaining the motion to quash, 
the court on March 14, 1958, dismissed the case as against her, with one-half of 
the costs de oficio. This order was not appealed and has therefore become final 
and conclusive.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1958, a third information against herein petitioner was filed 
in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case No. 46860) for the same 
and identical offense of estafa charged in Criminal Case No. 41366 in spite of 
the order of dismissal therein which had long become final and conclusive. Again 
invoking double jeopardy, the petitioner, thru counsel, filed a motion to quash 
the information. The respondent Judge, however, in an order dated July 11, 1959, 
denied the motion and ordered petitioner's arraignment. Motion for 
reconsideration having been also denied, petitioner brought the case to this 
Court through the present petition for prohibition.</p>
<p>The petition is meritorious.</p>
<p>An order sustaining a motion to quash on the ground of double jeopardy 
constitutes a bar to another prosecution for the same cause. (Sec. 8, Rule 113, 
Rules of Court.) The record clearly shows that in Criminal Case No. 41366, 
wherein petitioner was charged with the offense of estafa, the latter's motion 
to quash on the ground of double jeopardy wds sustained and the case dismissed 
as against her. In not therefore dismissing the information in the proceedings 
below charging petitioner with the same offense, the respondent Judge committed 
a grave abuse of his discretion. (People <em>vs</em>. Petilla, 92 Phil., 395; 48 
Off. Gaz., 5288.)</p>
<p>This Court fails to see any plausible reason for the filing of the 
information in the present case, considering that the defense,of double jeopardy 
is patently clear from the facts appearing on record. The law makes it a legal 
duty for prosecuting officers to file the charges against whomsoever the 
evidence may show to be responsible for an offense, but in the performance of 
their functions, they are equally duty bound to exercise a high degree of 
prudence and discrimination to the end that no one shall be twice put in 
jeopardy for the same offense. In this way, the danger, annoyance and vexation1 
suffered by the accused after going thru the process of being arrested, 
subjected to a preliminary investigation, arraigned and required to plead and 
stand trial may be avoided.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of prohibition is granted and the preliminary injunction 
heretofore issued made permanent, with costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Writ granted</em>.</p></div>
