				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is a petition for&nbsp; <i>certiorari </i>seeking a modification of&nbsp;&nbsp; the order of respondent&nbsp;&nbsp; judge dated.&nbsp; January 14, 1957 in the sense of allowing, petitioner an extension of forty-five (45) days to exercise her option to purchase the "Legarda-Tambunting Subdivision" and other persons who may enter the bid for the sale thereof in order to obtain the best price possible for the benefit of the estate and of all&nbsp; the heirs of the deceased.<br><br>Dña. Clara Tambunting died on April 2, 1950 in&nbsp; the City of Manila leaving a will which was&nbsp; probated in due time (Special Proceedings No. 10808).&nbsp; Her husband Don Vicente L. Legarda was appointed special administrator and among the properties&nbsp; he included in&nbsp; the inventory submitted to the court as part of the conjugal property is the "Legarda-Tambunting Subdivision" located at&nbsp; Rizal Avenue Extension,&nbsp; City of Manila, containing an approximate area of&nbsp; 80,000 square meters&nbsp; and described in&nbsp; Transfer Certificates&nbsp; Of&nbsp;&nbsp; Title Nos. 59585, 29578, 62042, 45149 said 40957&nbsp; or&nbsp; the land records&nbsp; of said.&nbsp; city. <br><br>On February 24, 1956, Don Vicente L. Legarda also died&nbsp; in the City of Manila leaving likewise a will which in&nbsp; due time was&nbsp; also duly probated&nbsp;&nbsp; (Special Proceeding No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 29062).&nbsp; In&nbsp; that will,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; surviving widow,&nbsp; herein petitioner, was&nbsp; given one-half (1/2) of the&nbsp; entire estate.&nbsp; As a result,&nbsp;&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of the late&nbsp; Clara Tambunting which was still pending distribution became as follows:&nbsp; the&nbsp; minor&nbsp;&nbsp; Clara&nbsp; Tambunting, Conchita S.&nbsp; Vda.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Legarda,&nbsp; herein petitioner; and&nbsp; the nephews of Dña. Clara Tambunting,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; Augusto,&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin,&nbsp; Romeo and Julieta,&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp; surnamed&nbsp; Tambunting. <br><br>On November 21, 1951, the probate court authorized the sale of the "Lesarda-Tambunting Subdivision" at a price of P30 to P50 per square meter upon petition of the then judicial administrator Vicente L.&nbsp; Legarda.&nbsp; As&nbsp; no purchaser has&nbsp; been&nbsp; found,&nbsp;&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; on July 31, 1956 again ordered&nbsp;&nbsp; the administrator Philippine Trust Company to&nbsp; sell&nbsp;&nbsp; "as&nbsp; is" the&nbsp; property&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; the best&nbsp; obtainable price.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; not until the early part of January, 1957, or on January 5,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp;&nbsp; to be exact, that Dr. Gregorio Venturanza offered to purchase the property&nbsp; for P650,000 under certain terms&nbsp; and&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp; No action&nbsp; was&nbsp; taken thereon until&nbsp; January 10,&nbsp; 1957 when on open bidding was held before the probate&nbsp;&nbsp; court at which two more bids were submitted," one&nbsp; by Manotok Realty Company and the other by A.U. Valencia Realty Company.&nbsp; Upon agreement of&nbsp; the bidders and the heirs,&nbsp; action,&nbsp; on the bids was postponed to&nbsp; January 14,&nbsp; 1957.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the latter date, the courts again postponed action to January 25, 1957,&nbsp; in an order wherein it&nbsp; provided,&nbsp; among other things, that&nbsp; "any or all&nbsp; of the hears may have a preferential&nbsp; option to purchase&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; property for themselves under the same terms&nbsp; and conditions as those considered most favorable by the Court of all the offers, provided that the offer to buy is submitted not later than 12:00 o'clock noon on January 35, 1957."<br><br>On January 22,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; counsel for petitioner filed an urgent motion for reconsideration praying,&nbsp; among other things,&nbsp;&nbsp; that an extension of forty-five&nbsp;&nbsp; (45)&nbsp; days be&nbsp; given within which&nbsp; the heirs may exercise&nbsp; their preferential option&nbsp; considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; the time&nbsp; given by&nbsp; the&nbsp; court for&nbsp; them to do so was short;&nbsp;&nbsp; praying at&nbsp; the same time for such additional and reasonable time as&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; judge may&nbsp; deem proper to allow outsiders&nbsp; to take part in&nbsp; the bid so&nbsp; as&nbsp; to obtain the&nbsp; best&nbsp; price for&nbsp; the property&nbsp; considering that&nbsp;&nbsp; the three bids already submitted&nbsp; offered a&nbsp; price&nbsp; of not more&nbsp; than P10 per square meter which was considered low taking&nbsp; into account&nbsp; that&nbsp; the property&nbsp; is&nbsp; located&nbsp; in a semi-commercial place.&nbsp; In the morning of January 25, 1957, the Land Tenure Office&nbsp; likewise filed an urgent petition seeking for an opportunity to take part&nbsp; in&nbsp; the bid emphasizing therein that&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; the government&nbsp; is allowed to acquire&nbsp; the property it would resell&nbsp;&nbsp; the same to <u>bonafide</u>&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; or occupants and&nbsp; in&nbsp; that way&nbsp; "long protracted&nbsp; litigations may&nbsp; be avoided,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both motions having been&nbsp; denied,&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner interposed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Petitioner contends&nbsp; that respondent&nbsp; judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying her motion&nbsp;&nbsp; for extension of&nbsp;&nbsp; the period within which the heirs may exercise their preferential option to purchase the property considering that&nbsp; the period so given was&nbsp; so short&nbsp; that&nbsp; it becomes&nbsp; useless&nbsp; having in mind&nbsp; the enormous value of the property which is&nbsp; located&nbsp; in a semi-commercial place and&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the three bids&nbsp; so far submitted only&nbsp; offered a price of P12.00 per square meter which could be greatly improved if mores time&nbsp; is&nbsp; allowed to the heirs a no to&nbsp; other interested persons.&nbsp; Petitioner further contends that as a rule the sale of a property of a deceased person is authorized when necessary to pay the debts&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; charges against&nbsp; the estate and when beneficial to the heirs (Buenaventura v. Ramos, 43 Phil., 704),&nbsp; and here such situation does not obtain because&nbsp; the judicial administrator has&nbsp; in its possession more than one million pesos (P1,000,000) representing the proceeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; other properties which is more&nbsp; than sufficient&nbsp; to pay the obligations and&nbsp;&nbsp; charges of&nbsp;&nbsp; the estates&nbsp;&nbsp; and so there&nbsp; is no reason for the undue hurry in 'the sale of&nbsp;&nbsp; the property in question. <br><br>The claim of petitioner does not find support&nbsp; in the record.&nbsp; It appears that as early as November 21, 1951,&nbsp; the probate court had already authorized the sale of&nbsp; the property at a price of P30 to P50 per square meter upon petition, of the former administrator.&nbsp; As no offer was forthcoming, the probate court on July 31, 1958 again directed the new administrator, Philippine Trust Company, to sell it at the best&nbsp; obtainable price.&nbsp; To implement this order, the Philippine Trust Company contacted several brokers in the city,&nbsp; advertised the property in several newspapers, offered it to the Philippine American Life&nbsp; Insurance Company and the Insular&nbsp; Life Assurance Company, Ltd., and even tried to interest the Land Tenure Administration considering that there were many squatters on the land.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these efforts, no bid come forth until January 5, 1957,&nbsp; or after a lapse of almost six years, when Dr. Gregorio A. Venturanza made an offer of P650,000.&nbsp; On January 10,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; an open, bidding was held before&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; court&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of all&nbsp; the heirs and other interested parties&nbsp; but&nbsp; on that occasion only two more bids were submitted, and the best offer only reached as high as P12.00 per square meter. During all this time,&nbsp; any of the heirs,&nbsp;&nbsp; including&nbsp; the petitioner,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; given preferential option, could have taken part&nbsp; in the bid,&nbsp; or looked for a&nbsp; buyer who&nbsp; could offer a satisfactory price, but they failed to do so and only&nbsp; in&nbsp; the last minute did they make a hasty move for additional&nbsp; time in a frantic effort&nbsp; to improve&nbsp; the bids. Considering the foregoing circumstances, it is doubtful if petitioner could accomplish her&nbsp; purpose even if her request is acceded.&nbsp; We are not therefore prepared to conclude in the circumstances that respondent&nbsp; judge committed an abuse&nbsp; of discretion in denying her motion. <br><br>There are several&nbsp; reasons why apparently a&nbsp; better offer cannot be obtained for the property.&nbsp; They are: (1) the property is largely occupied by&nbsp; squatters;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no up-to-date subdivision plan;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; there is no definite&nbsp; information as to the exact&nbsp; salable area of&nbsp; the subdivision;&nbsp; and. (4)&nbsp; there is&nbsp; need for a resurvey and relocation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the subdivision.<br><br>It is true tint the Land Tenure Administration has also intervened in as effort&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; acquire&nbsp;&nbsp; the land for&nbsp; the benefit of the actual occupants, but at the hearing, held on January 25, 1957, it was&nbsp;&nbsp; revealed that said office did not have the money with which to buy the land.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that this&nbsp; land had been offered&nbsp; to&nbsp; said office by&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Trust&nbsp; Company as&nbsp; early as May 8, 1956 but since then that&nbsp; office&nbsp; did not&nbsp; take any action.&nbsp; At any rate, even if this property were sold now, the government may still intervene if necessary to protect the interest&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; occupants.<br><br>Petition is denied, without pronouncement as to costs. The injunction issued by this Court is hereby dissolved. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.J., Bengzon Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; J.B.L., Endencia,</i>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,&nbsp;&nbsp; JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
