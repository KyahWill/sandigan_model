				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 8, 1954, Gloria Lagman filed a complaint for forcible abduction 
against Alberto Pañgan, Arsenio Pabalan, Jr., and one Teofilo Dizon in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Mexico, Pampanga. After the required preliminary 
examination, the court issued a warrant for the arrest of the three accused who 
later filed bail bonds for their provisional release. On June 3, 1954, after the 
necessary preliminary investigation, the justice of the peace court forwarded 
the case to the court of first instance for further proceedings wherein it was 
docketed as Criminal Case No. 1884.
<p>Before filing a formal complaint, the provincial fiscal conducted a 
reinvestigation of the case wherein both complainant and the three accused were 
present assisted by counsel. After the reinvestigation, finding that the 
evidence was insufficient to hold Pañgan and Pabalan, Jr. criminally liable, the 
fiscal filed a motion for dismissal of the case as to them, limiting the 
information against Teofilo Dizon only. On September 10, 1956, the court granted 
the motion and, accordingly, dismissed the case against Pañgan and Pabalan, 
Jr.</p>
<p>Five months thereafter, or on February 18, 1957, the complainant filed a 
motion for reconsideration praying that the order be set aside on the grounds 
(a) that no copy of the motion for dismissal was served on her counsel, nor was 
the latter notified of the hearing thereof, notwithstanding the fact that his 
appearance had already been made of record; and (b) the finding of the 
provincial fiscal that the evidence was insufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> 
case against Pañgan and Pabalan, Jr. is erroneous. This motion was opposed by 
the fiscal who contended that he did not commit any error in the evaluation of 
the evidence and that under the law he had the authority and discretion to file 
a motion for dismissal even over the objection of the private prosecutor. On 
June 11, 1957, the court granted the motion and, accordingly, set aside its 
previous order and set the hearing of the motion for dismissal filed by the 
fiscal on June 27, 1957. On this latter date, the court, upon petition of 
private counsel, issued another order granting the accused Pañgan and Pabalan, 
Jr. ten (10) days within which to reinstate their bail bonds with the 
understanding that, if they fail to do so, it will order their arrest. The 
effects of these two orders, however, have been suspended in order to give the 
two accused, or their counsel, an opportunity to test the validity of said 
order-before the Supreme Court. Hence, the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>The issue before us is whether the lower court acted properly or within its 
jurisdiction when it set aside its order of September 10, 1956 dismissing the 
case against petitioners nine months thereafter, or on June 11, 1957.</p>
<p>The lower court, in setting aside its previous order of dismissal, said: 
"Without passing upon the evidence adduced in the justice of the peace court and 
in the office of the fiscal, and considering that the court may take into 
account any information that the private prosecutor may furnish the court (U.S. 
vs. Barredo, 32 Phil., 444, 449-451), the order of September 10, 1956 is set 
aside x x x." Evidently, the lower court considered it necessary for the fiscal 
to notify the private prosecutor of his motion for dismissal before action can 
be taken thereon in view of the following comment made by this Court in the 
Barredo case, to wit: "But if he (the Judge) is not satisfied with the reason 
assigned by the fiscal, or if it appears to him from the record of the 
proceedings in the court of the Justice of the Peace, or <u>as a result of 
information furnished by the private prosecutor</u>, or otherwise, that the case 
should not be dismissed, he may deny the motion." (Underlining supplied) And the 
lower court set aside its previous order because the private prosecutor was not 
notified of the motion of dismissal.</p>
<p>While the court may find it necessary to hear the views of a private 
prosecutor before acting on a motion for dismissal filed by the fiscal, it does 
not follow that it can set aside its order dismissing the case even if the same 
has already become final. The comment made by this Court in the Barredo case is 
merely persuasive in character, which it may follow in the exercise of its 
discretion, but there is no law which requires notice to a private prosecutor, 
because under our rules all criminal actions are prosecuted "under the direction 
and control of the fiscal" (Section 4, Rule 106). And we say that the order in 
question has already become final because-more than fifteen (15) days had 
elapsed since it was issued by the court (Section 6, Rule 118). In this 
instance, the motion for reconsideration was filed five months thereafter and 
the order of the court reconsidering it, after nine months. It is apparent that 
the lower court acted without jurisdiction in issuing the order in question.</p>
<p>Another error committed by the lower court is when it ordered petitioners to 
file new bail bonds for their provisional liberty even if the case against them 
had been dismissed. This can only be done if a new complaint is filed against 
them and the required preliminary examination conducted as required by law.</p>
<p>We therefore hold that the orders issued by the lower court dated June 11, 
1957 and June 27, 1957 are null and void and should be set aside. The remedy of 
the offended party is to lodge a new complaint against petitioners either before 
the justice of the peace court having jurisdiction over the case, or with the 
provincial fiscal, and have a new examination conducted as required by law. In 
case the provincial fiscal should fail or refuse to act even when there is 
sufficient evidence on which action may be taken, the offended party may take up 
the matter with the secretary of Justice who may then take such measures as may 
be necessary in the interest of justice under Section 1679 of the Revised 
Administrative Code.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted. The orders subject flatter of the petition 
are hereby set aside. No costs.</p>

Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
