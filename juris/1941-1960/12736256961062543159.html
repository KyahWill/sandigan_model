				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal in three separate criminal cases tried and decided by the Court of First Instance of Cagayan.<br><br>In
 Case No. 1091-a (now G.R. No. L-6033), for the murder of Fernando Pablo,
 the accused Cecilio Rol was acquitted, while the res of his co-accused -
 Loreto Oliva, Jose C. Villanueva, Adriano Quinsay, and Daniel Ulsano - 
were convicted of the crime, qualified by abuse of superior strength, 
and aggravated by the circumstance of having taken advantage of their 
public position as municipal policemen, offset by the mitigating 
circumstance of lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as the one 
committed; and sentenced to suffer each <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>,
 to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Fernando 
Pablo in the sum of P6,000 without subsidary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay 1/5 of the costs. From this judgment, the four 
convicted accused appealed to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the 
case to us for decision, considering that all the appellants have been 
sentenced to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<br><br>In
 Cases Nos. 1092-A and 1093-A for arbitrary detention of Eliseo and 
Sofronio Arreola, with physical injuries (now G.R. No.L-6034 and 6035), 
accused Angel C. Adap, Alfonso Martinez, Restituto Fronda, Joel 
Macatiag, and Marcelo Guillermo were acquitted; while the other 
defendants Loreto A. Oliva, Jose C. Villanueva, Daniel Ulsano, and 
Adriano Quinsay were found guilty as charged, and all of them were 
sentenced in each of the two cases to suffer an indeterminate penalty of
 from 4 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> as minimum to years and 4 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>
 as maximum; to pay jointly and severally to Eliseo Arreola the sum of 
P75,00 in Case No. 1092-A and to Sofronio Arreola the sum of P50.00 in 
Case No. 1093-A, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency but 
not exceeding 1/3 of the principal penalty; and to pay in each of said 
cases 1/10 of the costs. From this judgment, the defendants likewise 
appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the latter again certified the 
case to us, for decision together with the appeal in the murder case, 
upon the ground that the three cases arose out of the same acts and 
occasion.<br><br>During the pendency of these cases in this Court, 
appellant Adriano Quinsay moved to withdraw his appeal in all three 
cases, which motion was granted. This decision therefore involves only 
the appeals of Loreto A. Oliva, Jose C. Villanueva, and Daniel Ulsano<br><br>Upon a careful review of the records, we find the following facts to be undisputed:<br><br>At
 about 10:00 o'clock in the morning of September 3, 1951 a police patrol
 composed of ten members of the police force of Aparri, Cagayan composed
 of Sgt. Jose C. Villanueva, and Policemen Daniel Ulsano, Alfonso 
Martinez, Joel Macatiag, Marcelo Guillermo, and Angel Adap, at the 
command of Lieutenant Loreto A. Oliva, headed for barrio Bakiling, 
Aparri, to investigate the reported murder or suspicious death of one 
Remegio Marcos. The investigation in Bakiling lasted up to about 4 
o'clock in the afternoon; and when the partol was about to return to the
 <span style="font-style: italic;">poblacion</span>, it was met by a 
truck of the Panifual Saw Mill, from which one Anacleto Abarriao (alias 
"Big Boy") alighted and complained to the police that on the previous 
day, at the cockpit of Binalan, Aparri, he had trouble with and was 
maltreated by the brothers Eliseo and Sofronio Arreola and their 
relative Fernando Pablo, all of Fugu, Ballesteros. Wherefore, the patrol
 rode on the Sawmill truck and proceeded to Fugu. Upon arrival, Lt. 
Oliva instructed his men to summon Eliseo Arreol, Sofronio Arreola, and 
Fernando Pablo, for the purpose of settling their trouble with Abarriao.
 Policemen Ulsano, Macatiag, and Guillermo picked up Eliseo from his 
house and Sofronio from the ricefield where he was plowing; while 
Mariano Dancel fetched Fernando Pablo. The three men, who were 
interested in having their dispute with Abarriao settled, voluntarily 
went with the police, and when brought before Lt. Oliva were asked be 
the latter to board the truck and come with the police to Aparri so that
 they could save the expense of the fare in going to town the following 
day. At Nagsirucan, the patrol picked up three other persons, who were 
suspected of being responsible for the death of Remgio Marcos. After 
crossing the Cagayan River at Camalaniugan ferry, the party boarded a 
Sambrano passenger bus. Upon reaching the town of Aparri, the bus 
stopped at the Sambrano garage. Lt. Oliva ordered his men to proceed on 
foot to the municipal building with the Arreola brothers, Fernando 
Pablo, and the three murder suspects, while he stayed behind to settle a
 controversy with the Sambrano inspector.<br><br>As to what transpired 
later in the municipal building, the evidence for the prosecution and of
 the defense are at variance. After contrasting and weighing the same, 
we find no error in the lower Court's having taken as proved beyond 
reasonable doubt that, after arriving at the municipal building, the 
policemen under the direction of sergeant Villanueva separated Fernando 
Pablo and the two Arreolas from the suspects of the killing of Remegio 
Marcos, and then proceeded to maltreat systematically the first three. 
Sergeant Villanueva slapped and boxed Fernando Pablo first, saying "You 
rascal, we almost got into trouble because of you"; then assaulted 
Eliseo Arreola in the same way, and after him, his brother Sofronio. As 
soon as Villanueva had finished with one suspect, policemen Ulsano and 
Quinsay took turns in taking up the maltreatment of the detainees. The 
worst beating was administered to Fernando Pablo who do not only 
received fist blows, but was repeatedly hit in the abdominal region with
 the rifle butts until he fell prostate; and when lying thus, Pablo's 
tormentors tried to make him stand up with blows and kicks, and finally 
sought to bring him back to consciousness by pouring water on his face.<br><br>At
 this juncture, Lieutenant Oliva came in asking what happend, to which 
Ulsano replied "Zarzuela, sir", meaning that Pablo was merely feigning 
injury. Oliva reprimanded the men, instructed them to desist from 
further maltreatment and led Pablo's companions, the Arreola brothers, 
outside the room, telling them to report to him if somebody would again 
maltreat them, and advised them to sleep in the municipal building 
because it was already late. Oliva then ordered Pablo placed inside one 
of the jail cells, with other prisoners. The latter noticed that Pablo 
was already dead and called the guard, Rol, to the cell. Finding the 
prisoners' statement to be correct, Rol informed Lt. Oliva of Pablo's 
death, and the two went to the house of Dr. Ricardo Alvarado, President 
of the 4th Sanitary Division, woke him up, and informed him of the death
 of Fernando Pablo in the municipal jail. At about 12:00 p.m. of 
September 3 and 1:00 a.m. of the next day, Dr. Alvarado came with the 
policemen to the municipal building, and as he could not perform an 
examination of Pablo's body because it was dark in the cell, he merely 
removed the dead man's outer garments. The next morning, at about 8:00 
o'clock, Dr. Alvarado conducted an autopsy of Pablo's remains, and the 
result of his post-mortem examination is stated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br><br>This
 is to certify that I have this day performed an autopsy on the person 
of FERNANDO PABLO, single, resident of Fugu, Balesteros, Cagayan, and 
found the following:<br><br>1.Externally - Ecchymoses around the pelvis and loin below the umbilicus.<br><br>2.Internally
 - On opening the the abdomen below the sternum at the line of the linea
 alba down to the pelvis and on reaching the peritoneum was found blood 
serum and hupermia.On reaching the inner part of the abdomen, blood 
serum and dark clotted blood was found along the sides of the intestines
 and omentum. The intestines itself were found to be clean and light 
pale, but the omentum was mostly hyperemic and congested blood forum 
thru out the greater and lesser omentum. The spleen was well exposed and
 found that the tail was ecchymotic. Much dark blood was found inside 
the abdomen of about 2 or 3 liters. The gall bladder was full and light 
greenish in color. The urinary bladder was found to have been emptied 
with a tear wound, showing that the urine was extravasated into the 
abdomen.<br><br>I further certify that the cause of death was internal hemorrhage.

</blockquote>
  <p><br>
    In the morning of September 4, Sgt. Villanueva took the Arreola 
brothers to the place where they had their breakfast. He asked them to 
sign an affidavit to the effect that Pablo fell from the truck and that 
he was a Huk, but the brothers refused it was not true. In the 
afternoon, Villanueva ordered the brothers to guard the remains of 
Fernando Pablo. They stood guard up to the afternoon of September 5, 
when they helped bury Pablo's remains. After the burial, Sgt. Villanueva
 still did not permit the Arreola brothers to go home, saying that they 
must wait for Lt. Oliva. the Arreolas were actually released only in the
 afternoon of September 6. The morning after their release, they went to
 the Ballesteros Emergency Hospital, where they were treated by Dr. 
Emilio A. Alonso for the injuries inflicted upon them by the policemen 
Villanueva, Quinsay and Ulsano. According to the medical certificates 
Exhs. H and J (p.69, Rec Case 1092-A; and p.60, Case 1093-A), Dr. Alonso
 found on the person of Eliseo Arreola a contusion on the right lower 
costal region with marked ecchymosis, which took 20 days to heal, and 
contusions on the right and left arms (dorsal), side, which healed in 10
 days; while on the person of Sofronio Arreola, he found swellings on 
the left arm, right hand, and chest, and also swellings with ecchymosis 
on the forearm; which lesions healed in 10 days' treatment. Dr. Alonzo 
charged and received from the brothers P25.00 for medicine used, without
 collecting from them any professional fees because they were poor.<br>
    <br>
    The maltreatment of the deceased Pablo and of the Arreola brothers 
by appellants Ulsano and Villanueva, (and by the accused Quinsay who has
 abandoned his appeal), was amply attested in court not only by Sofronio
 and Eliseo Arreola and by Eusebio Caculitan, a detainee who had been 
lodged in the prison cells of the municipal building some time before 
the arrival of Pablo and the Arreolas, but also by the testimonies of 
doctors Alvarado and Alonzo. Upon the other hand, the attempt of these 
appellants to attribute Pablo's death to injuries inflicted by "Big Boy"
 Abarriao the day previous, is belied by the seriousness of the 
injuries, as disclosed by the autopsy. Were the defense version 
truthful, the internal hemorrhage and the rupture of the urinary bladder
 would have caused Pablo to expire the next day, even before reaching 
the municipal building in the evening of September 3. At least, he would
 have arrived at Aparri in a condition that would have caused the police
 to immediately call for a physician or take Pablo to the hospital 
instead of the jail. Certainly he would not have been able to walk a 
hundred meters from the Sambrano bus station to the municipal building.<br>
    <br>
    The same reason militate against the alternative defense that 
Fernando Pablo's death was due to a fall inside the truck where he rode 
with the policemen when the speeding vehicle at one time was suddenly 
braked to a stop to avoid hitting a carabao. Such a fall could not have 
inflicted such extensive injuries as the autopsy has revealed.<br>
    <br>
    We agree with the Solicitor General that the conviction of 
Lieutenant Loreto oliva of either murder or arbitrary detention is 
entirely without support. Sofronio and Eliseo Arreola, as prosecution 
witnesses, testified that Oliva arrived only after Pablo had been 
tortured by Sgt. Villanueva and policemen Ulsano and Quinsay, and 
already lay dying on the floor of the police quarters. The Arreolas also
 asserted that Oliva inquired what happened and angrily upbraided his 
men for the maltreatment of Pablo (t.s.n. pp. 66 and 112), a clear 
indication that the torture was done without his knowledge. Eusebio 
Caculitan, testifying for the prosecution stated that Oliva had taken 
one of the Arreolas out of the police department for a separate 
investigation and arrived only to order some one to revive Pablo by 
pouring water on his face he lay sprawling on the floor (t.s.n. pp. 
34-36). Oliva therefore took no hand in the death of Pablo, and there is
 no proof that he ordered or conspired with his men to torture the 
deceased of that he had any knowledge of it nor opportunity to stop the 
maltreatment one time. There is no support for the trial Court's finding
 that Oliva made the maltreatment possible, or that Oliva arrested the 
offended parties out of complaisance for "Big Boy" Abrriao.<br>
    <br>
    Neither can appellant Oliva be held responsible for the Arreolas' 
detention until September 6, since Eliseo Arreola himself testified that
 he and his companions voluntarily went to Aparri with the patrol and 
that after the death of Pablo, Lt. Oliva permitted the Arreola brothers 
to sleep in the hall of the municipal building.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"A * * * When Milo Tan asked me, I told him that Lt. Oliva 
released us the previous night and asked whether we had any place 
wherein to sleep and we told him that we would sleep in the house of 
Milo Tan and that because it was already late, we slept in the municipal
 hall."(t.s.n. p. 3)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The extrajudicial statements of Olivia's co-accused are not 
competent proof against him, not being made in his presence. They are 
not even admissible in rebuttal because Olivia presented no evidence in 
his behalf.<br>
    <br>
    The records of the case are thus clear that those really responsible
 for the death of Fernando Pablo were Sergeant Villanueva and policemen 
Ulsano and Quinsay. Likewise, despite in his denials, it is abundantly 
proved that it was the sergeant, Villanueva, who detained the Arreola 
Brothers and forbade them from leaving the municipal building until 
Pablo was buried, unsuccessfully attempting in the meantime have them 
subscribed to an affidavit that Pablo's death was due to accidental 
injuries, and that the deceased was a Huk. The sergeant would not allow 
the Arreolas to go home on the 4th of September, when Pablo's relatives 
arrived, notwithstanding the orders of Lieutenant Oliva, so that the 
Arreolas were in fact arbitrarily detained by him from the 4th to the 
6th of September, when they were finally allowed to depart and tend to 
their injuries. While the brothers were occasionally permitted to leave 
the municipal building and eat at the house of one Milo ta, the 
complainants were evidently too terrorized to take advantage of these 
occasional sallies and meekly returned to custody even docilely stood 
guard over the remains of Pablo until it was buried. As pointed out by 
the Solicitor General in his brief.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>" * * *. It clearly appears from this testimony that it was 
Sergeant Villanueva who continuously kept them under guard the remains 
of Fernando Pablo and to help prepare his coffin, by telling them to 
come back to the municipal building after taking their meals outside, 
and making sure that they came back by conducting them, and by telling 
them not to go until after the burial of the remains of Pablo (pp. 67, 
70, 105, 106, 123, 124, 382, 390, t.s.n.) (Brief of Appellee, p. 25)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The cooperation of appellant Daniel Ulsano toward this arbitrary 
detention is not satisfactorily shown. The probabilities are that, as a 
disciplined subordinate, he left everything to his superior, Sergeant 
Villanueva, and anyway he could not presume to overrule the latter's 
orders. For this reason, we are not inclined to hold him responsible for
 this charge. But the record is clear that he must stand equally 
responsible with the sergeant for the murder of Fernando Pablo, in whose
 maltreatment this accused actively participated together with his 
co-accused Quinsay and Villanueva, as well as for the physical injuries 
inflicted upon the brothers Arreola.<br>
    <br>
    There being no clear evidence that the maltreatment inflicted on the
 offended parties was for the purpose of extorting confessions or 
information, Art. 235 of the Revised Penal Code does not aplly.<br>
    <br>
    Wherefore, the conviction of appellants Jose Villanueva and Daniel 
Ulsano in case No. 1091-A of the Court of First Instance of Cagayan 
(G.R. No. L-6033) for the murder of Fernando Pablo (with aggravating 
circumstance of public position utilized by the offender offset by the 
lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong doing as the one inflicted) is
 hereby affirmed. Loreto Oliva is, however, acquitted of this charge, 
with costs <em>de oficio</em>.<br>
    <br>
    In the other two cases (Nos. 1092-A and 1093-A of the Court below, 
L-6034 and 6035 of this Court),the conviction and sentence of appellant 
Jose A. Villanueva, for arbitrary detention complexed with physical 
injuries, is likewise affirmed. But appellant Loreto A. Oliva is 
acquitted therefrom, with costs <em>de oficio</em>. Appellant Daniel 
Ulsano is likewise acquitted from this charge and, instead, conviected 
only of less serious physical injuries, aggravated by the circumstance 
of having taken advantage of public position (U.S. vs. Yumul, 34 Phil. 
169; U.S. vs. Cerdena, 51 Phil. 393), and sentenced to six (6) months of
 <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>.<br>
    <br>
    The civil liabilities imposed by the trial Court shall be understood
 as imposed only upon appellants Jose Villanueva and Daniel Ulsano,<em> in solidum </em>with the accused Adriano Quinsay, who abandoned his appeal.<br>
    <br>
    Costs in this instance shall be taxed against appellants Jose Villanueva and Adrian Quinsay. So ordered.</p>
  <p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</em> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Concepcion, JJ.,</span> <em></em> concur.</p></div>
