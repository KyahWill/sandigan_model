				<H3>MACARIO GUNABE, SULPICIO GUNABE AND MARGARITO DRILLON, PETITIONERS, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioners more or less admit that in November, 1942, they were charged 
in criminal cases Nos. 988 and 1010 of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
with murder and frustrated murder and that, in virtue of said cases (continued 
as criminal cases 1838 and 1839) which are still pending, the petitioners have 
been detained by the respondent Director of Prisons under proper commitment 
orders. Nevertheless, in the present petition for the writ of <i>habeas 
corpus</i>, the petitioners pray for their release on the grounds (1) that from 
one to four months after their arrest, their detention was unlawful as it was a 
brazen violation of their right to be delivered to the judicial authorities 
within six hours following their arrest, petitioner Macario Gunabe having been 
arrested on or about July 8, 1942, petitioner Sulpicio Gunabe on or about July 
17, 1942, and petitioner Margarito Drillon on or about October 5, 1942; (2) that 
after the trial held about the end of September, 1943, the final termination of 
said cases were delayed to the prejudice of the substantial rights of the 
petitioners as defendants therein, nothing having been done by the prosecution 
since then until the liberation of the Philippines and until the date of the 
filing of the present petition for that matter, or for a period of more than 
three years now; (3) that, at any rate the petitioners should be released on 
amnesty, because the offenses for which they were prosecuted are political in 
nature, perpetrated by guerrilla men in the furtherance of their resistance 
movement during the enemy occupation.
<p>With respect to the first ground, it is sufficient to state that the alleged 
failure of the authorities (who arrested or are detaining the petitioners) to 
deliver the latter to the judicial authorities within six hours—which may of 
course be the subject of criminal prosecution under article 125 of the Revised 
Penal Code—cannot affect the legality of the confinement of the petitioners 
which is admittedly under subsisting process, issued by a competent court. 
Indeed, if it appears that the persons alleged to be restrained of their liberty 
are in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge having 
jurisdiction to issue the process, the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> shall not be 
allowed. (Rules of Court No. 102, section 4.)</p>
<p>The second ground cannot be sustained. An accused is entitled to speedy 
trial, but this right is necessarily relative, consistent with reasonable 
delays, and usually depends upon circumstances. (Moran, Commentaries on the 
Rules of Court, Vol. II, p. 476.) Said right may be waived by not objecting to 
postponements or other delays of the trial. (<i>Id</i>., p. 476.) The record 
does not show that the cases in question were not finally disposed of during the 
enemy occupation because of machinations of the prosecution, or that the 
petitioners objected to the alleged delays or insisted in the dismissal of the 
cases by reason of such delays. It cannot be reasonably expected that, after the 
liberation, trial could be resumed immediately, in view of the destruction of 
the records; and reconstitution is as much the duty of the prosecution as of the 
defense. It is to be noted that, when the original cases were in December, 1946, 
continued as criminal cases Nos. 1838 and 1839, the period within which court 
records may be reconstituted had not as yet expired. The cases of Conde 
<i>vs</i>. Judge of First Instance and Provincial Fiscal of Tayabas (45 Phil., 
173), and Conde <i>vs</i>. Rivera and Unson (45 Phil., 650), are not in point, 
since the delay therein complained of was held to be due to the fault of the 
provincial fiscal.</p>
<p>The third ground is likewise untenable. As to whether the petitioners were or 
are entitled to amnesty, is a question that should be ventilated in the trial 
Court (Villa <i>vs</i>. Allen, 2 Phil., 436), or before the Guerrilla Amnesty 
Commission created pursuant to Proclamation No. 8 dated September 7, 1946, by 
the President of the Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The petition will be, as the same is, hereby denied. So ordered, with costs 
against the petitioners.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</p>
<p><strong>MORAN, C. J.:</strong></p>I certify that Justice Padilla concurred in 
this decision.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</strong></p>
<p>Petitioners complain that they have been restrained of their liberty, since 
July 8, 1942, the former, and October 5, 1942, the latter, upon their arrest by 
the Japanese <i>kempei</i>, and allege that two criminal cases were filed with 
the Court of First Instance of Manila for murder and frustrated murder, months 
after said arrest, and that after the trial in September, 1943, nothing has been 
done by the prosecution to secure the final termination of the cases until the 
petition in this case was filed with this Court in December, 1946. This 
unreasonable delay, petitioners claim, entitle them to be freed on <i>habeas 
corpus</i>, under the authority of the two Conde cases (45 Phil., 173, 650).</p>
<p>Upon the facts of this case, there is no doubt that the three petitioners are 
entitled to the personal freedom they are seeking by their petition.</p>
<p>They appear to be the victims not only of unreasonable and unjustified delay 
in the administration of justice, but also of the beastly means employed by the 
Japanese <i>kempei</i> to serve their purposes.</p>
<p>We have already stated in our opinion in the Co Kim Cham case (75 Phil., 
113), that all the judicial processes during and under the Japanese regime are 
null and void and should not be given effect, and it appearing that petitioners 
are confinde, according to respondent's answer, by virtue of informations filed 
under said regime, petitioners are entitled to be released.</p>
<p>The nullity of judicial processes under which petitioners have been deprived 
of their liberty since 1942, or for about four and a half years, is aggravated 
by the fact that said processes are tainted with shocking delays and that their 
deprivation of liberty began by their arrest by the Japanese <i>kempei</i>, it 
being a fact of universal knowledge to Filipinos that the Japanese <i>kempei</i> 
never made any arrest that could have any shadow of legality.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we vote that the immediate release of the three 
prisoners be ordered without delay.</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>I concur in this dissent of Mr. Justice 
Perfecto.</div>
