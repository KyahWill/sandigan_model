				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In a&nbsp; complaint filed in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila, the plaintiff, a domestic corporation engaged&nbsp; in the bonding&nbsp; business, hereafter&nbsp; called the&nbsp; company, alleges that the Batu Construction &amp; Company, a partnership the members&nbsp; of which&nbsp; are&nbsp; the&nbsp; other three defendants, requested it to post,&nbsp; as&nbsp; it did, a surety bond for P8,812 in favor of the Government of the Philippines to secure the faithful performance of the construction of the Eacarra Bridge, Project PR-72(3), in Ilocos Norte, undertaken by the partnership, as stipulated in a construction on contract entered into on 11 July 1950 by and between the partnership and the Government of the&nbsp; Philippines, on condition that the defendants would "indemnify&nbsp; the COMPANY for any damage, loss, costs, charges,&nbsp; or expenses of whatever. kind and nature, including counsel or attorney's fees, which the COMPANY may, at any time,&nbsp; sustain or incur,&nbsp; as a consequence&nbsp; of having&nbsp; become&nbsp; surety&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; above-mentioned bond; said attorney's fees shall not be less&nbsp; than fifteen&nbsp; (15%) per cent of the total&nbsp; amount claimed in any action&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; COMPANY may institute against the undersigned&nbsp; (the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; except&nbsp; Andres&nbsp; Tunac)&nbsp; in Court,"&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; "Said indemnity shall be paid&nbsp; to the COMPANY as soon as it has become liable for the payment of any&nbsp; amount, under the&nbsp; above-mentioned bond, whether or not&nbsp; it .shall have paid such sum or sums&nbsp; of&nbsp; money,&nbsp; or any part thereof," as stipulated in a contract&nbsp; executed on 8 July 1950 (Exhibit&nbsp; B);&nbsp; that on&nbsp; 30 May 1951 because of the unsatisfactory&nbsp; progress of the work on the&nbsp; bridge, the Director of Public Works, with the approval of the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, annulled&nbsp; the construction contract referred to&nbsp; and&nbsp; notified&nbsp; the plaintiff Company that the Government would hold it (the Company)&nbsp; liable for any amount incurred by the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; completion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bridge, in excess of&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; price&nbsp; (Exhibit D); that&nbsp; on 19&nbsp; December 1951 (should be 23&nbsp; November 1951), Ricardo&nbsp; Fernandez and 105 other&nbsp; persons&nbsp; brought&nbsp; an action in&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace Court of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, against the partnership, the individual&nbsp; partners and&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; plaintiff Company&nbsp; for&nbsp; the collection&nbsp; of unpaid wages amounting to P5,960.10,&nbsp; lawful interests thereon and costs&nbsp; (Exhibit E); that the defendants&nbsp; are in&nbsp; imminent danger of be- coming insolvent, and are removing and disposing, or about to remove and dispose, of&nbsp; their properties&nbsp; with intent to defraud their creditors, particularly the plaintiff Company; and&nbsp; that the latter has&nbsp; no other sufficient&nbsp; security to protect its rights against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; Upon these allegations, the plaintiff prays&nbsp; that,&nbsp; upon the approval of a bond and&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; strength&nbsp; of the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the verified complaint,&nbsp; a writ of&nbsp; attachment be issued and levied upon the properties&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants; and that after&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; be&nbsp; rendered "ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; to deliver&nbsp; to the plaintiff such sufficient&nbsp; security as&nbsp; shall&nbsp; protect plaintiff from&nbsp; any&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; by&nbsp; the creditors on the Surety Bond aforementioned and from the danger of insolvency of&nbsp; the defendants;&nbsp; and to allow costs to the herein plaintiff,"&nbsp; and "for&nbsp; such other measures of&nbsp; relief as may be proper and just in the premises." Attached to the complaint are&nbsp; a verification and&nbsp; affidavit of attachment; and copies&nbsp; of the&nbsp; surety bond&nbsp; marked Annex A; of the indemnity contract marked Annex B; and of&nbsp; the letter&nbsp; of the Acting Director of Public Works to the plaintiff&nbsp; dated 30 May 1851, marked Annex C. Andres Tunae admits in his answer the allegations in paragraphs 1,&nbsp; 2, 3 and&nbsp; 4&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint, but denies the allegations&nbsp; in paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the com- plaint, because he has&nbsp; never promised to put up an indemnity&nbsp; bond in favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; nor has he ever entered into any indemnity&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; with it; because the partnership&nbsp; or the Batu Construction &amp;&nbsp; Company was fulfilling its&nbsp; obligations in accordance with the terms&nbsp; of the construction contract;&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines,&nbsp; through the&nbsp; Director of Public Works, had no&nbsp; authority to annul the contract&nbsp; at its own initiative; because the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Laoag,&nbsp; Ilocos Norte had no jurisdiction to hear and decide&nbsp; a case for collection of P5,960.10; and because the defendants were not in imminent&nbsp; danger&nbsp; of insolvency, neither did they remove or dispose of their properties with intent to defraud their creditors.&nbsp; By&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; affirmative&nbsp; defenses, he alleges that the&nbsp; signing by&nbsp; Carlos N. Baquiran&nbsp; of&nbsp; the indemnity agreement for&nbsp; and&nbsp; in behalf&nbsp; of the partnership&nbsp; Batu Construction &amp;&nbsp; Company&nbsp; did not bind the latter to the plaintiff and as&nbsp; the&nbsp; partnership is not bound, he (Andres Tunac), as a member thereof, is&nbsp; also not bound; that he not being&nbsp; a party&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; said agreement,&nbsp; the plaintiff has no cause of action against him; that in the&nbsp; event the partnership&nbsp; is bound by&nbsp; the indemnity&nbsp; agreement he invokes his&nbsp; right of exhaustion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property of the partnership before the plaintiff may proceed against his property.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; as a counterclaim he alleges that the plaintiff brought&nbsp; the action against him maliciously and&nbsp; in bad faith for the purpose of&nbsp; annoying him and&nbsp; damaging his professional&nbsp; reputation,&nbsp; he having a nourishing and successful practice as engineer&nbsp; in&nbsp; Ilocos Norte, thereby compelling him&nbsp; to defend&nbsp; himself; that&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure the issuance of a&nbsp; writ of attachment the plaintiff made&nbsp; false representations;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the issuance of the writ&nbsp; upon such false representations of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff caused&nbsp; him damages in&nbsp; the sum of P10,000 including expenses&nbsp; of litigation&nbsp; and&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; he prays that the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; be dismissed as to him and the defendant&nbsp; Batu Construction&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; costs against the plaintiff; ;that the latter be ordered to pay him the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P10,000;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; he be&nbsp; granted such other remedies as&nbsp; may be just, equitable and&nbsp; proper. <br><br>Gonzalo P. Amboy&nbsp; denies in&nbsp; his answer the allegations of the complaint,&nbsp; except&nbsp; those&nbsp; that may&nbsp; be deemed&nbsp; admitted in the&nbsp; special defenses,&nbsp; and&nbsp; alleges that&nbsp; he is not in imminent danger&nbsp; of insolvency and is not removing and&nbsp; disposing or about to remove and&nbsp; dispose of his&nbsp; properties,&nbsp; because he has no&nbsp; property;&nbsp; that there has been no liquidation of the&nbsp; expenses incurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; the construction of the Bacarra Bridge,&nbsp; Project PR-72(3), to determine whether there would&nbsp; be a&nbsp; balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the contract price which may be applied to pay the claim for unpaid wages&nbsp; of Ricardo&nbsp; Fernandez et al sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be collected&nbsp; in civil case&nbsp; No. 198 of the Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace Court of Laoag,&nbsp; Ilocos Norte, and not until after such liquidation shall have been made could his liability and that&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; co-defendants&nbsp; be determined and fixed; that if after proper liquidations there&nbsp; be a deficit of the contract&nbsp; price the defendants&nbsp; are&nbsp; willing to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim for&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; wages&nbsp; of Ricardo&nbsp; Fernandez et&nbsp; al.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon these&nbsp; allegations he prays that the issuance&nbsp; of the writ of attachment prayed&nbsp; for&nbsp; by the plaintiff be held in abeyance until after civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 198 of the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace Court of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, shall have been disposed of. <br><br>Carlos&nbsp; N.&nbsp; Baquiran&nbsp; admits in his answer the allegations, in paragraphs&nbsp; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&nbsp; and 11&nbsp; of the&nbsp; complaint but alleges that he has no sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to&nbsp; the truth of the claim of&nbsp; Ricardo Fernandez et al.&nbsp; set forth in paragraph 7 of the complaint, for there has never been a liquidation between&nbsp; the defendants and the Bureau of Public&nbsp; Works.&nbsp; He further&nbsp; denies specifically paragraphs 8,&nbsp; 9&nbsp; and&nbsp; 10 of the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; By way of special defenses he alleges&nbsp; that&nbsp; there has&nbsp; been&nbsp;&nbsp; no liquidation by and&nbsp; between the defendants and the Bureau of Public Works on Project PR-72(S) to determine whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; total amount spent for the construction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bridge exceeded the contract&nbsp; price; that after the&nbsp; determination: of the respective liabilities of the parties in civil case No. 198&nbsp; of the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; of Laoag, IIocos Norte, if any there be against the defendants herein, and such liability could&nbsp; not be paid out of the balance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; price&nbsp; of Project PR-72(3), the defendants are&nbsp; ready and willing to assume their&nbsp; respective responsibilities.&nbsp; Upon these allegations he prays that&nbsp; the complaint of the&nbsp; plaintiff be dismissed; that&nbsp; the issuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for be&nbsp; denied;&nbsp; and that he&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted&nbsp; such&nbsp; other relief&nbsp; as may&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; just&nbsp; and equitable,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff. <br><br>At&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; presented&nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence. After the plaintiff&nbsp; had rested its case,&nbsp; defendant Gonzalo P. Amboy moved for&nbsp; the dismissal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; on the ground that the remedy provided for in&nbsp; the&nbsp; last paragraph of article 2071 of the new Civil Code may be availed of by the&nbsp; guarantor only and not by a surety. <br><br>Acting upon this motion to&nbsp; dismiss the trial court made the&nbsp; following findings:<br><br>* * * That on July 8, 1950, the defendant Batu&nbsp; Construction &amp; Company, as principal, and the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity&nbsp; Co. Inc., as surety,&nbsp; executed a surety bond for the sum of P8,812,00 to insure faithful performance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; former's obligation as contractor for the construction of the Eacarra Bridge, Project PR-72 (No.&nbsp; 3) IIocos Norte Province,&nbsp; On the same&nbsp; date, July&nbsp; 8, 1950, the Eatu Construction &amp;&nbsp; Company&nbsp; and the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Carlos N. Baquiran and Gonzales P. Amboy executed an indemnity agreement to&nbsp; protect the Manila Surety&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Fidelity Co. Inc.,&nbsp; against damage, loss&nbsp; or expenses which&nbsp; it&nbsp; may&nbsp; sustain ag a consequence of the surety bond executed by it jointly with Batu Construction &amp;&nbsp; Company. <br><br>On or about&nbsp; May 30, 1951, the&nbsp; plaintiff received a notice from the&nbsp; Director of Public Works&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B) annulling its contract with the Government for the construction&nbsp; of the Bacarra&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; because of its failure to make&nbsp; satisfactory progress in the execution of the works,&nbsp; with the warning&nbsp; that any&nbsp; amount&nbsp; spent by&nbsp; the Government in the continuation, of the work, in excess of the contract price, will be charged against the surety bond&nbsp; furnished by&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp; It also appears that a complaint by the laborers in said project of the&nbsp; Batu Construction &amp;&nbsp; Company&nbsp; was filed&nbsp; against it in Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc. vs. Batu Construction and Co., et al. and the&nbsp; Manila Surety&nbsp; and Fidelity Co., Inc., for unpaid wages amounting to P5,960.10. <br><br>and, being&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opinion that the&nbsp; provisions of article 2071 of the new Civil Code may be availed of by a guarantor only and not by a surety, dismissed the&nbsp; complaint, with costs against&nbsp; the plaintiff. <br><br>From this order the plaintiff&nbsp; Company&nbsp; has appealed to this Court, because it proposes&nbsp; to&nbsp; raise only&nbsp; a question of law. After the order dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; had&nbsp; been entered, on&nbsp; 16 and 20 July 1953,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; Gonzalo P. Amboy&nbsp; and Andres Tunac moved for leave to&nbsp; prove damages they allegedly suffered as a result of the attachment&nbsp; levied upon&nbsp; their properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 15&nbsp; August&nbsp; 195S the Court heard the&nbsp; evidence on damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 23&nbsp; September 1953 the Court found&nbsp; and&nbsp; held that the defendant Gonzalo P. Amboy is&nbsp; entitled to recover from the plaintiff damages equivalent to 6 per cent&nbsp; interest per annum on the sum&nbsp; of P35&nbsp; in possession of the Provincial Treasurer of Ilocos Norte, which was garnished pursuant to the writ of attachment, from the date of&nbsp; garnishment until its discharge; but that the claims&nbsp; for damages&nbsp; of Andres Tunac and Gonzalo P. Amboy allegedly suffered by them in their business, moral damages and attorney's fees were without basis in law&nbsp; and in&nbsp; fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence their recovery was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dissolved&nbsp; the writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this&nbsp; last order&nbsp; only&nbsp; the plaintiff Company has appealed. <br><br>The&nbsp; main question&nbsp; to, determine is&nbsp; whether the last paragraph of article&nbsp; 2071&nbsp; of the new Civil Code taken from article 184S of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; may be&nbsp; availed of by&nbsp; a surety. A guarantor is the insurer of the solvency of the&nbsp; debtor; a&nbsp; surety is&nbsp; an&nbsp; insurer&nbsp; of the debt.&nbsp; A guarantor binds himself to&nbsp; pay if the&nbsp; principal is unable to pay; a surety undertakes&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; if&nbsp; the principal does&nbsp; not pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason which could&nbsp; be invoked for the non-availability to a surety of the provisions of the last paragraph of article 2071 of the new Civil Code would be the fact that guaranty like commodatum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> is gratuitous.&nbsp; But guaranty could also be for a price or consideration as provided for in article 2048.&nbsp; So, even if&nbsp; there should be a consideration or price paid to a guarantor for him to insure the performance of an obligation by the principal debtor, the provisions of article&nbsp; 2071 would still be available to the guarantor.&nbsp;&nbsp; In suretyship&nbsp; the&nbsp; surety&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; liable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the creditor without the benefit of the principal debtor's excussion of his properties, for he&nbsp; (the surety) may&nbsp; be&nbsp; sued independently.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; he is an insurer of the debt and as such he has assumed or undertaken a responsibility or obligation greater or more onerous&nbsp; than that&nbsp; of guarantor.&nbsp; Such being1&nbsp; the case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 2071, under guaranty, are applicable and available to a&nbsp; surety.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reference in article 2047&nbsp; to the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; Section 4, Chapter&nbsp; 3, Title I,&nbsp; Book&nbsp; IV of&nbsp; the new&nbsp; Civil Code, on solidary or several obligations,&nbsp; does not mean that suretyship which is a&nbsp; solidary obligation is withdrawn from the applicable provisions governing guaranty. <br><br>The plaintiff's&nbsp; cause of action does not fall under paragraph&nbsp; 2 of article&nbsp; 2071 of&nbsp; the new Civil Code,&nbsp; because there is no proof of the defendants' insolvency.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact that the contract was annulled&nbsp; because of lack&nbsp; of progress in the construction&nbsp; of the bridge&nbsp; is no proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; such insolvency.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; does not&nbsp; fall&nbsp; under paragraph&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; because the defendants have not bound themselves&nbsp; to&nbsp; relieve the plaintiff from the guaranty within a specified period which already has&nbsp; expired,&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; surety&nbsp; bond&nbsp; does&nbsp; not fix any period of time and the indemnity agreement stipulates&nbsp; one&nbsp; year&nbsp; extendible&nbsp; or&nbsp; renewable until the bond be completely cancelled by the person or entity in whose behalf the bond was executed or by a Court&nbsp; of competent&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp; It does not come under paragraph 4, because the debt has&nbsp; not&nbsp; become&nbsp; demandable&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; the expiration of the period for payment.&nbsp; It does not come under paragraph 5 because of the lapse of&nbsp; 10&nbsp; years, when the principal&nbsp; obligation has no&nbsp; period for its maturity, etc., for&nbsp; 10&nbsp; years&nbsp; have not yet elapsed.&nbsp; It does&nbsp; not&nbsp; fall under paragraph 6, because there is no proof that "there are reasonable grounds to fear that the principal debtor intends to abscond&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not come under paragraph 7,&nbsp; because the defendants,&nbsp; as&nbsp; principal debtors,&nbsp; are&nbsp; not in imminent danger of becoming insolvent, there being no proof to&nbsp; that&nbsp; effect. <br><br>But the plaintiff's&nbsp; cause of action&nbsp; comes under paragraph 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; article&nbsp; 2071 of the new Civil Code,&nbsp; because the action brought by Ricardo Fernandez and 105 persons in the Justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Peace Court of&nbsp; Laoag, province of Ilocos Norte, for the collection&nbsp; of&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; wages amounting to P5,960.10, is in connection with the&nbsp; construction of&nbsp; the Bacarra Bridge,&nbsp; Project PR-72(3),&nbsp; undertaken by&nbsp; the Batu&nbsp; Construction&nbsp; &amp; Company, and one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; therein&nbsp; is&nbsp; the herein plaintiff,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila Surety and&nbsp; Fidelity Co., Inc., and&nbsp; paragraph 1 of article 2071 of the&nbsp; new Civil Code provides that the guarantor, even before having paid, may proceed against the principal debtor "to obtain release&nbsp; from the&nbsp; guaranty, or to demand&nbsp; a security&nbsp; that&nbsp; shall protect him from any proceedings&nbsp; by&nbsp; the creditor or from the danger of&nbsp; insolvency of&nbsp; the debtor," when he&nbsp; (the&nbsp; guarantor)&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; sued&nbsp; for payment. It does not provide that the guarantor be sued by&nbsp; the creditor for the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of the debt.&nbsp; It simply provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the guarantor&nbsp; of surety be sued&nbsp; for&nbsp; the payment of an amount for which the surety&nbsp; bond&nbsp; was put up to secure the fulfillment of the obligation undertaken by the&nbsp; principal debtor.&nbsp; So, the suit&nbsp; filed by Ricardo Fernandez and&nbsp; 105 persons in the Justice of&nbsp; the Peace Court of Laoag, province of Ilocos Norte, for&nbsp; the collection of unpaid wages&nbsp; earned&nbsp; in connection with the work done by them in&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction of the Bacarra Bridge, Project PR-72(3),&nbsp; is a&nbsp; suit for the payment of an amount for which the surety bond "was put up or posted to secure the faithful performance of the obligation undertaken by the principal debtors (the defendants) in favor of the creditor, the Government of the Philippines. <br><br>The order appealed from dismissing the complaint is reversed and&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside,&nbsp; and the case remanded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the court below for determination of the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of security that would protect the plaintiff&nbsp; Company from any proceedings by the creditor&nbsp; or from the danger of insolvency of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants, the&nbsp; principal debtors,&nbsp; and direction to the defendants to&nbsp; put up&nbsp; such amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; security as may be&nbsp; established by competent evidence,&nbsp; without pronouncement as to costs. <br><br>The writ of attachment having been issued improvidently because,&nbsp; although there is an allegation in the verified complaint&nbsp; that the defendants were in imminent&nbsp; danger of insolvency&nbsp; and that they&nbsp; were removing or disposing, or&nbsp; about to remove or dispose,&nbsp; of their&nbsp; properties,&nbsp; with intent to defraud their creditors, particularly the plaintiff Company,&nbsp; still such allegation was not proved, the fact that a&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; had been&nbsp; filed against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants and the plaintiff&nbsp; Company&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; of Laoag,&nbsp; Ilocos&nbsp; Norte, for the collection of&nbsp; an amount for unpaid wages&nbsp; of the plaintiffs therein who claimed to have worked&nbsp; in the construction of the&nbsp; bridge, being insufficient to prove it, and because the relief prayed for&nbsp; in&nbsp; the complaint for security&nbsp; that shall protect&nbsp; it from any proceedings by the creditor and from the danger of the defendants becoming insolvent&nbsp; is inconsistent with the&nbsp; state of insolvency&nbsp; of the defendants or&nbsp; their being in imminent danger of&nbsp; insolvency, the order&nbsp; awarding 6 per&nbsp; cent on the sum of P35 in possession of&nbsp; the Provincial Treasurer owned by the defendant Gonzalo P.&nbsp; Amboy garnished&nbsp; by&nbsp; virtue of the writ of attachment, from the date of the garnishment until its discharge, and denying recovery of the amounts of&nbsp; damages claimed to have been suffered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants not having appealed therefrom. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Labrador, Conception,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.
