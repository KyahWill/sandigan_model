				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Jose Geukeko appears to be the registered lessee of Lot No.&nbsp; 18, Block 20 of the Tambobong Estate, with an area of 2,890&nbsp; square meters, formerly owned by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, a&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; which he sub-leased to&nbsp; Elena Jacinto, Hilarion Encarnacion,&nbsp; Leonila Rocal, Mercedes Veles,&nbsp; Francisco Caro, Alejandro Morales, Inocencia&nbsp; Lumtao,&nbsp; Adriano&nbsp; Simeon&nbsp; and&nbsp; Onofre&nbsp; Enriquez. When the Republic oi the&nbsp; Philippines acquired the Tambobong Estate by&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1947, pursuant to Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 539, Jose Geukeko filed an application with the Director of Lands, who was entrusted with sale and disposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; estate, to&nbsp; purchase the lot&nbsp; leased by him, but the sub-lessees registered opposition thereto and likewise filed&nbsp; applications&nbsp; to purchase the respective portions actually&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This controversy was docketed in the Bureau of Lands as B.&nbsp; L. Conflict No. 41 (N), D. L.&nbsp; E. Conflict No. 2.<br><br>On&nbsp; June&nbsp; 12, 1952, the Director of Lands recognizing Jose Geukeko as the bonafide tenant of&nbsp; Lot No. 18,&nbsp; Block 20, rendered decision giving due course to his application and dismissing the&nbsp; protests&nbsp; and&nbsp; counter—applications of the sub-lessees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon, the parties adversely affected by said decision&nbsp; instituted Civil Cases Nos. 1826 and 1865 on August&nbsp; 4 and September&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1952, respectively, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal seeking to annul the same and praying for&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval of their applications to purchase the portion of&nbsp; the lot occupied by&nbsp; them.&nbsp; Two years later, or on October 11, 1954, the Court issued an&nbsp; order holding that as therein plaintiffs had not exhausted all the administrative remedies available to them,&nbsp; it appearing that they failed to appeal&nbsp; to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources before going to Court,&nbsp; an action for mandamus could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be entertained and thus dismissed the 2 civil&nbsp; cases filed therein.<br><br>The&nbsp; sub-lessees then brought&nbsp; the matter on appeal to the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Agriculture&nbsp; and Natural&nbsp; Resources on October 23, 1954, (DANR Case No. 987)&nbsp; who&nbsp; required the sub-lessees to pay the corresponding docketing fee and ordered the parties to submit their respective memoranda. Jose Geukeko interposed an objection to the institution of this appeal&nbsp; and&nbsp; correspondingly filed with&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case&nbsp; No. 3453) a petition for mandamus and prohibition praying that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources be restrained from taking cognizance of DANR Case No. 987 and from taking further action in said appeal; that said official be&nbsp; ordered to certify that the decision of the Director of Lands in B. L. ,conflict No. 41 (N), D. L. E. Conflict No. 2 was final and the corresponding deed of sale of Lot No. 18, Block 20 of the Tambobong Estate be executed in his favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; He alleged as ground for the petition that the period to appeal had already prescribed; that&nbsp; the filing of Civil&nbsp; Cases Nos. 1826 and 1865 amounted to&nbsp; a waiver of appellants' right to appeal to the Secretary of&nbsp; Agriculture and Natural Resources;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Court's order dismissing said civil cases was an adjudication on the merits; and that the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources had lost jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because the decision of the Director of&nbsp; Lands was already&nbsp; final&nbsp; and&nbsp; executory.<br><br>The Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Agriculture and Natural Resources filed an&nbsp; answer&nbsp; contending that he could lawfully take cognizance of the appeal filed in DANR&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 987 because the filing of Civil Cases&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 1826&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1865 with the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Rizal suspended the running of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prescriptive period within&nbsp; which to&nbsp; appeal from decisions of the Director of Lands, as&nbsp; provided for by Land Administrative Order No. 6; that the decision of the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands had&nbsp; not become final; that the Court had no jurisdiction over the&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; of the action; and that the petition&nbsp; did not allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; thus prayed that the petition be dismissed with costs&nbsp; against petitioner.<br><br>After&nbsp; due&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; and submission by&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties of their respective memoranda,&nbsp; the Court rendered decision dated July 12, 1955, holding that in&nbsp; view of the existence of the policy of the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources&nbsp; of&nbsp; considering&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of a&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action in Court&nbsp; as having&nbsp; the effect of suspending the running of the prescriptive period within which appeal could be Interposed to the Department Secretary, a policy&nbsp; that was reasonable&nbsp; and sound, the Secretary of Agriculture and. Natural Resources&nbsp; did not abuse his discretion in taking&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of the appeal after Civil&nbsp; Cases Nos.&nbsp; 1826 and 1865&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Rizal&nbsp; were dismissed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; lower Court also&nbsp; observed that the records showed that the&nbsp; protestants&nbsp; or sublessees never intended to waive or abandon&nbsp; their rights to appeal&nbsp; from the decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Director of Lands.&nbsp; As the motion for the reconsideration of said decision&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by therein petitioner was denied for lack of merit, the matter was brought to Us on appeal, appellant maintaining&nbsp; that the lower Court erred:<br><blockquote><ol><li> In&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Agriculture and Natural Resources did&nbsp; not act without or&nbsp; in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in&nbsp; entertaining and taking&nbsp; cognizance of&nbsp; DANR Case No. 987 which seeks for the review of the decision of the Director of Lands&nbsp; dated June 12, 1952;&nbsp; and<br></li><li> In dismissing and in not&nbsp; issuing' the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; prohibition and mandamus prayed&nbsp; for by&nbsp; petitioner therein. </li></ol></blockquote>The main question at issue hinges&nbsp; on the interpretation of Section&nbsp; 2 of&nbsp; the Lands Administrative&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp; 6, promulgated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Agriculture and&nbsp; Commerce&nbsp; on May 1, 1934, providing for the filing" of appeals from decisions or orders of the Director of&nbsp; Lands to the said Department&nbsp; Secretary, which reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2.&nbsp; APPEAL FROM DECISION ON&nbsp; ORDER&nbsp; OF THE&nbsp; DIRECTOR OF LANDS,&nbsp; MOTION&nbsp; FOR RECONSIDERATION.—An appeal&nbsp; shall lie&nbsp; from a decision of the Director of&nbsp; Lands to the&nbsp; Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce&nbsp; within a&nbsp; period of sixty (60)&nbsp; days to be counted from the date&nbsp; the&nbsp; interested party&nbsp; received notice thereof&nbsp; unless a motion for reconsideration is&nbsp; filed within&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; period,&nbsp; in which case,&nbsp; appeal shall be made within sixty (60)&nbsp; days from his&nbsp; receipt of notice of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; or decision of the&nbsp; Director of Lands disposing of&nbsp; the motion for reconsideration. * *&nbsp; *. </blockquote>This Lands Administrative&nbsp; Order&nbsp; No. 6 governing the promulgation&nbsp; of&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; and orders of the Director of Lands and providing for the prescriptive period within which appeals may be interposed was issued pursuant to the provisions of section 79(5)&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code,&nbsp; section 5 of Act No. 2874 and Act No.&nbsp; 3038.<br><br>Although the exact date when the sub-lessees received copies of the decision of the Director of Lands does&nbsp; not appear on record,&nbsp; the parties admit that the action filed by the former with the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal (Civil Cases Nos. 1826 and 1865) on August 4 and September 8, 1952, respectively, were instituted&nbsp; within 60&nbsp; days. There is likewise no controversy that the order of dismissal in said cases&nbsp; was&nbsp; promulgated on October 11,&nbsp; 1954, thus&nbsp; when the&nbsp; matter was brought on&nbsp; appeal to&nbsp; the Secretary of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources on October 23, 1954, more than 2 years from the date of their receipt of the decision&nbsp; of the Director of&nbsp; Lands had elapsed. Despite this fact, the Secretary of Agriculture&nbsp; &amp; Natural Resources took cognizance of the appeal, notwithstanding which appellant does not raise in this case any question against the appeal&nbsp; of the sub-lessees from&nbsp; the decision of the Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Secretary of Agriculture and&nbsp; Natural&nbsp; Resources for&nbsp; being interposed beyond&nbsp; the 60-day period provided by section 2 of Lands Administrative&nbsp; Order No. 6,&nbsp; if the period lapsed between the&nbsp; filing of the action in&nbsp; court on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 4 and&nbsp; September 8, 1952, and the date&nbsp; of receipt by said sub-lessees, of notice of the order of the Court dismissing their action, (which does not appear of record), is considered interrupted.<br><br>In&nbsp; justification of his attitude&nbsp; in&nbsp; taking cognizance of the sub-lessees' appeal, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural&nbsp; Resources&nbsp; refers to his Department's&nbsp; policy&nbsp; of considering the running of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prescriptive period&nbsp; for purposes of appeal from decisions of the Director of Lands, as suspended&nbsp; by the institution of a civil action in Court. It is&nbsp; interesting&nbsp; to note at&nbsp; this juncture that the order of the lower&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Cases Nos.&nbsp; 1826 and 1865 was predicated on the ground that the sub-lessees failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to them and, therefore, held that said actions could not be entertained by the courts, citing the&nbsp; case of Miguel vs. Reyes,&nbsp; 93&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 542.&nbsp; But&nbsp; in&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; rulings&nbsp; in other cases involving lots in said Tambobong Estate, this Court qualified its stand by confining the application of the principle of exhaustion of&nbsp; administrative remedies as a condition precedent to the filing of&nbsp; a judicial&nbsp; action to controversies arising out of the disposition of <i>disposable public lands and not to cases&nbsp; involving private&nbsp; lands acquired, by the Government by purchase</i>&nbsp; (See Marukot vs. Jacinto, 98 Phil., 128; Santiago vs. Cruz, 98 Phil., 168).'<br><br>At any rate, and looking at the question at issue in this case independently of&nbsp; the aforecited&nbsp; authorities,&nbsp; it may be asked:&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; the civil&nbsp; cases filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the sub-lessees were thrown out of court, could they still invoke administrative relief by appealing to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretory&nbsp; of Agriculture&nbsp; and&nbsp; Natural&nbsp; Resources 1&nbsp; Said&nbsp; Administrative official answers in the affirmative, maintaining&nbsp; that&nbsp; the period of 60 days&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; by section&nbsp; 2 of the Lands Administrative&nbsp; Order&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; aforequoted&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp; not&nbsp; yet prescribed,&nbsp; it being the adopted policy of their office to consider the filing of civil actions in court as suspending the running of said period.&nbsp; It must be remembered that Lands&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp; 6 is&nbsp; in&nbsp; the nature of procedural rules&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of Agriculture&nbsp; and&nbsp; Natural&nbsp; Resources pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; the power bestowed on said administrative agency to promulgate rules and&nbsp; regulations necessary for the proper&nbsp; discharge and management of the functions imposed by Jaw upon said office.&nbsp; The necessity for vesting&nbsp; Administrative Authorities&nbsp; with&nbsp; power to make rules and regulations because of the impracticability of the lawmakers to&nbsp; provide general regulations for various and varying details&nbsp; of management, has&nbsp; been recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts&nbsp; and&nbsp; upheld against various particular objections&nbsp; (42 Am. Jur, 329).&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing the existence of such&nbsp; rule-making&nbsp; authority, what is the weight of an&nbsp; interpretation given by an administrative agency to its own&nbsp; rules&nbsp; or regulations?&nbsp; Authorities sustain the doctrine that the interpretation given to a rule or regulation by those charged with its execution is entitled to the greatest weight&nbsp; by the Court construing such rule or&nbsp; regulation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; such&nbsp; interpretation will be followed unless it appears&nbsp; to be clearly unreasonable or arbitrary (42 Am. Jur. 431).&nbsp;&nbsp; It has also been&nbsp; said that:<br><blockquote>An administrative body&nbsp; has power to interpret its&nbsp; own rules which have the force and effect of law, and such an interpretation becomes part of the&nbsp; rule (Foley vs. Benedict, 122 Tex 193, 55 SW [2d] 805, 86&nbsp; ALK&nbsp; 477).<br><br>Rules, regulations, and general&nbsp; orders enacted by administrative authorities&nbsp; pursuant to&nbsp; the&nbsp; powers delegated&nbsp; to them have&nbsp; the force&nbsp; and effect of law (Columbia Broadcasting&nbsp; System vs. United States, 87,&nbsp; L Ed [Adv 1086]).<br><br>The contemporaneous construction of&nbsp; a&nbsp; statute&nbsp; (and similarly of rules&nbsp; and regulations) by the executive officers of the goverment whose duty it is to execute it is entitled to great respect, and should ordinarily&nbsp; control&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; by the courts (United&nbsp; States vs. Philbrick,&nbsp; 120&nbsp; U.S. 52, 30 L&nbsp; Ed. 559).<br><br>Courts are reluctant to disregard a settled practice of an executive department whore they are not satisfied that it is contrary to law, and are satisfied that it is in accordance with justice and good faith (Grant vs.&nbsp; Raymond, S L Ed. ,370).</blockquote>From the foregoing it may be seen, that under the law and the&nbsp; jurisprudence&nbsp; on the&nbsp; matter appellees had two courses&nbsp; to follow,&nbsp; and inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; their&nbsp; resort to the courts railed for&nbsp; non-exhaustion&nbsp; of administrative remedies, could they be deprived of taking the&nbsp; other&nbsp; course left to them, i.&nbsp; e., the remedy of appeal to the Secretary&nbsp; of Agriculture and&nbsp; Natural&nbsp; Resources,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; when&nbsp; in accordance with the interpretation given&nbsp; by said administrative&nbsp; agency and&nbsp; its&nbsp; acknowledged policy,&nbsp; that relief could still be availed of by the aggrieved parties?&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking into consideration all the&nbsp; factors&nbsp; involved in the&nbsp; controversy, We are of the opinion and thus hold that the dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the actions&nbsp; in courts does not constitute&nbsp; an impediment to the filing of the appeal before the Secretary of Agriculture&nbsp; and Natural Resources. The only&nbsp; requisite in such a case would be that the period within which said remedy may be invoked has&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; prescribed.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; connection, We can also&nbsp; say that the interpretation given by the Department of Agriculture and&nbsp; Natural Resources to&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of section 2 of Lands Administrative Order No. 6 appears to be reasonable for it merely reflects the intent of the law in placing the disposition of lands within the&nbsp; Tambobong&nbsp; Estate in the hands of the officials of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Department&nbsp; (Executive Order No. 376; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 539; Lands Administrative Order&nbsp; No.&nbsp; R-3).&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; underlying idea seems to be that those officials are considered in a better position to decide controversies regarding the disposition of said Estate.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from and&nbsp; the order denying the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration thereof are hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; cost against appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.
