				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-7871, October 29, 1955</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. LEON PE, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Antique 
granting the petition for naturalization filed by Leon Pe. The latter's 
qualifications are not in issue, and the Solicitor General merely contends that 
the lower court erred in granting the petition because "only one of the two 
character witnesses whose affidavits are attached to his petition testified at 
the hearing."
<p>The petition for naturalization alleged that Delfin Encarnacion and Perpetuo 
Lotilla "will appear and testify as my witnesses at the hearing of my herein 
petition." Immediately following said petition are (1) the "affidavit of 
witness" Delfin Encarnacion and (2) the "affidavit of witness" Perpetuo Lotilla. 
At the hearing, Delfin M. Encarnacion testified for the petitioner, and although 
Perpetuo Lotilla was not put on the witness stand, the petitioner presented 
Higino Loza as his other witness, and the latter's affidavit, dated on the same 
day as the affidavits of Delfin Encarnacion and Perpetuo Lotilla, appears on 
page 31 of the record.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General argues that the testimony of Higino Loza cannot be 
substituted for that of Perpetuo Lotilla, inasmuch as to permit such 
substitution is tantamount to amending the petition which cannot be allowed, 
citing the case of Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> G.R. No. L-3018, decided July 18, 
1951.</p>
<p>We believe that the law was substantially complied with. Section 7 of the 
Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473) provides that "* * * The 
petition must be signed by the applicant in his own handwriting and be supported 
by the affidavit of at least two credible persons, stating that they are 
citizens of the Philippines and personally know the petitioner to be a resident 
of the Philippines for the period of time required by this Act and a person of 
good repute and morally irreproachable, and that said petitioner has in their 
opinion all the qualifications necessary to become a citizen of the Philippines 
and is not in any way disqualified under the provisions of this Act. The 
petition shall also set forth the names and post office addresses of such 
witnesses as the petitioner may desire to introduce at the hearing of the 
case."</p>
<p>Although the name and post office address of petitioner's witness Higino Loza 
were not set forth in the petition for naturalization, he is a vouching witness 
and his affidavit (Exhibit D) is contained in the record. While said affidavit 
was not attached immediately after the petition, it recites that it is a part of 
the petition.</p>
<p>The decision in Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic of the Philippines is not in point, 
since the two vouching witnesses therein were fcund not to be competent, and as 
a matter of fact one witness was withdrawn upon objection interposed by the 
Government; and no other witnesses were actually presented in support of the 
petition.</p>
<p>The decision in Yu Chong Tian vs. Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> G.R. No. L-6029, decided April 12, 1954, 
also relied upon by the Government, is not applicable, because in said case this 
Court found the affidavits attached to the petition for naturalization to be 
insufficient and held that the testimony of other witnesses could not be 
substituted alter the petitioner had closed his evidence. In the case at bar the 
fiscal not only did not object to the presentation of witness Higino Loza but 
also cross-examined the latter.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is affirmed and it is so ordered without 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista, Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
