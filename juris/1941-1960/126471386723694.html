				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Manila Jockey Club, Inc., and the Philippine Racing Club, Inc.,  respondents herein, are corporations organized primarily, though not exclusively, for the purpose of holding horse races.   Republic Act No. 309, as amended, allows horse races to be held only on certain days of the year, apportioned among private racing clubs and certain charitable institutions.  Accordingly, the  second Sunday  and the first Saturday afternoon of every month as well as the first Sunday of  March, or a total  of 13 Sundays and 12 Saturday afternoons are reserved exclusively for the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society.   The fourth Sunday of January, May, July and September, and the second  Saturday afternoon of January, April, July and  October, or a  total of  4 Sundays and  4 Saturday afternoons are reserved exclusively for the White Cross, Inc.  The fourth Sunday of  February, April, June, August and October,  and the third Sunday of December, or  a total of  6 Sundays, are reserved exclusively for  the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes office.  Respondent Manila Jockey Club, Inc., is actually able to hold races only on 12 Sundays, 12 Saturday afternoons, and  3  holidays;  and respondent  Philippine Racing  Club, Inc., actually conducts a similar number of races.  The other unassigned Saturday afternoons of the year are reserved for races that  may be authorized by the President from time to time for other charitable, relief or  civic purposes.</p>
<p>Each of  the two respondents owns a large tract of  land, respondent Manila  Jockey Club,  Inc. at  Felix  Huertas Street,  Manila,   containing an area  of  160,000  square meters;  respondent  Philippine Racing Club, Inc.,  near Sta. Ana District, in Makati,  Rizal, containing  an  area of  250,000 square  meters.  Inside  these  two tracts of land the respective  race  tracks of respondents are built, enclosed by a high concrete fence, and occupying a greater portion.  Within the enclosed compound of each race track the following are built:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(a)  An oval course covered with  sand around which the horses run.</p>
  <p>"(b)  One or more grandstands from where the public views the races.</p>
  <p>"(c)  The judges' stand  from where the judges or stewards view the races.</p>
  <p>"(d)  An emergency clinic.</p>
  <p>"(e) An eletcric totalizator machine.</p>
  <p>"(f) A  stable and  a paddock where the horses which are soon to take part in a race arc accommodated or walk around before they are led to the starting gate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A part of the land each owned by the respondents and outside of the walled compound has been leased to private parties  who have  constructed  their own improvements, paying monthly rentals to the respondents.  On  the remainder of  said  outside .portion  the  respondents have constructed buildings which are leased  to  third  persons and used by the latter as sari-sari stores, offices, or stables, the lessees who pay monthly  rentals to the  respondents being solely responsible for the compliance with legal sanitary  requirements.  The buildings  located  outside the walled  compound and  suitable  for stables are leased by the respondents either  to  horse owners or persons  who invite  horse owners to  board with them  race  horses for a certain fee, and they  are different from the stables and paddocks located within the compound which are regulated by the  Games and Amusements Board and are not leased to any  one and their use by horse owners shortly before races are run is  free.</p>
<p>Occasionally  the grandstands within the enclosed compounds are leased by  the  respondents to political, labor or social organizations which  hold conventions, rallies or other large gatherings,  paying to the  respondents stipulated  rentals.   A  portion of  the  main grandstand of respondent Manila  Jockey  Club, Inc.,  is rented  by the Philippine Charity  Sweepstakes  Office  which uses  the same for office space.</p>
<p>Within the walled compound there are also spaces leased by the respondents on racing days to private persons who maintain restaurants, bars and other recreation centers.</p>
<p>As the charitable organizations authorized by law  to hold horse races do not own their race tracks, they lease the  premises and  facilities of either respondent.  Thus the White Cross, Inc. and the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society each pays a flat rental of P7,000 for a whole day's use  and P3,500 for a half day's use of said premises and facilities.  The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office pays a  percentage of its profits amounting to about the same rentals paid by the White Cross,  Inc. and the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society.   The holding of races by said charitable organizations are under their sole management, without any intervention from either respondent.</p>
<p>The  respondents regularly pay to  the  Government the fixed tax prescribed for real estate dealers, and  the fixed tax on business (P500) under section 193 (<span style="font-style: italic;">r</span>) of the National Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>The  first question that  arose  is  whether the  rentals received by the respondents from private horse owners or trainers who have leased buildings located outside the race tracks for stables are subject to the 20 per cent amusement tax.</p>
<p>The  second question is  whether the rentals received  by respondent Manila Jockey Club,  Inc. from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office for  a portion  of the grandstand and the rentals from political, labor or social organizations for said grandstand, are subject to the 20 per cent amusement tax.</p>
<p>The  third  question is whether the rentals received  by the respondents  on their  respective racing days  from private individuals for spaces used by the latter as restaurants, bars, and other  recreations concessions are subject to the 20 per  cent amusement tax.</p>
<p>The  fourth question is  whether the rentals received  by the respondents from the White Cross,  Inc., the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society, and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office  which hold their  own  races on the race tracks of either respondent  are also subject to the 20  per cent amusement tax.</p>
<p>The Board of Tax Appeals ruled in the negative as to the first, second and fourth questions,  and in the affirmative as to the  third question.  The Collector of Internal Revenue,  petitioner  herein,  has  appealed to this  Court from the ruling as to the first, second and fourth questions. The legal provision  involved is the third paragraph of Section 260 (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>)  of the National  Internal Revenue  Code which reads as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the case  of cockpits,  cabarets, and  night clubs, there shall be collected  from the  proprietor,  lessee, or  operator a ' tax equivalent to ten per centum, and in the case of race-tracks, twenty per centum of the gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not  any amount is  charged or paid for admission: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> however, That in the case of race-tracks,  this  tax is in addition to the  privilege tax prescribed  in section one hundred ninety-three.  For  the purpose of  amusement tax, the term 'gross  receipts' embraces all the receipts of the  proprietor, lessee,  or operator of the  amusement place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the petitioner's contention that all income of the respondents are  subject to the amusement  tax  of 20 per cent, whether  or not  it  is derived  from the holding of races or  other amusements.  The contrary  view is held by the respondents  and  sustained  by the Board of Tax Appeals,  namely, that the respondents  are required to pay the 20 per  cent amusement tax only on "gross receipts" obtained  from the  holding  of races or  amusements.</p>
<p>We agree with the latter view.   The very nature  of the tax is decisive.  It is an "amusement tax", and the law refers  to "gross receipts"  and   not  "gross income".   It is  important  to  note that  "gross receipts" is prefaced and qualified by the phrase  "for the purpose  of  amusement tax".</p>
<p>The  law states  that  the  20 per cent amusement tax shall  be   paid on  the  "gross  receipts,  irrespective  of whether  or not  any  amount is  charged or paid for  admission."   This  clause is a  plain demonstration that  the "gross receipts" refer to the collections on days when the race  track is open to  the general public and admission fees  are  or are not charged.  This  necessarily  excludes income of  the  respondents  received  on days when  they do not legally and  actually hold horse races.</p>
<p>It  is also significant that the tax  required to be  paid under section 260 (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>) is expressly  imposed in addition  to the privilege tax  prescribed in section 193(<span style="font-style: italic;">r</span>) which requires owners  of race tracks  to pay  P500 for each day on which races are run on any track.  This confirms the idea of imposing the 20 per  cent tax under section 260 (<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>) only on receipts from the business of horse racing on  days during which the respondents are authorized to offer  such amusement to  the  public.</p>
<p>A  race track should  be  distinguished  from the  club which owns it  and is also authorized  by law to engage  in other  business activities.   Since  the  law  imposes  the amusement tax  on  cockpits, cabarets, night clubs and  race tracks, it is certainly not imposed on or measured by the gross income of the club engaged,  among other activities, in  horse  racing.</p>
<p>The petitioner is of the impression that because section 2 of Republic Act No. 309 requires that "adequate sanitary accommodations be provided in the race track, grandstands, stables and other  structures of racing clubs," the various improvements and  conveniences in question had to be built by the respondents as a  necessary incident to their business  of  horse  racing,  with the  result  that the  rentals for stables or buildings and lots outside the racing compounds should  form  part of their gross receipts liable  to the 20 per cent amusement  tax.  It is well  to remember that the appellees  are private  corporations empowered  to purchase, hold, convey, sell, lease, mortgage, encumber, and otherwise deal with such real and personal property as the purpose  for which they were formed may permit  and the transaction of their  lawful  business  may reasonably and necessarily require.  In the exercise of such  power the respondents naturally may dispose of the portion  or portions of their land  in excess of that  necessary for or  may be devoted  to  the race  tracks or hippodrome. There is authority for the proposition that if the business of  a corporation is  such as to render it  necessary for it  to own a  certain kind  of property, and  at  times  such property is not necessary to its business, it may employ the property in a business or for a  purpose which  is not strictly within the objects  of  its creation  and utilize said surplus  or  idle property by appropriate lease or sale. (Section 2535, Fletcher's Cyc. Corporations, Vol. VI.)  As in the case of respondent Manila Jockey Club, Inc., one of its secondary purposes is to acquire real estate, construct edifices  thereon for lease or for sale, when  in the opinion of the  Board of Directors such  sale is  advantageous  to the corporation.</p>
<p>The  lease  by the respondents of  the land outside the walled compound or hippodrome as subdivided lots to persons who have constructed thereon their residential homes, warehouses, or stores, clearly has  nothing to do with the business of  horse  racing.   The construction by the respondents  on  the  other  portion not  occupied  by the hippodrome of improvements like  stables, bowling alleys, residential buildings,  warehouses  and  office spaces, also has nothing to do with the business  of  horse racing,  with the possible  exception of the stables.  But, as heretofore already noted, said  stables should be  distinguished from the stables inside the racing compound  which are within the jurisdiction  of  the  Games and Amusements  Board, but the latter stables  are  not herein involved because the horse owners do not pay any fee  or rental for their use.</p>
<p>With reference to the  rentals collected  by  respondent Manila  Jockey Club,  Inc. for the use of a  portion of the main grandstand as office space of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, or for the  use of said grandstand  by various political or other  organizations, it would be  sufficient to state that said use is clearly alien to respondent's business of horse racing.  The  main  consideration that prompted the  Philippine  Charity Sweepstakes  Office to rent a space in the grandstand of respondent Manila Jockey Club, Inc. is undoubtedly its proximity to its  official headquarters on Rizal Avenue near the San Lazaro  Hippodrome. If horse racing is the main consideration,  the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office would also have  rented  office space in the grandstand of respondent Philippine Racing Club, Inc.   As  to the use of  the grandstand by various organizations for conventions, rallies, dances or other large gatherings, it need only be pointed out that horse racing, far  from  being an  attraction to said occasions,  would be a deterrent thereto for the  obvious reason that during racing  days it would not be practicable to hold  said conventions, rallies or  dances.  The  purpose  for  which  respondents' grandstands were built, should not be confused with the purpose for which they  are leased to the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office or to various organizations.</p>
<p>Turning now to the floor rentals paid to the respondents by the  White Cross, Inc., the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes  Office for using respondents' race tracks, it is clear that they should not  be  subject to the  20 per cent amusement tax.  It is to be remembered  that the law makes the proprietor, lessee, or operator, of the amusement place liable for the amusement tax, the three tax payers being connected by the  disjunctive conjunction "or", thereby positively  implying  that  the tax should be  paid by either the  proprietor, the  lessee, or the operator,  as the case may be, singly and not by all at one and the same time.  During days when the White  Cross,  Inc.,  the Philippine  Anti- Tuberculosis Society,  and the  Philippine Charity Sweepstakes  Office hold their  races,  they become the lessees or operators of the race  and therefore should  be called upon to pay the 20  per cent  amusement tax.  Under Republic Act No. 309, respondents cannot hold races  on the days assigned to charitable institutions.  It  would therefore be anomalous for said respondents to be required to pay the amusement tax on  rentals  for  the use  of their hippodromes by said charitable  institutions  on  the  days  on which  the respondents are prohibited from holding horse races.   The anomaly would  be lightened if the  respondents were required to pay the amusement tax, when the charitable institutions holding their own  races are them selves  exempt from taxes.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the  appealed decision of the  Board of Tax Appeals is hereby affirmed, without costs.</p>
