				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE LATE ESPERANZA J. VILLANUEVA, PABLO ORO, ADMINISTRATOR; MARIANO J. VILLANUEVA, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The West Coast Life Insurance Company issued two policies of Insurance on the 
life of Esperanza Villanueva, one for two thousand pesos and maturing on April 
1, 1943, and the other for three thousand pesos and maturing on March 31, 1943, 
In both policies (with corresponding variation in, amount land date of maturity) 
the insurer agreed "to pay two thousand pesos, at the home office of the 
Company, in San Francisco, California, to the insured hereunder, if living, on 
the 1st day of April 1943, or to the beneficiary Bartolome Villanueva, father of 
insured, immediately upon receipt of due proof of the prior death of the 
insured, Esperanza J. Villanueva, of La Paz, Philippine Islands, during the 
continuance of this policy, with right on the part of the insured to change the 
beneficiary."</p>
<p>After, the death of Bartolome Villanueva in 1940, the latter was duly 
substituted as beneficiary under the policies by Mariano J. Villanueva, a 
brother of the insured. Esparanza J. Villanueva survived the insurance period, 
for she died only on October 15, 1944, without, however, collecting the 
insurance proceeds. Adverse claims for said proceeds were presented by the 
estate of Esperanza J. Villanueva on the one hand and by Mariano J. Villanueva 
on the other, which conflict was squarely submitted in the intestate proceedings 
of Esperanza J. Villanueva.pending in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo. 
From an order, dated February 26, 1947, holding that the state of the insured is 
entitled to the insurance proceeds, to the exclusion of the beneficiary, Mariano 
J. Villanueva, the latter has interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>The lower court committed no error. Under the policies, 4he insurer obligated 
itself to pay the insurance proceeds (1) to the insured if the latter lived on 
the dates of maturity or (2) to the beneficiary if the insured died during the 
continuance of the policies. The first contingency of course excludes the 
second, and vice versa. In other words, as the insured Esperanza J. Villanueva 
was living on April 1, and March 31, 1943, the proceeds are payable exclusively 
to her or to her estate unless she had before her death otherwise assigned the 
matured policies. It is not here pretended and much less proven, that there was 
such assignment.) The beneficiary, Mariano J. Villanueva, could be entitled to 
said proceeds only in default of the first contingency. To sustain the 
beneficiary's claim would be to altogether eliminate from the policies the 
condition that the insurer "agrees to pay * * * to the insured hereunder, if 
living".</p>
<p>There is nothing in the Insurance Law (Act No. 2427) that militates against 
the construction placed by the lower court on the disputed condition appearing 
in the two policies now under advisement. On the contrary, said law provides 
that "an insurance upon life may be made payable on the death of the person, or 
<em>on his surviving a specified period</em>, or otherwise contingently on the 
<em>continuance</em> or cessation of life" (Sec, 165), and that "a policy of 
insurance upon life or health may pass by transfer, will, or succession, to any 
person, whether he has an insurable interest or not, <em>and such person may 
recover upon it whatever the insured might have recovered</em>" (Section 
166).</p>
<p>Counsel for the beneficiary invokes the decision in Del Val <em>vs.</em> Del 
Val, 29 Phil. 534, 540, in which it was held that "the proceeds of an insurance 
policy belong exclusively to the beneficiary and not to the estate of the person 
whose life was insured, and that such proceeds are the separate and individual 
property of the beneficiary, and not of the heirs of the person whose life was 
insured." This citation is clearly not controlling, first, because it does not 
appear therein that the insurance contract contained the stipulation appearing 
in the policies issued on the life of Esperanza J. Villanueva and on which the 
appealed order in the case at bar is based; and, secondly, because the Del Val 
doctrine was made upon the authority of the provisions of the Code Commerce 
relating to insurance (particularly section 428) which had been expressly 
repealed by the present Insurance Act (No. 8427).</p>
<p>Our pronouncement is not novel, since it tallies with the following typical 
American authorities: "If a policy of insurance provides that the proceeds shall 
be payable to the assured, if he lives to a certain date, and, in case of his 
death before that date, then they shall be payable to the beneficiary 
designated, the interest of the beneficiary is a contingent one, and the benefit 
of the policy will only inure to such beneficiary in case the assured dies 
before the end of the period designated in the policy." (Couch, Cyclopedia of 
Insurance Law, Vol. 2, Sec. 343, p. 1023.) "Under endowment or tontine policies 
payable to the insured at the expiration of a certain period, if alive, but 
providing for the payment of a stated sum to a designated beneficiary in case of 
the insured's death during the period mentioned, the insured and the beneficiary 
take contingent interest. The interest of the insured in the proceeds of the 
insurance depends upon his survival of the expiration of endowment period. Upon 
the insured's death, within the period, the beneficiary will take, as against 
the personal representative or the assignee of the insured. Upon the other hand, 
if the insured survives she endowment period, the benefits are payable to him or 
to his assignee, notwithstanding a beneficiary is designated in the policy." (29 
Am. Jur., Vol. 29, section 1277, pp. 952, 953.)</p>
<p>The appealed order is, therefore, Hereby affirmed, it is so ordered with 
costs against the appellant.</p>
