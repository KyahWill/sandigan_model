				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petitioner prays for mandamus to compel the delivery to him 
of a certain jeep which the respondents, officials of the National Bureau of 
Investigation, are holding by virtue of a search warrant issued and ratified by 
the other respondents, all judges of the Manila court of first instance. He 
avers that said search warrant is void and that he is the lawful owner of the 
car, having purchased it from the Government Procurement Commission.
<p align="justify">On July 25, 1946 a Ford jeep, Motor No. G.P.W. 223169 of the 
Department of Justice, assigned to its Division of Investigation now—the 
National Bureau of Investigation—was stolen from the residence of Agent 45 in 
San Juan, Rizal.</p>
<p align="justify">On January 27, 1947, while the jeep allegedly now in question 
was parked on the Escolta, an operative of said Bureau spotted it and knowing it 
was stolen personalty, drove it to the Bureau where it was identified by Agent 
45 as the same vehicle that had been taken away from his residence. Later herein 
petitioner Erasmo R. Cruz appeared and claimed the jeep. The officers 
relinquished it to him only to swear the following day before Hon. Sotero Rodas 
(then judge of Manila) in criminal case No. 1267 an application for a search 
warrant of one Ford jeep bearing plate No. 18-395, series of 1946. The jeep was 
again seized. But on February 1, 1947, Erasmo R. Cruz filed in court an urgent 
motion for its return. Judge Rodas, apparently was impressed by the fact that 
the chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation had been applying chemicals 
to the motor (obviously for the purpose of clinching its identification of the 
property), concluded that the Bureau was not sure of its position and directed 
that the vehicle be handed back to claimant Cruz.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI for 
short) obtained better evidence of its case of theft of the automobile against 
Erasmo R. Cruz, et al. then pending investigation in the City Fiscal's office, 
and desirous of retaining the jeep as part of the corpus delicti filed another 
application for search warrant in criminal case No. 1288 against Erasmo R. Cruz, 
et al., for theft. The NBI had at that time statements of the accused. Judge 
Rafael Dinglasan issued a search warrant, forgone "jeep now bearing plate No. 
18395 (series 1946) motor No. MVD 620 and chassis No. 203961." It was 
consequently carried out. Upon motion for the return of the jeep, Judge Ramon 
San Jose refused to modify or revoke the warrant. Upon another motion to 
reconsider, Judge Conrado V. Sanchez of the same court issued this order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is alleged that the jeep in question was seized under 
search warrant issued in criminal case No. 1267, the search warrant issued in 
said case was quashed. The order of February 7, 1947 in criminal case No. 1267 
is predicated upon the fact that the jeep, seized upon the search warrant 
therein issued, was not the one applied for. Needless to state, the jeep seized 
in the present case (criminal case No. 1288) is the very same jeep applied for 
herein. The order of February 7, 1947, in criminal case No. 1267 is, therefore, 
not controlling in the present case.</p>
<p align="justify">"It is also urged in behalf of defendant that the jeep seized 
herein is not the same jeep claimed and owned by the Division of Investigation 
and that the aforesaid jeep does not form part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in 
criminal case No. 3011 of this Court, entitled 'The People of the Philippines 
vs. Dionisio Macaranas, et al.' After hearing the arguments of the parties, it 
is clear that the prosecution in said case claims that the jeep, the subject of 
herein search warrant, is the same jeep which was alleged to have been stolen 
from the Division of Investigation, and that the identification, numbers thereof 
have been tampered with. It is obvious that to order, at this time, the return 
of the jeep, may nullify the efforts of the People to procure conviction in 
criminal case No. 3011, for the reason that the jeep in question constitutes, 
the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime charged, according to its theory.</p>
<p align="justify">"Premises considered, the motion for reconsideration is hereby 
denied."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Hence this petition attacking the validity of the warrant. The 
points involved.have been fully argued.</p>
<p align="justify">Whether or not the jeep now in the custody of the NBI—holding 
the property for the court—is the same jeep stolen from Agent 45, or is another 
vehicle purchased by the herein petitioner from the Government Procurement 
Commission is obviously a question of fact that should be ventilated neither in 
this forum nor in this litigation. That issue properly belongs to the courts of 
first instance.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner's grievance seems to be planted mainly on the 
proposition that after Judge Rodas had determined that the jeep was not <i>the 
stolen jeep</i>, other judges may not thereafter declare that it was.</p>
<p align="justify">On this phase of the controversy, it should be noted that, in 
issuing or not issuing search warrants, judges act in accordance with the 
evidence presented to them. The proofs submitted to Judge Rodas were not 
probably as strong as the evidence introduced before Judge Dinglasan. And then 
it should be remembered that the motions were filed in different cases. Anyway 
orders of judges on the matter are not final and do not constitute <i>res 
judicata</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The denial of a search warrant on the ground, of the 
insufficiency of the affidavit and deposition is not a bar to further 
proceedings, nor is the issuance of the warrant and its subsequent discharge 
<i>res judicata</i> as to the right to the warrant." (56 C. J., 1228.)</p>
<p align="justify">"Where accused in a criminal proceeding has petitioned for the 
return of goods seized, the order of restoration by an inferior court is 
interlocutory and hence not appealable; likewise a denial, by the United States 
district court, of defendant's petition for the return of articles seized under 
a warrant, is such an interlocutory order." (56 C. J., 1253.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We may, now advert briefly to the other contention of 
petitioner that the warrant had not been issued by Judge Dinglasan in accordance 
with the rules. It should be observed that the warrant may be issued to "bring 
before the court" "property stolen" (Rule 122, sections 1 and 2), and that Judge 
Dinglasan issued it after considering testimony of agents of the NBI which seems 
to be justified by the subsequent presentation of information for theft of that 
jeep. According to the order, the judge was satisfied "after examining under 
oath" two agents of the Division of Investigation that the jeep was "stolen" 
property. Therefore, under the circumstances, we do not see any material 
violation of the principles laid down by this Court in the Garcia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Alvarez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> cases invoked by petitioner to support his 
contention.</p>
<p align="justify">In fine, this request for restoration is not clearly 
meritorious; and we should hesitate to favorably act on the petition, there 
being an indication that petitioner is under a cloud in connection with the 
larceny of the motor vehicle which he seeks to retrieve from the hands of the 
law. Petition denied, with costs.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, 
Perfecto, Briones, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.
