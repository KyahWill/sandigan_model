				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila, finding the appellant guilty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of <i>estafa</i> and sentencing him to imprisonment&nbsp; for&nbsp; a period of&nbsp; six months and one day of <i>prision correctional</i>, to indemnify the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office in the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P9,060, with&nbsp; subsidiary imprisonment in ease of insolvency, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; Only the following questions of law are raised in the appeal:<br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp; The lower court&nbsp; error in not&nbsp; considering this ease as&nbsp; civil, particularly because of a partial payment admitted in the decision; and<br><br>"II. The lower court erred in imposing on the accused the penalty prescribed in the 2nd paragraph&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; instead of that prescribed&nbsp; in Article 316 (B) or that in Article 818."&nbsp; (p. 1, Appellant's Brief)</blockquote>It is contended in support&nbsp; of the first assignment of error that&nbsp; the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office accepted partial payment; that according to the information the relation between the offended party and the appellant is one of agency, which&nbsp; cannot be the basis of criminal responsibility; and that the information does not charge an offense.&nbsp; It is not true&nbsp; that the information does&nbsp; not charge an offense because allegation is made that appellant received sweepstakes tickets from&nbsp; the offended party for the purpose of&nbsp; selling&nbsp; the same&nbsp; under the&nbsp; express&nbsp; obligation of&nbsp; making an accounting thereof and turning over the proceeds of the sale&nbsp; to&nbsp; the offended party, and that the appellant failed to&nbsp; comply with his obligation&nbsp; within a&nbsp; reasonable length&nbsp; of time&nbsp; and misappropriated,&nbsp; misapplied and converted&nbsp; the tickets or their&nbsp; value&nbsp; to his own personal use and benefit, to the damage of the offended party.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; is it true&nbsp; that the obligation contracted by the appellant&nbsp; is a civil&nbsp; one; under&nbsp; the allegations&nbsp; the act of the&nbsp; appellant is&nbsp; characterized by&nbsp; abuse of&nbsp; confidence. The act of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; consists in misappropriating, misapplying or&nbsp; converting the tickets&nbsp; or their value&nbsp; with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence,&nbsp; which. is&nbsp; an&nbsp; offense defined in the&nbsp; law (Article&nbsp; 315, paragraph 1 (6), Revised&nbsp; Penal Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; Acceptance of partial&nbsp; payment by an offended party is not one of the means for extinguishing criminal liability (Camus vs.&nbsp; Court of Appeals,&nbsp; et al., 92 Phil.,&nbsp; 85;&nbsp; 48 Off. Gaz., 3898).&nbsp; A&nbsp; criminal offense is&nbsp; committed against the People and&nbsp; the offended party&nbsp; may not waive or&nbsp; extinguish the criminal&nbsp; liability that the law imposes for the commission of the offense. <br><br>In support of the second assignment of error, it is argued that&nbsp; the penalty is too strict and in accordance with general principles of law&nbsp; which demand a liberal&nbsp; application of criminal laws,&nbsp; the amount of P9,060&nbsp; misappropriated should be considered only as falling under paragraph 3 of Article 315 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, because the value of money&nbsp; since the fixing of the penalty in the Revised Penal Code in the&nbsp; year 1930 has considerably decreased.&nbsp; The argument is indeed novel, although there seems to&nbsp; be. some reason therefor.&nbsp; It is true that about 27 years&nbsp; ago the value of the peso was very much more than&nbsp; its present value.&nbsp; However, courts are not authorized to adjust penalties according to the&nbsp; changing value of the legal&nbsp; currency, as&nbsp; this&nbsp; clearly falls within&nbsp; the province of the Legislature.<br><br>However, the penalty imposed&nbsp; by the trial court, which is that of six months and one day of <i>prision correctional</i>, is not&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of law.&nbsp; The proper penalty is the indeterminate sentence&nbsp; running from 2 months and&nbsp; 1 day to 6 months as minimum,&nbsp; and from 1 year, 8 months and&nbsp; 21&nbsp; days to 2 years,&nbsp; 11 months and 10 days as maximum.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is, therefore, hereby affirmed, but the penalty imposed&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; modified and the appellant sentenced to 6 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; mayor</span>&nbsp; as minimum to 1 year, 8 months and 21&nbsp; days&nbsp; as maximum. In all other respects&nbsp; the penalty imposed&nbsp; by the trial court is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
