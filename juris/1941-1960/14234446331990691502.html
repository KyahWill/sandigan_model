				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; a decision of the&nbsp; Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals. In July, 1950 agents of Customs Patrol&nbsp; Service boarded and searched the M/V "Crete Maersk",&nbsp; of which respondent Cia.&nbsp; Gral.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Tabacos&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; special agent.&nbsp; The ship had&nbsp; a "Manifest"&nbsp; (Exh. "A") and among the provisions listed therein were "Cigarettes Cartons—3260&nbsp; pcs."&nbsp; But upon a recount of the amount of&nbsp; cigarettes contained in the slob chests it&nbsp; was&nbsp; found&nbsp; out&nbsp; by the customs agents that there was an excess&nbsp; of 420 cartons&nbsp; over and above the quantity&nbsp; listed in the&nbsp; "Manifest".&nbsp;&nbsp; This excess was ordered confiscated by&nbsp; the Commissioner of Customs&nbsp; on June 5, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cia. Gral. de Tabacos appealed&nbsp; from the above decision to the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals and this court reversed the confiscation, ordering the&nbsp; return of the 420&nbsp; cartons&nbsp; of&nbsp; cigarettes,&nbsp; or the refund&nbsp; of the proceeds from the sale thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals held that the 420 cartons of cigarettes form&nbsp; part.of the ship's store, which was not required to be&nbsp; entered&nbsp; in a detailed manifest, and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; same are not subject to&nbsp; confiscation under the provisions of Section 1363&nbsp; (g) of the Revised Administrative Code.<br><br>It&nbsp; is the&nbsp; contention&nbsp; of the Solicitor General on this appeal that the&nbsp; stock of cigarettes carried on board was required to be listed in a manifest, as provided in Section 1228 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; and&nbsp; what is not so&nbsp; listed is subject to confiscation under Section&nbsp; 1363 (g)&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appeal involves the interpretation of the above-mentioned sections of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code, which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 1228.&nbsp; <i>Manifest required of vessel&nbsp; from&nbsp; foreign port</i>.— Every vessel&nbsp; from&nbsp; a foreign port&nbsp; or place must have on&nbsp; board complete written or typewritten&nbsp; manifests of all her cargo.<br><br>"All of the&nbsp; cargo intended to be landed at a port in the Philippines&nbsp; must be described in separate manifests for each&nbsp; port of call&nbsp; therein.&nbsp; Each manifest&nbsp; shall&nbsp; include the port of departure, and&nbsp; the port of delivery with the marks, numbers, quantity, and description of the packages and the&nbsp; names of the consignees thereof. Every vessel from a foreign port or place must&nbsp; have on board complete manifests&nbsp; of passengers,&nbsp; immigrants, and their baggage, in-the prescribed form, setting forth their destination and all particulars&nbsp; required&nbsp; by the immigration laws; and every such vessel shall have prepared for presentation to the proper customs official upon arrival in ports of the Philippines a complete list of all ship's stores&nbsp; then&nbsp; on board.&nbsp; If the vessel&nbsp; does&nbsp; not carry cargo,&nbsp; passengers, or immigrants,&nbsp; there must still be manifest showing that no&nbsp; cargo is carried from&nbsp; the port of&nbsp; departure to the&nbsp; port of destination in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines.<br><br>"A cargo manifest shall in no&nbsp; case be changed or altered, except after entry of the vessel, "by means&nbsp; of an amendment by the master, consignee, or agent thereof, u<nder oath,="" and="" attached="" to="" the ="" original="" manifest."<br="">nder oath, and attached to the original manifest."<br><br>"Sec.&nbsp; 1363. <i>Property&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to forfeiture under customs laws.</i>— Vessels,&nbsp; cargo,&nbsp; merchandise, and' other&nbsp; objects and&nbsp; things&nbsp; shall, under the conditions herein below&nbsp; specified, be subject to forfeiture:<br><br>"(<i>g</i>) Unmanifested merchandise found on any vessel, a manifest therefor being required,"<br><br><center> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </center></nder></blockquote>A&nbsp; cursory&nbsp; reading of&nbsp; the&nbsp; first section readily&nbsp; shows that what&nbsp; is required&nbsp; is a "manifest of all her&nbsp; (ship's) cargo."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cargo" is&nbsp; what Is intended to be unloaded and landed at a&nbsp; port, . The "Manifest" contains&nbsp; the port&nbsp; of departure&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; port&nbsp; of delivery,&nbsp; "with&nbsp; the marks, numbers,&nbsp; quantity, and description of&nbsp; the packages and the names of the consignees thereof."&nbsp; As ship's provisions are&nbsp; not to be&nbsp; unloaded and delivered to consignees, they are&nbsp; not&nbsp; supposed to be included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; "manifests"&nbsp; as above required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the law, they are&nbsp; to be contained in "a complete list of&nbsp; all ship's stores."&nbsp; Such has been our interpretation in the cases of United States <i>vs.</i> SS. "Islas Filipinas," 28 Phil. 291 and United States<i> vs. </i>Steamship "Rubi", 32&nbsp; Phil. 228, where we said:<br><blockquote>"Another contention of the appellant is that&nbsp; the opium in question is not 'cargo' within the meaning of the customs laws.&nbsp; The term 'cargo' is not specifically&nbsp; defined&nbsp; in the Customs Administrative Act, but from the&nbsp; language&nbsp; used in several of its provisions it is clear that the word 'cargo' as used in the section, under consideration includes&nbsp; all goods, wares,&nbsp; and merchandise aboard ship which do not form, of the ship's&nbsp; stores.<br><br>"Black's Law Dictionary&nbsp; defines the term&nbsp; 'cargo' as follows: 'The load or lading of&nbsp; a vessel;&nbsp; goods&nbsp; and&nbsp; merchandise put on&nbsp; board a ship to be carried to&nbsp; a certain port."&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S. <i>vs.</i> S,S. "Islas Filipinas, <i>supra</i>, p. 297.)<br><br>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Having in&nbsp; mind the&nbsp; context,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; purposes and objects sought to be obtained by the enactment of this&nbsp; statute; we are satisfied that the word 'cargo'&nbsp; as used in the first paragraph of section 77 refers to the 'entire lading of the ship which&nbsp; Carries it' and includes&nbsp; all goods, wares, merchandise, effects, and indeed everything, of every kind&nbsp; or description, found on board, except such&nbsp; things as are used or intended for use in connection with&nbsp; the management or&nbsp; direction of the vessel and&nbsp; are not&nbsp; intended&nbsp; for delivery at any port of&nbsp; call, and except also, perhaps 'passengers or immigrants and their baggage."&nbsp; (U.S. <i>vs. </i>Steamship "Rubi" supra, p.&nbsp; 235.)<br></blockquote>We, therefore, find&nbsp; no error in the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; that the cigarettes&nbsp; carried as provisions&nbsp; do not need to be listed in the manifest of a ship's cargo.&nbsp; True it&nbsp; is, failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; detail&nbsp; them in&nbsp; the&nbsp; list of provisions may facilitate illegal importation, which zealous customs officials should prevent.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; neither the probability of illegal importation. nor the seal&nbsp; of&nbsp; customs officers&nbsp; justify&nbsp; a liberal&nbsp; construction of the&nbsp; penal provisions&nbsp; and permit Us to&nbsp; impose&nbsp; a penalty&nbsp; for an&nbsp; act which the law does not expressly and clearly punish.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed, with costs <i>de oficio.</i><br><br><i>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A,, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.<br></div>
