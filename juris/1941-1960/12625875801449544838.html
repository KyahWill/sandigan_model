				<H3>JOSE GARRIDO, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE PEREZ CARDENAS, RESPONDENT.<br><br> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review, by certiorari, of a  decision  of the  Court of  Appeals, reversing that of the Court of   First  Instance  of Manila,   and absolving  respondent, J.  Perez Cardenas,  from the  complaint,  without costs.  <br><br>It appears that on May  26,  1941, said respondent  and Pedro Camus executed, in favor of petitioner, Jose Garrido, the  promissory note Exhibit A, which is  of the following  tenor:  <br><blockquote>"For value received, PEDRO CAMUS as principal, and J. Perez  Cardenas as guarantor in solidum  hereby promise to  pay to  the order of Jose  Garrido,  the  sum  of  Two  Thousand  (P2,000.00) Pesos Philippine Currency, in the following manner:<br><br>During the  first twelve  consecutive  months beginning  June 1941,  the sum of P360.00 in twelve  equal installments  of P30.00, each installments to be  paid on or before  the fifth day of every month; <br><br>Then  the  balance  of  P1,640  in  thirty-two equal  installments of P50.00 and one last installment of P40.00 beginning the thirteenth month and  consecutively  thereafter, each installment  to  be paid on or before the fifth day of every month; <br><br>And PEDRO CAMUS as principal, and J. PEREZ CARDENAS as guarantor in solidum hereby agree that  if any two installments are  not paid according to  the tenor of this instrument, the whole principal sum then remaining unpaid shall forthwith  become  due and  payable immediately;<br><br>And PEDRO CAMUS as principal, and J. Perez Cardenas as guarantor in solidum, also promise and agree to pay a  sum equivalent to 20% of  the unpaid principal as  attorney's fees in case this note is not paid according to its tenor and is placed in the hands of  an attorney for collection." </blockquote>The  amount thereof not  having been paid,  despite demands, Garrido brought an action for its  recovery in the Municipal Court of Manila  (Civil Case  No. 15799).   Said action  was dismissed, however, for  want  of jurisdiction, whereupon petitioner  instituted the case  at bar,  against Camus  and Perez Cardenas, in the Court of First Instance of  Manila, for the same  purpose.   Only Perez Cardenas filed his answer, for  Camus  could  not  be summoned, his whereabouts  being unknown.  In  due  course,  said court subsequently  rendered a decision,  the dispositive  part  of which  reads: <br><blockquote>"FOR THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS,  the Court hereby  renders judgment in favor of  plaintiff Jose Garrido and  against Defendant Jose Perez  Cardenas,  sentencing the latter to pay the former the sum of  P2,000.00 with 6% interest thereon from  the filing of the complaint on December  15, 1953, until  its full payment,  plus the sum of  P200.00 for  attorney's fees.  No pronouncement is  made as to costs." </blockquote>On appeal, taken by Perez Cardenas, this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeals,  upon the ground that the promissory note in question is unenforceable, its cause or consideration being  unlawful  and contrary to public order and to  the proper administration of justice. Hence, this petition  for review  by  certiorari, filed  by Garrido, who now  maintains  that the Court of Appeals erred: <br><blockquote>"1. * * * in  holding that the question of illegality of consideration of the promissory  note may be taised  for  the first time on appeal inspite of the fact that the same was  never raised  in  the court below and is not within  the  issues  made  by  the  parties in their pleadings.<br><br>"2. * * * in holding the contract, which is hut a promise to civilly indemnify petitioner of the amount embezzled  from him, as null  and void, and in not applying  the  doctrine laid down in  the case of Hibberd  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rhode and  McMillian, 32 Phil,,  476."</blockquote>The first assignment or error is untenable.   If the consideration for the promissory note upon which plaintiff's cause of action relies were  contrary  to law, morals, good customs, public  policy or  public  order,  the  contract between the parties thereto would legally, be  "inexistent and void from the beginning."   (Art 1409, par. [1], Civil Code of the  Philippines.)   Inasmuch as the finding of the  lower court, on this point, was based upon petitioner's own evidence, it was proper to consider the same  in  the decision appealed from.  The petitioner could not be entitled to a judgment in his favor if his own proof  showed that he has no  cause  of action,  because the contractual relation  upon which  his claim  relies  is inexistent, from a legal  viewpoint.<br><br>As regards the second assignment  of error, the finding of the  Court  of  Appeals is  as follows: <br><blockquote>"*  *  * el  mismo apelado, libre y voluntariamente,  tal vez  sin darse cuenta  de  la consequencia de su acto, retalo antes  y durante el juicio que la causa  o consideracion del  pagare en cuestion era para evitar  que Pedro  Camus, el  codemandado  del  apelante, fuese procesado por estafa  (Exh. B.  y  Trans, n.t.,  pp. 2  y 4).  Como que  immediatamente  despues de su otorgamiento, la denuncia por estafa que ya estaba en manos  de la fiscalia, fue retirada o 'dismissed'—segun  declaracion del  mismo  apelado  (Trans, n.t.,  p.  6) <br><br>"De las mismas pruebas del apelado, resulta claro y evidente que la causa del pagare cuya redencion  se trata  de compeler es  ilegal, por  ser contrario a la ley, a la  moral y al orden publico.  Por consiguiente, es  inexistente,  nulo <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>,  no produce  efecto legal ninguno y su pago no puede judicialmente imponerse a sus otorgantes, uno  de  ellos, en su  calidad de fiador  solidario,  el  aqui apelante (Arts. 1352 y 1409  del nuevo Codigo Civil y Art.  1235 del antiguo; Arroyo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Berwin, 36 Phil., 386; Velez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ramas,  40  Phil, 787; Navarro <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Yuan, 43 Off. Gaz., p. 1675; Reyes <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Gonzales, 45 Off. Gas., p. 831)."</blockquote>The testimony  of  Garrido upon which  this finding is based, was to the effect that before the war, Pedro Camus had swindled him in the sum of P2,000.00, for which reason he  (Garrido) filed a complaint  against him  (Camus)  in the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila, where the following transpired, in the words  of Garrido:<br><blockquote>"* * *  I  went to the Fiscal's  Office  and  I remember  it  was Fiscal  Dinglagan who first investigated the case, and in  front of me  he  told Atty. Camus,  'You better  settle this with Mr. Garrido otherwise I will have to prosecute you because the evidence against you is  strong."  Then Atty. Camus told me that he was willing to settle the matter with me. And so I told him, 'Alright,  provided that you guarantee to me that you will pay me this  amount, I will give you the opportunity to  settle it.' I  then asked him how he propose to pay this amount.   Then  he told me  that  he is  an employee  of the Law  Office of Atty. J. Perez Cardenas, and then he asked me whether I would be agreeable to a promissory note to be signed  by  him in  solidum with Atty. J.  Perez Cardenas.   And  I told  him '<span style="font-style: italic;">You may prepare the promissory note and  the conditions, and if I will see that it  in all right I wilt accept </span>it."  (Italics ours.)</blockquote>It does not appear from  the  foregoing that Exhibit A was made in consideration of petitioner's  promise or obligation either to withdraw  his complaint for estafa,  or not to prosecute  him, or not to testify against him, or to suppress  any evidence against him,  or  otherwise  to interfere with the proper administration  of justice.  That no such undertaking  existed  or was the cause  for the  execution of  said Exhibit A, is more apparent from the  testimony of  respondent J.  Perez Cardenas, who siiid:<br><blockquote>"Yo  no  he tenido nada que ver en el  asunto anterior de Pedro Camus con el Sr. Garrido. Yo he oido solamente que el Sr.  Camus le habia estafado al Sr. Garrido cuando  el ejercia. la profesion de abogacia en  Baguio, porque parece ser que el Sr. Garrido, segun he visto en los documentos, le habia dado dinero  a Pedro Camus para comprar algunos 'claims'. El caso es que el Sr.  Camus,  en  ese año 1941,  cuando nadie piensan en la guerra, me pidio que le garantizara para librarle de la estafa; y yo le he garantizado firmando ese pagare. Pero para poner las cosas en  su lugar, yo no he itio a la ofieina del Sr.  Garrido,  ni a su casa, ni he firmado en frente de el ese pagare como el ha dicho.  El pagare lo firme en mi oficina en la Nacional City Bank Building; pero  no niego mi firma.      <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">****** <br></div>"Q—When Pedro Camus went to you i'or you to sign Exhibit A; is it not true that he told you that if you will sign the said Exhibit A the ease against him will be dismissed? "<br><br>A—I  don't  know anything about  that.   I have no  intervention at all  in this Exhibit  A. <br><br>"Q—Did  he not tell  you anything why you have to sign Kxhibit A in his favor in accordance with the information given  to you? <br><br>"A&amp;dmash;In  accordance with the information lie  gave  me, <span style="font-style: italic;">he  has curtain obligations in favor of Mr. Garrido  and that he wanted to have an  extension  of time  within  which to pay it</span>.  But <span style="font-style: italic;">later on</span> I  came to know that it was  the result of a case of  swindle  made by Mr. Camus  on Mr. Garrido l<span style="font-style: italic;">ong after I  signed that promissory note</span>. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">****** <br></div>"Q—Why did you sign  the promissory  note? <br><br>"A—Because I thought I could  help the young man, who was then a young lawyer, develop himself a better man.  I helped him because  he pretended to me to be a good lawyer." </blockquote>In short,  petitioner  did not deal with respondent prior to,  or  at the  time of, the  execution of  the promissory note.   It was  Camus  who  asked  respondent to sign it. Respondent  <span style="font-style: italic;">did not even know</span> that a complaint for swindling had been filed with the  Office of the City  Fiscal and was pending therein,   Respondent was merely advised by Camus that he had "certain obligations in favor of Mr. Garrido and that he (Camus) <span style="font-style: italic;">wanted to have an extension</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">of time</span> within which to pay it."   And respondent  signed the promissory note <span style="font-style: italic;">because he thought he  could thereby "help the young man, who was then a  young lawyer, develop himself a better man"</span>.  This certainly is not contrary to law, morals, good  customs,  public order or  public  policy. The circumstance that because of respondent's  signature on  Exhibit  A, petitioner "withdrew" his complaint  and the case against Camus was  "dropped", does not alter the situation materially.   In this connection, there  is  a substantial  analogy between the present  case  and  that  of Hibberd  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rohde and McMillian  (32 Phil,  476).   In the language of Mr, Justice Trent, the facts therein were:<br><blockquote>"* * *  McMillian  was  in the retail liquor  business and  secured a  stock of  merchandise valued  at P1,200 from  Brand &amp; Hibberd and  sold it.  Alleging that they delivered the merchandise to him on deposit only, Brand &amp; Hibberd filed a complaint of estafa against McMillian.  McMillian was arrested and  released on bond  pending" the  preliminary  hearing  before  the  justice  of the  peace.  The defendant Rohde was a practicing attorney and undertook McMillian's defense in  the estafa case.  Rolide testified that he was well  acquainted  with the nature of the  transaction between  the  firm  of Brand &amp;  Hibberd and McMillian;  that the merchandise was sold outright  to McMillian;  that <span style="font-style: italic;">he  knew  the estafa complaint was absolutely without foundation; and that McMillian could not  possibly be convicted; but that one Sullivan informed him after the preliminary hearing was held that  he knew  positively  that McMillian would be bound  over for trial in the, Court of First Instance</span>.  In rebuttal, Sullivan testified that what he told Rohde was that he was  satisfied from the  evidence introduced at the hearing that McMillian would be held for  trial in the Court of First Instance.   Upon the strength of Sullivan's statement,  Rohde agreed to sign the  note reproduced above  <span style="font-style: italic;">if Brand &amp; Hibberd would  withdraw  the estafa  complaint. He did this because he did not want  his client  to  remain in confinement  pending  his  trial</span> in the  Court of First  Instance, which would  not have occurred  for three months.  His  client  was sick at the time and Rohde was afraid that confinement in the jail for such a  period  of time  would  seriously  endanger  his  health.  After  the execution  of the note, <span style="font-style: italic;">Brand &amp;  Hibberd moved in the justice court that the estafa complaint be  dismissed and this motion was granted</span> by the presiding  justice.  In the  order  dismissing the  complaint, the justice  stated that, from the evidence introduced at the  hearing he was convinced  that there was  no sufficient basis for a criminal action,  but  that the  controversy was  of a civil  character.  Rohde subsequently paid two hundred  pesos  in the note.   The note was signed to  the  plaintiff L. O. Hibberd, on June 10,  1911."   (p. 481; italics ours.)</blockquote>A suit  having been brought  subsequently  on  the promissory  note against its makers, the latter alleged by way of special  defense—which respondent herein has not done— that the consideration for said contract was illegal.  This Court held  such  defense  is  untenable.  We  quote  from the decision therein:<br><blockquote>"* * *  The trial  court  found as a fact that tins consideration of the note was  the compromise of  a public offense.  We do not think  that the evidence justifies  this  conclusion.   It is true that the defendant Rohde testified that the consideration  of the note was 'the withdrawal of the false charge against him (McMillian) and to get him out of jail.'   But <span style="font-style: italic;">it is  also  in evidence that  McMillian owed Brand &amp;  Hibberd the full amount of  the  note and Rohde knew this fact before he signed the note.</span> There is no  charge that Brand &amp; Hihberd filed  the  criminal  complaint  with a view  of  extorting  a settlement  of  their  claim against  McMillian.  <span style="font-style: italic;">The  hearing at the preliminary investigation was  duly had  and all the  evidence was before the justice of the  peace  before the agreement represented by the note was wade.  It is not shown  that Brand &amp;  Hibberd agreed not to testify</span> in any further criminal proceedings against McMillian, or that <span style="font-style: italic;">they would suppress any evidence  in their possession, or that they would solicit  the State's prosecutor  or any other Government official  whose authority extend  to the criminal case,  to not  hold the defendant  for trial.  What they actually  did  was to move  in open court for a dismissal of  the complaint</span>.  This  is all  they did so far as the record shows, and that  it was satisfactory to the defendant Rohdc is apparent from the fact that he  subsequently made partial payments  on the  note. <br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">There  can be no doubt that  the  agreement which resulted in the execution of the note was entered into by  Brand &amp; Hibberd with an eye to the  satisfaction of their pecuniary claim against McMillian</span>. From the testimony of Rohde himself it appears that he strongly insisted that  McMillian was not guilty of the crime charged, and no doubt his ability as a lawyer tended  to convince the complainant that the  criminal charge  was unjustified.  If  they became converted  to this view of the matter, they no doubt more readily consented not to actively assist in the further prosecution  of the criminal complaint. We  do not  think the record justifies  a more  radical  conclusion as to what Brand &amp; Hibberd agreed to  do with reference to the criminal phase  of  the transaction than that <span style="font-style: italic;">they  promised  not  to  further actively participate  in the  case</span>.  The  record does   not  justify the conclusion  that they  went further  and  agreed to <span style="font-style: italic;">actively assist in preventing the due investigation of the criminal charge by suppressing evidence, by declining to appear</span> against McMillian if duly sub-poenaed as  witnesses, or  by  other means.   In  our opinion, the case is  similar in many aspects to  Goodrum <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Merchants &amp; Planters Bank (102 Ark., 326), to  which  we have referred above.  The record  indicates the same passivity on the part of the injured party and the same publicity of: the criminal charge.  <span style="font-style: italic;">There having been no agreement  to interfere with the due administration of the criminal law, we are constrained to hold that no part of the consideration of the note  declared upon is  illegal or against public policy</span>.  The plaintiff is therefore entitled to judgment."  (Pp. 486-486;  Italics ours.)</blockquote>Referring now to the case at bar, Camus, like MeMillian, had been  the subject of a criminal  complaint  and was <span style="font-style: italic;">advised that action adverse to him would be taken thereon</span>. Moreover, there was no  question about his obligation to pay the amount of  the  promissory note Exhibit A, and, after  the  execution  thereof,  the complaint was dropped. Although the order  of dismissal of the  case  against McMillian stated that the evidence against him did not suffice to warrant criminal  action, he thought that the justice of the  peace would find otherwise.  Similarly,  despite  the circumstance that Garrido believed Camus guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, the evidence before  us is not enough  to justify  a finding that said crime had really been  committed.  Indeed, it is to  be assumed  that the  complaint against  Camus was dropped upon  the recommendation of  the assistant city fiscal  who  investigated  the  case,  and  that  such recommendation must have stated that the evidence against the accused was insufficient  to secure  his conviction.  Otherwise  the City Fiscal would have had no choice but to disapprove the recommendation  and  order the filing of the corresponding information against Camus.  In short, there is a legal parity between the two  cases.<br><br>Those cited in support of respondent's pretense are not in point.   The  contract involved in Arroyo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Berwin (36 Phil., 386-387), specifically provided that <span style="font-style: italic;">one of the obligations contracted  thereby</span> was  "that the plaintiff  would ask the prosecuting  attorney  to dismiss  * * *  the proceedings  against Marcela Juaneza and Alejandro Castro for the crime of theft."  No such obligation has been contracted in the present  case. <br><br>Likewise, the cause of action in Velez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ramas (40 Phil., 787) was based upon a contract stating that it had been entered into "in order to prevent said woman (Restituta Quirante) from being  brought before the  courts for the unlawful acts  she has  executed,"  and the  offended parties therein had <span style="font-style: italic;">agreed "to suspend</span> the action they intend to bring against Restituta Quirante," so that, in the words of the Supreme Court, <span style="font-style: italic;">"the purpose of the contracting parties was to prevent a prosecution for crime</span>: and the injured parties  on their part, <span style="font-style: italic;">agree to  suspend</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">the criminal proceedings</span> which they had intended  to promote," for which  reason "<span style="font-style: italic;">the only</span>  consideration" for defendants' promise  to pay  "was  the  engagement  of the  plaintiffs whereby <span style="font-style: italic;">they bound  themselves  to suspend criminal proceedings</span>."   There was no such undertaking in the case at bar.  What is more,  respondent's testimony shows that <span style="font-style: italic;">he did not know</span> of  the existence of criminal proceedings against Camus, at the time of the execution of Exhibit A, and that Camus then merely wanted "an extension of time to pay" Garrido. <br><br>The case of Reyes <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Gonzales  (45 Off. Gaz., 831) refers to a deed  of  mortgage with a false cause, the true consideration  for which  was the release  of  the accused in a criminal case or the dismissal of the same.   Besides, it did not  appear  that said  accused  admitted either the offense  charged or their  liability,  and in consequence of said contract,  "the investigation was <span style="font-style: italic;">stifled</span>."   Precisely this Court  refused to apply therein the view taken in Hibberd <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Rohde and McMillian (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), because McMillian—in the same manner as Camus, in the  case  at bar, but, unlike the  accused in the Gonzales case—had been investigated  and  his  obligation  to pay the  complainant was admitted.   Needless  to say,  the  undisputed obligation of Camus to  refund  to  Garrido the  sum of P2,000 is  sufficient  consideration for the execution of Exhibit A, and, as respondent's testimony suggests, was his <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>  consideration therefor.  <br><br>Wherefore,  the decision  of  the  Court of  Appeals  is hereby reversed and another one shall be entered affirming that of the  Court of First Instance of Manila,  with  costs against respondent Jose Perez Cardenas.   It is so ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.</span>, concur. <br></div>
