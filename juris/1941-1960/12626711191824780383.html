				<H3>GOVERNMENT  SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM,  PETITIONER,  VS. HON.  MODESTO  CASTILLO,  ET  AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition by the Government&nbsp; Service Insurance System&nbsp; for&nbsp; a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; with&nbsp; preliminary injunction, to enjoin Honorable Modesto Castillo, as associate judge of the Court of Industrial Eelations, from hearing and further proceeding with CIR case No.&nbsp; 895-V, for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter in controversy.<br><br>On February 17,&nbsp; 195S, the respondent Association submitted to the&nbsp; Board of Trustees of the petitioner fourteen demands which included, among other things,&nbsp; the adoption of a scale of&nbsp; salaries with a minimum&nbsp; of P200 a&nbsp; month, the continuation&nbsp; of the grant&nbsp; of family allowance, free hospitalization and medicine&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of sickness, extension of regular appointments to temporary and emergency employees,&nbsp; additional&nbsp; compensation at 50&nbsp; per cent of basic pay&nbsp; for overtime work during Sundays and holidays&nbsp; and 25 per cent during&nbsp; regular days, and the creation of the positions of general manager&nbsp; and general&nbsp; actuary.&nbsp; As the board resolved to withhold&nbsp; action on the&nbsp; matter, the respondent association decided to declare a strike.&nbsp; Whereupon the Secretary of Labor called the parties to a conciliation conference&nbsp; wherein'&nbsp; four of&nbsp; the demands&nbsp; were granted.&nbsp; Still dissatisfied, the members of the respondent association declared a strike on June 17, 1953, when the Secretary of Labor certified the dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations, becoming CIR case No. 895-V.&nbsp; On July&nbsp; 10, 1953, the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the members of the respondent association are civil service employees whose demands, being covered by the Civil Service Law, are outside&nbsp; of the jurisdiction of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations.&nbsp; The court denied&nbsp; the motion and set the case for hearing,<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioner now contends that it&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; the performance of a governmental function of the State, and invokes the case of National Airports Corporation vs. Honorable Jose Teodoro, Sr., et al. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> G. R. No.&nbsp; L-5122, decided on April 30, 1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from supporting petitioner's case, this citation rather serves to define&nbsp; its status as a private concern&nbsp; (though of course government-owned or controlled), because&nbsp; it was therein ruled:<br><blockquote>"The Civil Aeronautics Administration&nbsp; comes under the category of a private entity.&nbsp; Although not a body corporate it was created, like the&nbsp; National Airports Corporation, not to maintain a necessary function of government but&nbsp; to run what is&nbsp; essentially&nbsp; a business, even if revenues be not its prime objective but rather the promotion of travel and the convenience of the travelling public.&nbsp; It is engaged in an enterprise which, far from being&nbsp; the&nbsp; exclusive prerogative of the state, may, more than the&nbsp; construction of public roads, be undertaken by private concerns."<br></blockquote>As a matter of fact, the petitioner (Government Service Insurance System)&nbsp; was created by virtue of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 186, as&nbsp; amended by Republic Act No. 660, as a non-stock corporation,&nbsp; managed&nbsp; by a&nbsp; Board of Trustees exercising the. "usual corporate powers."&nbsp;&nbsp; As a non-stock corporation, it is&nbsp; governed by Executive Order No. 399, otherwise known as&nbsp; Uniform&nbsp; Charter&nbsp; for&nbsp; Government Corporation, section 4 of which grants the following general powers:<br><blockquote>"(<i>a</i>) To do all such other things and&nbsp; to&nbsp; transact all such business directly&nbsp; or indirectly&nbsp; necessary,&nbsp; incidental&nbsp; or&nbsp; conducive&nbsp; to&nbsp; the attainment of&nbsp; the purposes of the corporation;&nbsp; and<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) Generally, to exercise all the powers of&nbsp; a&nbsp; corporation under ' the Corporation, Law&nbsp; in so far as&nbsp; they are not&nbsp; inconsistent with the provisions of this Order."<br></blockquote>And in Abad Santos <i>vs. </i>Auditor General,&nbsp; 79 Phil., 190, the petitioner was spqken of as&nbsp; "*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; uri verdadero negocio, una empreaa giganteca. en que estan vitalmente&nbsp; interesados mile's&nbsp; de clientes * * * " , We need&nbsp; only add, to show, that the petitioner is in&nbsp; error, that its business of&nbsp; insurance is&nbsp; not inherently or exclusively&nbsp; a&nbsp; governmental function,&nbsp; it is on the contrary, in essence and practice,&nbsp; of&nbsp; a private nature&nbsp; and&nbsp; interest.<br><br>Petitioner's contention that the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations has no jurisdiction because the employees involved are governed by. the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Law, is likewise untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our decision in Manila Hotel Employees Association vs.&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Hotel&nbsp; Company, et al., 73&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 374,&nbsp; is already decisive&nbsp; in favor of the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the Court, of Industrial Relations over&nbsp; labor disputes affecting government-owned&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; controlled&nbsp; corporations.&nbsp; Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 103&nbsp; (creating the&nbsp; Court of . Industrial Relations) does&nbsp; not exclude from&nbsp; its&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; civil service employees. <br><br>It is interesting to note that&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 11 of Republic Act No.' 875&nbsp; it is provided that "the terms and&nbsp; conditions of employment in the&nbsp; Government, including any political subdivision&nbsp; or instrumentality thereof,&nbsp; are&nbsp; governed&nbsp; by law and it is declared to be the policy of this Act that employees therein shall not strike for the purpose&nbsp; of securing changes or modification in their terms and conditions of employment";&nbsp; and yet it&nbsp; is also provided that said section&nbsp; "shall apply only&nbsp; to&nbsp; employees employed in governmental functions and not&nbsp; to those employed in proprietary functions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; including but not limited to governmental&nbsp; corporations."&nbsp; This&nbsp; indirectly upholds the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; over the labor dispute between the&nbsp; petitioner and the, respondent association&nbsp; which&nbsp; gave rise to: the strike declared&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 17,&nbsp; 1053,&nbsp; considering that strikes are common&nbsp; coercive measures falling under and subject to said jurisdiction. <br><br>Wherefore, the petition is hereby, dismissed without pronouncement as to costs.:&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Monternayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L,.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 91 Phil., 203.<br></div>
