The defendants filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; answer&nbsp; (Annex B), and&nbsp; after joinder of issues the Court set the case&nbsp; for trial.&nbsp; On the day&nbsp; set for trial&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case, neither.&nbsp;&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; nor their attorney appeared.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; proceeded to receive the plaintiffs' evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 11 February, the Court rendered judgment declaring the election&nbsp; held on 11 and 12 January null and void,&nbsp; ordering the defendants to call for and&nbsp; hold another election in&nbsp; accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the association and the Corporation Law,&nbsp; and sentencing the defendants to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P1,500 as attorney's fees,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; suit (Annex&nbsp; C).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; On 15 February,&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; time to&nbsp; appeal, the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; the judgment (Annex F).&nbsp; On 4 March the Court granted the plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and issued&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; execution prayed for&nbsp; (Annex G).&nbsp; On 9&nbsp; March the&nbsp; defendants moved for stay of execution&nbsp; of the judgment, for which they offered to&nbsp; file a supersedeas bond&nbsp; in the&nbsp; amount to be&nbsp; fixed by the Court&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; H).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 23 March the Court denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants'&nbsp; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In compliance with&nbsp; the judgment rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court, on 26 March the&nbsp; election committee composed&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quintin&nbsp; Tesalona, Manuel Dumaup and Jose" Capinio&nbsp; Santos set the meeting of the members&nbsp; of the association for 28&nbsp; March&nbsp; at 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon to elect the new members of the board of directors (Annexes&nbsp; J &amp;&nbsp; 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 27 March the plaintiffs filed an ex-parte motion alleging that the election committee&nbsp; that had called the meeting of members of the association is composed of the&nbsp; same members that had conducted and supervised the election of the members of the board of directors that was declared null and void by&nbsp; the Court; that in view thereof it would be inequitable to allow them to conduct and supervise again the forthcoming election;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the election to be&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; and supervised by the said committee would not be&nbsp; held in accordance with&nbsp; the constitution and by-laws of the association providing for&nbsp; five days notice&nbsp; to the members before the election,&nbsp; since&nbsp; the notice was posted and sent out only on 26 March,&nbsp; and the election&nbsp; would be&nbsp; held on 28&nbsp; March,&nbsp; or two days after notice; that the notice that beginning 26 March any member&nbsp; could secure his ballot and proxy from the office of the association is in violation of section 5, article III of the constitution&nbsp; and&nbsp; by-laws, which prohibits voting by proxy in the election of members of&nbsp; the board of directors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendants did not show that arrangement is being made "to guarantee that the election will&nbsp; be&nbsp; held in accordance with&nbsp; the constitution and&nbsp; by-laws&nbsp; and&nbsp; by the law."&nbsp; They prayed that the Court appoint its&nbsp; representative or representatives, whose compensation shall be paid out of&nbsp; the funds of the&nbsp; association, to supervise and conduct the election ordered by it&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the same&nbsp; day, 27 March, the Court entered an order providing as follows:<br><blockquote>* * * the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; orders&nbsp; that the&nbsp; election&nbsp; scheduled&nbsp; for March 28, 1957 be,&nbsp; as it hereby is, cancelled, and a committee of three is&nbsp; hereby constituted&nbsp; and appointed&nbsp; to&nbsp; call, conduct&nbsp; and supervise the election of the&nbsp; members of the board of directors of the&nbsp; association for 1957, said committee&nbsp; to&nbsp; be composed&nbsp; of Mr. Candido C. Viernes&nbsp; as representative of the Court and to act as Chairman; and one representative each from the plaintiffs and defendants,&nbsp; as&nbsp; members.&nbsp; The&nbsp; committee is vested&nbsp; with&nbsp; the sole and exclusive power and authority to call conduct and supervise the election of&nbsp; the members of&nbsp; the board of directors of&nbsp; the association for the year 1957. <br><br>The chairman of&nbsp; the committee&nbsp; shall&nbsp; receive a compensation of P50.00 per&nbsp; day and the members thereof P30.00 each per day, said compensation to be&nbsp; paid by the association. so ordered.&nbsp; (Annexes E &amp; 3.)<br></blockquote>On 28&nbsp; March the&nbsp; defendants moved for&nbsp;&nbsp; reconsideration of the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; order (Annex L).&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 30 March the Court denied the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Claiming that&nbsp; in issuing&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; 27 March&nbsp; 1957 (Annexes E &amp; 3) and&nbsp; in denying their motion for reconsideration, the Court acted without or in&nbsp; excess of jurisdiction&nbsp; or with grave abuse of discretion;&nbsp; and that there being no appeal or any&nbsp; plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the&nbsp; ordinary course of&nbsp; law, the&nbsp; petitioners pray for a writ&nbsp; of certiorari to annul and set aside the order&nbsp; assailed,&nbsp; and a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction to&nbsp; restrain the respondent court from enforcing its order of 27 March 1957&nbsp; (Annexes E &amp; 3) after the filing of a bond in the amount&nbsp; to be&nbsp; fixed by this Court; for&nbsp; costs to be taxed against&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for&nbsp; such&nbsp; other&nbsp; just&nbsp; and equitable relief as&nbsp; may be granted to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 14&nbsp; May 1957, after the petitioners had&nbsp; filed a bond in the sum of P200, this Court issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for.<br><br>Section 3, article III,&nbsp; of the constitution and by-laws of the&nbsp; association&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>Notice of the time and place&nbsp; of holding of any annual meeting, or any special meeting, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; members,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be given either by posting the same in&nbsp; a postage prepaid&nbsp; envelope, addressed to each member on record at the address left by such member with the Secretary&nbsp; of the Association, or&nbsp; at his known post-office&nbsp; address, or by delivering the same in person, at least five&nbsp; (5) days before the date set for&nbsp; such&nbsp; meeting.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; In lieu of addressing or serving&nbsp; personal&nbsp; notices to the&nbsp; members,&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; a&nbsp; regular annual meeting or of&nbsp; a special meeting&nbsp; of the members&nbsp; may be given by posting copies of said&nbsp; notice&nbsp; at&nbsp; the different departments and&nbsp; plants of the San Miguel&nbsp; Brewery&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; not less than five (5) days prior to&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of the meeting.&nbsp; (Annex K.)<br></blockquote>Notice&nbsp; of a special meeting of members should be given at&nbsp; least&nbsp; five&nbsp; days&nbsp; before&nbsp; the date of&nbsp; the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that the notice&nbsp; was posted&nbsp; on 26 March and the election was set for 28&nbsp; March.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the&nbsp; live days previous notice&nbsp; required would not be complied with.<br><br>As regards the creation of a committee of three vested with the authority&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; call,&nbsp; conduct and&nbsp; supervise the election,&nbsp; and the appointment thereto of&nbsp; Candido C. Viernes as chairman and representative of the&nbsp; court and one representative each&nbsp; from the&nbsp; parties, the Court&nbsp; in the exercise&nbsp; of its equity jurisdiction may appoint&nbsp; such committee, it having been shown that the Election Committee provided for in section 7 of the by-laws of the association that conducted&nbsp; the&nbsp; election&nbsp; annulled by the&nbsp; respondent court if&nbsp; allowed to act as such may jeopardize&nbsp; the rights of the&nbsp; respondents.<br><blockquote>In a proper&nbsp; proceeding a&nbsp; court of equity may direct the holding of a&nbsp; stockholders' meeting&nbsp; under the&nbsp; control of&nbsp; a special master, and the action&nbsp; taken at such a meeting&nbsp; will not be set aside because of a wrongful use of the court's interlocutory decree,&nbsp; where not brought to the attention of the court prior to the meeting.&nbsp; (18 C.J.S. 1270.)<br><br>A court of equity may, "on&nbsp; showing of good reason, appoint a master&nbsp; to&nbsp; conduct and&nbsp; supervise an election of&nbsp; directors&nbsp; when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it appears that a fair election&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; otherwise be had. Such a&nbsp; court cannot&nbsp; make directions contrary&nbsp; to statute and public policy&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to the conduct of such election.&nbsp; (19 C.J.S. 41)</blockquote>The&nbsp; writ prayed for is&nbsp; denied and&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction heretofore issued dissolved, with costs against the petitioners. &nbsp;<br><br><i>Paras, C.
