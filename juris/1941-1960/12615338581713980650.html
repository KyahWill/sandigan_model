				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant Arnulfo Alvarez&nbsp; was accused of robbery in an, inhabited&nbsp; house&nbsp; in&nbsp; an information filed with the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila, which&nbsp; reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; in&nbsp; or&nbsp; about and&nbsp; during the period&nbsp; comprised&nbsp; between January&nbsp; 15 and&nbsp; January 16, 1955, in the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously enter the&nbsp; store and house No. 1106 San Fernando St., Binondo,&nbsp; in said City,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was at the same&nbsp; time&nbsp; the dwelling place&nbsp; of&nbsp; one&nbsp; Tiong Cuanco&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; members&nbsp; of his family&nbsp; and therefore&nbsp; an&nbsp; inhabited house&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp; then and there passing thru the top of&nbsp; the mam door of the store, and house after forcibly&nbsp; cutting the iron&nbsp; grills on top&nbsp; of said door, and once inside the said store and house, with intent of gain and without the 'consent' of the owner thereof, wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously took,, stole and carried away 20 pieces of Gas Lantern&nbsp; (Optimus) made in Sweden, 300 candle power, valued at P600&nbsp; and 5 pieces of Gas Lantern (Petromax) made in Germany valued at P160 belonging to the said Tiong Cuanco, to the&nbsp; damage and prejudice of the said owner in the total sum of P760&nbsp; Philippine currency." </blockquote>Upon arraignment, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced, considering his plea of&nbsp; guilty as a mitigating circumstance, to&nbsp; suffer an indeterminate penalty of from&nbsp; six&nbsp; years of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to twelve years and one&nbsp; day of&nbsp; <i>reclusion temporal</i>,&nbsp; as&nbsp; maximum, to return to the offended party the stolen articles not recovered or indemnify him in the sum&nbsp; of P729.60, without subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of insolvency&nbsp; and to pay the costs. <br>&nbsp;<br>Not&nbsp; satisfied with the&nbsp; penalty, imposed upon him,&nbsp; he appealed from the decision only to&nbsp; question its propriety. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The crime alleged in&nbsp; the information,&nbsp; of which the&nbsp; appellant pleaded guilty,&nbsp; clearly falls&nbsp; under the provision of Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code and penalized there&nbsp; under with&nbsp; <i>prision mayor</i>, for the&nbsp; value of the stolen property exceeds&nbsp; P250&nbsp; but the appellant was&nbsp; not armed when he committed the&nbsp; crime.&nbsp; Hence, the proper penalty that should be meted upon him is the minimum period of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor </span>ranging from six years and one day to eight years.&nbsp; Accordingly, and&nbsp; applying&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the decision&nbsp; must be modified and appellant is hereby sentenced to&nbsp; an indeterminate penalty&nbsp; of from two&nbsp; years and four months&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correceional</span>, as minimum,&nbsp; to eight years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor,</span> as&nbsp; maximum.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Appellant contends that he is entitled to&nbsp; a. fixed penalty alleging that the present&nbsp; case is his first offense, that he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; molest the family living&nbsp; in the tenement robbed and that he was&nbsp; not armed when he committed&nbsp; the offense.&nbsp; But granting&nbsp; these allegations to&nbsp; be true—although we do not find them clearly proven except the fact that the appellant was&nbsp; not armed when he committed the crime at bar—the same do not constitute legal ground for imposing upon him a fixed penalty instead of applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law which is favorable to him; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Wherefore,&nbsp; with the modification of the appealed decision as above indicated, the same is hereby affirmed in all other&nbsp; respects, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla,,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur. </div>
