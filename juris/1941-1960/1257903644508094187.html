				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Consuelo S. Calalang is the grantee of a legislative franchise 
approved June 19, 1959 (Republic Act Xo. 2290) to construct, operate, and 
maintain an ice plant and cold storage in Hagonoy, Bulacan, subject to the 
following conditions, among others:
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Section 6. This franchise is granted subject to the provisions of the 
Constitution and Commonwealth Act Numbered One Hundred Forty-six, as amended. * 
* *</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to the above franchise, petitioner, on August 17, 1959, filed an 
application with the Public Service Commission (Case No. 126911) for the 
issuance of the corresponding, certificate of public convenience in her 
name.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that on July 27, 1959, or about three weeks before 
petitioner filed her application with the Commission, Aurora Tanjangco, 
administratrix of the intestate estate of Gervacio Tanjangco, an established 
operator of an ice plant in Hagonoy, Bulacan, filed with the Commission an 
application to increase the capacity of her ice plant from 10 tons to 40 tons 
(Case No. 126537). Believing that the grant of Tanjangco's application to 
increase the capacity of her ice plant would nullify the legislative franchise 
granted her to operate an ice plant in the same municipality, and that as 
grantee of a legislative franchise, she has the preferred right to serve the 
public need therein, petitioner, on August 31, 1959, entered an opposition in 
Case No. 12653J. A few days later, she also moved for a joint hearing of her 
application and that of Tanjangco (Cases Nos. 126911 and 126537), on the ground 
that a common issue of fact, as well as the question of preference or priority, 
is involved in the two applications.</p>
<p>On September 10, 1959, the Public Service Commission, through Commissioner 
Aspillera, issued an order overruling petitioner Calalang's opposition in Case 
No. 126537 and also denying her petition for a joint hearing of said case with 
her own application, Case No. 126911. Basis of the order was Commissioner 
Aspillera's belief that petitioner's legislative franchise, being conditioned on 
her first obtaining a certificate of public convenience from the Commission, who 
in turn is authorized to grant the same to her only if it finds that public 
convenience so requires, did not invest her with any right as an operator to 
oppose the application of an established operator for authority to improve her 
service, nor did said legislative franchise deprive the Commission of the power 
to act on an established operator's application for additional capacity without 
first giving petitioner an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p>On September 21, 1959, petitioner Calalang moved for the reconsideration of 
the above order, which motion Commissioner Aspillera denied on September 23, 
1959. Whereupon, Calalang filed the present petition for certiorari before this 
Court, charging respondent Commissioner Aspillera with having acted with grave 
abuse of discretion and in excess of jurisdiction in denying her right to 
interpose an objection in Case No. 126537, as well as in denying her motion for 
reconsideration without submitting the same to the members of the Commission 
<em>en banc</em>. Upon petitioner's filing of a bond in the amount of P1,000.00, 
we issued an order restraining the respondent Commissioner from promulgating any 
decision in Case No. 126537 until further orders from this Court.</p>
<p>However, on November 21, 1959, petitioner presented a supplemental petition 
alleging that Commissioner Aspillera had already decided Case No. 126537 
granting respondent Tanjangco's petition for an increase in the capacity of her 
iceplant, so that our writ of preliminary injunction came too late, and praying 
for another injunctive order to restrain said Commissioner from executing the 
decision in said case until the final disposition of this petition. We issued 
this second writ of preliminary injunction on December 8, 1959, after petitioner 
had filed an additional bond of P1,000.00.</p>
<p>The basic issue presented by this petition is a simple one: Whether 
petitioner, as the grantee of a legislative franchise to operate an ice plant in 
Hagonoy, Bulacan, approved before respondent Tanjangco applied for an increase 
of the capacity of her ice plant in the same municipality, should be allowed to 
oppose and be heard on the latter's application.</p>
<p>We think that under the circumstances, petitioner should have been given such 
a right.</p>
<p>The criterion or test in determining whether a person has sufficient interest 
or personality to intervene in any proceedings before the Public Service 
Commission has been laid down as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He must show * * *, that he has sustained, or is immediately in danger of 
sustaining, an injury as a result of that action, and it is not sufficient that 
he has merely a general interest common to all members of the public. His 
interest must be of such nature as to be susceptible of valuation" (Sambrano 
<em>vs</em>. Red Line Trans. Co., Inc., 68 Phil., 652)</p></blockquote>
<p>We believe that petitioner, although not yet an operator of an ice plant in 
the municipality of Hagonoy, Bulacan, has, in view of her having been granted a 
legislative franchise to operate such public utility in that municipality, 
sufficient interest as would satisfy the above test and entitle her either to 
oppose respondent Tanjangco's application for an increase in the capacity of her 
existing plant, or to ask a joint hearing of said application and her own 
application for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience in order to 
operate under her franchise.</p>
<p>Indeed, when petitioner was granted the franchise in question by the 
Legislature, we can assume that that body had already made a prima facie finding 
of a public necessity for the operation of an additional ice plant service in 
Hagonoy, Bulacan, and of petitioner's possessing the necessary qualifications to 
operate such service. Under this franchise, petitioner has thus acquired the 
right to operate an ice plant in the aforementioned municipality, subject only 
to the conditions mentioned in the franchise Act, among which is that she first 
obtain a certificate of public convenience from the Public Service Commission, 
fixing her plant's capacity and the conditions of operation. . Otherwise, it 
must be concluded that the franchise grant was an empty gesture on the part of 
the Legislature, as the petitioner could have just as well applied to the 
Commission itself.</p>
<p>The provisions of the franchise subjecting the grantee's operation to the 
terms and conditions imposed by the Public Service Commission presuppose that 
the Commission would not arbitrarily deny petitioner's application for a 
certificate of public convenience, but would act in accord with the facts and in 
the exercise of its sound judgment and discretion, with the end of accomplishing 
rather than frustrating the legislative will. When, therefore, respondent 
Tanjangco, an established operator, filed an application ahead of petitioner to 
increase the capacity of her existing ice plant in the same municipality, the 
least that the Commission should have done was to hear both applications 
together or give each applicant the opportunity to be heard against the other, 
to enable it to determine not only the relative merits of both applications but 
the question of preference between them as well. The act of the Commission of 
hearing and granting respondent Tanjangco's application without as much as 
allowing petitioner to intervene, oppose, or prove any better rights against it, 
is not only a deprivation of petitioner's rights without due process of law, 
"but seems calculated to render ineffectual and nugatory the franchise granted 
to her by the legislature and frustrate the legislative intent behind it. Such 
act is, therefore, not only a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the 
Commission, but an overstepping of the powers and jurisdiction conferred upon it 
by the law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of September 10, 1959 of the respondent Commission is 
reversed; the trial and judgment in Case No. 126537 are set aside; the 
opposition of petitioner in Case No. 126537 is admitted; and the respondent 
Commission is ordered to try cases Nos. 126537 and 126911 jointly, after which a 
new judgment shall be rendered in accordance.with the law and the evidence. . 
The preliminary writ of injunction issued by this Court on December 3, 1959, is 
rendered permanent. Costs against respondent Aurora Tanjangco.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Gutierrez David, 
Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order of September 10, 1959, reversed.</em></p></div>
