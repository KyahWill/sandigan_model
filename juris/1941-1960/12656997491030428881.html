				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ALEX JUREIDINI, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JARANILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Alex Jureidini was prosecuted for and convicted of theft in the Municipal 
Court of Cebu and on appeal to the Court of First Instance was found guilty of 
the same crime and was sentenced to one month and one day of imprisonment. From 
this judgment he appealed to this Court.
<p>The prosecution tried to establish the following facts:</p>
<p>In the morning of April 16, 1945, Private Ned Games, a guard of the warehouse 
of the quartermaster depot, APO 716, at pier 2, Cebu City, saw on the carriage 
of a parked bicycle a bag, exhibit A, containing the articles Exhibits A-1 to 
A-7, belonging to the United States Army. Thereupon Private Games reported what 
he had seen to Sergeant Merle G. Brown, calling his attention particularly to 
the bag Exhibit A which contained cigarettes. Private Games was instructed by 
Sergeant Brown to take the bicycle and its owner to the office as soon as the 
latter showed up. Moments later the accused appeared, approached the bicycle 
and, after tying his shoes over the bag exhibit A which was placed on the 
carrier of the bicycle, tried to leave the premises. Upon being asked by Private 
Games whether he was the owner of the bicycle, the appellant answered in the 
affirmative; whereupon, following the order of his superior. Private Games took 
the appellant together with the bicycle and the exhibits referred to above to 
the quartermaster. Here the appellant admitted having placed the goods inside 
the bag Exhibit A but without any intention of stealing them. Appellant was at 
that time an employee of the said warehouse of the quartermaster depot of the 
United States Army in Cebu.</p>
<p>Denying his guilt, the appellant adduced the following evidences That he was 
the only son of Isidro Jureidini and one Eulalia, wealthy merchants of Cebu 
before the outbreak of the war; that he studied in the Sambag Grammar School of 
the City of Cebu, attended high school in the Silliman Institute and received 
his college education in the Cebu Junior College; that he had never before been 
accused of any crime in any court of justice and that lie is a young man of good 
moral character; that at the time he was prosecuted for theft he was living with 
his mother in such ease and comfort that he did not have to work for a living 
but that being bored having nothing to do he worked, in the aforesaid 
quartermaster of the United States Army as foreman; that while he was working 
there so many robberies and thefts had taken place that the authorities of the 
quartermaster took all precautionary measures to prevent further commissions of 
such crimes by, among others, posting guards at the entrance and exit of the 
premises, frisking every employee going out and placing a notice in the premises 
warning that any person caught in the act of stealing goods from the 
quartermaster would be shot; that in the afternoon of April 14, right after he 
had begun working in the warehouse, he stumbled on a box, as a result of which, 
he injured his feet, but despite the accident he continued working; that early 
in the evening of said date he requested the watchman, Venancio Antonio, to 
speed up the work in the warehouse which appeared to the former to be going on 
very slowly, but that Venancio refused to cooperate; that he then told Venancio 
that he was only wasting the money of the Americans, which provoked a quarrel 
between the two; that in the morning of April 16 the appellant entered the 
warehouse and waited there for about half an hour to get his rations, but 
finding that there was nobody to attend him he went back to his bicycle 
intending to go home, as his office hours had already ended; that on that 
occasion he noticed that his bicycle had been removed from the place where he 
had left it and found on its carrier a small box with lettering "PRUNES" and a 
small tin can without any label; that a guard approached and told him to go to 
the office; that upon arriving there he was shown by Sergeant Brown a big bag 
and was told that it was found on the carrier of his bicycle; that a Corporal 
Lovensky began typing something which was probably an affidavit to be subscribed 
against him; that about an hour later Lieutenant James, head of the employees in 
the quartermaster, arrived, and told him that he and several others had 
committed the crimes of robbery and theft in the premises of the quartermaster; 
that the bag exhibit A was placed by Venancio Antonio on the bicycle of the 
accused after filling it up with some scattered chewing gums, chocolate bars and 
other things that were found by him in the premises of the quartermaster; that 
Venancio Antonio, not knowing what had become of the appellant because the 
former left the quartermaster for not having been paid his salary, discovered 
when he visited the accused that the latter was being prosecuted for theft due 
to that bag which he had placed on the bicycle of the accused, and so willingly 
testified before the court on this matter.</p>
<p>Appellant's brief raises six errors supposedly committed by the trial court 
which in our opinion may be reduced to the following proposition: Whether or not 
the appellant was proved guilty of the crime charged beyond reasonable 
doubt.</p>
<p>In the course of the presentation of the evidence for the defense, Venancio 
Antonio was introduced as a witness, who strongly corroborated appellant's 
testimony. He declared that he had a quarrel or fight with the appellant in the 
evening of April 15, 1945, and that as a result thereof he wanted to get even 
with him and decided to put the contents of the bag Exhibit A and the bag itself 
on the carrier of appellant's bicycle, unsuspecting that appellant would be 
seriously affected by the deed and would result in his prosecution for theft. 
This act of Venancio Antonio was probably conceived by him due to the prevailing 
condition during that time in the warehouse in question wherein, in view of the 
numerous robberies and thefts being committed, the people or employees who were 
carrying any kind of bundle were examined and searched at the exit by the guard 
purposely posted there to remedy the situation. This practice of the guard being 
known to the accused (pp. 5O-51, 79, t. s. n.), it was most natural for him not 
to take any package or bundle containing stolen goods from the quartermaster 
warehouse, because it was logical for him to presume that he would be searched 
at the gate when he went out, similarly to other people or employees who were 
going out of the premises. If he were really aware of the fact that he had 
committed said crime of theft and that he was carrying with him the <em>corpus 
delicti</em> in the bag Exhibit A on the carrier of his bicycle, he would not 
have attempted to go through that gate with that incriminating evidence against 
him, knowing as he did that every person was searched as he went out. The 
appellant, it stands to reason, would not have exposed himself to becoming a 
sure victim of the stolen goods that he had in his possession. Under the 
circumstances it is not hard to believe that, there having been an ill feeling 
between the appellant and Venancio Antonio, it was very probable that the latter 
might have planted it, as in fact he so testified before the trial court and 
corroborated the accused on this point, which testimony was not in any way 
rebutted by the prosecution although there were other persons present cited by 
Venancio Antonio (pp. 35, 36, t. s. n.).</p>
<p>It is alleged that the testimony of Venancio Antonio and that of the 
appellant suffer from some inconsistencies which render the testimony of the 
former unbelievable and that said Venancio did not appear on the payroll of the 
employees of the warehouse in question. The alleged inconsistencies are not 
serious in nature. Moreover we should not expect the testimony of every person 
to be identical and coinciding with each other. It is enough that the principal 
points, covered by their testimonies are established although they do not 
dovetail in all the detailsâ€”which would even prove well-rehearsed and studied 
declarations. The fact that many employees were not noted on the payroll was 
also established in this case. And even the name of the appellant himself was 
only written in ink in one of the payrolls, which goes to show that many of the 
employees there were not regularly carried on the payroll.</p>
<p>Another circumstance which to our mind strengthens the position of the 
appellant is that he was an intelligent person and a college student, and it 
seems reasonable to expect that he would not be so stupid as to commit the crime 
in the manner attributed to him by the prosecution.</p>
<p>One more significant circumstance that should not escape our attention is 
that one lent testified that in the evening of April 16, as one of the guards of 
the warehouse, he actually saw the appellant take away surreptitiously the 
stolen goods and place them in the bag Exhibit A, and that he reported what he 
had seen to Sergeant Brown, another witness for the prosecution. But if what he 
testified was true, why is it that he was not presented as a witness for the 
prosecution since the beginning in the municipal court where this case was 
originally heard? And why is it that the trial judge, in his decision, did not 
even mention the name of this witness the most pertinent facts declared by him 
in the trial? Was it because he believed that the accused was being 
"persecuted"?</p>
<p>Finally, when the appellant was told to go to the office by the guard, 
believing that he was to get his rations, he met there Corporal Lovensky and was 
shown by Sergeant Brown a big bag, bigger than that which was made an exhibit in 
this case, and was informed that it was found on the carrier of his bicycle. 
Corporal Lovensky then began typing something which was probably an affidavit to 
be subscribed by the accused. That affidavit which is supposed to be one of the 
strongest proofs against the accused does not appear to have been introduced in 
this case â€” which leads us to another significant circumstance: Was the purpose 
of preparing that affidavit to establish something that the accused committed 
such and such acts but that the accused repudiated the same, or was that 
affidavit prepared for the purpose of having it subscribed by the persons who 
were supposed to have been present on that occasion of the discovery of the 
<em>corpus delicti</em> but that the witnesses or individuals expected to 
testify thereon refused to "persecute" the appellant herein?</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the guilt of the 
appellant has not been proved beyond peradventure of doubt. The judgment of 
conviction is accordingly reversed and the appellant acquitted, with costs 
<em>de oficio</em>. So ordered.</p>
