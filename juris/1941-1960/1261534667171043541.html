				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> On April 4, 1955, Priscilla Durang-Parang Jimenez filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a petition for the adoption of her natural child Marietta Durang-Parang, a minor 11&nbsp; years old.&nbsp; The petitioner has no legitimate, legitimated,&nbsp; acknowledged natural children or natural children by legal fiction, and the only child she has is the minor Marietta Durang-Parang who was reared and cared for by her since childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner is married and her husband gave his consent to the&nbsp; adoption of the minor. <br>&nbsp;<br>On September 13, 1955, the Solicitor General intervened in the case and filed a&nbsp; motion to dismiss the petition "on the ground that the child sought to be adopted was enjoy&nbsp; ing the status&nbsp; of an acknowledged natural child as the petitioner so stated in paragraph 5 of the petition and her adoption would&nbsp; constitute a violation of paragraph 1 of Article 355 of the New&nbsp; Civil Code and is repugnant to the philosophy underlying the provisions of law on&nbsp; adoption. The petitioner opposed&nbsp; the motion to dismiss contending: (1) that petitioner's allegation in paragraph&nbsp; 5 of her petition to the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; she has reared and cared for the aforementioned minor since she was&nbsp; begotten up to the present does not vest on the child the status of an acknowledged&nbsp; natural child; and (2) that Article&nbsp; 335, paragraph 1, contemplates a prohibition&nbsp; to those who&nbsp; already have children as therein mentioned from adopting another.&nbsp; No action was taken by the court on the motion to dismiss but the case Was later on heard on the merits and the petition was subsequently granted.&nbsp; Thereupon, the Solicitor General perfected his appeal and thus the case was brought to this Court. <br>&nbsp;<br>The facts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case are&nbsp; not&nbsp; disputed. <br>&nbsp;<br>The appellant contends:&nbsp; (a.)&nbsp; that Article 335, paragraph X, provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; those&nbsp; who&nbsp; have legitimate, legitimated, acknowledged natural children er natural children by legal fiction can no longer adopt;&nbsp; (b) that "it does not provide for an exception where the adopting parent seeks to adopt his own acknowledged natural child and because paragraph 5 of the&nbsp; petition is a recognition by the&nbsp; petitioner of her minor child as her&nbsp; natural child, she cannot apply for the adoption of said minor"; (c) that "the natural&nbsp; child that can be adopted is one that has not been&nbsp; acknowledged by the parent desiring to adopt it, for where the child has been acknowledged, there is&nbsp; already established a natural relationship of paternity and filiation between&nbsp; the parent and the child, the child has successional rights,&nbsp; and&nbsp; adoption in such case is not only unnecessary but also untenable in the realm of theory and principle"; and (d)&nbsp; the minor in question cannot be adopted by the petitioner because she has already a natural child who&nbsp; is the minor whom she desires to&nbsp; adopt,&nbsp; and&nbsp; consequently the provisions of paragraph 1, Article 335,&nbsp; cited above, should govern the case. <br><br>Carefully considered, the foregoing contentions are completely untenable.&nbsp; The petitioner herein has only one child, the one she wants to adopt; she has no legitimate, legitimated, acknowledged natural children or natural children by&nbsp; legal&nbsp; fiction; hence paragraph 1 of Article 335 of the New Civil Code would not apply, for it&nbsp; clearly refers to persons who have legitimate,&nbsp; legitimated,&nbsp; acknowledged natural children or&nbsp; natural&nbsp; children by&nbsp; legal fiction and yet desire to adopt another.&nbsp; On the other hand, paragraph 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 338,&nbsp; in an unmistakable&nbsp; language, clearly provides that&nbsp; the natural child may be&nbsp; adopted by the natural father&nbsp; or mother in order to allow the parents to make amends for the wrong&nbsp; done to the child and to raise the latter&nbsp; to the&nbsp; status of&nbsp; a legitimate child. <br><br>Anent appellant's contention&nbsp; that parents cannot adopt an&nbsp; acknowledged natural child because the latter has already&nbsp; successional. rights, we find it squarely disposed of by&nbsp; the clear provisions of&nbsp; the aforesaid&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 1, Article 338 of&nbsp; the Civil Code&nbsp; and' the underlying reasons which prompted its promulgation.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding&nbsp; no error&nbsp; in the&nbsp; decision appealed from, the same is hereby&nbsp; affirmed without&nbsp; costs. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L</i>., and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur. </div>
