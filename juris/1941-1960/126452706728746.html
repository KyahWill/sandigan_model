				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First instance of Laguna, convicting the herein appellants, Aquilino Niem,  Filemon Niem, Benito Niem, and Jose Buenafe, of the crime of robbery in band committed  in an uninhabited  place  and sentencing them to the indeterminate penalty  ranging from two  years and four months of <em>prision correccional</em> to seven years, ten months and twenty-one days of <em>prision  mayor</em>; to  indemnify the offended parties, Toribio Quiogue and Genaro Gelitia, jointly and severally, in the respective sums of F89 and P27.41, without subsidiary imprisonment in case  of insolvency; and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>In the sitio of  Balanoy, barrio of Mabacan, municipality of Calauan, Province of Laguna, along  an uninhabited railroad truck, Toribio Quiogue and Genaro Gelitia were held up at about noon of January 18, 1945, by four waylaying men, three of whom were armed  with revolvers and one with a knife.  At the subsequent investigation conducted by Constabulary  Sergeant Julian Artillaga,  Genaro Gelitia easily identified the herein appellants, among many persons shown to him, as the four individuals who robbed him and his companion, Toribio Quiogue, of their clothes and other personal belongings worth F116.41; and in the search made in the house of Aquilino Niem with whom the other appellants lived, the belt buckle  (Exhibit C) and the pandan bag (Exhibit D) taken  away  by'the appellants, were recovered.</p>
<p>More  specifically, Genaro  Gelitia testified  in  positive terms that he was  confronted and ordered to undress by Benito Niem and Jose Buenafe, the latter holding a revolver and  the former a knife,  and  that,  in  the meantime, Filemon  Niem poked his revolver at Toribio Quiogue's  side while Aquilino Niem acted as guard holding a revolver. Although Toribio Quiogue was also able to identify Filemon Niem,  he was frank enough to admit that he could not recognize the other three.</p>
<p>The appellants were rightly convicted.  The defense of <em>alibi</em> vigorously set up by their counsel is not convincing. It cannot prevail over  the  positive testimony of the offended parties, particularly in the absence of any  showing that they had any  motive for implicating the appellants, coupled with the recovery of the belt buckle and the pandan bag from appellants' house.   Moreover,  as the plantation where the appellants are alleged to have  been  working on the day in question is only about six hundred  yards away from the scene of the crime, it was not impossible for them to leave  their place of honest work momentarily in order to attend to the unlawful hold-up business which, though seemingly lucrative, never pays in the long run.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellants is suspicious about the ability of Genaro Gelitia in identifying  the  appellants who,  according to the very evidence for the prosecution,  had effected the robbery within the  brief  period of two minutes, especially in view of the failure  of Toribio Quiogue to recognize three of the appellants.  We  have, however, every reason to suppose that Genaro Gelitia spoke the truth not only because he appears to have  no motive in testifying falsely but because we find corroboration in the discovery in appellant's house of two of the articles  robbed.  Upon the other hand, the candid admission of Toribio Quiogue that he could identify only Filemon Niem, far from being a detracting circumstance, serves to make the evidence for the prosecution more truthful and persuasive.  Indeed, Toribio's failure to recognize all the appellants may be due to his inferior perceptive power or to the fact that he was not in so good a position as to view all the  appellants well enough to be remembered for some time.</p>
<p>We cannot accept appellants' speculative  contention that the initials  "G. G." appearing on the belt buckle was a probable fabrication  and that Genaro  Gelitia, being  illiterate,  could, not have  read said initials.  Said buckle had been positively identified by its  owner  and it  is not unusual for even an  illiterate to recognize his property by any familiar distinguishing mark.</p>
<p>Contrary  to  appellants' allegation, there  is satisfactory proof that all the appellants were armed and  the articles specified in the information had really been taken away by them.   The fact that only the knife (Exhibit A), the belt buckle  (Exhibit C), and the pandan bag (Exhibit D) had been produced before the court  does  not  prove any  deficiency in the evidence for the prosecution  regarding the <em>corpus  delicti</em>, but  merely indicates the speed  with which the appellants were  able to  conceal  or dispose of  their weapons and the other articles robbed.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment will therefore be, as the  same is hereby, affirmed, with the sole modification in conformity with  the  recommendation  of  the  Solicitor General, that the minimum of the indeterminate penalty imposed upon the appellants is reduced to six months of arresto mayor.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Jaranilla, Feria,  Pablo</em>, and <em>Briones, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
