				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>A document (Exhibit B), purporting to be a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale of a 
fishpond situated in the barrio of Marulaw, municipality of Hagonoy, Bulacan, is 
assailed by the petitioners on the ground that it does not reflect the true 
agree ment between the parties: antichresis. The respondent invokes the letter 
of the contract. Petitioners' theory was sustained by the Court of First 
Instance of Bulacan where in this case was commenced. The Court of Appeals, 
however, rendered a decision of reversal. Appealing by way of certiorari, the 
petitioners in the main argue that Exhibit B should be held effective only as an 
equitable mortgage. The next following six paragraphs, taken ver batim from the 
decision of the Court of Appeals, contain the basic findings of fact. </p>
<p>(1) On December 4, 1928, the spouses Laureano Marquez and Eusebia Capiral 
leased to defendant Vicente Valencia, by the document Exhibit A, the herein 
mentioned fishpond for a period of ten years, expiring December 31, 1938. The 
stipulated yearly rental was P1,000, payable every month of January. Valencia 
held the fishpond and paid the rents for the years 1929, 1930 and 1931. 
According to plaintiffs, Valencia could make a net profit of P2,000 every 
year.</p>
<p>(2) Before July, 1931, Laureano Marquez had a litigation with Fortunato 
Santiago, and to settle it, he got that month seven thousand pesos (P7,000) from 
Vicente Valencia who did not want to give it "unless Laureano Marquez signed the 
document Exhibit E." Although Marquez actually received the amount of P7,000 
only, the document Exhibit B listed the, sum of P11,290 as purchase and 
repurchase price in accordance with the items written by Vicente Valencia in 
Exhibit C, as follows: </p>

<p>(3) Vicente Valencia admitted having written Exhibit C, and explaining the 
item of P8,470 said "the amount of P7,000, the capital, corresponds to the 
amount received by Mr. Marquez, at 10 per cent rate of interest per year 
compound edly, that sums P700 for the first year and 1,400 for two years. Now 
the P700 at 10 per cent again, that is 10 per cent of P700 gives P70. That, in 
all, makes P1,470. Summing up, the total becomes P8,470." (Page 27, t. s. n.) He 
added that he had paid P1,000 in January, 1931, as rent, and inasmuch as in 
July, 1931, he ceased being a lessee (he became purchaser), the amount of P500 
was due to him for reimbursement—that accounts for the P500 in Exhibit C.</p>
<p>(4) As to the amount of P2,000, he declared that it represented the value of 
the improvements he had made on the fishpond, as lessee, during the years 
previous, to 1931, which improvement he would necessarily lose upon repurchase 
by plaintiffs. Plaintiff Marquez had to agree that the P2,000 represented 
"mejoras," although he implicitly asserted, without corroboration,, that it 
represents the "mejoras" which the defendant had agreed to build on the 
land.</p>
<p>(5) It appears that on the same day when Exhibit B was executed, Laureano 
Marquez and companion signed Exhibit D, * * *.</p>
<p>(6) Defendant explained that under this exhibit, if plaintiff, upon 
repurchase, should. execute another lease in his favor, he would allow them, to 
repay, only P8.790, thereby waiving the indemnities.he would otherwise charge, 
them (a) for the improvements he had made (P2,000)— which he would again enjoy 
under the lease—and (b) the P500 for the unexpired five months of his lease.</p>
<p>Limiting our curiosity within the narrow confines of the foregoing narration 
of facts, we find petitioner Laureano Marquez in urgent need of P7,000 in order 
to settle a litigation with Fortunato Santiago, and respondent Vicente Valencia 
unwilling to give that amount <em>unless Laureano Marquez signed the document 
Exhibit B.</em> What could he do? "The distress for money under which he then 
was, places him in the same condition as other borrowers, in numerous cases 
reported in the books, who have submitted tc the dictation of the lender under 
the pressure of their wants; * * *. Necessitous men are not, truly speaking, 
free men; but, to answer a present emergency, will submit to any terms that the 
crafty may impose upon them." (Villa vs. Santiago, 38 Phil., 157, 164.)</p>
<p>Now, it is easy to understand (a) why the petitioners were required to pay 
the land taxes; (b) why they were charged compound interest at the rate of ten 
per cent; (c) why they received only P7,000, when the alleged purchase and 
repurchase price was P11,290; (d) why the amount actually received by the 
petitioners coincided with the total rental for the unexpired term of the lease, 
Exhibit A; (e) why the respondent Vicente Valencia spoke of "the amount of 
P7,000, the capital;" and (f) why the sum actually received by the petitioners, 
or even the alleged-purchase and repurchase price of P11,290, was much below the 
assessed value.</p>
<p>Of course, neither the payment by the vendor of the land tax, interest, or 
other additional charges, nor any of the circumstances above enumerated, taken 
singly, will preclude the existence of a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale; and 
stipulations essentially not germane to a sale may be legally or morally 
acceptable. In this particular case, however, the collective weight of such 
considerations, in our opinion, sufficiently reveals the intention of the 
parties to enter into a loan agreement with security, that is, an equitable 
mortgage. "While it is true that the contracting parties, may establish any 
agreements, terms and conditions they may deem advisable, provided they are not 
contrary to law, morals, or public order (article 1255, Civil Code), the 
validity of these agreements is one thing, and the juridical qualification of 
the contract resulting therefrom is very distinctly another." (Aquino vs. Deala, 
63 Phil., 582.)</p>
<p>In further elaboration, we may state that, in spite of the terms of Exhibit B 
(in which, according to the Court of .Appeals, "there is surely no ambiguity nor 
uncertainty"), the respondent frankly admitted that the amount of P7,000 was the 
capital and the sum of P1,470 the total compound interest for two years. Such 
admission is clearly descriptive of a loan, rather than of a sale.</p>
<p>The fishpond contains an area of more than 29 hectares and, on the date of 
Exhibit B, was admittedly assessed at P18,260. With this as a basis, and 
considering that the petitioners were receiving a yearly rental of P1,000, it is 
believed that the sum of P7,000 actually received by them— the very amount that 
would have been realized by the petitioners under the unexpired term of the 
lease Exhibit A—was too inadequate a consideration. While the purchase and 
repurchase price is alleged to be P11,290, an owner will naturally look only to 
actual cash values. Indeed, even the respondent concerned himself with the 
interest on P7,000, and not on Pll-,290. While it may be a fact, also, that the 
guardian of one of the petitioners- had admitted in a sworn motion filed in 
civil case No. 3785 that he "could not secure better conditions," it should be 
remembered that it was part of a course of action he had to pursue in order to 
extricate himself from a predicament. It may be argued that, generally, a person 
sells his property in view of some sort of necessity, but in all such, cases the 
nature of the transaction is always made, clear and unmistakable not only by 
their terms and incidents but by the subsequent conduct of the parties.</p>
<p>The payment by the petitioners of the land tax, a usual burden attached to 
ownership, helps in showing that the intended deal was a loan; otherwise, there 
seems to be no fairness in requiring the vendors, who have ceased to be owners, 
to still pay the same. At any rate, the arrangement (even if legally 
permissible) emphasizes the extent to which the petitioners "have submitted to 
the dictation of the lender under the pressure of their wants;" for, while the 
petitioners were strict and careful enough to require, in the lease, Exhibit A, 
the respondent (the lessee) to pay the land tax, they had become so meek and 
accommodating as to assume that obligation under Exhibit B.</p>
<p>The supposition of the Court of Appeals that the respondent could not have 
preferred the loan to his more advantageous lease, Exhibit A, is plausible only 
if the loan is said to be antichretic, and not, as justified by the facts found 
by the said court, simply an equitable mortgage under which the respondent 
enjoyed the possession of the fish-pond, in addition to interest and other 
indemnities to be paid by the petitioners.</p>
<p>There is no merit in the contention that the petitioners have adopted a 
change of theory on appeal. Although the petitioners' complaint in the Court of 
First Instance alleges a case of antichresis, there is no fundamental difference 
between that'contract and an equitable mortgage, in so far as the principal 
subject matter is concerned, namely, a loan.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the present decision is predicated solely on facts 
appearing in the judgment of the Court of Appeals, although the conclusion we 
have drawn therefrom was reached upon arguments overlooked or otherwise 
erroneously rejected by said court. "* * * The change of emphasis from one phase 
of the case as presented by one set of facts to another phase macle prominent by 
another set of, facts, all of which facts were received in evidence without 
dbj.eetion as clearly pertinent to the issues framed by the parties in their 
pleadings, does not result in a change of theory, and particularly not where the 
two sets of facts are so closely related both as to time and nature1 that they 
are to all intents and purposes inseparable.'" (Limpangco Sons vs. Yangco 
Steamship Co., 34 Phil., 597, 608.)</p>
<p>It is, therefore, our judgment that the petitioners should be held liable for 
the payment to the respondent of the sum of P7,000. Under the facts found by the 
Court of Appeals, we are not justified in concluding that the respondent is 
guilty of usury or answerable for the products of the fishpond. The most that 
can be done, on equitable grounds, is to consider the stipulations regarding 
interest and other indemnities imposed upon the petitioners, as offset and 
satisfied by the income obtained by the respondent during the period of his 
possession.</p>
<p>The decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and the petitioners 
sentenced to pay P7,000 to the respondent, who shall be entitled to remain in 
possession of the fishpond in question until the said amount is fully paid. So 
ordered, without costs.</p><em>Perfecto, Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason JJ.</em>,

<p><strong>HlLADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Up to the time of voting and even till the present I had been, and still am, 
of opinion that, considering that the decision sought to be reviewed was 
rendered by the "Court of Appeals of Central Luzon" of the "Republic of the 
Philippines" on April 29, 1944, and said decision having been appealed to the 
Supreme Court of the said "Republic/' which was not this Court, the case has not 
been appealed to this Court of the genuine Republic of the Philippines. However, 
at the voting there would have been a deadlock if I had refused to go into the 
merits. And in order to break that deadlock I have consented to vote on the 
merits, having also participated in the consideration of the questions involved 
in the case during the deliberation. In doing so," I voted with my brethren who 
have signed the majority opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Paras, in which 
opinion, without abandoning my stand on the legal question above indicated, I 
concur.</p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.,</strong> conforme:</p>
<p>Es a todas luces evidente que el contrato de que se trata no es venta con 
<em>pacto de retro</em>, sino prestamo con garantia (<em>equitable 
mortgage</em>). Y para arribar a esta conclusion no es necesario, como se afirma 
en la disidencia, revisar las apreciaciones de hecho establecidas en la 
sentencia del Tribunal de Apelacion, cosa que desde luego no podemos hacer. Sin 
apavtarse ni en lo mas minimo de dichas apreciaciones, tal conclusion es 
forzosa. Es mas: me basta con un solo hecho admitido y establecitlo en la 
sentencia apelada pai'a considerar el contrato como prestamo no venta con 
<em>pacto de retro</em>. Ese hecho es el pago de intereses sobre el capital, y 
no como quiera sino hasta intereses compuestos. El pago, de intereses es la 
caracteristica distintiva por excelencia del prestamo y es absolutamente 
incompatible en esta jurisdiccion con el concepto de la venta con <em>pacto de 
retro</em>. Notese que Valencia, el supuesto comprador a retro, al interpretar 
el Exhibit C en donde se computan los intereses, habla de capital y no de 
<em>precio.</em> Se dice <em>capital</em> cuando se trata de un prestamo; precio 
cuando es una venta. Esto tanto en el lenguaje vulgar como en el juridico.</p>
<p>Un comentario de Manresa ha dado lugar a cierta confusion, haciendo creer al 
Tribunal de Apelacion y a algunos miembros de esta Corte que el cobro de 
intereses es compatible con la riocion dela venta-con <em>pacto de retro</em>. ' 
Pero aparte de que el comentario no esta apuntalado por ninguna sentencia del 
Tribunal Supremo de Espana, mi contestacion al argumento esque en esta 
Jurisdiction—en Filipinas—tencmos sobre el particular una' jurisprudencia 
propia, formada al calor e influjo de fenomenos y ciramstancias locales. Esa 
jurisprudencia se ha ido desenvolviendo poco a poco sobre un fondo 
economico-social en que la usura, con sus diversas formas de expoliacion, ha 
en-contrado una aliada eficaz, un instrumento ductil en la modalidad juiridica 
llamada venta, con <em>pacto de retro</em>. Ya abiertamcnte.ya de un modo 
encubierto, bajo la formalidail de un contrato accesorio de arrendamiento en que 
ios intereses exorbitantes se disimulan aguisa de alquileros, la venta con 
<em>pacto de retro</em> ha sido por mucho tiempo casi el unico instrumento de 
credito conocido en nuestros pueblos.</p>
<p>Asi que en esta jurisdiccion nunca se ha mirado con favor la venta con 
<em>pacto de retro</em>. El meollo, el <em>leit-motif</em> de la doctrina ha 
sido el siguiente: en el curso de una larga serie de. decisiones, siempre que la 
terminologsa del contrato ha sido ambigua, o alguna circunstancia hiciese dudosa 
la intencion de las partes, esta Corte ha dictaminado invariablemente en el 
sentido de optar por el contrato de condiciones menos onerosas, esto es, el 
prestamo simple, o lo mas, el prestamo con garantia (<em>equitable 
mortgage</em>). Y el cobro de intereses es, en sentir de esta Corte, una de las 
caracteristicas mas distintivas del prestamo. No se puede citar una sola 
sentencia de. esta Corte en que el cobro de intereses se haya declarado 
compatible con el concepto de la venta con <em>pacto de retro</em>. Por eso que 
cualquiera que sea la validez y fuerza del comentario de Manresa en Espana 
(repito que no se ha citado en su apoyo ninguna sentencia del Tribunal Supremo 
de aquel pafs), es indudable que no puede prevalecer aqui donde una doctrina 
contraria de firmes lineamientos hace innecesario el acudir a fuentes de derecho 
extranjeras.</p>Ademas, la equidad gravita fueilemcnte por el lado de los 
apelantes. El apelado ha estado poseyendo y disfrutando dela finca hace 18 anos, 
ganando P2,000 al ano, segun la sentencia apelada. Esta. ganancia es mucho mas 
de lo que el apelado hubiese cobrado en intereses, aun a razon de 12 por ciento 
al ano. Habiendo ganado P36,000 hasta ahora, ya ha recobrado cinco veces su 
capital de P7,000. Mal puede quejarse, pues, cuando en nuestra sentencia todavia 
se le permite recobrar este capital, y aun quedarse con la finca si los 
apelantes no tuyiesen o. no encontrasen P7,000 para el rescate. <br><br><br>

<p>The decision of the Court of Appeals, reversed by this Court, is as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On July 27, 1931, Laureano Marquez, Eusebia Capiral and Marcelino Marquez, 
as guardian of Patrocinio Marquez, notarized the 'Vcnta con <em>Pacto de 
Retro</em>' (Exhibit B) whereby, for the sum of P11,290, receipt whereof they 
acknowledged, they sold a fishery in the barrio of Marulaw, municipality of 
Hagonoy, to defendant Vicente Valencia, reserving, however, the right to 
repurchase the same within,two years, for the same amount. The vendors failed to 
exercise the covenanted right of redemption.</p>
<p>"However, on May 28, 1936, Laureano Marquez, in behalf of himself and of his 
co-signers, filed a complaint, alleging that their contract1 with defendant, 
Exhibit B, was in effect a usurious loan, and not a. pacto-de-retro sale; that 
defendant had already been repaid with the products of the fishpond, which 
should now be returned to them after appropriate accounting.'</p>
<p>"Defendant denied complainants' allegation and averred the bargain was a 
veritable pacto-de-retro sale.</p>
<p>"The Court of First Instance of ¦Bnlacan heard the evidence and ihe parties, 
and rendered judgment holding that the document Exhibit B represented an 
antichr.csis agreement. <br>Consequently, it ordered, 'al demantidado a que 
pague a los demandantes la suma de P9,000, mas la cantidad de P2,000 cada afio 
desde la fecha del contrato Exhibit B hasta que la pesqueria en cuestion es 
entregada por demandado a los demandantes; * * * que entregue <br>a los 
demandantes la pesqueria en cuestion-y a pagar las costas del juicio.'</p>
<p>"Defendant appealed.</p>
<p>"On December 4, 1928, the spouses Laureano Marquez and Eusc-bia Capiral 
leased to defendant Vicente Valencia, by the document Exhibit A, the 
hereinmentioned fishpond for a period of ten years, expiring'. December .31, 
1938. The stipulated yearly rental was P1,000, payable every month of January. 
Valencia held the fishpond and paid the rents for the years 1929, 1930 and 1931. 
According to plaintiffs, Valencia could make n net profit of P2,000 every 
year.</p>
<p>"Before July, 1931, Laureano Marquez had a litigation with Fortunato 
Santiago, and to settle it, he got that month seven thousand pesos (P7,000) from 
Vicente Valencia, who did not want to give it unless Laureano Marquez signed the 
document Exhibit B Although Marquez actually received the amount of P7,000 only, 
the document Exhibit B listed the sum of P11,290 as purchase and repurchase 
price in accordance with the items written by Vicente Valencia in Exhibit C, as 
follows:</p>

<p>"Laureano Marquez, declaring: in this case, avers that Exhibit B was not the 
true contract he had made with Vicente Valencia, who promised by a gentleman's 
agreement not to carry it out; and without actually using the word 'loan' or 
'antichresis,' he spoke of P7,000 as the 'capital' earning more than 10 per cent 
interest.</p>
<p>"The trial court, seeing that interest was charged for two years,' that 
vendors had to pay real estate taxes and that the price was inadequate, 
concluded that the transaction was a usurious antichresis loan and made the 
order appealed from.</p>
<p>"Vicente Valencia admitted having written Exhibit B, and explaining the item 
of P8,470 said 'the amount of P7,000, the capital corresponds to the amount 
received by Mr. Marquez at 10 per cent rate of interest per year compoundedly, 
that sum P700 gives P70 at 10 per cent again, that is 10 per cent of P700 gives 
P70. That, in all makes. P1,470. Summing up, the total becomes P8,470. (P. 27, 
t. s. n.) Ho added that ho had paid P1,000 in January, 1931, as rent, and 
inasmuch as in July, 1931, he ceased being a lessee (he became purchaser), the 
amount of P500 was due to him for reimbursement— that accounts for the P500 in 
Exhibit C.</p>
<p>"As to the amount of P2,000, he declared that it represented th'e vaiuc of 
the improvements he had made on the fishpond, as lessee, during, the years, 
previous to 1931, which improvement he would necessarily lose upon repurchase by 
plaintiffs. Plaintiff Marquez had to agree that the P2,000 represented 
'mejoras,' although he im-plicity asserted, without corroboration, that it 
represents the mejoras which the defendant had agreed to build an the land.</p>
<p>"It appears that on the same day when Exhibit B was executed, Laureano 
Marquez and companion signed. Exhibit D, the pertinent provisions of which read 
as follows:</p>
<p>"Por cuanto en esta misma fecha se ha otorgado una escritura de venta con 
<em>pacto de retro</em> por Laureano Marquez, Eusebia Capiral * * * a favor del

reservado en la escritura arriba mencionada dentro del plaro estipuiado y 
otorgaremos simuitaneamente otra escritura de arrendamiento a favor del Dr.

Entendiendose, ademas, que si nosotros optaramos para no otorgar el contrato de

suma de ONCE MIL DOSCIONTOS NOVENTA PESOS (P11,290) tal como se dispone en la 
escritura de venta con <em>pacto de retro</em> arriba mencionada.'</p>
<p>"Defendant explained that under this exhibit, if plaintiff, upon repurchase, 
should execute another lease i.h his fa,vor, Ire would allow them to repay only 
P8,790, thereby waiving the indemnities he.would otherwise charge them (a) for 
the improvements he had made (P2,000)—which he would again enjoy under the 
lease—and (b) the, P500 for the unexpired five months of his lease.</p>
<p>"It has Song; been established in this jurisdiction that a written document 
of pacto-de-retro sale may be shown to be a mortgage by oral evidence (Rodriguez 
vs. Pamintuan and De Jesus, 37 Phil., 876; Villa vs. Santiago, 32 Phil., 157). 
But in every case where courts uphold such showing they have done so cither 
because the terms of the document were ambiguous, or because the circumstances 
surrounding its execution or performance were incompatible or inconsistent with 
the theory that a conventional redemption was intended by the parties. 
(Tolentino and Manio vs. Gonzalez Sy Chiam, 50 Phil., 558.) And the oral 
evidence must be 'clear and convincing,' if it is to overcome the presumption of 
validity and genuineness which attaches to a public document. (Aside, vs. 
Guzman, 37 Phil., 652; Masong-song vs. Kalaw, 55 Phil., 787.)</p>
<p>"There is surely no ambiguity nor uncertainty in the writing Exhibit B, and 
the supplementary agreement Exhibit D. The first contains all the essential 
stipulations of conventional redemption which the conduct of the parties tend to 
corroborate; the purchaser took the property into his possession; for five years 
after the contract, plaintiff made no move to reform the deed; upon the 
expiration of the redemption period, Vicente Valencia consolidated his ownership 
and inscribed the property in the tax record in his own name; Laureano Marquez 
and Marcelino Marquez in a motion which they filed in civil case No. 3785, 
declared under oath that this transaction was a venta con <em>pacto de 
retro</em>, and that Valencia's terms were the most advantageous.</p>
<p>"In weighing the oral evidence of both sides, we notice firstly that only 
Laurcano Marquez testified for the plaintiffs and only Vicente Valencia declared 
in opposition. Marquez was imccrtain in his statements, and inconsistent with 
his theory. The complaint which he knew and ratified, said that P1,970 was the 
amount of 'interest'; at the trial he swore it was 10 per cent over the capital 
(P1,400). Then instead, of the loan of P7,000 which he impliedly said he 
obtained from Valencia, he admitted in answer to subsequent questions that the 
amount was 'advanced rentals' under the lease contract. His memory does not seem 
to be very good. He could not well account for the P500 item—for which Valencia 
had given a truly logical explanation. His cross-examination was 
significant:</p>
<p>"Q. And why did you have to return the P500 appearing- in Exhibit 0 if it did 
not correspond to interest?—A. That is always the case of a usurer, that they 
always had the interest on the unexpired time.</p>
<p>"Q. Do you mean to say that P500 mentioned in Exhibit C correspond also to 
interest which you had to pay for the P7,000?.—A. That could be possible to be 
in that way, but what I know is that I have not received that amount.</p>
<p>"Q: Are you- not positive- to what that P5O0 correspond to?—A. My previous 
declaration in regards to P500, I stand by it.</p>
<p>"Q. And what is your previous declaration?—A. T. ani -afraid might change my 
previous declaration. (Page 19, t. s. n.) </p>
<p>"On the other hand, the data in Exhibit C, and the documents of lease 
(Exhibit A), <em>pacto de retro</em> (Exhibit B) and compromise 'de dar en 
arrendamiento' (Exhibit D), all consistent with each other, reasonably bear out 
the "assertions of "Vicente Valencia that the parties had really agreed to the 
stipulations attested, to by (Exhibit B), namely, a contract whereby, for having 
received P7,000, plaintiffs Sold the fishpond to him, reserving, however, the 
right to reacquire it, for the total sum of P11,290, with the qualification that 
if they should release it to him, the redemption money could be reduced. to 
P8,790. The fact that the vendor a retro promised to pay upon repurchase, not 
only the sale price but also certain other additional charges, such as taxes 
(Lichauco vs. Berenguer, 20 Phil., 12), and even interest does not convert a. 
plain unambiguous document of <em>pacto de retro</em> sale into one of 
loan—unless, of course, such form of agreement is resorted to for the purpose of 
distinguishing truly, usurious loans. (Cf. Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. us. 
Tamaraw Plantation Co. 47 Phil., 513.) Manresa, interpreting article 1518 of the 
Civil Code, says:</p>
<p>" 'No vemos, por lo tanto, inconveniente en que se pacte que el' precio o 
mejor dicho, que la cantidad que se restituya sea mayor o menor que el precio de 
la venta (1 ultimo sera muy raro); pues tal convencion implica im pacto Hcito, 
de cuya eficacia no se nos alcanza motivo para dudav. No tendremos quiza 
entonces el <em>pacto de retro</em> quo. rlamenta el Codigo, pero tendremos 
evidenfcemente un derecho de retraer de caracter convencional y que producira 
efectos juridicos.</p>
<p>" 'Analoga consideracion se nos ocurre sobre la pregunta que mu-chos formulan 
referente a si el vendedor tendra que pagar los inte-reses del precio por el 
tiempo que lo haya tenido en su poder. El C6digo no habla de tales intereses, 
los cuales, por lo tanto, no se deben naturahnentc. Puede, sin embargo, pactarse 
su abono y en cste caso, tratandose, a nuestro juicio de un pacto de Hcito, es 
visto que el vendedor tendra que satisfacerles.1 (10 Manresa 4.a ed., pag. 
810.)</p>
<p>"In fact, Vicente Valencia could not have voluntarily consented to the 
termination of his lease, to enter upon a loan of P7.000 at interest of 10 per 
cent, as appellees' theory seems to be. Why? Because under a loan, he would be 
earning only 1*700 a year, whereas by holding the property as lessee, he could 
make P2,000 a year, according to plaintiffs; however, in a pacto-de-retro deal, 
in addition to the 10 per cent he was to receive upon repurchase, he had the 
attractive chance of owning the fishery, should Marquez and his companions 
neglect or fail to redeem.</p>
<p>"With regard to the price, there is evidence that before concluding the 
bargain with Valencia, Marquez approached several people; but could not secure 
better conditions. Indeed that is what he informed the court in the civil case 
No. 3785, in the sworn motion hereinbefore mentioned.</p>
<p>"In view of the preceding considerations, we are, at least not persuaded that 
the document Exhibit B did not represent the true intent and agreement of the 
parties. The Supreme Court's words may here be recalled:</p>
<p>"As obnoxious as contracts of pacto dc retro are, yet nevertheless, the 
courts have no right to make contracts for parties. They made their own contract 
in the present case. There is not a word, a phrase, a sentence or paragraph, 
which in the slightest way indicates that the parties to the contract in 
question did not intend to sell the property in question absolutely, simpiy with 
the right to repurchase. People who make their own beds must lie thereon." 
(Tolentino and Manio vs. Gonzalez Sy Chiam, 50 Phil., 558, 577, 578.)</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the appealed decision will.be revoked and the complaint 
dismissed. Cost in both instances against the plaintiffs. So 
ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners, the Court of Appeals 
issued the following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court has given careful attention to the appellees' motion for 
reconsideration, but is unable to reach a different conclusion.</p>
<p>"The argument that Exhibit B should be regarded as an equitable mortgage, 
because P7.000 is inadequate price for the fishpond assessed at P22,040, is 
unmeritorious; firstly, the price for which Vicente Valencia acquired the land 
was not P7,000, but F11.290, and the land was assessed at P18,260 (Exhibit F); 
secondly, the Ux assessment appears to be unreliable as a test of the land's 
actual value, because Laureano Marquez himself agreed to the sworn statement in 
Exhibit A, that Valencia's offer was the best obtainable in the market; and 
thirdly, even supposing that the assessment was a correct indication of value, 
the resulting disproportion is not so marked as to be incompatible with a real 
<em>pacto de retro</em> covenant. (See Feliciano vs. Limjuco and Calacalzado, 41 
Phil., 147 [price P500, assessed value P1,000] and Villarosa vs. Villamor, 43 
Phil., 350 [price P3,000, assessed value around P5,850].)</p>
<p>"Attempting to refute-our reasoning '.that Valencia could not htfve 
voluntarily consented to the termination of his lease to enter upon a loan of 
P7,000 with interest at 10 per cent, the appellees express the belief that this 
Court has utterly failed to consider the fact that the fishpond mentioned in 
Exhibit B, during the period of redemption was to remain, as it did remain, in 
the possession of appellant. As this Honorable Court has stated, without 
qualifications, that the fishpond in question produces an income to appellant of 
P2,000 a year, it becomes clear that for the P7,000 given by appellant to 
appellees, the former was to profit a total of P2,700 for the first year, and 
P2,770 for the second year. For besides getting the produce from the fishpond, 
in the, amount of P2,000 a year, he would still secure from appellees an 
interest of 10 per cent on P7,000 compounded annually.'</p>
<p>"There was no such oversight. Under appellees' theory of "antichretic 
loan—which we rejected on the assumption that Valencia-would not have 
voluntarily accepted a less favored' position—the products of the fishpond 
(P2,000) were to pay the 10 per cent interest and the capital. Consequently, 
there is no warrant for the assertion that under the alleged loan arrangement, 
Valencia would get 10 per cent interest plus the products (P2,000).</p>
<p>"The motion to reopen is denied."</p></blockquote>
<p>It may thus be seen from the decision of the Court of Appeals that, on the 
issue of whether the true agreement between the parties is a <em>pacto de 
retro</em> sale or merely an equitable mortgage, both direct and circumstantial 
evidence have been adduced by the parties. The direct evidence consists of 
Exhibits A, B, C, D and 2 together with the testimony of petitioner Laureano 
Marquez and respondent Vicente Valencia. The circumstantial evidence consists of 
the alleged payment of taxes and interests together with the alleged 
disproportion between, the sale price and the assessed value of the property in 
litigation. The conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the true agreement 
between the parties is a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale, is based <m all="" these="" proofs="" considered="" as="" whole.="" conclusion="" fact="" cannot="" be="" reviewed="" by="" without="" reviewing="" whole="" has="" no="" authority="" to="" review="" testimonial="" evidence="" under="" provisions="" rules="" above="" mentioned.="" because="" it="" lacks="" such="" authority,="" majority="" reverses="" decision="" court="" appeals="" on="" basis="" only="" a="" part="" evidence,="" omitting="" completely="" testimony="" of="" the="" witnesses,="" this="" is="" certainly="" illegal="" and="" unfair.=""></m></p>
<p>In cases like this, the utterances of the parties at the time of their 
negotiation leading to their written agreement, are the best evidenced And the 
testimony of witnesses directly on such utterances is of great importance and 
may-be decisive. If, as in. the instant case, the testimonial evidence, 
corroborated by public documents, is such as to persuade the Court of Appeals 
that the true agreement between the parties is a pacto dc retro sale, 
circumstances such as the payment of taxes or interests in case of repurchase, 
cannot convert the true contract into a mere equitable mortgage. There is 
nothing illegal or immoral in a vendor agreeing to reimburse upon, repurchase 
the taxes paid by the vendee, and to pay the interests which the vendee's money 
would have earned prior to the repurchase. (Lichauco vs. Berenguer, 20 Phil., 
12; 10 Manresa, 4th ed., p. 310.)</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals said: "In weighing the oral evidence of both sides, we 
notice firstly that only Laureano Marquez testified for the plaintiffs and only 
Vicente Valencia declared in opposition. Marquez was uncertain in his 
statements, and inconsistent with his theory." And the Court proceeded to show 
the uncertainty and inconsistency of Marquez' testimony and at the same time the 
veracity of Valencia's testimony which was found to be in perfect harmony with 
the documentary evidence Exhibits A, B, C and D as well as with the subsequent 
conduct of both parties.</p>
<p>According to Exhibit A, on December 4, 1928, the spouses Laureano Marquez and 
Euscbia Capiral leased to respondent Vicente Valencia the property in litigation 
for ten years expiring on December 31, 1938. The stipulated annual rent was 
P1,000 payable in advance. All improvements' made by the lessee on the property 
during the lease were to belong to the lessor upon the expiration of the 
lease-In July, 1931, Laureano Marquez had a litigation with Fortunato Santiago 
involving the same property. To settle this, litigation, Laureano Marquez needed 
the amount of P7,000 and he approached several persons to sell the property in 
order that, with the proceeds of the sale, he could pay said amount to Fortunato 
Santiago. Due .to- the uncertainty of the title to the property occasioned by 
the pending litigation with Fortunato Santiago, and, also, due to the lease 
contract in favor ol respondent which, had still. seven and a half years to run, 
the prospective buyers were. unwilling to purchase the property .under the terms 
desired by Laureano Marquez. Thus, the latter,offered to sell the fishpond with 
a right to repurchase to herein respondent. The offer was accepted and Exhibit B 
was executed. This documents is not uncertain or ambiguous.</p>
<p>On the same date and in another document, Exhibit D, the parties agreed that, 
upon, repurchase, the vendors could again lease the same property to Vicente 
Valencia, in which case the price for repurchase would be P8,790 instead of 
1*11,290; but in case they chose not to lease the property again to Valencia, 
then the price for repurchase would, remain the same, namely, f 11,290. This 
agreement, Exhibit D, confirms the <em>pacto de retro</em> sale, Exhibit B. It 
dearly cancelled lease Exhibit A, which would not have been done had the 
contract in issue been merely an antichresis or equitable mortgage. In other 
words, if the contract, Exhibit B, is merely an antichresis or equitable 
mortgage, then the agreement contained in Exhibit D would have no effect or 
purpose. It must be noted that Exhibit D is not assailed as not expressing the 
true intention of the parties.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1931, according to Exhibit At a motion, under oath, was filed 
in special proceedings No. 3785 of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, 
entitled "In re Guardianship of Minor Patrocinio Marquez," therein Lain reano 
Marquez and Marcelino Marquez prayed for the approval of the contract, Exhibit 
B, referred to specifically in said motion as ' venta con <em>pacto de 
retro</em>" and as "las mas ventajosa tanto para la menor como para sus padres." 
This motion was granted and the contract approved by the Court as a <em>pacto de 
retro</em> sale which was duly registered in the registry of deeds of 
Bulacau.</p>
<p>And now the majority says that this sworn motion deserves no credit because 
"it was a part of a course of action he (the movant.) had to pursue in order to 
extricate himself from a predicament." That such, was the reason for the motion 
is a mere assumption contrary to the findings of the Court of Appeals. After 
weighing all the evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, the Court of 
Appeals held the sworn motion to be a deliberate expression of truth taken by 
the probate court of Bulacan as ground for approving the contract in an order 
that has already become final at least as regards the movants themselves. The 
majority decision, however, in effect considers the sworn motion as a perjury, 
and, what is worse, the perjury is made one of the grounds for deciding in favor 
of the perjurers.</p>
<p>The mere fact that petitioners were very badly in need of money does not 
argue against the pacto dc retro sale. Sales are often made by needy people. The 
trouble in the instant case is that petitioners do not know what their true 
agreement is. In the Court of First Instance they said it was antichresis; but 
in the Court of Appeals they said it was an equitable mortgage.</p>
<p>Other considerations of minor importance appearing in the majority decision 
are fully answered by the Court of Appeals' decision which I believe to be in 
conformity with law.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, I vote for the affirmance of the judgment rendered by 
the Court of Appeals.</p>
