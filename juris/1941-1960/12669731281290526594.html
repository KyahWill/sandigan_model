				<H3>JUANITO N. FERRER, PETITIONER AND  APPELLEE, VS. ALFONSO TABORA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS  CITY MAYOR  OF  BAGUIO CITY, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Juanito Ferrer was&nbsp; holding&nbsp; the&nbsp; position of Assistant Civil Engineer of Baguio&nbsp; City,&nbsp; in charge of the Waterworks system, at a&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; of&nbsp; P3,720.00&nbsp; per annum, having been appointed thereto sometime in 1954. In a letter of the&nbsp; General Manager of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority, dated June 22, 1956, petitioner was authorized, in addition to&nbsp; his duties as Assistant Civil&nbsp; Engineer, to act as representative of the NAWASA, "to receive all records, properties, machinery, equipment, assets, choses&nbsp; in&nbsp; action liabilities, obligations and&nbsp; sewerage, bonds, sinking funds and all unexpended funds of such waterworks, sewerage and&nbsp; drainage&nbsp; systems, including artesian wells in the City of Baguio", under Executive&nbsp; Order No. 127,&nbsp; dated September 1955, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines.<br><br>While Ferrer was on an observation tour in the United States, the City Council of Baguio&nbsp; City, by resolution of June&nbsp; 28, 1956&nbsp; (Resolution No.&nbsp; 186, s. 1956), abolished his position,&nbsp; apparently because of&nbsp; the council's impression that&nbsp; said&nbsp; office was to be absorbed by and transferred to the National Waterworks and Sewerage&nbsp; Authority as of July 1, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; Resolution No. 188,&nbsp; passed by&nbsp; the same council on July 5,&nbsp; 1956, expressly&nbsp; excluded the position from the&nbsp; annual budget of&nbsp; the city.<br><br>On&nbsp; October 1, 1956, petitioner&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Baguio a petition&nbsp; for "Mandamus with&nbsp; Damages", docketed as Civil Case No.&nbsp; 643, wherein he&nbsp; sought,&nbsp; among&nbsp; other&nbsp; things,&nbsp; the restoration of&nbsp; his position or office by the respondents.<br><br>After&nbsp; the parties had&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; their respective evidence, the court rendered judgment on&nbsp; August 26, 1957, as follows:<br><blockquote> "Judgment is, therefore, rendered declaring&nbsp; Resolution No. 188, Series of 1956,&nbsp; illegal, and ordering Respondents&nbsp; to restore&nbsp; Petitioner to&nbsp; his position as Assistant Civil&nbsp; Engineer in the Bureau of Public Works, Office of&nbsp; the City Engineer, Baguio, as&nbsp; of July 1, 1956,&nbsp; and ordering&nbsp; Respondents further,&nbsp; jointly and severally, to pay petitioner the sum of P600.00&nbsp; by&nbsp; way of&nbsp; attorney's fees for their unjustified&nbsp; abolition&nbsp; of his position, and to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs."<br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal by the respondents.<br><br>The appeal must be dismissed, as the record shows that it&nbsp; was perfected beyond&nbsp; the fifteen-day period fixed for mandamus proceedings&nbsp; by section 17 of Rule 41.<br><br>Notice of the decision was received by appellants&nbsp; on August 27, 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September&nbsp; 11, 1957,&nbsp; that is&nbsp; to say, fifteen days after&nbsp; receipt of notice of the judgment the appellants filed a motion&nbsp; to reconsider in the following terms (Record, page 90) :<br><blockquote>"COME NOW the respondents&nbsp; in the above-entitled case, by the undersigned counsel, and to&nbsp; this&nbsp; Honorable Court respectfully allege:<br><ol> <li> That on August 26, 1957, this Honorable Court rendered a decision in the above-entitled case in favor of the petitioner and&nbsp; against the respondents;<br></li><li> That said decision is not in&nbsp; accordance with the evidence presented and&nbsp; the facts adduced&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing of this case; and<br></li><li>&nbsp;That said&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; contrary to law.<br></li></ol>Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that the aforementioned decision be c6nsidered accordingly."<br></blockquote>This motion for reconsideration did not suspend the running of the period of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; since it did not, contrary to the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 2,&nbsp; Rule 37 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, "point out&nbsp; specifically the&nbsp; findings&nbsp; or conclusions of the judgment which are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law making express reference to the testimonial&nbsp; or documentary evidence or to the provision of law alleged to&nbsp; be&nbsp; contrary to such findings or conclusions"&nbsp; (Alvero <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; De la&nbsp; Rosa, 76&nbsp; Phil., 428,&nbsp; and case cited therein).&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants cannot&nbsp; be excused from said requirement of&nbsp; the Rules, because the legality or illegality of petitioner's ouster from office was not the only question of law raised&nbsp; in the&nbsp; lower court.&nbsp; The&nbsp; issue of whether or not the&nbsp; petitioner refused to&nbsp; render services to the City of Baguio and may&nbsp; be deemed to have abandoned his&nbsp; office was&nbsp; likewise broached by the&nbsp; parties and taken up&nbsp; by the court below, and is in fact, also assigned as error&nbsp; in this&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion to reconsider was set for hearing does not determine&nbsp; whether or not it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> motion, since the&nbsp; rule clearly demands that the controverted findings be specified in&nbsp; the motion itself.<br><br>It follows that as the notice of appeal was actually filed only on September 23, 1957, twenty-seven (27) days after notice of&nbsp; judgment, the trial&nbsp; court's&nbsp; decision had been by then final&nbsp; and could no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; be&nbsp; appealed.&nbsp; Hence, this Court acquired no jurisdiction to review the decision.<br><br>Wherefore the&nbsp; appeal is dismissed,&nbsp; with costs against appellants.<br><br><i> Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,&nbsp; Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
