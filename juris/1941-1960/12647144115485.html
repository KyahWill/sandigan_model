<p>On  7  January 1955  the  Court rendered judgment,  the dispositive part of which  was  amended on 22  January 1955â€”
</p><blockquote>
  * *  * in  favor  of  the  petitioners  and against  the  respondents ordering  Franco Bibera to reinstate  the petitioners to  their respective  positions and ordering the respondents  to vacate  their places without pronouncement as to  costs.  The Court orders for the payment of the  back salaries  of  the  petitioners during the period  of their illegal separation from the service on February 21, 1954 up to the  period of their  reinstatement.<br>
  </blockquote> 
<p>The respondents have appealed.</p>
<p>The petitioner Cipriano Amora, chief of police of Bato, Leyte, a veteran but without civil  service eligibility,  was replaced by respondent Francisco Tavera who had passed the civil service examination for  patrolman  (Exhibit 4- D).   Being a civil service  eligible, respondent Tavera's appointment to replace a non-eligible temporarily occupying the  position of chief of police is valid and legal.   The fact that petitioner Amora is  a veteran  does  not  give him the status of  a civil service  eligible under Republic Act  No. 65, as amended by Republic  Act  No. 154,  and he may be removed upon  certification  of  an eligible by the  Commissioner  of  Civil Service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Likewise  the  appointment of respondent Melecio Aguilar, who had passed the  examination for  special deputy assessor and  hence a civil service eligible (Exhibit 5-D),  to the position of sergeant of police in the place  of  petitioner Conrado Matondo, a non-eligible temporarily holding the position  of sergeant of police, is  legal and valid.</p>
<p>It is argued  that in the case  of respondents Tavera and  Aguilar, their civil service eligibility already expired for their failure to obtain employment in the Government within one year after  passing  the civil service examination they had  taken.   This contention would have been sustained were it not for the fact that Republic Act No. 1079, approved on  15 June 1954,  provides that "Civil Service eligibility shall be permanent and  shall have  no time  limit;"  and  that  "This Act  shall be  retroactive  so as to include persons  whose civil  service eligibility had expired prior to its approval."</p>
<p>The fact that the respondents Tavera and Aguilar were appointed to  positions other than to those for which they had  qualified in the civil  service does not militate against their appointment,  for petitioners have pointed" out  no law that prohibits the appointment of one who had passed a civil service  examination to a position other  than that for which he had qualified, especially when the position to which  he has been appointed does not call for special knowledge or  skill.</p>
<p>The temporary appointment  of respondent Sinforiano Serdan  and Antonio Briones,  the  latter a  veteran, both without civil service eligibility, to the position  of  policeman, vice petitioners  Apolonio  Signar  and  Florentino Lovete, also without civil service  eligibility, is  legal and valid.  Appointments  made under  section  682  of the Revised  Administrative Code  as  amended  by  Commonwealth Acts Nos. 177  and 281 are temporary,  when the public interests so require and only upon  the  prior authorization of the Commissioner of  Civil Service,  not  to exceed thirty days from receipt by  the chief  of the bureau or office of the Commissioner's certification of an eligible. The temporary appointment  of  non-eligibles  to replace non-eligibles whose terms have expired is not prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The latter cannot successfully invoke the provisions  of Republic Act No. 657  as the Act guarantees  the tenure of office of provincial  guards and members of  city and municipal police who are eligibles.  Non-eligibles  do  not come under  the protection of the  Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>The replacement of the petitioners  Loreto Cinco, Apo linar Rosal and Filomeno Tablo,  all veterans but without civil service  eligibility, by respondents Antonio Red, Isabelo Remolador and Florencio Aguilar,  all without civil service eligibility, is illegal because the petitioners Cinco, Rosal and Tablo are veterans appointed within three years as provided for in Republic  Act No.  65, as amended  by Republic Act No. 154.  Although not civil service eligibles they are entitled as veterans to protection in office pending receipt by the chief of the bureau or  office of certification of, eligibles from the  Commissioner of Civil Service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  And  although the respondents Antonio Red and Florencio Aguilar are  also veterans, they cannot  be  appointed to replace veterans  who were appointed  within the period of time  as  provided, for in Republic Act  No. 60, as amended by Republic Act No. 154, and are entitled to  protection  in  office.  Moreover, the appointment  of veterans Antonio  Red  and  Florencio Aguilar on 22 February 1964 was made beyond or  outside  the  period of time  as provided for  in said Act as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>Accordingly, the appointment  of respondents Francisco Tavera as chief of police,  vice Cipriano Amora; Melecio Aguilar as sergeant of police, vice Conrado Matondo;  and Sinforiano  Serdan  and Antonio  Briones as  policemen, vice Apolonio Signar and Florentino Lovete, respectively, being  legal and valid,  the judgment appealed from insofar as it concerns them is reversed and set aside, and the petition as  to  them dismissed.  The dismissal of the petitioners  Loreto Cinco,  Apolinar Rosal and Filomeno Tablo, all policemen, and the appointment of respondents Antonio Red, Isabelo  Remolador and  Florencio  Aguilar in their place and stead being illegal, the judgment appealed from insofar  as it concerns them  is affirmed and the  respondent  Franco  Bibera, Mayor  of Bato,  Leyte, ordered to reinstate the petitioners Cinco, Rosal and Tablo. The rest of the  judgment as to those to be reinstated is affirmed.  No costs shall be taxed.</p>
