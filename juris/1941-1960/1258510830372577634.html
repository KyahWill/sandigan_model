				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review by certiorari of a decision of the
Court of Appeals. The main facts are set forth in said decision from
which we quote:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In 1953, Soledad A. Verzosa was a duly authorized
public service operator and possessor of a certificate of public
convenience issued by the Public Service Commission. She was
maintaining and operating passenger buses plying the public highways
and roads of Zambales, Bataan, Bulacan, City of Manila and suburbs; and
was doing her transportation business under the name and style of
Try-V-Tran. On September 4, 1953, Augusto Baytan, Armando Zacarias,
Rosalio Retcner, Horacio Custodio, Adoracion Custodio, Felix Angeles,
Alejandro Belleza, Simeon Jaointo, Paula Jacmto, and Dominador
Magbanua, boarded in Olongapo, Zambales, one of Verzosa's buses,
bearing plate number TPU-505 s/53 (Zambales), then being driven by
Silvino Mangliemot and bound for Manila. Upon reaching sitio Longos,
Malolos, Bulacan, the said bus collided with a freight truck which was
coming from the opposite direction, and as a result thereof, the above
named passengers suffered injuries. They were immediately taken to the
Malolos Provincial Hospital for emergency treatment, and later some of
them were brought to the National Orthopedic Hospital for further
treatment. All the injured passengers were employed by the U. S. Navy,
"with the exception of Adoracion Custodio, who was a dressmaker, Simeon
Jacinto and Paula Jacinto, who were school teachers. Aside from being
rendered unable to report for work for the duration of their treatment,
they also lost some belongings as a consequence of the collision, which
likewise destroyed two <em>carretelas</em> and injured the rig drivers
and the horses. Driver Manglicmot was charged with the crime of
'damages to property with multiple physical injuries and abortion thru
reckless imprudence' in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, where
the case was docketed as criminal case numbered 2050. Meanwhile, the
above named passengers filed a complaint with the Court of First
Instance of Manila against Soledad A. Verzosa and Silvino Manglicmot,
praying that defendants be condemned to pay, jointly and severally,
each and every one of the plaintiffs:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'(<em>a</em>)
Under the first cause of action, the sum of P250.00 (or a total of
P2,500.00), for medical attendance and drugs, plus whatever amount may
accrue thenceforth until the time of their complete recovery.</p>
    <p>'(<em>b</em>)
Under the second cause of action, the sum of P3,896.68, representing
lost of income incurred by plaintiffs up to the date of this complaint
as follows:</p>

  </blockquote>
<p>"Only defendant Verzosa registered an answer alleging that the
driver of her passenger bus exercised all the diligence of a good
father of a family, and that the collision was due to the negligence of
Leon Macabulos, who was then driving cargo truck bearing plate number
T-700 s/53 (Pampanga), belonging to Pablo Narciso, both of whom are the
ones responsible for the damages sustained by plaintiffs. Verzosa
consequently prayed for the dismissal of this case. Upon plaintiffs'
motion, defendant Manglicmot was declared in default on January 25,
1954.</p>
 <p>"The issues thus joined, several hearings were held, after which the  Court below rendered judgment  ordering defendants:</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>'(a)
To pay the herein plaintiffs the sum of P2,500.00 for medical
attendance and drugs spent by them for their complete recovery; (b) the
sum of P3,896.68 representing the lost income on which the herein
plaintiffs have failed to receive from the time of the accident to the
date of the filing of this complaint; (c) the sura of P1,691.00 which
was the value of the personal belongings of the herein plaintiffs which
were lost and had disappeared by reason of this accident; (d) the sum
of P30,000.00 for moral damages for mental and bodily distress, as well
as mental anguish and physical deformities; (e) the sum of P5,000.00
for attorney's fees and to pay the costs of this suit.' (p. 23, record
on appeal.)"</p>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On appeal, this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
except as to the amount of the moral damages, which was reduced
altogether to P10,000. Hence, Soledad A. Verzosa filed this petition to
review, upon the ground that the moral damages and attorney's fees
awarded in the decision appealed from are not in accordance with law,
particularly Articles 2219 and 2220 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines, and the doctrine laid down in Cachero vs. Itanila Yellow
Taxicab, 101 Phil., 523; 54 Off. Gaz, (26) 6599.</p>
<p>Said Article 2219 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Moral damages may be recovered  in the following and analogous cases:</p>
  <p>(1)  A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;<br>
    (2)  Quasi-delicts  causing physical injuries;<br>
    (3)  Seduction, abduction, rape, or  other lascivious acts;<br>
    (4)  Adultery or concubinage;<br>
    (5)  Illegal or arbitrary detention  or arrest;<br>
    (6)  Illegal search;<br>
    (7)  Libel, slander or any other form of defamation;<br>
    (8)  Malicious prosecution;<br>
    (9)  Acts mentioned in article 309;<br>
    (10)  Acts and actions referred to in articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 84,  and 35.</p>
  <p>"The
parents of the female seduced, abducted, raped, or abused, referred to
in No. 3 of this article, may also recover moral damages.<br>
    <br>
"The spouse, descendants, ascendants, and brothers and sisters may
bring the action mentioned in No. 9 of this Article, in the order
named."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner maintains that the present action does not fall under
said provision and is not analogous to any of the cases therein
enumerated. Upon the other hand, respondents assert the contrary, upon
the authority of Articles 21 and 1170 of said Code, which provide:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 21. Any person who wilfully causes loss or
injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs
or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage."</p>
  <p>"Art.
1170. Those who in the performance of their obligations are guilty of
fraud, negligence or delay, and those who in any manner contravene the
tenor thereof, are liable for damages."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, however, no merit in respondents' pretense, for petitioner
has been sued by respondents herein and was sentenced by the Court of
First Instance and the Court of Appeals, not by reason of any act which
is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy, but, merely on
account of the fact that she is liable for the negligence of her agent
or driver, which gave occasion for the injuries and damages sustained
by respondents (Articles 1755, 1756, 1757 and 1759, Civil Code of the
Philippines). With respect to said Article 1170, suffice it to say that
the same merely sets forth a general principle on damages, and that, as
regards moral damages, Article 2219 is controlling, it being a specific
provision thereon, and, as such, it prevails over Article 1170.</p>
<p>At any rate, the decision of the Court of Appeals correctly held
that the liability of petitioner herein arises from a breach of her
contract of carriage with respondents herein, and, in such event,
"moral damages are recoverable <em>only</em> when the defendant acted
fraudulently or in bad faith" in the language of Article 2220 of our
Civil Code, In the case at bar, there is neither allegation nor proof
that petitioner herein is guilty, either of fraud, or of bad faith.</p>
<p>In Fores <em>vs.</em> Miranda (105 Phil., 266; 57 Off. Gaz. [44]
7938), this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Reyes (J.B.L.), had the
following to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Anent the moral damages ordered to be paid to the
respondent, the same must be discarded. "We have repeatedly ruled
(Cachero<em> vs.</em> Manila Yellow Taxicab Co. Inc., 101 Phil., 523;  54 Off. Gaz. 6599; Necesito, et al. <em>vs.</em>
Parais, 104 Phil., 75; 56 Off. Gaz. [23] 4023) that moral damages are
not recoverable in damage actions predicated on a breach of the
contract of transportation, in view of Articles 2219 and 2220 of the
new Civil Code, which provide as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'Art. 2219. Moral  damages may be recovered in the  following and analogous cases:</p>
  <p>(1)  A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;</p>
  <p>(2)  Quasi-delicts  causing physical injuries;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>'Art.
2220. Willful injury to property may be a legal ground for awarding
moral damages if the court should find that, under the circumstances,
such damages are justly due. The same rule applies to breaches of
contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"By contrasting the provisions of these two articles it immediately becomes apparent that:</p>
  <p>(<em>a</em>)  In cases of  breach of contract  (including one of transportation)  proof of bad faith or fraud (<em>dolus</em>), i. e., wanton or deliberately injurious conduct, is essential to justify an award of moral damages; and</p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>)
That a breach of contract can not be considered included in the
descriptive term 'analogous cases' used in Art. 2219; not only because
Art. 2220 specifically provides for the damages that are caused by
contractual breach, but because the definition of<em> quasi-delict</em> in Art. 2176 of the Code expressly <em>excludes</em> the cases where there is a  'pre-existing contractual relation between the parties.'</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'Art.
2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being
fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault
or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relartion
between the parties, is called a <em>quasi-delict</em> and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The
exception to the basic rule of damages now under consideration is a
mishap resulting in the death of a passenger, in which case Article
1764 makes the common carrier expressly subject to the rule of Art.
2206, that entitles the spouse, descendants and ascendants of the
deceased passenger to 'demand moral damages for mental anguish by
reason of the death of the deceased' (Necesito <em>vs.</em> Paras, 104
Phil., 75; 56 Off. Gaz. [23] 4023, Eesolution on motion to reconsider,
September 11, 1958). But the exceptional rule of Art. 1764 makes it all
the more evident that where the injured passenger does not die, moral
damages are not recoverable unless it is proved that the carrier was
guilty of malice or bad faith. We think it is clear that the mere
carelessness of the carrier's driver does not <em>per se </em>constitute
or justify an inference of malice or bad faith on the part of the
carrier; and in the case at bar there is no other evidence of such
malice to support the award of moral damages by the Court of Appeals.
To award moral damages for breach of contract, therefore, without proof
of bad faith or malice on the part of the defendant, as required by
Art. 2220, would be to violate the clear provisions of the law, and
constitute unwarranted judicial legislation.</p>
  <p>"The Court of Appeals has invoked  our rulings in Castro <em>vs.</em> Aero Taxicub Co. G. R.  No.  49155, December  14, 1948 and Layda <em>vs.</em>
Court of Appeals, 90 Phil., 724; but these doctrines were predicated
upon our former law of damages, before judicial discretion in fixing
them became limited by the express provisions of the new Civil Code
(previously quoted). Hence, the aforesaid rulings are now inapplicable.</p>
  <p>"Upon
the other hand, the advantageous position of a party suing a carrier
for breach of the contract of transportation explains, to some extent,
the limitations imposed by the new Code on the amount of the recovery.
The action for breach of contract imposes on the defendant carrier a
presumption of liability upon mere proof of injury to the passenger;
the latter is relieved from the duty to establish the fault of the
carrier, or of his employees, and the burden is placed on the carrier
to prove that it was due to an unforeseen event or to <em>force  majeure</em> (Cangco <em>vs.</em>
Manila Railroad Co., 38 Phil., 768, 777). Moreover, the carrier, unlike
in suits for quasi-delict, may not escape liability by proving that it
has exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its
employees (Art. 1759, new Civil Code; Cangeo <em>vs.</em> Manila Railroad Co.,  supra;  Prado  <em>vs.</em> Manila Electric Co., 51 Phil.,  900).</p>
  <p>"The  difference in conditions,  defenses  and proof, as well as the codal  concept of <em>quasi-delict</em> as essentially <em>extra-contractual</em> negligence, compel us to differentiate between actions <em>ex contractu</em>, and actions <em>quasi ex delictio</em>,
and prevent us from viewing the action for breach of contract as
simultaneously embodying an action on tort. Neither can this action be
taken as one to enforce on employer's liability under Art. 103 of the
Revised Penal Code, since the responsibility is not alleged to be
subsidiary, nor is there on record any averment or proof that the
driver of appellant was insolvent. In fact, he is not even made a party
to the suit.</p>
  <p>"It is also suggested that a carrier's violation
of its engagement to safely transport the passenger involves a breach
of the passenger's confidencet and therefore should be regarded as a
breach of contract in bad faith, justifying recovery of moral damages
under Art. 2220. This theory is untenable, in every case its obligation
to the passenger is infringed; while under the law (Art. 1756), the
presumption is that common carriers acted <em>negligently</em> (and  not maliciously), and Art. 1762 speaks of <em>negligence</em> of  the common carrier.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'ART.
1756. In case of death of or injuries to passengers, common carriers
are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted negligently, unless
they prove that they observed extraordinary diligence as prescribed in
articles 1733 and 1755,'</p>
  <p>'ART. 1762. The contributory
negligence of the passenger does not bar recovery of damages for his
death or injuries, if the proximate cause thereof is the negligence of
the common carrier but the amount of damages shall be equitably
reduced.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"The distinction between fraud,
bad faith or malice (in the sense of deliberate or wanton wrongdoing)
and negligence (as mere carelessness) is too fundamental in our law to
be ignored (Arts. 1170-1172); their consequences being clearly
differentiated by the Code.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'ART. 2201. In
contracts and quasi-contracts, the damages for which the obligor who
acted in good tfaith is liable shall bo those that are the natural and
probable consequences of the breach of the obligation, and which the
parties have foreseen or could have reasonably foreseen at the time the
obligation was constituted.</p>
  <p>'In case of fraud, bad faith,
malice or wanton attitude, the obligor shall be responsible for all
damages which may he reasonably attributed to the non-performance of
the obligation.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"It is to be presumed, in
the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, that this
difference was in the mind of the lawmakers when in Art. 2220 they
limited recovery of moral damages to breaches of contract in bad faith.
It is true that negligence may be occasionally so gross as to amount to
malice; but that fact must be shown in evidence, and a carrier's bad
faith is not to be lightly inferred from a mere finding that the
contract was breached through negligence of the carrier's employees.</p>
  <p>"In
view of the foregoing considerations the decision of the Court of
Appeals is modified by eliminating the award of P5,000.00 by way of.
moral damages (Court of Appeals Resolution of May 3, 1357)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is  thus clear,  therefore, that respondents herein  are not entitled  to moral damages.</p>
<p>As  regards the attorney's fees, Article 2208 of the afore-mentioned Code ordains:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered,
except:</p>
  <p>(1) When  exemplary damages are awarded;</p>
  <p>(2)
When the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to
litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his
interest;</p>
  <p>(3) In  criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;</p>
  <p>(4) In  case  of a  clearly unfounded civil action  or proceeding against the plaintiff;</p>
  <p>(5)
Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to
satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claim;</p>
  <p>(6) In  actions for legal support;</p>
  <p>(7) In  actions  for the  recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;</p>
  <p>(8) In  actions  for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws;</p>
  <p>(9) In  a  separate civil action to recover civil liability  arising from a crime;</p>
  <p>(10) When  at least double judicial costs are awarded;</p>
  <p>(11)
In any other case where the eourt deems it just and equitable that
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.</p>
  <p>"In all cases, the attorney's fees and expenses of litigation must he reasonable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is urged by petitioner herein that paragraphs 2 and 4 of this
provision, which are the only ones having a bearing on the present
case, are inapplicable thereto for, by setting up an aggregate claim of
approximately P200,000, which is manifestly excessive, respondents
have, in fact, compelled the petitioner to reject it. It appears,
however, tnat in their letter of demand to petitioner herein,
respondents did not specify any sum of money. What is more, they
explicitly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Extra-judicial settlement of their cases, may still
be possible, should you be willing to pay them the reasonable damages
just and proper for each and every one of them to receive."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in the reply thereto, made by the former counsel of
petitioner herein, the liability of the latter was denied, upon the
ground that the injury and damages sustained by respondents were due to
the negligence, not of petitioner's driver, but of the driver of the
freight truck which collided with petitioner's bus.</p>
<p>Considering, however, that the aggregate amount of the actual and
compensatory damages awarded to respondents herein is a little over
P8,000.00, and that, as provided in the above-quoted Article 2208, "in
all cases the attorney's fees and expenses of litigation must be
reasonable", this Court is of the opinion that the attorney's fees in
the present case should be reduced from P5,000.00 to P1,000.00.</p>
<p>With the elimination of the award of moral damages and the reduction
of the attorney's fees to P1,000.00, the decision of the Court of
Appeals is hereby affirmed, therefore, in all other respects, without
special pronouncement as to costs in this instance. It is so ordered.</p>
