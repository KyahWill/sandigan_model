</blockquote>
<p>Found guilty as charged, he was  sentenced to  (suffer) <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of Sofronio Santiago in the sum of&nbsp; P6,000.00, and to pay the costs.   In this appeal, Again  alleges that the lower  court  erred: (1)  in finding that he voluntarily confessed to the crime; (2)  in  failing to  appreciate  certain  facts  and  circumstances  indicating his innocence.</p>
<p>We  glean  from  the  evidence  adduced by the People, the following facts:</p>
<p>Between 6 and 7 o'clock in the  evening of November 26, 1952, Sofronio  Santiago, 75, was found lying dead on the floor of  his  house in Victory  Village, town of Legaspi, Albay, (Exhibits B, B-3).  He had three bullet wounds. An empty cartridge from a .45 caliber pistol was recovered near a sewing machine inside the house (Exhibit B-2). On November 27, 1952, the dead body was autopsied by Dr. Moises Cruz, then Chief of the  Provincial Hospital of  Albay,  in the presence  of his assistant  Dr.  Antolin Letivio.  The autopsy  revealed  that Sofronio  Santiago sustained the injuries described  in the information and according to  Dr. Letivio, the deceased must have been shot at the  back and that wounds Nos. 1 and 2 were the immediate cause of Sofronio's  death.</p>
<p>On July  14, 1954, accused Federico Agarin, a member of the Hukbalahap  (a dissident organization),  then armed with a .45 caliber pistol and Francisco Baltazar <em>alias</em> "Bal" and the latter's  mistress Isabel Alzada, were  captured by Constabulary soldiers headed by  Sgt.  Cirilo Lasin in Legaspi,  and were  brought for confinement at  the  P.C. stockade of Legaspi  (Exhibit  C).  While under  confinement, the accused confided to one Modesto Austria, a fellow-detention prisoner in the  said stockade that he  (accused) was one of the  group that boarded his  (Modesto's)  sailboat and proceeded to Victory Village at the time Sofronio was killed.</p>
<p>In  effect,  Modesto Austria  testified in  court  that at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, about the end of November, 1952, accused Agarin, with Commander Manding and Commander Vida, who carried short firearms on their hips, approached him while he was7 fixing  his sailboat on the seashore of  Malumbalay, Manito,  Albay,  and  requested that they be transported to Malagnog, Legaspi, for which Commander Vida  promised  to pay him  (Modesto).   He transported the three to Malagnog first and then to Manito where he was told to wait for them.  He fell asleep while waiting for them until 10:00 o'clock in the evening, when the three returned,  after which Commander Vida  paid him (Modesto)  the sum of  P2.50 and  the  three headed for the mountains.</p>
<p>On August 14, 1954, the  accused executed an affidavit Exhibit C before Jose G. Balin, Clerk of the Court of First Instance of  Albay.  In this  Exhibit C, the  accused confessed that prior to his capture on July 14,  1954, he was a member of a Huk organization as Field Commander 55 (PC 55), with the rank of sergeant under Commander Manding; that he  was also known as ''Smith" among his men; that sometime in November, 1952, he, Commander Manding and Vice Commander Vida, left their camp at Anopol, Puchan, Manito, Albay, for an important mission somewhere,  and riding on a sailboat manned by Modesto Austria, they proceeded  to  Malagnog, reaching the same at about five o'clock in the afternoon; that from here they hiked and arrived at Victory Village at  about 6:30 in the evening; that they surrounded the house of Sofronio Santiago (deceased), whom they wanted to take  for investigation because they suspected him to be the person who informed the BCT regarding the presence of the Huks in Manito, which resulted in a  raid on their camp by government troops; that Commander  Manding instructed him (accused) to guard near the window of Sofronio's house, while Commander Vida was  posted at the window near the stairs of the house; that Commander Manding called Sofronio to come downstairs for a  talk but Sofronio moved towards the stairs and finding Commander Manding there, he  (Sofronio) retreated as if to escape through the window where Vice Commander  Vida was guarding; that  at this juncture, Commander Manding gave the order to fire, and Vice-Commander Vida fired and he (accused)  also fired at  Sofronio; followed by another shot by the same Commander  Vida, after which Commander Manding gave the order to stop firing and the three escaped towards Malagnog from where they sailed back to Manito  (Exhibit C). The accused and a policeman, later reconstructed the killing of Sofronio, in the presence of Det. Sgt. Alfredo Mulo, police Lt.  Binas and Sgt.  Cirilo Lasin  of the P.C. and several other policemen of Legaspi.</p>
<p>The accused denied having shot Sofronio or having participated in  any manner in the killing of Sofronio.  He claimed that while he was under confinement in the stockade of the  P.C.  in Albay,  Sgt.  Lasin  maltreated him  in the bathroom by boxing him on  the head and other parts of his body; that Sgt. Lasin told him that if he  did not admit the  contents of the affidavit, he would be shot on the pretext that he  was trying to escape;  and that he signed said affidavit  for the  protection of  his life.</p>
<p>Appellant declared that in the evening  of November 26, 1952, at about 6:30 o'clock, he was in Daraga, Albay, delivering a letter to Julian Iiorera, another Huk Commander to  whom he had been assigned as courier; that after he had delivered the letter, he and Llorera saw a movie until 10:00 o'clock that evening after which he returned to Malagnog to meet Commanders Handing and Vida whom he had left there in the  afternoon.  Julian Llorera, himself a fellow detention prisoner of the appellant, testified to the same effect.</p>
<p>In  other words, the primordial question put in issue by the defense is the voluntariness of the confession Exhibit C, and the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant the conviction of the appellant for  the  crime  charged.</p>
<p>We have given the case the attention it deserves, having in  mind the seriousness of the offense, and we are fully convinced that the appellant is guilty. Anent the execution of Exhibit  C, the appellant signed and swore to the truth of  the contents of Exhibit  C  before the Clerk of Court, Jose G. Balm,  in his office on August 14, 1954, after the contents thereof had been read and translated to him into the Bicol dialect.  The appellant himself corroborated this fact, when he declared that it was the Clerk of Court who made him sign the document in his presence which was in questions and answers; that the Clerk of Court read to him and  translated the document to him into the Bicol dialect, before he signed it; that he understood each and everything that the document contained; that during his confinement at the P.C. barracks, Sgt. Lasin was not with him; and that it  was Sgt. Mulo who accompanied him to the Clerk of Court.  Sgt. Lasin, therefore, could not,  under this circumstance,  have  forced4 or  intimidated  him  to execute his confession.  There was  absolutely no motive shown why Balin, an officer of the court, and Sgt.  Lasin would  have implicated an otherwise innocent man.  It is almost trite to be repeating herein  the rule  that as  far as the credibility  and veracity of witnesses are concerned, great respect and reliance are placed  upon the findings and conclusions of the trial court, and we find nothing in the record which would  warrant us in disbelieving  the testimonies  of  the witnesses  for the  People.  Counsel's contention that Exhibit C must have been merely a composite  of the statements  of Modesto Austria  and Roger Dolar, and of what the P.C. men and officers  had already known, did not pass beyond  a mere conjecture.   Exhibit C having been executed on August 14, 1954, could not have been based on the affidavit of Austria which was then unexisting, as the same was  executed only on September 20, 1954.   Exhibit C contained details and matters which could have been supplied only by the  appellant.  There are matters therein which the appellant  himself confirmed on the witness stand, such as the fact that he was  captured with Francisco Baltazar, that he was then in possession of a .45 caliber pistol, that he carried the name of "Smith" and that he joined the Huk organization in November 1952. The physical finding of the medical expert corroborates the appellant's, confession that he  shot  Sofronio  Santiago  at the back.</p>
<p>In the face, therefore, of  the  strong and  convincing evidence adduced by the prosecution, the <em>alibi</em> interposed by the appellant, although supported by the testimony of a number of the dissident organization, becomes untenable. The prosecution, in our opinion,  has established sufficient live on the part of the appellant for the killing.</p>
<p>The offense perpetrated by appellant is murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength.  Considering, however, the fact that  the killing was committed as a means to  or in the furtherance of the subversive  ends of the <em>Hukbalahaps</em> (HUKS), because the said appellant arid his companions, Commander Manding and Commander Vida suspected the deceased to have acted as a spy and had informed the BCT and  Government agencies  regarding the presence of the Huks in that region, we find the said Federico Agarin <em>alias</em> Commander 'Smith' guilty of the  crime of simple rebellion only  (People <em>vs</em>. Hernandez, et al., 99 Phil., 515; 52 Off. Gaz.  [12] 5506; Sees. 4  and 5, Rule 116; People <em>vs</em>. Melecio Aquino, et al., 108 Phil., 814; 57 Off. Gaz. [51]9180).</p>
<p>There being  no modifying circumstance  to appreciate, the appellant is, therefore, sentenced to suffer eight (8) years and one  (1)  day  of <em>prision  mayor,</em> and  to pay a fine in the sum of P10,Q00.00, without subsidiary imprisonment, pursuant to article 38 of the Revised Penal Code and  to indemnify the heirs of Sofronio Santiago in the sum of  P6,000.00  (Art. 107, Revised Penal Code; People <em>vs</em>. Geronimo, 100 Phil.,  90; 53 Off. Gaz.,  6S; People <em>vs</em>. Romagosa, 103 Phil., 20; 56 Off. Gaz.  [14] 2946).</p>
<p>Modified in the manner just  indicated, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed  in all other  respects, with costs. <br>
