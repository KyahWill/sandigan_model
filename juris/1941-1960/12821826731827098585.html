				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FLORENTINO CANIBAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Charged with treason on two counts, 
appellant Florentino Canibas was found guilty, in a unanimous decision, by the 
3rd Branch of the People's Court, and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine 
of P10,000.00, with costs<br><p>On count 1, the court found that the accused, a 
native of Tarlac, arrived in Batangas from Lopez of the now province of Quezon, 
in November, 1944. Soon after that, a Makapili unit was organized in Lipa by the 
accused together with one Nicolas Gonzales and others. Gonzales became the 
titular head of the organization and defendant, its secretary. The accused, as 
member of the Makapili, wore Japanese uniform and white arm band, was armed with 
a revolver, mounted guard and did sentry duty, accompanied Japanese soldiers in 
raids against supposed guerrillas, confiscated foodstuff, and forced male 
citizens to work for the Japanese army.<br><br>In support of count 2, the court 
found that on February 11, 1945, a group of Makapilis, among whom was the 
accused, accompanied by Japanese troops, raided barrio Marajuy, municipality of 
Lipa, province of Batangas, apprehended almost the entire population of the 
barrio, about 300 in all, including children and adults, men and women, and 
marched them to a citrus experimental station. In that place, the accused and 
others tied the victims by two's, after which the Japanese slaughtered the 
prisoners with bayonets, with the exception of a few who were able to escape, 
one of them being Juan Navarro, who testified at the trial. In the killings, 
children were tossed up in the air and caught with the points of bayonets as 
they fell. Besides those who succeeded in escaping, five young girls were 
spared; they were selected for their good look by the accused and his fellow 
Makapilis, and taken to Nicolas Gonzales' house in a barrio in Sto. Tomas, 
Batangas, where they were kept as "servants" for Gonzales and the Japanese. One 
of those "girls was Lutgarda Tolentino, scarcely 15 years of age at the time of 
the massacre, also a witness for the prosecution.<br><br>The first count has not 
been established by the oaths of at least two witnesses. There are no two direct 
witnesses to any of the component parts that made up the whole overt act of 
appellant's membership in the Makapili. (People <em>vs</em>. Adriano, 44 Off. 
Gaz., 4300.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> But the testimony on this 
branch of the case is sufficient proof of adherence to the enemy. Adherence, 
unlike overt acts, need not be proved by two witnesses. Clear intent and 
knowledge may be gathered from the testimony of one of the witnesses, or from 
the nature of the act itself, or from the circumstances surrounding the act. 
(Cramer <em>vs</em>. U. S., 65 S. Ct. 980; People <em>vs</em>. Adriano, 
<em>supra</em>.)<br><br>The second count has been established in the manner 
required by the law of treason. There is no proof by two witnesses of the 
seizure at their homes of the inhabitants of barrio Marajuy by the Japanese and 
the accused, but there were three eye-witnesses to the fact that the accused was 
present at the mass killings, taking active part therein in collaboration with 
the Japanese, by personally tying the hands of some of the victims and directing 
the same operation with regard to others.<br><br>The accused, corroborated by 
Gonzales and another witness, put up an alibi, saying in, answer to various 
questions that he knew nothing of the charges and of the testimony of the 
Dvernment witnesses against him. He said he fled to the mountains when the 
Americans were coming. The People's Court believed the testimony of the 
prosecution' witnesses and we do not think it committed any error in so 
doing.<br><br>The judgment of conviction and the penalty imposed are in 
accordance with law and are hereby affirmed, with costs of this instance against 
the appellant.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla
