				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners-appellees were in the year 1951 members of the police&nbsp; force&nbsp; of the City of&nbsp; Bacolod.&nbsp; All&nbsp; of&nbsp; them are civil service eligibles.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 1951 the&nbsp; chief of police filed&nbsp; administrative complaints against them, charging some with having tolerated prohibited games, another with&nbsp; maltreatment,&nbsp; another with failure to make arrest of&nbsp; offenders, etc.&nbsp; The administrative complaints were sworn to by the chief of police&nbsp; and&nbsp; were&nbsp; presented by him&nbsp; to&nbsp; the city mayor,&nbsp; who&nbsp; thereupon&nbsp; endorsed, them to the&nbsp; city council&nbsp; and suspended the petitioners.&nbsp; The latter referred&nbsp; the complaints to a committee on police, which authorized its chairman to&nbsp; subpoena the petitioners, furnishing&nbsp; each and everyone&nbsp; of them with a&nbsp; copy of the respective administrative charges filed&nbsp; against each. The&nbsp; respondents did not appear&nbsp; at the hearing, so&nbsp; the committee&nbsp; received the evidence which the chief&nbsp; of police offered.&nbsp; Thereafter&nbsp; the&nbsp; committee made&nbsp; the&nbsp; following findings and resolution:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; complainant&nbsp; Chief of&nbsp; Police was&nbsp; asked&nbsp; to&nbsp; present&nbsp; his evidence&nbsp; against the respondents&nbsp; and upon hearing the evidence presented by&nbsp; the complainant Chief&nbsp; of Police, thru his witnesses, the committee is of the opinion&nbsp; and so holds that&nbsp; respondents Arturo&nbsp; Cardenas, Monico Nobleza, Pacifico Limbaga, and&nbsp; Conrado Matavia are&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; charge&nbsp; of "serious irregularities&nbsp; in the performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; duties&nbsp; and violation of&nbsp; the law";&nbsp; and&nbsp; Respondents Ernesto&nbsp; Quiatchon&nbsp; and Crispin&nbsp; Carmona are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the charge of "Maltreatment and abuse of authority"; and Respondents Pacifico Limbaga and Conrado Matavia are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of additional charge of "dereliction of&nbsp; duty" and&nbsp; "sleeping while in duty" respectively, aside&nbsp; from their&nbsp; guilty already established in the first administrative complaint for "serious&nbsp; irregularities in' the performance of their duties and violation of the&nbsp; law" "In view hereof, the committee"<br><br>"Resolved, to recommend&nbsp; to the Honorable City Mayor the immediate&nbsp; separation&nbsp; from the service of all the above-named respondents for the best interest&nbsp; of public service."<br><br>"Resolved&nbsp; further, that in order not&nbsp; to&nbsp; hamper the function of the police force it is recommended that&nbsp; the position to be vacated by the&nbsp; respondents herein be immediately&nbsp; filed by him&nbsp; also for the&nbsp; best&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp; service."&nbsp; (pp. 12-13,&nbsp; Brief&nbsp; of&nbsp; Respondent-Appellant.)</blockquote>The above resolution,&nbsp; which ratified&nbsp; all the&nbsp; actuations of the city mayor with&nbsp; regards to their suspension&nbsp; and their separation from the service (of petitioners-appellees), was approved by the city council&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 29,&nbsp; 1951.<br><br>So the petitioners-appellees instituted these suits against the mayor, alleging that they had&nbsp; been illegally removed and praying that they&nbsp; be&nbsp; reinstated to&nbsp; their respective positions.&nbsp;&nbsp; A trial was&nbsp; held, after which the&nbsp; court rendered&nbsp; a decision ordering the&nbsp; reinstatement of the petitioners-appellees, holding that their&nbsp; suspension and removal are&nbsp; not in accordance with the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 557.&nbsp; The reasons&nbsp; adduced by the trial court for its&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; are:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that&nbsp; the complaints were&nbsp; not instituted by the city mayor himself; (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; the investigation was conducted by a committee of the&nbsp; council, and not by the council itself;&nbsp; and (3) that the petitioners were&nbsp; not given opportunity, to appear and give their evidence in support of&nbsp; their defense.&nbsp; Appeal against this decision was prosecuted in this Court, for the reason that there is&nbsp; no dispute as&nbsp; to the facts necessary for the determination of the case.<br><br>The law provides that the&nbsp; charges against city policemen shall&nbsp; be preferred by the&nbsp; city mayor.&nbsp; It&nbsp; can&nbsp; not be implied&nbsp; therefrom that the&nbsp; mayor himself must&nbsp; file the charges personally,&nbsp; or that he sign the complaint himself like a prosecuting officer filing an information.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; provision that he&nbsp; must sign the charges.&nbsp; To prefer is to&nbsp; present,&nbsp; and this is what the mayor did when he submitted the&nbsp; charges&nbsp; before the&nbsp; council.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; the chief&nbsp; of police is the&nbsp;&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; the mayor, and acts for the latter&nbsp; under&nbsp; the latter's direct orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the chief of police, therefore, filed the&nbsp; administrative complaints and the mayor submitted them to the city&nbsp; council,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter may&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as having made the complaints his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; The signing of the complaints by&nbsp; the mayor is a mere formality&nbsp; which is&nbsp; not essential to the&nbsp; validity of&nbsp; the proceedings, causing no substantial injury to the rights of the respondents.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no&nbsp; justification&nbsp; for annulling the investigation under&nbsp; this score.<br><br>The second&nbsp; reason for invalidating&nbsp; the investigation is the fact that the charges were investigated&nbsp; by a committee of the city council, not by the council itself.&nbsp; While it is true that we had held in Santos <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp; </span>Mendoza, 48 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; p. 4801, that&nbsp; such&nbsp; a procedure&nbsp; is&nbsp; valid the law has been changed since the above decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Republic Act No. 557 has eliminated the&nbsp; provision&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; investigation by,a committee of&nbsp; the council.&nbsp;&nbsp; We held that the&nbsp; change meant that the investigation should be by the council itself (Festejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Municipal Mayor of Nabua, 96 Phil.,&nbsp; 286,&nbsp; promulgated December 22, 1954). We affirmed this&nbsp; doctrine in&nbsp; the recent&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Covacha <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Amante, G. R. No. L-8358, promulgated May 25, 1956. The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; was, therefore, correct in holding that the investigation proceedings were&nbsp; not conducted by the municipal&nbsp; council&nbsp; and&nbsp; in annulling&nbsp; the results of&nbsp; the investigation.<br><br>The above&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; as to the nullity of the&nbsp; investigation renders unnecessary the&nbsp; consideration of the third finding of&nbsp; the trial court.<br><br>The judgment is, therefore,&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C, J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
