				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal against&nbsp; a decision of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Leyte,&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; S. C. Moscoso,&nbsp; presiding, awarding&nbsp; to plaintiffs Balbino Sequito,&nbsp; et al., ownership of a parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in&nbsp; Dagami,&nbsp; Leyte,&nbsp; and ordering&nbsp; defendant Anatalio Letrondo to vacate the premises and to pay damages in the&nbsp; amount of P4.000.<br><br>The record&nbsp; discloses the&nbsp; following:&nbsp; On October 21,&nbsp; 1955, the complaint in&nbsp; this case&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; court&nbsp; and the summons was served&nbsp; by police sergeant Borja&nbsp; upon defendant's daughter who was then 12 years old and&nbsp; a fourth grade pupil&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 4 appellant's brief).&nbsp; Defendant failed to file his answer, and so,&nbsp; upon plaintiffs' motion, he was declared in&nbsp; default.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs presented&nbsp; their&nbsp; evidence ex-parte; the&nbsp; same consists of the testimony of&nbsp; plaintiff Balbino&nbsp; Sequito only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this testimony the court&nbsp; on February 7,&nbsp; 1956 rendered the judgment appealed from.<br><br>On March&nbsp; 13, 1956, the defendant, moved for.new trial, alleging&nbsp; that he did not receive&nbsp; the summons&nbsp; and that he came to know about the case only when he received a copy of the decision on February 23, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; He attached to his motion affidavits of merit and a copy of a deed of sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land.&nbsp; The motion was denied,&nbsp; hence this appeal.<br><br>The sole issue is, Did the trial court err&nbsp; in denying appellant's motion for new trial.&nbsp; Resolution of this question&nbsp; depends upon whether or not there had been&nbsp; a valid substituted service of summons in&nbsp; accordance with Section&nbsp; 8, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The record&nbsp; shows that the service of the summons was irregular.&nbsp; It was served by one police sergeant, Pacifico Borja, who was not a sheriff or a court&nbsp; officer, and who was&nbsp; not&nbsp; authorized by the court to deliver the summons. This violates the provisions of Section 5,&nbsp; Rule 7, Rules of Court.&nbsp; The proof of service is also not under oath&nbsp; as required&nbsp; by Section 20&nbsp; of said rule.<br><br>Moreover, even if the summons was really&nbsp; served upon defendant's daughter, still there was no valid substituted service because she, being only 12 years of age and a grade four&nbsp; pupil,&nbsp; could not&nbsp; have appreciated&nbsp; the&nbsp; importance of the paper delivered&nbsp; to her.&nbsp; We can not say with certainty that the daughter&nbsp; was at the&nbsp; time of suitable age&nbsp; and&nbsp; discretion to be entrusted&nbsp; with so important a document as&nbsp; a court summons&nbsp; (Section 8, Rule 7, Rules of Court).<br><br>As there is no evidence to show that defendant ever came to&nbsp; know about the case before he&nbsp; received the decision, the irregularity in the service was not cured. Defendant's failure to file his answer is, therefore, justified. <br><br>The record would&nbsp; also reveal that the defendant has a valid defense,&nbsp; which consists of Annex&nbsp; "B"&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 13-15, R.O.A.),&nbsp; a deed of sale of the land executed by Francisco Sequito, predecessor in-interest of the plaintiffs, in favor of Vicente Capatay, who, in turn,&nbsp; sold it to the defendant (pp.&nbsp; 12-13,&nbsp; R.O.A.).&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the&nbsp; defendant claims to have been in&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of purchase up&nbsp; to the present time.<br><br>The&nbsp; decision arid the order&nbsp; appealed from are hereby set aside and the&nbsp; case remanded to the lower court for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras C.
