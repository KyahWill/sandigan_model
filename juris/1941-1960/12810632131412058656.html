<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The prosecution presented evidence to the effect that at about 6 o'clock in 
the afternoon of October 21, 1942, three policemen of the vice squad of the City 
of San Pablo, named Quirico Azucena, Domingo Lacatan and Teofilo Cruz went to 
barrio Concepcion upon tip that <em>jueteng</em> was to be played there. On 
reaching near the precise place, they made a semicircle around a shed, which had 
no walls, and saw persons going inside one after another and handling Gregoz-io 
de Gorostiza small bundles of paper. Arsenio Ticzon was the last to come. The 
policemen, who were watching what was going on inside the shed where the accused 
and other persons were gathered, upon noticing that they were about to play 
<em>jueteng</em>, raided the place. The group of persons scampered away. Leaving 
on the table the bag Exhibit F, Gorostiza ran to an adjoining house. Cruz picked 
up the bag and followed Gorostiza who, when called upon to surrender, gave 
himself up. As Ticzon was intending to run away, he was grabbed by Azucena. 
Lacatan seized from the grip of Ticzon's left hand two pieces of paper Exhibits 
A-I and A-2. Lacatan found and on the ground four envelopes containing six 
rolled white paper Exhibit A and small bundles of paper contained in envelopes 
and identified as Exhibits B, B-1, B-2, C, C-1, C-2, D, D-1, D-2, D-3, E, E-1, 
E-2, and E-3. Gorostiza and Ticzon were taken to the police headquarters, where 
they were investigated by Assistant Chief of Police Vicente Carikitan. During 
the investigation, Cruz opened, in the presence of Gorostiza, the bag Exhibit F 
and took therefrom the pieces of paper Exhibit F-1, envelopes Exhibits F-2 to 
F-9, containing white sheets of rolled pad paper, and bills of different 
denominations amounting to P4.43 marked as Exhibit G.</p>
<p>The pieces of paper Exhibits A-1 and A-2, found in Ticzon's possession, and 
F-1 found in the bag left by Gorostiza when he ran away, contained, written 
thereon, <em>jueteng</em> numbers bet on and the amounts of bets in cen-tavos, 
as explained by policemen Lacatan and Cruz, who testified as having expert 
knowledge of Â£he game of jue-tenrj. The defense did not attempt to contradict 
the testimony of the two policemen., as to the nature of the three exhibits1. At 
any rate, the "attempt would have been fruitless because in Exhibit H, signed' 
by Gorostiza, he recognized the presence of one maong sack, referring to bag 
Exhibit F, the cash P4.43,' and "<em>jueteng</em> parapher-nalias"; and in 
Exhibit I, signed by Ticzon, the latter admitted the presence of 
"<em>jueteng</em> paraphernalias" as evidence. Lastly, Gorostiza and Ticzon 
jointly admitted in Exhibit J that, when they were arrested, policemen Azucena, 
Lacatan and Cruz found in their possession pieces of paper containing 
<em>jueteng</em> numbers and that at the time they were in search of 
<em>jueteng</em> collectors to make effective the bets they made in the pieces 
of paper referred to, in view of their strong hunch in favor of the numbers 
written in said pieces of paper, although they were unable to make the bets 
effective because of their arrest. The statement Exhibit J is worded as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kaming mga nakalagda sa ibaba nito, ay may mga sapat na gulang naninira sa 
Lunsod nang San Pablo, dito sa hinaharap na kasulatan ay malaya naming 
sinasaysay, pinagtitibay at pinanunum-paan itong mga sumusunod:<br><br>"Na, 
noong ika 21 nang Octubre, 1942, kami ay nahuli nang mga policiang si Azucena, 
Lacatan at Cruz mga policia nang Lunsod nang San Pablo nang tig-kakapirasong 
papel na may sulat nang numero nang <em>Jueteng</em> dahil sa mga sandaling kami 
ay mahuli nang nabangit na mga policia ay kasalukuyan kami ay naghahanap ng 
cobrador ng <em>Jueteng</em> na matatayaan, sapagkat ang mga numerong natatala 
sa nabangit na mga papeL na nahuli sa amin ay mahihigpit naming mga 'anuncio.' 
Hinde na nga namin naitaya ang aming mga anunciong ito dahil sa kami ay nadakip 
na iiga nang mga policia at dinala kami sa kanilang himpilan.</p>
<p>"Ito ang lubos namin mapapatunayan at dahil dito ay aming nilagdaan ngayon 
ika 25 nang buan nang Octubre, 1942, sa Lunsod ng San Pablo, Kapuluan 
Filipinas."</p></blockquote>
<p>The defense tried to establish that the two defendants did not participate, 
in the afternoon and place in question, in a game of <em>jueteng</em> either as 
collector or cashier, each accused offering: explanations as to their respective 
presence at the place of their arrest. The lower court made, in its decision, an 
ample analysis and discussion of the evidence presented both by the prosecution 
and the defense, and a perusal and study of the records of this case convince us 
that the conclusions of fact arrived at by the lower court are substantially 
correct and are supported by the evidence. Appellants have failed to show us 
sufficient grounds why we should disturb the conclusions of fact of the lower 
court.</p>
<p>Appellant Ticzon alleges that he signed Exhibit J because he was promised to 
be prosecuted only as a mere <em>jueteng</em> bettor; while Gorostiza, attacked 
the admissibility of said exhibit because the chief of police "told me to sign 
it so that I will not be molested anymore, and as I have never been accused 
before during my life time I signed it," pointing out that neither the chief of 
police nor policemen Lacatan and Cruz, instrumental witnesses of Exhibit J, 
refuted him on the alleged promise. But there are circumstances which make us 
refrain from accepting appellants' theories. When Exhibit J was signed by 
appellants on October 25, 1942, they were not under arrest because, as they 
themselves had testified, they were allowed to go home after they had signed 
Exhibits H and I on October 21, 1942, the date of their arrest. Exhibit J is 
written in Tagalog, the language of the locality. Before signing it, Gorostiza 
read it. Ticzon pretended not to know how to read and write, a pretension belied 
by his signatures in Exhibits I and J which show the penmanship of a person who 
ought to know how to read and write. The strokes and the letters of the 
signatures are characteristic of a person experienced in the long and frequent 
use of the pen. Ticaon declared that he was promised that he would be prosecuted 
only as <em>jueteng</em> bettor and would be made to pay only a fine. It is 
probable that the accused, losing all hopes of acquittal, offered to accept 
responsibility as mere <em>jueteng</em> bettors and were made to sign a 
statement of what they were willing to admit.</p>
<p>Upon the evidence in this case, we entertain no doubt as to the guilt of 
appellants. The social scourge of gambling must be stamped out. The laws against 
gambling must be enforced to the limit.</p>
<p>The lower court sentenced each of said appellants to an indeterminate penalty 
of from six (6) months and one (1) day to two (2) years, four (4) months and (1) 
day of <em>prision correccional</em>, to suffer the accessory penalties provided 
by law, and to pay one-half of the costs. The Solicitor General suggests that 
the maximum penalty should be not less than two (2) years, eleven (11) months 
and eleven (11) days of <em>prision correccional</em>. The suggestion is 
correct. (Article 195, paragraph 2 [c] of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 235.)</p>
<p>With the modification that the maximum of the penalty that should be imposed 
upon defendants be two (2) years, eleven. (11) months and eleven (11) days, the 
judgment of the lower court is affirmed in all other respects, with costs 
against the appellants.</p><em>Paras,</em> and<em> Pablo, J.J.,</em> concur.

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The present case is concerned with judicial proceedings ha'd during the 
Japanese occupation of the Philippines, culminating in a judgment rendered by 
the Court of First Instance of Laguna, dated May 8, 1943, acting as an agency of 
the so-called and defunct Republic of the Philippines.</p>This being a case of 
the Second Division of this Court composed of five Justices, the affirmative 
vote of a majority of said members is sufficient to pronounce a judgment by such 
Division. (Executive Order No. 86, dated January 7, 1946, amending Executive 
Order No. 40, dated May 4, 1945, of His Excellency, the President of the 
Philippines, amendatory of section 133 of the Revised Administrative Code, as 
amended.) There are three Justices voting affirmatively for the rendition of the 
foregoing judgment. Therefore, I need not waive my stand on the question of 
validity or nullity of the proceedings in this case in the Japanese-sponsored 
Court of First Instance of Laguna. Nor need I reiterate here the reasons and 
considerations supporting my stand in my dissenting and concurring opinions 
already delivered in Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan Ken and Dizon (75 Phil., 113) ; 
Peralta vs. Director of Prisons (75 Phil., 285) ; People vs. Jose (75 Phil., 
612) ; Alcantara vs. Director of Prisons (75 Phil, 494) ; and De Castro vs. 
Court of Appeals (75 Phil, 824). Nor need I state here the additional reasons 
and considerations to be set forth in my dissenting opinions in Ibanez vs. 
Hernandez (p. 772, post) and in Rustia vs. Aguinaldo (G. R. No. 48928, Sept. 5, 
1946)<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> now in course of preparation.
