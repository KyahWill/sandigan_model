				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Plaintiffs brought this action&nbsp; against defendants before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for the annulment of a sale&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the provincial treasurer of said province of a parcel&nbsp; of land for the&nbsp; sum of P302.31&nbsp; to Justo Evangelista for failure to pay the tax due thereon, and in the alternative, they asked that they be allowed to redeem the same from the present owner by virtue of the consignation&nbsp; made by them&nbsp; with the&nbsp; clerk&nbsp; of. court&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1943&nbsp; of the&nbsp; redemption money amounting&nbsp; to P345.00.<br><br>Defendants&nbsp; set up&nbsp; in their&nbsp; answer&nbsp; the following defenses: (1) that the court has no jurisdiction&nbsp; over the subject matter of&nbsp; the action (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause of action has already prescribed; and&nbsp; (3) that plaintiffs are now in estoppel to recover the property in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, however, defendants filed a motion to dismiss wherein they reiterated the same ground&nbsp; constituting their special defenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 30,&nbsp; 1956, the&nbsp; court issued an order sustaining the motion to dismiss without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; Plaintiffs appealed on purely questions of law. The order of&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">a&nbsp; quo&nbsp; </span>reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"This is a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the defendants and it&nbsp; appearing that another case between the same&nbsp; parties and about the same subject matter&nbsp; and the same causes of action was filed with this Court on&nbsp; October 19, 1942, being Civil&nbsp; Case No. 12, which was already decided&nbsp; by this Court upon&nbsp; a stipulation&nbsp; of facts on May 25, 1943,&nbsp; which decision was&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; the same is&nbsp; already <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata,</span>&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; that&nbsp; neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants took the necessary&nbsp; steps to reconstitute the record of the said case within the period&nbsp; prescribed by&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3110,&nbsp; thereby waiving the said&nbsp; reconstitution&nbsp; under Section&nbsp; 29&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>"The filing of&nbsp; the present&nbsp; action,&nbsp; which took place on November 28,&nbsp; 1955,, falls within&nbsp; the statute of&nbsp; limitations, for the&nbsp; failure of the plaintiffs to comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; reconstitution law&nbsp; does not entitle them to the benefits of&nbsp; Section 31 of the said&nbsp; Act, which provides&nbsp; that the&nbsp; time that has&nbsp; elapsed from the initiation&nbsp; of destroyed&nbsp; records&nbsp; until the time&nbsp; their reconstitution&nbsp; is declared impossible shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be counted against the interested parties&nbsp; or his&nbsp; heirs or other, successors&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest.&nbsp; Since 1943, therefore, until the filing&nbsp; of this&nbsp; action&nbsp; on November 28/ 1955,&nbsp; more&nbsp; than ten years have&nbsp; elapsed,&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason&nbsp; this&nbsp; action is&nbsp; now barred by the statute of limitations."</blockquote><br>It would appear that the trial&nbsp; court dismissed the case, on two&nbsp; grounds:&nbsp; (1) plaintiffs originally filed&nbsp; a similar case before the same court&nbsp; on October 19,&nbsp; 1942 which&nbsp; was decided&nbsp; on May 25,&nbsp; 1943&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; and which later appealed by&nbsp; defendants to the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, and since neither appellants nor appellees took steps to reconstitute the case then on appeal within the period prescribed by Act No. 3110, the court considered the&nbsp; judgment rendered in said case&nbsp; as a bar to the present under the principle of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> res judicata;&nbsp;</span> and (2)&nbsp; since the&nbsp; present action was filed&nbsp; on&nbsp; November 28,&nbsp; 1955, or&nbsp; more&nbsp;&nbsp; than 10 years after the filing of the&nbsp; original&nbsp; action in&nbsp; 1942, the court considered the present action as prescribed, the&nbsp; period intervening from the initiation of the destroyed record to&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of the present action not having been interrupted in view of the failure of plaintiffs to undertake its reconstitution as prescribed by Act No. 3110.<br><br>With regard to the first ground, we believe that the court was in error when it held that the present action was barred by a prior judgment under the principle of<span style="font-style: italic;"> res judicata</span>.&nbsp; Under Section 29 of Act No. 3110, the only effect of the failure of an interested party&nbsp; to have the record of a&nbsp; pending case reconstituted is that he shall be understood to have waived the benefits of the order or judgment which may have been rendered in the case,&nbsp; but that will not preclude him from filing the action anew covering the same subject matter.&nbsp; In the instant case, plaintiffs, it is true, failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; reconstitute the record of the case then pending before the Court&nbsp; of Appeals, but that will&nbsp; not bar them from filing the case anew.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what they&nbsp; have done. The judgment rendered in the previous case shall only&nbsp; be deemed waived, but cannot be set up as a bar to the present action&nbsp; (Claridad<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Novella, G. R. No. L-4207, October 24, 1952).<br><br>With regard to the second&nbsp; ground,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court is also in error&nbsp; in entertaining the defense of prescription. It appears that the original case was filed on October 19, 1942 and decision was rendered therein in favor of plaintiffs on May 25, 1943 (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 12).&nbsp; While under Section 29 of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 3110, a party who fails to reconstitute a court record within the period prescribed by law loses the&nbsp; "benefits of Section 31 hereof", which refers&nbsp; to the interruption of the time that may transpire from the initiation of the destroyed record until the date when its reconstitution shall&nbsp; have been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; impossible, however,&nbsp; in the instant case, this&nbsp; failure cannot have an adverse effect it appearing that plaintiffs filed another action for the same purpose against the same defendants on August 19, 1943 (Civil Case No. 60), which remained pending until October 19, 1954, when the same was dismissed without prejudice&nbsp; for&nbsp; alleged lack of interest on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of plaintiffs.&nbsp; And since plaintiffs filed this case anew on November 28, 1955, wherein the history of the previous cases was briefly related, following Article 1793 of the Spanish Civil Code which provides that "the prescription of actions is interrupted by the commencement of a suit for their enforcement,"&nbsp; it follows that the period of 10 years&nbsp; for the annulment of the sale of the property in question to&nbsp; appellee Justo&nbsp; Evangelista, as well&nbsp; as its subsequent&nbsp; sale by the latter to&nbsp; his co-appelle Leon&nbsp; P. Esquerra, has&nbsp; not yet expired upon the theory that the intervening period from the filing of&nbsp; the first case on October 19,&nbsp; 1942 to the institution of the&nbsp; present case in November 28, 1955, is&nbsp; deemed to have been&nbsp; civilly interrupted.&nbsp; It is therefore clear that the right of action of plaintiffs has not yet prescribed as erroneously held by the trial&nbsp; court.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; order appealed from is&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp; Let this&nbsp; case be&nbsp; remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
