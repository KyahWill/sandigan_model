				<H3>VICTORIA DESBARATS MIAILHE, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE VIVENCIO RAMIREZ, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>JUGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Victoria Desbarats Miailhe filed a complaint for foreclosure of 
mortgage against Jose Vivencio Ramirez, Rita Esperanza Ramirez, Jorge 
Pedro Ramirez, Jose Eugenio Ramirez, Belen Tomasa Ramirez, Ramos 
Anastacio Ramirez and Angela M. Butte for the sum of TWO HUNDRED 
THOUSAND PESOS (P200,000) with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from
 March 10, 1945, up to the time of payment, plus interest upon accrued 
interests and attorney's fees of 2% on the total amount due, alleging, 
among other things, that Executive Order No. 25, dated November 18, 1944
 as amended by Executive Order No. 32 dated March 10, 1945, and Republic
 Act No. 342, approved July 26, 1948, providing for a moratorium on all 
debts and other monetary obligations are null and void for being 
unconstitutional, and praying that said Republic Act and Executive 
Orders be declared unconstitutional and null and void and that judgment 
be rendered for the sums above-stated against the herein defendants.
  <p>    The defendants filed a motion for dismissal on the ground that 
the complaint did not state a cause of action in that the debt alleged 
therein was not due and payable by reason of the moratorium established 
by the above-mentioned Republic Act and Executive Orders.  The Court of 
First Instance of Manila issued an order dated May 13, 1950, granting 
the motion for dismissal.  The plaintiff appealed to this Court.</p>
  <p>    It is no longer necessary to consider the questions raised with
 regard to the moratorium for the reason that in the case of Royal L. 
Rutter vs. Placido J. Esteban, G. R. No. L-3708, promulgated on May 18, 
1953, and several other cases this Court has declared that said Republic
 Act and Executive Orders establishing moratorium are unconstitutional 
and, therefore, null and void.</p>
  <p>    IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the order of dismissal entered by the
 court below is hereby reversed and set aside, and this case is ordered 
returned to said court for further proceedings in accordance with this 
opinion, without pronouncement as to costs in this instance.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ</i>., concur. </p>
