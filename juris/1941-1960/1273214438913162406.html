				<H3>CONCHITA LIGUEZ, PETITIONER VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS, MARIA NGO VDA. DE LOPEZ, ET. AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>RESOLUTION ON THE APPELLEE'S
<br>MOTION TO RECONSIDER</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Against the decision of this Court holding the appellees, in their quality 
of successors of the late Salvador F. Lopez, Barred from questioning as immoral 
the donation aade by said deceased in favor of appellant Conchita Liguez, said 
appellees have interposed a notion for reconsideration praying us to declare: 

<ol><li>That the donation in question, being with an illicit cause, is null and void 
and inexistent, and produced no effects whatsoever. <br><br>
</li><li>That the pari delicto rule should apply. <br><br>
</li><li>That what may preclude the deceased donor from setting up the illegality 
cannot preclude his heirs. <br><br>
</li><li>That the appellant is in estoppel.&nbsp;<br> </li></ol>
<p>Concerning the first proposition, this 
Court has declared the donation to be tainted by immoral (i.e. illegal) <u>causa</u>, 
which necessarily involves the consequence that it is void and of no effect. 
Nevertheless, the court was also bound to apply Articles 1305 and 1306 of the 
Civil Code of 1889 (being the law in the case)</p><p>and under said articles, nullity of contracts due to illegal consideration or 
subject matter, when executed (and not merely executory) ,does produce the 
effect of barring any action by a guilty party to recover what it has already 
given under the contract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art.1305. When the nullity arises from the illegality of the consideration 
or of the subject-matter of the contract, if the fact constitutes a crime or 
misdemeanor common to both contracting parties, neither shall be entitled to 
maintain an aetion against the other, and criminal proceedings shall be 
instituted against them; and, furthermore, the things or money which may have 
been the subject-matter of the contract shall be disposed of in accordance with 
the rules prescribed by the Penal Code concerning the effects of a crime or 
misdemeanor and the instruments used in its commission.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This provision shall be applicable to cases in which one only of the 
contracting parties has been guilty of a crime or misdemeanor, but the innocent 
party may recover anything he may have given and shall not be bound to fulfill 
any promise he may have made."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1306. If the act which constitutes the illicit consideration is neither 
a crime nor a misdemeanor, the following rules shall be 
observed:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>When both parties are guilty, neither of them can recover what he may have 
given by virtue of the contract, or enforce the performance of the undertaking 
of the other party;<br><br>
</li><li>When only one of the contracting parties is guilty he cannot recover 
anything which he may have given by virtue of the contract, nor enforce the 
performance of any undertaking in his favor. The other party, if he has had 
nothing to do with the illicit consideration, may recover anything which he may 
have given without being obliged to perform any undertaking he may have 
assumed." </li></ol>

<p>These articles make it plain that in <u>so far as the guilty is concerned</u>, his 
act of conveying property pursuant to tan illicit contract operates to divest 
him of the ownership of the conveyed property, and to bar him from recovering it 
from his transferee, just as if the transfer were through a bargain legal in its 
inception. Repugnant as immoral bargains are, the law deems it more repugnant 
that a party should invoke his own guilt as a reason for relief from a situation 
he deliberately entered: "Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans". The 
foregoing serves to explain why the tainted conveyance, to the extent that it has been carried 
out, becomes conclusive as between the guilty parties, even if without effect 
against strangers without notice; and why a guilty party may nct ask the courts 
for a restoration to the status quo ante.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The argument that appellant's suit to recover the property amounts to an 
enforcement of the illegal contract itself fails to take into account the detail 
that the donation by Lopez to appellant was a full and complete act of 
conveyance. Donation, it must be remembered, is one of the modes of acquiring 
ownership; and the retention of the donated land by the donor or his privies can 
not deprive the donation of its transferring effect, either because donation 
does net need te be completed by tradition (since Art. 609 prescribes that 
"ownership and rights therein are acquired and transmitted by donation, 
succession-and in consequence of certain contracts by tradition, "thereby 
implying that donation is not one of the contracts requiring tradition), or else 
because the execution of the notarial deed is equivalent to the physical 
tradition of the property, as expressly provided by par. 2 of Article 1462 of 
the Code of 1889. True it is that the decisions of this Court (Addison vs. 
Felix, 39 Phil. 404, etc.) declare that such tradition "per chartam" is 
ineffective where the thing conveyed was at the time in the physical possession 
of third perons; but the possession of the donor or of his family can in wise be 
considered possession by strangers to the conveyance.</p>
<p>The donation being regular on its face, the refusal of appellees to surrender 
the donated property is in itself an attack in the validity of the gift made by 
their predecessor Salvador F. Lopez. Note well that appellant Liguez does not 
seek specific performanee of the donation: the latter has been already 
completely executed, and no further action is required. The basis of appellant's 
complaint is not an executory contract to convey, but the ownership resulting 
from the completed conveyance; and that ownership carries with it the right tc 
possession (jus possidendi) that the appellees seek to withhold. To retain 
possesion of the thing donated, appellees must defeat the donation; to defeat 
the donation they invoke its illegality, and this Court has ruled that they can 
not do so, because their predecessor was barred by law from so doing.</p>
<p>The debarring of appellees, qua successors and privies of the deceased donor, 
Salvador F. Lopez, is not predicated (as appellees erroneously believe) on the 
technical rules of estoppel, but on one more basic and fundamental: that the 
heir or successor, his quality as such, can not have a better right than the 
predecessor whom he replaces. The justice of this principle has been recognized 
by both the civil and the common law. "Nemo plus juris ad alium transferee 
potest quam ipse habet"; one can not transfer to another more rights than he has 
himself, as noted by Lord Coke in his Commentaries on Littleton (309b) virtually 
reiterating the of the Digest (50,17,54) and the Partidas (Part. VII, Tit. 34, 
rule 12) and pithily condensed in the vulgar "Nemo dat quod non habet". With 
particular reference to a deceased's contracts, Digest restates (50, 17, 143, De 
regulis juris) the consequent principle due to Ulpians "Quod ipsis qui 
contraxerunt. obstat, successoribus eorum obstabit": what bars those who 
contracted will likewise bar their successors. These maxims are net only 
grounded on common sense, but result from the very nature of succession as a 
mere derivative mode of acquiring rights. In consequence, this Court held that 
the appellees may attack the donation only if they can base its invalidity 
upon reasons independent of their quality as heirs or successors of the donor; 
and this is likewise true of the widow. Such recourse was reserved in our main 
decision.</p>
<p>The contention that the <i>pari delicto</i> rule should have been applied to this 
case deliberately ignores the important fact emphasized in our main decision, 
to wit: that the appellant Liguez was a minor of sixteen at the time the 
contract was made, while Lopez was of mature years and experience. No authority 
has been called to our attention holding that the guilt of a minor should be 
judged with severity equal to the guilt of an adult. It is well known that 
minors occupy a privileged position in law; and the law's tender care for them 
is emphasized by Art. 1415 of the new Civil Code. At any rate, the point is 
unimportant, because the donation having been fully executed, even if the 
parties were held to be in <i>pari delicto</i> the action of the donor or his privies 
ta recover the conveyed property and return to the <u>status quo</u> would remain 
barred by Arts. 1305 and 1306.</p>
<p>The ruling in the cases of Velasquez vs. Biala, 18 Phil. 231; Perizuelo vs. 
Benedicto, 9 Phil. 621; Pamittan vs. Lasam, 60 Phil. 908; and Camagay vs. 
Lagera, 7 Phil. 397, holding a donation of real estate to be invalid if made in 
private writing, has no application to the case at bar, wherein the essential 
formalities prescribed by statute were duly observed. A donation being a formal 
or solemn act, it does not exist in law if the formalities prescribed are not 
accomplished; and being thus inexistent, it is open to attack even by the 
parties thereto. But the donation in the present case is not inexistent but 
illegal, and specific articles of the Civil Code command that neither party 
thereto may be heard to invoke its unlawful character as a ground for relief. It 
is not possible to ignore this difference between true inexistence and 
illegality under the Civil Code of 1889.</p>
<p>Appellees also rely on the provisions of Art. 4 of the Civil Code to the 
effect that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Acts performed contrary to the provisions of law are void, except in the 
cases where the law itself provides for their validity."</p></blockquote>
<p>to support the thesis that donations of conjugal property by the husband 
without his wife's consent being forbidden by Art. 1413, the donation in favor 
of appellee should net be given effect. This argument is, however, untenable 
because of the terms of Art. 1419:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1419. The inventory shall include, for the purpose of collating them, a 
statement of any sums which, having been paid by the conjugal partnership, are 
to be deducted from the wife's dowry or from the capital of the husband, in 
accordance with Articles 1366, 1377, and 1427.</p><p>The value of any gifts or alienations which, in accordance with Article 1413, 
are to be deemed illegal or fraudulent, shall also be collated."</p></blockquote>

<p>The second paragraph of said article shows that the lawmaker does not view 
the donations made by the husband without the consent cf the wife as void, but 
merely fraudulent, subject to collation upon liquidation of the conjugal 
partnership and deduction of its value from the donor's share in the conjugal 
profits. This conclusion is supported not only by the commentators but also by 
the total absence in the Code of 1889 of any provision authorizing the wife to 
recover the property donated during the existence of the conjugal partnership, 
in contrast to Art. 173 of the new Civil Code. The donation now in question, 
therefore, falls within the exception of Art. 4 rather than its general 
rule.</p>
<p>Finally, the rule of estoppel by laches can not apply to prevent enforcement 
of the principle that a party to an illegal contract can not recover what he has 
given pursuant thereto, for the latter is a rule of superior public policy.</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, the motion to reconsider is denied.</p>
