				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from  a judgment  of the Court of First Instance of Isabela, Hon.  Manuel Arranz presiding,  ordering the defendants to restore to  the plaintiffs the  possession of the land described in the sketch, Exhibit "B", to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P2,100 as damages, and  to  pay the costs. <br><br>Plaintiffs-appellees  brought this action,  alleging that they are  absolute owners of a parcel  of land  situated in Barrio Aneg, Tumauini,  Isabela; that  said land  was  acquired as  a homestead  by Maria Diaz in the year 1939, by virtue  of  her H.A.  No. 229763 (Entry No. 138890), approved by  the Secretary of Agriculture  and  Natural Resources on November  29, 1950;  that plaintiffs  herein, parents of Maria Diaz,  succeeded to the possession of the said homestead; that defendants  illegally took  possession of a portion of the said homestead, containing an  area of 6 hectares and yielding an annual harvest of 480  cavans of palay valued at P7.00 per cavan.  They pray that judgment  be  rendered ordering the defendants to deliver  to them the land in question together with  its annual produce since  1948 up to the termination of the case, and  to pay the costs. <br><br>The  defendants  filed a motion to dismiss, but  tne same was denied.  As  the defendants failed  to  file an answer, they were declared in  default, and after presentation  of the evidence for  the  plaintiff, judgment was  rendered ordering the restoration of the land to the plaintiffs, the payment  of P2,100 by  the defendants to the  plaintiffs, and the payment  of costs.   On November 18,  1953, the decision was, however,  set aside  on a motion  for relief from judgment, because the court  found that the attorney for the defendants was not furnished  with copy  of the order of the court denying  the motion to dismiss.  The order set the case for trial  in the 1954 calendar. <br><br>Subsequently,  however, the defendants were  again declared  in default, and after a hearing of the evidence for the plaintiffs, the  court again rendered a judgment identical to that which it  has previously promulgated.  This was  on August  25, 1955.  Upon notice of the  judgment the defendants moved for a new trial on  the ground that the lawyers who received a copy  of the  order  for relief from  judgment was not their counsel  but one  who was temporarily engaged  by  them; that the  failure  of  the defendant's  attorney to file their answer  within  the  time fixed  by the Rules was  due to  excusable negligence  of their  counsel;  that they have a  good and  meritorious defense because defendant Pascual Macalinao  is another homestead  applicant  and  his  application conflicts  with that of the  late  Maria  Diaz, predecessor-in-interest  of the plaintiffs, and that  the other  defendants have  no interest or right over the land subject matter of the  action. The court, however, denied  the motion  for new trial, and upon such  denial and after  a denial also of the  motion for  reconsideration of the  order  of  denial, they  appeal directly  to this Court. <br><br>The assignment  of  errors raised on  this  appeal is as follows: <br><blockquote>"1.  The trial  court erred in  not  sustaining the  defendants-appellants' motion to  dismiss on the ground  that  said court has no jurisdiction of the  subject-matter of the action or suit. <br><br>2. The trial court erred in  holding that its decision by default of August 25,  1955,  has already  become final  and  executory, and therefore  could no longer  be set aside and grant a new trial to the defendants-appellants. <br><br>3. The trial court erred in  not entertaining defendants-appellants' motion for new  trial  so as to  afford them the  chance of putting up their  defense of res  adjudicata."  (pp. 1  &amp; 2, Brief  for the Defendants-appellants.) </blockquote>In  support of the first  assignment of  error it is  argued that  as  the land subject matter  of  the action is  still  a part  of  the public  domain,  no  homestead  patent or title has been issued as  yet, and consequently the one that has jurisdiction over the case is the Director of Lands.   The action presented is  not one  of ownership, although plaintiffs allege  ownership  and pray that the land be declared in their  favor.  However, the  allegation of ownership in the complaint  is not incompatible with the allegation that the plaintiffs have succeeded to the right of a homesteader who has  been  granted entry but  to  whom no  homestead patent has  yet been issued.   The allegation of ownership and  the  prayer therefor  may, therefore, be considered as a mere surplusage and this  case be considered as an action for possession.  The complaint alleges that the  defendants entered  possession  in  1948.   The  case  is, therefore,  one for the determination  of  the right of possession, whether it is  the plaintiffs  or the  defendants who have a right thereto.   Inasmuch as the possession of the defendants has lasted for more than three  years,  there is no  doubt that the action  falls within  the  jurisdiction of the  court of first instance and not of the justice of the  peace of court. <br><br>The  contention  that  the Director  of Lands  has the jurisdiction to determine which of the rival homesteaders should  be entitled  to  possess is without  merit.  A  homestead entry having been permitted by the Director of Lands the homestead is segregated from the public domain and the Director  of Lands  divested  of the  control and  possession  thereof  except  if the application  is  finally  disapproved and the entry  annulled or revoked. <br><br>There is also no  merit in the  second  assignment of error.   The record sustains the finding of  the trial court that the motion for  new trial  was  presented after the judgment had become final and executory.  The first order of default was issued on June 15, 1953 and  the defendants learned of the decision on  September 26, 1953, and the decision was  a  default  judgment.  As a matter of fact the court set aside  the first judgment of default on November  18,  1953.  Since September  26,  1953, when the defendants presented their  motion  to set aside the judgment, they were  aware that they had not presented their answer.   From that day,   September 26, 1953, up to the second judgment by default on August 25, 1955, the defendants had not  filed their answer to  all,  inspite of the  fact that the court had set aside its previous judgment by default to give  an  opportunity to  the  defendants to file  an  answer to the  complaint.  The reason given to the  effect  that another lawyer was notified  of the order setting aside the judgment  of the court is no  excuse for delaying the presentation of  an answer.   The  lawyer who appeared  for defendants to secure the  relief from the first default judgment was  the lawyer who  should be notified of the order  of relief  and  the defendants were bound  by the  notice to such lawyer.  Since  the  notification  to their lawyer no answer had been presented by defendants and  such  notification  took place around September  26, 1953.   So  that for about two years they have failed  to file an answer  and they cannot claim now  that they have  presented  their motion for new trial  in  due time. <br><br>The resolution of the  second assignment  of error renders unnecessary the  consideration of the  third  assignment. <br><br>Judgment is hereby affirmed, with costs against defendants-appelllants. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
