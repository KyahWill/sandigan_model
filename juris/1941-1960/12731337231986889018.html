				G.R. No.L-11073, May 30, 1958</h4>
				<H3>HEIRS OF MELECIO ARCEO, CLAIMANTS AND APPELLEES, VS. ANDRES E. VARELA, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by Andres E. Varela from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Batangas in its Cadastral Case No. 50, G.L.R.O. Record No. 1820, 
adjudging and decreeing the registration of Lot No. 14076 of the Batangas 
Cadastre in the name of claimants Heirs of Melecio Arceo. The land involved, 
together with the improvements thereon, appears to have a total assessed value 
of P1,640.00. <p></p>
<p>Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p><i>The trial court erred in holding that ownership of Lot No. 14076 has been 
proved by the decision in civil case No, 4001, as affirmed in G. R. No. L-3052, 
promulgated on June 29, 1954.</i></p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p><i>The trial court erred in holding that possession and ownership of Lot No. 
14076 by appellees have been proved by their testimonial and documentary 
evidence.</i></p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p><i>The trial court erred in not giving credence to appellant's testimonial 
and documentary evidence, and in not decreeing Lot No. 14076 to 
appellant.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Considering that the value of the subject-matter of the case is less than 
P50,000, and the appeal raises questions of fact as shown by the above 
assignment of errors, the present appeal falls within the exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in accordance with the provisions of sec. 31 of the Judiciary Act 
of 1948 as amended, this appeal is ordered certified to the Court of Appeals 
there to be decided and disposed of in accordance with law.</p>
<p><i>Paras C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Endencia, 
</i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></p></div>
