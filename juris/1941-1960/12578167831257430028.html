				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an amended complaint for Damages, resulting allegedly from a violation of 
contractual rights over fish corrals, filed by Florentino Importante against the 
municipality of Tabiao, Antique, its Mayor, members of the council and four (4) 
private individuals, petitioner Jose L. Lagrimas, Provincial Fiscal of Antique, 
was included as defendant, in his capacity as such (CFI Case No. 836). The basis 
of his inclusion as a co-defendant, may be gleaned from the following 
allegations in the amended complaint, signed by Attys. Buenaventura Tolentino, 
Esdras F. Tayco and Calixto O. Zaldivar.
<blockquote>
<p>"14. That on January 28, 1966, the Chief of Police of Tibiao, Antique, filed 
Criminal Case No. 1185, in the Justice of the Peace of Tibiao, Antique, entitled 
'People of the Philippines <em>vs</em>. Lydia Sarmiento, Felipe Sarmiento, 
Victor Gindap and Norberto Faren, accused, for violation of Paragraph (b) 
Section 26, of Ordinance No. 9, in connection with Schedule G-1-Y, of Ordinance 
No. 6, Series of 1954, of the Municipality of Tibiao, Antique, but on February 
25, 1966, the Provincial Fiscal personally citing his opinions of December 24, 
1955, end February 8, 1966, respectively filed a Motion for the Dismissal of the 
above-entitled ease, and the same was dismissed;</p>
<p>15. That Criminal Case No. 1185 against the defendants Lydia Sarmiento, 
Felipe Sarmiento Victor Gindap and Norberto Faren was a meritoriou's case and 
had it been prosecuted the fish corral of the defendants would have been removed 
or demolished and the rights of plaintiff safeguarded."</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 22, 1956, the petitioner Provincial Fiscal presented his Answer 
to the amended complaint with a Counterclaim. On March 13, 1857, believing that 
counsel for plaintiff Importante were responsible for his (Petitioner's) 
inclusion in the amended complaint, the petitioner caused to be filed a 
Third-Party complaint for damages against said lawyers, alleging1 among others,, 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"6. That third-party defendants, Attys. Buenaventura Tolentino, Esdras F. 
Tayco and Calixto O. Zaldivar, through mutual understanding and combination with 
the original plaintiff-Florentino Importante know full well that the amended 
complaint,, with particular reference to the third-party plaintiff Fiscal Jose 
L. Lagrimas, is not only frivolously grounded and devoid of merit based on bad 
faith, but same is designed to further third-party defendants' professional 
propaganda, and wanton desire to cause insult, indignity, social humiliation, 
wounded feelings and mental suffering of the latter (Fiscal Lagrimas), and to 
besmirch his reputation, integrity, good name and standing of said third-party 
plaintiff, both in his private capacity as a lawyer and official capacity as 
Provincial Fiscal of Antique thereby causing him endless professional and 
official embarrassment, and in contempt and public ridicule."</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 19, 1957, the trial court denied admission of the third-party 
complaint, stating that it did not meet the requirements of Sections 1 and 2, 
Rule 12 of the Rules of Court, as his claim for damages was not in any manner 
related to the claim of the plaintiff. In support of its ruling, the respondent 
judge cited the case of Cayapas vs. Court of First Instance of Albay, 77 Phil., 
181, holding that it is not a court's duty especially enjoined by law to admit a 
third-party complaint and that whether a party to an action shall be allowed to 
implead an additional party, rests in the discretion of the court. A motion for 
reconsideration was seasonably presented, petitioner Lagrimas contending that it 
is immaterial that a third-party plaintiff states a cause of action against the 
third-party defendant on a theory different from that asserted by the plaintiff 
against the defendant. He also pointed out that the rival claims of plaintiff 
Importante and his (Lagrimas) arose and descended from the same network of 
correlated circumstances and incidents brought about by unlawful acts or 
omissions described in the pleadings of the parties concerned; that third-party 
plaintiff would not have suffered his claim for damages, if the original 
plaintiff through the instrumentality and legal guidance of his counsel, had not 
unnecessarily and unlawfully included him as a co-defendant in the amended 
complaint. The motion for reconsideration was denied on March 30, 1957.</p>
<p>An appeal from the orders of March 19 and 30, 1957, was perfected within the 
reglementary period. On April 6, 1957, however, the respondent judge disapproved 
said appeal on the ground that the orders are interlocutory and, therefore, not 
subject of appeal. The motion for reconsideration on the order disapproving the 
appeal was denied on June 15, 1957.</p>
<p>The matter is now before us on Certiorari and Mandamus with Preliminary 
Injunction, petitioner alleging that the respondent judge acted with grave abuse 
of discretion or in excess of his jurisdiction, in disallowing his appeal from 
the orders complained of and that he has unlawfully neglected in the performance 
of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from his 
office, and/or has unlawfully excluded petitioner from hia right to appeal, 
there being no appeal or other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary 
course of law within the proceedings of the basic civil case No. 836 available 
to petitioner. Respondent judge denied knowledge and/or information regarding 
the inclusion of petitioner as a party defendant, upon the advice and guidance 
of counsel for plaintiff Importante.</p>
<p>Under the facts of record, it seems that the dominant issue in the case is 
whether or not mandamus will lie, which necessarily involves the determination 
of the character or nature of the orders in question.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that mandamus is the proper remedy to compel the 
respondent judge to approve the appeal taken, considering the fact that the 
petitioner has established a clear and certain right to invoke it. (Zamora 
<em>vs</em>. Wright, 53 Phil., 613). The orders appealed from are not 
interlocutory in nature, but are final and appealable and, therefore, come 
within the pale of the last portion of Section 2, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, 
which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No interlocutory or incidental judgment or order shall stay the progress of 
an action, nor shall it be the subject of appeal until final judgment or order 
is rendered for one party or the other."</p></blockquote>
<p>When the respondent Court declared that its order of March 19, 1957, denying 
the admission of the third-party complaint, was interlocutory, it finally 
disposed of third Party plaintiff's action within the proceedings of civil case 
No. 836, leaving nothing more that can be done with it in the Court of First 
Instance of Antique. The declaration was a final order or judgment rendered 
against the action of the third-party plaintiff, which automatically threw his 
case (third-party complaint) out of court, a situation which only an appeal 
therefrom could have remedied, while it may be true that the proceedings in tlie 
main case could) continue, the pending matter litigated ' between the 
third-party plaintiff and the third-party defendants was finally terminated by 
the orders in question, "An order or a judgment is deemed final when it finally 
disposes of the pending action so that nothing more can be done with it in the 
trial court (I Moran's Rules of Court, 1957 Ed., p. 638).</p>
<p>In view of the conclusions reached, it is deemed unnecessary for the purposes 
of this opinion, to pass upon the merits of the petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the respondent court dated April 6, 1957, 
disapproving the record on appeal filed by petitioner, dated April 2, 1957 
(Annex I, petition). and the order of the respondent court denying the motion 
for reconsideration of said order dated June 15, 1957 (Annex K) are hereby set 
aside and annulled; and the respondent court is directed to approve, certify and 
elevate the record on appeal to the appropriate appellate court in accordance 
with law.</p>
<p>Without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Orders set aside and annulled.</em></p></div>
