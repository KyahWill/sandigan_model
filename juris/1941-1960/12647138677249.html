				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action to compel the Lepanto  Consolidated Mining Company to transfer or register in its books 2,500 shares of its stock sold by the  plaintiff  in his capacity as ancillary administrator of  the estate of the late Walter C. Wurdeman,  the  registered owner thereof, on  the Manila Stock Exchange  on 27 August 1952 through  the brokerage  firm  of  Hall,  Picornell,  Ortigas  &amp; Company at P0.81 per share, in  compliance with an  order  of  the pines and  expenses of  administration of  the  estate,  the transfer  and registration of which  were  refused by  the defendant  despite presentation  of certificate  No. 10578 for 7,500 shares in the name of Walter C. Wurdeman duly indorsed  for the  transfer of 2,500 shares  by the plaintiff as ancillary administrator of the estate and  of a copy of the order of the probate court entered in the special proceedings  for ancillary administration of the  estate of  the late Walter C. Wurdeman, to  recover P178.13, the difference between the selling price at P0.81 a share of 2,500 shares sold in the manner  and  form already  stated and the purchase price at F0.84 per share of the same number of shares at which the plaintiff as  administrator  of  the estate had to pay to  meet and  fulfill his  commitment to the brokers as a result of the defendant's refusal to transfer the number  of shares of the estate sold for the purpose and  in the  manner above stated; to recover  P1,000 for attorney's  fees  and  expenses of litigation; and  to have  and receive such other and further relief as  the Court may  deem proper to grant.</p>
<p>Answering the plaintiff's complaint, the defendant  admits that it refused to comply with the plaintiff's demand to take out  of  certificate No.  10578 representing 7,500 shares of its stock registered  in  the  name of Walter C. Wurdeman,  a non-resident,  2,500 shares to  be  used in the name of Hall, Picornell, Ortigas &amp; Company,  for the reason that the defendant could not change the registered owner of the aforesaid  shares from a non-resident to a resident without a prior  license from the  Central Bank or any of its authorized  representatives; that the transfer or registration  demanded by the  plaintiff was penalized by the Central  Bank  regulations;  that the order  of the probate court authorizing the  sale of the  shares belonging to the estate of the late Walter C. Wurdeman was void, because there was no proof in the record of the publication of notice to creditors requiring them  to file their  claims, as provided for in section 3,  Rule 87,  and  as directed by the Court in its order of 19 November 1951,  and because the petition to sell personal assets of the  estate of the deceased located in the Philippines was not accompanied by proof of notice to interested  persons, by publication or otherwise,  as required  by Section 7, Rule  90; that assuming that the  order  of  the Court  to sell part of the assets of the  estate of the deceased was valid, the order could not override the regulations of th Central Bank; that the amount of damages the plaintiff  claimed to  have suffered, as stated in his  second  cause of action, was caused  not by the defendant but by the plaintiff himself for refusing to secure the license required by the regulations of the Central Bank  which  could hav6 been easily obtained from any of the authorized security  dealers at  no expense to the estate  of the late Walter C.  Wurdeman;  that not only was there  no  need for bringing this action and for incurring expenses  and attorney's fees  for the reason just mentioned but also because section 7, Rule 86, provides  that "When the executor or administrator is an attorney  he shall  not charge  against  the  estate any professional  fees  for  legal  services rendered by him;" that the plaintiff is an attorney; that because the  defendant was required to appear in court and to defend  itself in this case in which it has absolutely no  interest,  pecuniary or otherwise, outside of complying with the law and guarding against a possible criminal liability should the act demanded by the plaintiff be recklessly  complied  with, this action is wholly frivolous,  vexatious and unfounded, and  under Article 2208,  sections 1 and 4, of  the new Civil Code, attorney's fees  and expenses of litigation  other than judicial costs may be recovered.  Upon these allegations  it  prays that the complaint be  dismissed  with costs against the plaintiff and the latter be  ordered to pay the defendant  P2,000 for attorney's fees.</p>
<p>The plaintiff  denies  that the action is frivolous and claims that it is just, equitable and legal; that the defendant  should  not be  granted indemnity for  damages  in the sum of P2,000, for the defendant has suffered  none. Upon  motion  of the  defendant,  the  Solicitor  General was directed to appear, the validity of the  regulations of the Central Bank being involved and assailed.</p>
<p>After  hearing, the Court rendered judgment  declaring that  as  "the regulations of the  Central  Bank subjecting to license  all transactions in gold and  foreign  exchange are within the power and  authority conferred upon  it by Republic Act No. 265," the defendant  is  not liable for any damage that the plaintiff may have suffered by reason of its refusal to register in its books the transfer of  2,500 shares of  its stock to the  brokerage firm Hall, Picornell, Ortigas  &amp; Company presented to it for transfer  and registration without the license of the Central Bank.   The Court dismissed the defendant's counterclaim for  damages but the  costs were taxed against the plaintiff.   In effect, the Court dismissed the complaint and  the counterclaim. In support of its judgment the  Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There can be no doubt that the sale of shares of stock belonging to a  non-resident  involves transaction  in  foreign  exchange. By that  sale  the dividends accruing to the foreign  resident will  be diminished to the extent of  the value of the shares  of  stock sold to a resident of the Philippines.  Any transaction  involving assets within the  Philippines  owned  by  a non-resident  will necessarily involve  exchange operations  because should the transaction  be a sale, the  proceeds will ultimately  be sent abroad, or should  the transaction be a purchase by a  non-resident, payment will have to be made in  foreign currency.  The transaction in question involves exchange  between  Philippine peso and American dollar.  The  regulations, therefore, of the Central  Bank,  particularly  Circular No. 20, are  within the powers and authority  conferred upon  it by  the legislature and consequently the same are valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A  motion for reconsideration was denied.  Hence  this appeal.</p>
<p>Under and pursuant to the provisions  of  section 74 of Republic Act No.  265 which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the third paragraph of  the preceding section, in order to protect the international reserve of the Central  Bank during an exchange crisis and to give the Monetary Board  and the Government time in which to take  constructive  measures  to combat such a crisis, the Monetary Board, with the concurrence  of at least  five of its members, and with the  approval of the President of the Philippines, may temporarily suspend or restrict sales  of exchange  by the Central Bank and may subject all transactions  in gold and foreign  exchange  to  license  by  the Central  Bank.  The adoption of  the emergency measures authorized in this  section shall be subject  to  any executive and  international agreement to  which the Republic  of  the Philippines  is a  party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Central  Bank promulgated on  9  December 1949 Circular No.  20 which partly provides:</p>
<p>Restrictions On Gold And Foreign Exchange Transactions,</p>
<ol>
  <li> Pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No.  265 (Central Bank Act)  the  Monetary Board, by unanimous vote and with the approval  of the President  of  the Philippines, and  in accordance with Executive and International Agreements  to which the Republic of the  Philippines  is a  party,  hereby restricts sales  of exchange by the Central Bank and subjects all transactions in gold and foreign exchange to licensing  by the Central Bank.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Transactions  in the assets described  below and  all dealings in them of whatever nature, including, where applicable, their exportation and  importation, shall not be effected,  except with respect to deposit  accounts included in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph, when such deposit  accounts are  owned  by,  and in the name of, banks.
    <blockquote>
      <p>(<em>a</em>)  Any and all  assets, provided  they are  held  through, in, or with banks  or banking institutions located in the Philippines, including money,  checks, drafts,  bullions, bank  drafts, deposit accounts  (demand, time and  savings),  all debts, indebtedness or  obligations,  financial  securities  commonly dealt in  by  bankers, brokers  and  investment  houses,  notes,  debentures,  stocks, bonds, coupons, bank acceptances,  mortgages, pledges,  liens or  other rights  in the nature  of security, expressed in foreign currencies,  or if  payable abroad,  irrespective  of   the  currency in  which  they   are  expressed,  and belonging to any  person,  firm,  partnership, association,  branch office,  company or  other  unincorporated   body or  corporation residing or located within the  Philippines;</p>
      <p>(<em>b</em>)  Any and all assets of the kinds included and or described in  sub-paragraph (a)  above, whether or  not held through, in, or  with banks or banking institutions, and existent within the Philippines, <em>which  belong to  any  person,  firm,</em>  partnership, association, branch office,  agency, company  or other unincorporated body  or corporation <em>not  residing  or  located within the Philippines; </em>(Italics  supplied.)</p>
      <p>(<em>c</em>)  Any and all assets existent within the Philippines including money,  checks, drafts,  bullions, bank drafts, all debts, indebtedness or obligations, financial  securities commonly dealt in by bankers, brokers and investment houses, notes, debentures, stock,  bonds,  coupons, bank acceptances, mortgages,  pledges, liens or other  rights  in  the nature of  security expressed in foreign currencies, or if payable abroad, irrespective of the  currency  in which they are expressed,  and belonging to  any  person, firm,  partnership, association, branch office, agency, company or other  unincorporated body  or corporation  residing or located within the Philippines.   (47  Off. Gaz. 5567.)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Supplemented   by  "Notification  to  Authorized  Security Dealers No. 1,"  promulgated  on 18 January  1950  which partly provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. <em>Security  transactions  for which licenses  are required</em>— a. Every sale, assignment, encumbrance, transfer,  or delivery of securities by a resident of the Philippines to a non-resident requires a license.  This  applies  to  transactions  in   both  Philippine  and foreign securities  whether the  transactions  are effected  in  the Philippines or outside and whether or not an export or import of securities is involved.  A resident broker or dealer who is effecting a purchase  of securities in the Philippines for a  non-resident is regarded as the resident selling such securities to a  non-resident even though the  broker or dealer is acting as  agent  and  not as principal in  the transaction; a, license is, therefore, required by the broker or dealer for  such a transaction.  Applications  for licenses to engage in such transactions should be filed on E. C. Form X.</p>
  <p><em>b</em>. Every export  of securities from the  Philippines  requires  a license.  Applications for  such licenses  should  be  filed  on  E. C. Form X.</p>
  <p><em>c</em>. A license  is required for all of the following security transactions and applications therefore should be  filed  on E.  C.  Form Y.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) <em>Every sale of securities in the Philippines or for delivery</em> in the Philippines  by  a non-resident;  and</p>
    <p>(2) <em>Every purchase by a resident of any securities owned by a non-resident, or the sale in the Philippines by a resident of any securities for or owned by  a non-resident,</em>  unless</p>
    <p>(<em>i</em>)  A license  has been granted  to the non-resident  authorizing the sale;  or</p>
    <p>(<em>ii</em>)  The purchase arises out of an exchange  of securities for  which a  license has been granted pursuant to  an  application  made  on  E. C.  Form X.  (Exhibit  6).  Italics supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and by  "Notification  to Authorized Agents No.  25." promulgated on 17 February 1950,  which partly  provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In general the  foreign  exchange  control  regulations  affect <em>all transactions</em>  having  international  financial  implications.   The  following is  a partial  list of various  classes of  transactions  which requires authorization by or on behalf of the  Central Bank:</p>
  <p>(<em>a</em>)  Purchases and sales  of, and other dealings in,  foreign  exchange ;</p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>)  Payments in pesos by residents to, or  to  accounts  of, non-residents;</p>
  <p>(<em>c</em>)  Exports of coin,  currency, checks, drafts,  traveller's checks, etc.;</p>
  <p>(<em>d</em>)  Exports of securities;</p>
  <p>(<em>e</em>)  Sales, assignments, incumbrances,  transfers,  and  deliveries of securities by residents to non-residents, either  in the Philippines or elsewhere, and purchases etc. in the Philippines of securities by non-residents from resident;  and</p>
  <p>(<em>f</em>) <em>Sales of  securities in the  Philippines by  non-residents and purchases  of securities  by residents  from  non-residents,</em>  either in the  Philippines or  elsewhere.  (Exhibit  4.)   (Italics  supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two notifications were not published in the Official Gazette.</p>
<p>The authority granted to the Central Bank under section 74,  Republic Act No.  265 is to "temporarily suspend  or restrict sales of exchange *  *  *  and may subject all transactions  in gold and foreign exchange to license" "in order to protect the international reserve of the Central Bank during an exchange crisis and to give the Monetary Board and the Government time in which to  take constructive measures to combat such a crisis."  And  "the Monetary Board, with the concurrence of at least five of its members, and with the approval  of the President of the Philippines," may take such step, to wit: to "temporarily suspend  or restrict  sales of exchange by the Central  Bank  and may subject  all transactions in gold and foreign exchange  to license by the Central Bank."</p>
<p>Foreign exchange is  the conversion of  an amount  of money  or currency of one country into  an equivalent amount of money or currency of  another.  If that is what foreign exchange is and means, we fail to see how a sale of shares of stock of a domestic corporation belonging  to  a non-resident for  the  purpose of paying taxes due the Government  of the Republic or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or  instrumentalities and expenses incurred in the administration of the estate of a  deceased may  be considered  a  transaction in  foreign  exchange. By the  sale of the shares  of stock  belonging to a  non-resident to a resident,  dividends declared from time  to time  by the corporation, accruing and payable to  a non-resident before the sale, part of which could only be remitted to him, as provided for  in the regulations of the Central  Bank, would  no longer accrue and be payable to the  non-resident but to  the resident  purchaser.   In that case, we again fail to  see how the disappearance or absence  of the need or reason for remitting part of the dividends to  a non-resident  because they  are  due and payable to the resident purchaser may  still be deemed a transaction  in  foreign  exchange.  The probability of  remittance abroad of the proceeds of the sale  of shares to a non-resident  seller thereof does not make the sale of the shares to a resident a transaction in foreign exchange. A probable  or  possible  remittance  abroad  of  the proceeds of the sale  of  the shares  is not a transaction in  foreign exchange.   It is no transaction at  all.  When such remittance is  to  be  made the Central Bank steps in, as no  remittance of funds abroad may be effected  without the approval or license of the Central Bank.  Take  a case where a  non-resident is not the seller but the purchaser of the shares.   A non-resident purchaser has to  use  his foreign  funds   and  convert them into pesos to   enable him  to purchase the  shares  of stock.  Such conversion cannot be made without  the  intervention of  the  Central Bank. Or,  he  may avail himself of the  funds   (pesos) belonging to another and credit the latter with an  amount in foreign   currency equivalent to the sum he had used to purchase the shares of stock.  The only conceivable way  of regarding the last transaction as one in  foreign exchange would be because of the remittance of  part of the dividends  that the corporation  may  declare  to the non-resident shareholder.   But  then  again  the   Central Bank would have a hand in such a remittance for without its approval or license part of such  dividends could not be sent abroad to the non-resident  shareholder.</p>
<p>If the  Central Bank  regulations above transcribed and quoted are  to  be construed as  subjecting to license  all transactions similar to the one involved in the instant case, we do not  hesitate to hold that  such  regulations as thus construed are <em>ultra vires,</em> because they do not come within the authority granted in section 74 of Republic Act No. 265. Nevertheless, the defendant  cannot  be held answerable for damages, because it only complied with the regulations of the Central  Bank and it was not within  its competence to interpret but to comply with  such  regulations.   There is no evidence  as to the  amount of damages  suffered  by the defendant by reason of the institution of  this action by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Conformably thereto, the  judgment  appealed  from is reversed  insofar aa it dismisses the first cause of action of the complaint and affirmed insofar as it dismisses the second and third causes of action thereof and the counter-claim.  The defendant is directed to transfer and register the 2,500 shares of its stock sold by the  plaintiff in his capacity  as ancillary administrator of the estate  of the late Walter  C. Wurdeman  to  the brokerage  firm Hall, Picornell, Ortigas &amp; Company without the license required by the Central Bank.  No  costs shall  be taxed in  both instances.</p>
