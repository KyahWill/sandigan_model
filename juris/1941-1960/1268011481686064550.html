				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In December 1946 the administratrix of the estate of the 
deceased Ramon S. Araneta requested the Court of First Instance of Occidental 
Negros to order the register of deeds of said province to cancel the mortgage 
and incidental assignment of sugar annotated on the back of transfer Certificate 
of Title No. 31593 in the name of Ramon S. Araneta. She alleged in substance 
that said annotation had been made in March 1940 when said property was 
mortgaged to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank as security for the payment of 
a loan in the principal sum of P125,000; that said loan has been fully 
discharged in August 1944, as shown by the supporting papers; and that the 
corresponding deed of cancellation which had been executed could not be 
presented to the court because it was lost in the office of the deceased in 
Manila during the liberation.
<p align="justify">The Agricultural and Industrial Bank replied that the 
indebtedness had been paid in Japanese military notes on the date mentioned. It 
prayed, however, that the cancellation be made subject to the provisions of 
paragraph 1 of Circular No. 14, dated August 25, 1945 of the'Secretary of 
Justice, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. Deeds, documents and other papers executed and/or 
acknowledged during the Japanese occupation, and filed for registration during 
or after said occupation, may be registered, if found to comply with the 
formalities prescribed in the existing laws and regulations; but, as a 
precautionary measure, the certificates to be issued and or the memoranda to be 
made on the proper certificates of title, in pursuance of such deeds, documents 
or papers, shall bear an annotation to the effect that the transaction involved 
is subject to such further dispositions as may be made by the Commonwealth 
Government with respect thereto."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Honorable Buenaventura Cordova, Judge, ordered the 
cancellation of the mortgage annotation without subjecting the cancellation to 
the provisions of the aforesaid circular. The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation 
as successor to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, after submitting a 
petition for reconsideration which was denied, appealed to this Court. It 
insists that the cancellation should be made "subject to such further 
disposition as may be made by the Commonwealth Government with respect" to 
transactions made during the Japanese occupation in compliance with the 
aforesaid departmental circular.</p>
<p align="justify">In Lim v. Register of Deeds, G. R. No. L-1739, February 3, 
1949,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> we passed upon a similar 
situation. We upheld the intention that cancellation of mortgages paid during 
the Japanese occupation need not be subject to the conditions stated in the 
circular herein mentioned. We said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"There is no doubt that the above-quoted annotation in the deed 
of cancellation of the mortgage would be an incumbrance on the title or a charge 
on.the property of the petitioners, because it would make the title to the 
property subject to any action which the government may take on the validity of 
the payments made with Japanese War Notes, so that in case the Government, 
through Congress or the Supreme Court of the Philippines, declares those 
payments invalid the property would have to continue as a security for the 
payment of the mortgage obligation.</p>
<p align="justify">"According to Sec. 39 of Act No. 496, as amended, every 
subsequent purchaser of a registered land under the Torrens System who takes a 
transfer certificate of title for value in good faith, shall hold the same free 
of all incumbrance, except those noted on the certificate and any of the legal 
incumbrances enumerated in said section. It is obvious, and of judicial notice, 
that such incumbrance was not and could not have been noted on the transfer 
certificate of title No. 21783 nor on the deed of cancellation of the mortgage 
executed by the Agricultural and Industrial Bank on June 5, 1944, and filed for 
registration on October 3, 1944, which were lost or destroyed during the 
liberation according to Annex A, above quoted. Therefore, the Secretary of 
Justice had no power or authority to order or direct, by Circular No. 14, series 
of 1945, the respondent Register of Deeds to insert such annotation, and 
reciprocally the latter is not bound to comply with such instruction.</p>
<p align="justify">"Under Sec. 79 (B) of the Administrative Code the Secretary of 
Justice is only empowered to promulgate rules, regulations, orders, circulars 
and other instructions <i>not contrary to law</i>, to all offices and 
dependencies of his department; and compliance with the instruction in question 
would be contrary to the Constitution, for it would impair the obligations ox 
contract or deprive a person of his property without due process of law. it can 
not be contended that the Secretary of Justice issued said circular in the 
exercise of the police power of the State, because Congress has not delegated 
such power to the Secretary of Justice. The sovereign police power is exercised 
by the State through its legislative branch; and its valid exercise may be and 
are, generally, delegated to towns, municipalities, and cities, and sometimes 
also to the Chief Executive in case of national emergency. (Primicias v. Fugoso, 
G. R. No. L-1800, promulgated January 27, 1948.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> But is it a well settled rule that a 
legislative power delegated to a body or person cannot be delegated by the 
latter to another.</p>
<p align="justify">"But even if the annotation in question were not an 
incumbrance, and the Secretary of Justice had power to issue the aforesaid 
circular No. 14, such annotation would have no longer any effect and, therefore, 
the insertion thereof in documents relating to transactions consummated during 
the Japanese occupation would not serve any purpose, in view of the ruling laid 
down by this Supreme Court in the case of Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation, 
G. R. No. L-554;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Hongkong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation vs. Luis Perez Samanillo, G. R. No. L-1345,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in which it was held that payments made 
with Japanese war notes during the occupation of obligations contracted before 
the war to the creditor or his legal representative, and accepted by the latter, 
are valid and release the said obligations. Philippine Congress having not 
enacted any act on the matter, the ruling of this Court in the cases 
aforementioned is the disposition adopted by our government regarding 
transactions consummated during the Japanese occupation, to which said 
annotation refers."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the appealed order will be affirmed, with 
costs.</p>

<p align="center"><b>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>OZAETA, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the affirmance of the order appealed from for the 
reason that it has now been definitely decided by this court in Haw Pia vs. 
China Banking Corporation, G. R. No. L-554, and other subsequent cases that 
payments made with Japanese military notes during the occupation of obligations 
contracted before the war to the creditor or his legal representative, and 
accepted by the latter, are valid and release the said obligations.</p>
<p align="justify">I dissent from the decision of the majority insofar as it 
relies upon the opinion, or rather dictum, of this court in Lim vs. Register of 
Deeds, G. R. No. L-1739, that the Secretary of Justice had no power or authority 
to issue Circular No. 14, dated August 25, 1945, quoted in the majority 
decision. That opinion holds in effect that the Secretary of Justice issued the 
circular in question without authority of law, and even contrary to law. In 
justice to former Secretary of Justice Honorable Ramon Quisumbing who issued 
said circular, and in view of the fact that because of my absence from the 
Philippines I was not able to participate in the decision of Lim vs. Register of 
Deeds, I avail myself of this opportunity to show that said circular was 
necessary, proper, and legal.</p>
<p align="justify">Before the promulgation of the decision of this court in Haw 
Pia vs. China Banking Corporation on April 9, 1948, nobody knew—not even the 
members of this Court—whether or not payments made with Japanese war notes 
during the occupation of obligations contracted before the war were valid and 
released the said obligations. That question was one of the most vexing problems 
confronting the Government after the liberation. It could only be resolved 
either by the Congress of the Philippines or by the Supreme Court. A bill 
defining the policy of the Government on that question was presented in Congress 
in one of its postliberation sessions.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, mortgagors who had paid their prewar debts 
with Japanese military notes during the occupation were demanding of the various 
registers of deeds throughout the country the registration of the cancellation 
of their mortgages. The mortgagees, on the other hand, were opposing the 
registration of the cancellation of the mortgages on the ground that the payment 
with Japanese military notes was not valid. If the register of deeds should 
cancel outright the annotation of the mortgage before either the Congress or the 
Supreme Court should finally determine whether or not such payments were valid, 
the mortgage would have suffered injury in case it should be decided that such 
payments were invalid, because onee the encumbrance on the mortgaged property 
had been cancelled outright the owner could have freely disposed of the 
property.</p>
<p align="justify">In that situation Secretary Quisumbing, by Circular No. 14, 
instructed the registers of deeds to register deeds, documents, and other papers 
executed during the Japanese occupation and filed for registration during or 
after said occupation, if found to comply with the formalities prescribed by 
existing laws and regulations; "but, as a <i>precautionary measure</i>, the 
certificates to be issued and/or the memoranda to be made on the proper 
certificates of title, in pursuance of such deeds, documents, or papers, shall 
bear an annotation to the effect that the transaction involved is subject to 
such further dispositions as may be made by the Commonwealth Government with 
respect thereto."</p>
<p align="justify">In its decision in Lim vs. Register of Deeds, the Court admits 
that under section 79 (B) of the Administrative Code the Secretary of Justice is 
empowered to promulgate rules, regulations, orders, circulars, and other 
instructions <i>not contrary to law</i>, to all offices and dependencies of his 
Department. I know of no law that has been infringed by that circular. On the 
contrary I find that such a cautionary notice as that contemplated in the 
circular is authorized by article 42 of the Mortgage Law when a question as to 
the ownership of real property or the creation, declaration, modification, or 
extinction of any property right is <i>sub judice</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">The argument of the Court that compliance with the circular 
would be contrary to the Constitution, for it would impair the obligation of 
contracts or deprive a person of his property without due process of law, is not 
only farfetched but begs the very question involved in the issuance of said 
circular. The purpose of the cautionary notice required by the circular was to 
preserve the rights of the parties until the validity of the document sought to 
be registered was finally determined. The argument assumes the validity of the 
document or contract sought to be registered and ignores the fact that it was 
disputed and that the dispute was precisely what gave rise to the issuance of 
the circular. As a matter of fact the dispute was not settled until the 
promulgation of the decision of this court in the Haw Pia case three years 
later.</p>
<p align="justify">In any event, it was not necessary for the Court to pass upon 
the validity of the circular of the Secretary of Justice because that circular 
had ceased to have any force and effect since the promulgation of the decision 
in the Haw Pia case. The Court itself said that "even if ... the Secretary of 
Justice had power to issue the aforesaid Circular No. 14," it would no longer 
have any effect "in view of the ruling laid down by this Supreme Court in the 
case of Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation, G. R. No. L-554.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>"</p>
<p align="justify">MONTEMAYOR, J.:</p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the foregoing opinion.</p>
