				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a review under Rule 44 and section 6, Republic Act No. 875, of a judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations.<br><br>The petitioner Manila&nbsp; Lodge No. 761,&nbsp; B.P.O.E., owns the Elks Club that runs&nbsp; and operates&nbsp; a dining room (restaurant), kitchen and <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega </span>for the benefit and service of the members of the&nbsp; Lodge.&nbsp; Oh 15 September&nbsp; 1953, John F.&nbsp; Dwyer, the Chairman of the House Committee of the petitioner, wrote&nbsp; a letter&nbsp; to the President of the respondent&nbsp; union advising him that separate&nbsp; letters had been sent to 14 of its employees,&nbsp; 12 of whom&nbsp; were members of the union, ending their&nbsp; services effective 16 September 1953, the Club having decided to&nbsp; discontinue the operation of the dining room&nbsp; (restaurant), kitchen and <span style="font-style: italic;">bodega </span>because of "losses continuously suffered."&nbsp; In each letter a&nbsp; check&nbsp; covering&nbsp; one&nbsp; month&nbsp; salary for the period 16 September to 15 October 1953 was enclosed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recipients cashed their checks.<br><br>On 3 November 1953 the respondent union, in behalf of 12&nbsp; of its members employed by the petitioner who were separated from its service, filed in the Court of Industrial Relations charges&nbsp; of unfair labor practice&nbsp; against the petitioner.&nbsp; After a preliminary investigation,&nbsp; on 4 January 1954 the Court issued and caused to be served upon the&nbsp; petitioner and John&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Dwyer, its Chairman of the House Committee, a complaint charging them with unfair labor practice under the provisions of section 4, sub-section (a), paragraphs 1 and&nbsp; 4, Republic Act No. 875, and with violation of paragraph 5&nbsp; of the working&nbsp; agreement entered into by and between the petitioner and respondent union on 20 September 1950, which provides—<br><br>That in laying off of members of the union, the party of the first part (the petitioner) will consult the&nbsp; president and members of the board of&nbsp; directors of the second&nbsp; part (the respondent).<br><br>In its answer the petitioner denies that it&nbsp; committed unfair labor practice against the complaining employees and sets up the&nbsp; defense that their separation&nbsp; was&nbsp; due to continuous losses in the operation of its dining room (restaurant), kitchen and bodega.<br><br>The Court referred the case&nbsp; to an&nbsp; examiner for hearing. In&nbsp; the course of&nbsp; the hearing, the examiner directed the chief&nbsp; accounts examiner of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; to&nbsp; examine and report on the financial condition of the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The examination&nbsp; and report were made.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later&nbsp; on,&nbsp; also upon order of the examiner, the same chief&nbsp; accounts examiner submitted a&nbsp; supplemental report.&nbsp; After the parties&nbsp; had rested their respective case, on 12 August 1955&nbsp; the Court rendered judgment holding—<br><blockquote>* * * that the respondents committed acts of unfair labor practice as charged in the complaint.&nbsp; The respondent Elks&nbsp; Club, the chairman of the House Committee of Lodge No. 761, or its manager, or representative,&nbsp; or assigns, are hereby ordered: <br><br>1. To cease and desist from interfering, coercing or restraining or in any manner harassing&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of the complainant union in the free exercise&nbsp; of its right under the Act, or to discriminate the members of said union;<br><br>2. To&nbsp; do the following affirmative acts: (a) To reinstate the complainants or the members of the complainant union who were dismissed on September&nbsp; 16, 1953,&nbsp; with back pay&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; such privileges that they&nbsp; could have acquired were it not for their dismissal,&nbsp; from the&nbsp; time of&nbsp; their&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; to the time of their reinstatement, less what they have received&nbsp; as separation pay in lieu of notice; (b) To post copies of this decision in the&nbsp; conspicuous places of the following departments of the Club: (1) Club's executive office, (2) Bulletin&nbsp; board of&nbsp; the bowling alley, (3) In the men's room and&nbsp; (4) In the ladies lounge; and<br><br>3. To&nbsp; report to this Court within&nbsp; 15&nbsp; days from the time of the&nbsp; receipt of this decision, and&nbsp; every&nbsp; 10&nbsp; days&nbsp; thereafter for six&nbsp; months, compliance&nbsp; of this Decision.<br></blockquote>The motion for reconsideration and new trial was denied by the court <i>in banc</i>. Hence&nbsp; this appeal.<br><br>The petitioner contends that the&nbsp; court below erred in holding that it&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; no losses&nbsp; despite&nbsp; proof&nbsp; to&nbsp; the contrary as shown by its profit and loss statement; that to compel the petitioner to retain the services of the complaining employees despite showing&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is losing is illegal; that&nbsp; the trial court allowed itself to&nbsp; be influenced by supposed facts that&nbsp; have no&nbsp; materiality or&nbsp; bearing upon the questions at issue;&nbsp; that the closing of the&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; dining room (restaurant), kitchen&nbsp; and bodega which brought about the separation of the&nbsp; complaining employees from the service is not an unfair labor practice as defined in&nbsp; section 4,&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 875; and the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; ordering the reinstatement of the complaining&nbsp; employees.<br><br>Although the evidence shows that losses had been incurred by the petitioner in the operation of the&nbsp; dining room&nbsp; (restaurant),&nbsp; kitchen and&nbsp; bodega,&nbsp; yet such losses which brought about&nbsp; the separation of the 14 employees from the service&nbsp; are not decisive on the question brought to this Court for determination.<br><br>The Court of Industrial Relations found that—<br><blockquote> * *&nbsp; * the club is not a business&nbsp; proposition, run for profit; it is created1 for the benefit&nbsp; and service of the&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the Lodge. * * *.<br></blockquote>Adhering to the&nbsp; rule laid down in&nbsp; U.S.T.
