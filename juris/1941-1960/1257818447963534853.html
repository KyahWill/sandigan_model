				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil 
Case No. 27474, the dispositive portion of which states:
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the 
plaintiff, the Republic of the Philippines, and against the defendant, Alto 
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., ordering the latter to pay to the former the 
sum of P51,021.00, with legal interest from the date of filing of the complaint 
until it is fully paid, and the costs of suit."</p></blockquote>
<p>Briefly, the facts and circumstances of the case may be narrated as follows: 
On September 9, 1955, the plaintiff, Republic of the Philippines, filed suit 
against the defendant, Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., praying that the 
latter be condemned to pay the sum of P51,021.00 representing the liability 
assumed by it under Alto Bond No. C-9060, the pertinent terms and conditions of 
which are hereunder reproduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now therefore, for and in consideration of the above, we Ted Lewin, as 
principal, and the ALTO SURETY AND INSURANCE Co,, INC., a corporation duly 
organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines, as 
Surety, in consideration of the above and of the issuance by the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue to Ted In of a Tax Clearance, hereby jointly and severally bind 
ourselves in the sum of Pesos Fifty-one Thousand Twenty-One Only (P51.021.00), 
Philippine Currency, under the conditions that Ted Leivin will return to the 
Philippines within three (3) months from the date of his departure and should he 
fail to do so, that we be liable to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for his 
Corporate Tax Assessments in the amount first above-mentioned." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>which conditions, plaintiff asserts, were violated when Ted Lewin failed to 
return to this country within the period therein stipulated. In its answer, the 
defendant admitted that "its principal, Ted Lewin, has not returned to the 
Philippines notwithstanding the lapse of three months," but denied that he has 
no intention of returning. By ; way of special defense, the surety alleges that 
plaintiff, by its own act or acts, has prevented the compliance of the condition 
imposed on the bond, when, through its Department of Foreign Affairs, it issued 
Foreign Service Circular Noa. 329 and 428, dated December 2, 1953 and June 3, 
1954, respectively, the contents of which are mentioned elsewhere below.</p>
<p>At the trial, the parties submitted a stipulation of facts, which, for easy 
reference, is hereunder quoted in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"COME now plaintiff and defendant, thru respective undersigned attorneys, and 
to this Honorable Court respectively submit the following agreed statement of 
facts-"</p>
<p>1. That on June 15, 1953, the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed against 
and demanded from Messrs. Ted Lewin and Jose L. P. fe Leon the payment of the 
sum of P51,021.00 as corporate income! tax due from the latter for the year 
ending December 31, 1953;'</p>
<p>2. That on or about September 23, 1953, Mr. and Mrs. Ted Lewin applied for a 
tax clearance with the Bureau of Internal Revenue because they intend to leave 
the Philippines for the United States;</p>
<p>3. That because Ted Lewin has a pending tax liability in the aforesaid amount 
of P51,021.00 the Bureau of Internal Revenue required said Ted Lewin to file a 
surety bond in its favor in the same amount to guarantee his return to the 
Philippines to answer for his aforesaid tax liability;</p>
<p>4. That on September 25, 1953, Ted Lewin, as principal and the defendant Alto 
Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc., as surety, jointly and severally posted and 
filed a surety bond with the Bureau of Internal Revenue in thS amount of 
P51.021.00, which bond was accepted by Me latter office, 'under the condition 
that Ted Lewin would return to the Philippines within three (3) months from the 
date of his departure and should he fail to do so, that we shall be liable to 
the Bureau of Internal Revenue for his corporate tax assessments in the amount 
first above-mentioned.' A true copy of the bond is attached as Annexed 'A' to 
the complaint and made an integral part of this pleading;</p>
<p>5. That to assure the return of Ted Lewin. to the Philippines, he secured a 
Permit to Re-enter the Philippines, No. 70155, from the Bureau of Immigration, 
the date of its issue being September 16, 1954. A certified true copy of said 
'Permit to Re-enter the Philippines' is hereto attached and made a part of the 
pleading and is marked as Annex 'B';</p>
<p>6. That Ted Lewin left the Philippines on September 26, 1953, and has not 
returned to the Philippines within' the stipulated three months from the date of 
his departure;</p>
<p>7. That on December 9, 1953, the Department of Foreign Affairs issued Foreign 
Service Circular No. 329 to the effect that 'No-Philippine visa of any kind 
should be issued to this person (Ted Lewin) without prior authorization from the 
Department.' A true copy of the same is attached herewith as Annex 'C';</p>
<p>8. That on June 3, 1954, the Department .of Foreign Affairs issued again 
another Foreign Service Circular No. 428 directing- 'that the necessary steps 
should be immediately taken by all Philippines foreign service establishments 
abroad, particularly those in the United States from which he (Ted Lewin) might 
try to obtain a visa, with a view to refusing him readmission into this 
jurisdiction.' A true copy of the same is hereto attached as Annex 'D';</p>
<p>9. That on or about October 25, 1955, Ted Lewin managed to return to the 
Philippines on a seaman's visa, on board the vessel 'Maria Incs', which anchored 
at Manila Bay, and sought to re-enter the Philippines as a permanent resident 
but plaintiff did not allow him to land;</p>
<p>10. That on December 14, 1955, Ted Lewin instituted Civil Case No. 28309 in 
the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Commissioner of Immigration 
and the Commissioner of Customs for the purpose of releasing him from 
confinement but the herein plaintiff resisted said case resulting in the 
dismissal thereof, the Court stating in its decision that Ted Lewin has failed 
to state a cause of action to justify the issuance of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in accordance 
with the above agreed statement of facts."</p></blockquote>
<p>In this appeal, as well as in the lower court, the appellant surety company 
urges that by virtue of the act or acts of the appellee, mentioned from 
paragraphs 7 to 10 of the agreed stipulation of facts, either the latter is 
estopped from confiscating or forfeiting the bond in its favor or the appellant 
surety company was released from tÂ» liability under the same.</p>
<p>In the series of acts complained by the appellant, the , On'y one relevant to 
the present dispute refers to Foreign Service Circular No. 329 issued on 
December 2, 1953 (See Par. 7 of the Agreed stipulation of Facts, 
<em>supra</em>), to the effect that "No Philippine visa of any kind should be 
issued to this person (Ted Lewin) without prior author-' ization from the 
Department". The others have no pertinence to the case, considering that they 
took place after the three-month period fixed in the bond; so that, whether true 
or untrue, they have little or no significance on appellant's liability or 
non-liability under the bond.</p>
<p>Basing the resolution of the case solely on the facts as found by the lower 
court, this being an appeal by certio-rari, there is little doubt but that it 
was correct in rendering the decision appealed from. It appears that Ted Lewin 
was issued, before his departure (and before Alto Bond No. C-9060 was executed 
by and between the parties), a reentry permit by the government, wherein it was 
expressly provided that possession thereof "relieves the alien to whom it is 
issued from the necessity of securing a visa from a Philippine or United States 
consul before returning to this country." The same had an expiry date of March 
16, 1954. The questioned foreign service circular (No. 329), it will be 
observed, did not revoke or cancel the said reentry permit. Nothing therein is 
said or mentioned that would warrant a different conclusion. There was, 
accordingly, no necessity for him (Lewin) to still secure a visa to be able to 
return to this country within the aforesaid period of three months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it had been shown that Foreign Service Circular No. 329 
had the effect, one way or the other, of preventing the principal, Ted Lewin, 
from being able to return to the Philippines within the stipulated term of the 
bond or that it <em>actually</em> increased the risk originally undertaken by 
the surety company, such circular, an act of the appellee, might have had the 
effect of discharging the appellant from its agreed liability or, at least, of 
justifying Lewin's failure to return within the required period. But no such 
showing was made during the trial nor was anything to that effect mentioned by 
the parties in their stipulation of facts. In fact, as observed by the lower 
court, it does <em>not</em> appear that Lewin <em>ever applied</em> for any visa 
nor had he manifested any intention of returning within the three-month term. 
The foregoing are factors that are incumbent upon the surety company to show in 
order to extricate itself from its liability under the bond.</p>
<p>During the pendency of this appeal, appellant filed with this Court a motion 
for new trial, which, per resolution of March 28, 1958, would be resolved upon 
consideration of the case on the merits. It is alleged as grounds for new trial 
that the case was submitted for decision without the testimony of the 
appellant's principal; that when Ted Lewin, its principal, reached the 
Philippines on a seaman's visa, appellee successfully blocked his efforts, 
administrative and judicial, to land in the Philippines; that during that time, 
appellant tried to subpoena him to testify in the hearing of this case, but was 
prevented from doing so, as his landing was made impossible by the appellee and 
because of the difficulty of serving a subpoena on board the ship, so that it 
was thereby made impossible for the appellant to discover and produce Lewin's 
testimony; that recently, however, the Government reversed its stand and allowed 
the temporary return of appellant's principal thereby making available his 
testimony to the court; and that if the motion will be granted, appellant will 
be able to show that when Ted Lewin arrived in New York on October 2, 1953, his 
passport, together with other papers, including the reentry permit, were 
confiscated by the U. S. authorities, and he was able to secure their return 
only some time in August, 1955, and that he tried to return to the Philippines 
during the period of confiscation, but that he was not able to do so because of 
the refusal of Philippine consular officials to issue him a visa.</p>
<p>One of the requirements for the granting of a motion for new trial is a 
satisfactory showing that even with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the 
new matter sought to be admitted could not have been discovered and produced at 
the trial (Sec. 1 [b], Rule 37, Rules of Court). From the motion, it would 
appear that Ted Lewin's presence within our territorial waters during the 
pendency of the trial was already known by the appellants. His intended 
testimony could have been, upon reasonable effort, made available to the court 
had appellant simply made use of one or some of the means provided under Rule 18 
of the Rules of Court (entitled Depositions and Discovery). It is not alleged 
that appellant tried to do so and failed. Accordingly, the motion for new trial 
is denied.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed. Costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed</em>.</p></div>
