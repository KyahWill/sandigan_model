				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On August 25, 1954 the Securities and&nbsp; Exchange&nbsp; Commissioner issued an order, requiring petitioner herein and its President, Mr. Alfredo Abcede,&nbsp; to show&nbsp; cause why it should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; against&nbsp; for&nbsp; making misrepresentations&nbsp; to the public about the need of&nbsp; registering and&nbsp; depositing&nbsp; Japanese war notes, with&nbsp; a view to their probable&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; as contemplated in&nbsp; Senate&nbsp; Bill&nbsp; No. 163&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; Senate&nbsp; Concurrent&nbsp; Resolution No.&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; for otherwise&nbsp; they&nbsp; would be valueless.&nbsp; At the investigation that was conducted in connection&nbsp; with the above order, the petitioner tried to show that there were no misrepresentations made by them in their&nbsp;&nbsp; publications and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; mistake&nbsp; made by&nbsp; them&nbsp; (that&nbsp; President&nbsp; Magsaysay would&nbsp; soon make&nbsp; representations&nbsp; to&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States Government to&nbsp; have&nbsp; the war&nbsp; notes redeemed)&nbsp; was&nbsp; made in good faith&nbsp; as it was&nbsp; later&nbsp; retracted and&nbsp; rectified. They also stated that they longed and hoped that the war notes would be&nbsp; redeemed; that they are sincere and honest in their activities;&nbsp; and that they&nbsp; are entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; their beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the investigation, in which it was disclosed that the petitioner claimed&nbsp; the right to&nbsp; continue in the above-mentioned activities,&nbsp; the Commissioner found that according to its articles the petitioner has the privilege&nbsp; to work for the redemption of the war notes of its members alone,&nbsp; but that it can not. offer its&nbsp; services to the public for a valuable&nbsp; consideration, because&nbsp; there is&nbsp; nothing definite and tangible about the redemption of the war notes and its success&nbsp; is&nbsp; speculative; that&nbsp; any&nbsp; authority given&nbsp; to&nbsp; offer services&nbsp; can easily degenerate&nbsp; into&nbsp; a racket; that&nbsp; under its articles&nbsp; of&nbsp; incorporation&nbsp; the petitioner is&nbsp; a civic and non-stock corporation&nbsp; and should not engage in business for profit;&nbsp; that it has received war notes for deposit,&nbsp; upon payment of fees, without&nbsp; authority in its articles&nbsp; to&nbsp; do so;&nbsp; that it had&nbsp; previously been&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; to desist&nbsp; from collecting fees for&nbsp; those&nbsp; registering the&nbsp; war&nbsp; notes, but notwithstanding&nbsp; this&nbsp; prohibiton&nbsp; it&nbsp; has&nbsp; done&nbsp; so in the guise of&nbsp; service fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the&nbsp; Commissioner ordered:<br><br><blockquote>(1) That the Association,&nbsp; and all/any of its officers, directors, employees, representatives, or agents stop immediately the registration&nbsp; of Japanese War Notes, receiving the&nbsp; same for deposit, and. charging&nbsp;&nbsp; fees&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; not,&nbsp; however,&nbsp;&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; from admitting&nbsp; members, with the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; rights and obligations as such. <br><br>"(2) That&nbsp; the Association and all/any&nbsp; of its&nbsp; officers, directors, employees, representatives, or agents,&nbsp; desist forthwith from accepting and collecting' fees for reparation claims for civilian casualties and other injuries, as it is not authorized so to do under its articles of incorporation."&nbsp; (Order of the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 28, 1955.) </blockquote><br><br>The case at bar is foria review of the above order.&nbsp; It is contended that the Commissioner&nbsp; erred&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; in finding that&nbsp; petitioner made misrepresentations to the&nbsp; public&nbsp; so as to induce holders of war notes to&nbsp; register them&nbsp; with petitioner,&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; in ordering the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; to stop the reg- istration&nbsp; of Japanese war notes,&nbsp; receiving same for deposit and charging fees therefore, and (3) in ordering petitioner to desist&nbsp; from accepting and&nbsp; collecting fees for reparation; claims for&nbsp; civilian casualties and injuries.<br><br>We&nbsp; are not permitted to examine the correctness of the first contention&nbsp; as above set forth, as&nbsp; the same involves questions&nbsp; of fact; only&nbsp; questions of law may&nbsp; be raised in this case for review&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 2, Rule 43 of&nbsp; the Rules of&nbsp; Court).<br><br>In support of&nbsp; the second contention it is claimed that the order&nbsp; was beside the issue'investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it'may be true&nbsp; that the issue which started' the investigation ha's been&nbsp; the&nbsp; misrepresentations made to&nbsp; the public&nbsp; by the petitioner herein, the order is based on the findings&nbsp; of fact made in the course of the investigation and the prohibition stated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; aims&nbsp; at&nbsp; the eradication of the source of&nbsp; the&nbsp; evil&nbsp; of&nbsp; misrepresentation that was&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject of the "investigation.&nbsp; It&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; said,&nbsp; therefore, that the resultant&nbsp; order&nbsp; is not germane or related to the sub- ject-matter&nbsp; of the investigation. <br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also argued&nbsp; that the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of war notes and the&nbsp; collection of fees therefor&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; by the corporation law and the&nbsp; authority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner to engage therein&nbsp; is implied from its articles of&nbsp; incorpora- tion,&nbsp; the&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of which&nbsp; are: <br><br><blockquote>"(1)&nbsp; To consecrate and. sanctify .in a strong and militant organization&nbsp; in the furtherance of the financial conditions of its&nbsp; members toward the attainment of their claims;<br>"(2) To take a position which is only secondary and complimentary to that of our constituted government&nbsp; in campaigning for&nbsp; the welfare of our people, especially when it ia to demand&nbsp; redemption .of currency&nbsp; from foreign&nbsp; country;<br>"(3) To work&nbsp; for,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to make due&nbsp; representations&nbsp; with&nbsp; the United States and Japanese Governments, for the redemption and, or,&nbsp; for the future payments&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Japanese War Notes&nbsp; (mickey mouse&nbsp; money);<br>"(4). To instill&nbsp; the ties&nbsp; of comradeship through this and noble gesture of goodwill between our people and country with the people and countries of the United States and Japan;<br>"(5) To do any and all acts and things which are naturally incidental on arising out of the purpose or any others.".&nbsp; (Petitioner's brief, pp. 57-58.)</blockquote>. <br><br>We do not find&nbsp; any merit in the contention.&nbsp; The&nbsp; articles authorize collection of&nbsp; fees&nbsp; from members; but&nbsp; they do not authorize the corporation to engage&nbsp; in the business of registering&nbsp; and accepting war notes&nbsp; for&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; and collecting fees&nbsp; from&nbsp; such services.&nbsp; This was the ruling of the Commissioner&nbsp; and this we find to&nbsp; be correct. <br><br>Neither do we find any&nbsp; merit in the third contention that the association&nbsp; has authority to accept and collect fees for reparation claims for civilian casualties and other injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is beyond any of the&nbsp; powers of the association as&nbsp; embodied&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; articles&nbsp; and&nbsp; have&nbsp; absolutely no relation&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; avowed&nbsp; purpose of the&nbsp; association to work for the redemption&nbsp; of war notes. <br><br>The order of the Securities and Exchange Commissioner was evidently promulgated under the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of section 1&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; of Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1143 which&nbsp; reads: <br><br><blockquote>"(b) To penalize any violation of or noncompliance with&nbsp; any terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; any&nbsp; certificate, license, or permit&nbsp; issued by the Commission or of any order, decision, ruling&nbsp; or regulation thereof, by a "fine of not exceeding two hundred&nbsp; pesos per day for every day during which such violation&nbsp; or&nbsp; default continues:&nbsp; and the Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to impose&nbsp; and collect such fine after due notice and hearing." </blockquote><br><br>The&nbsp; order sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; reviewed&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed. with costs against&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angela, Conception, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ</i>.,&nbsp; concur. <br><i>Reyes, A.,&nbsp; J</i>., concurs&nbsp; in the&nbsp; result. </div>
