				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal certified by the Court of Appeals for the reason&nbsp; that it involves&nbsp; only questions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law.<br><br>Alleging and claiming that the parcel of land described in&nbsp; the complaint belonged to&nbsp; Hipolito Rosario, their deceased father,&nbsp; who&nbsp; entrusted to&nbsp; Partenio Rosario,&nbsp; the deceased father of the defendants, the care&nbsp; (management) of the parcel of land and that the latter, taking advantage of the confidence and&nbsp; truat reposed in&nbsp; him by the former, registered the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; in his&nbsp; name,&nbsp; the plaintiffs seek the reconveyance of the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land, accounting of&nbsp; the fruits of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land since 1915,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the payment of costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This case is docketed in the court below as civil case No. 12238.<br><br>The defendants moved for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal of the&nbsp; complaint on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; the action&nbsp; is&nbsp; barred by the statute of&nbsp; limitations.<br><br>The Court dismissed the complaint&nbsp; and the reasons for its&nbsp; action are set out in the order which reads, as follows:<br><blockquote>In these two pases which&nbsp; are related with&nbsp; one another, a&nbsp; motion to dismiss under&nbsp; date of September 5,&nbsp; 1952, has&nbsp; been filed by Attys.&nbsp; Abenojar &amp; Sevidal&nbsp; in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 12238 which is for reconveyance of property on the ground that the cause of action is barred&nbsp; by&nbsp; the statute of&nbsp; limitations, to which&nbsp; an opposition has been interposed by plaintiffs' attorney under date of September 9, 1952.<br><br>The&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; recites that one&nbsp; Hipolito Rosario, deceased father of the plaintiffs,&nbsp; was the owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; that&nbsp; parcel of land,&nbsp; Lot&nbsp; 101 of the Urdaneta Cadastre together with&nbsp; the improvements&nbsp; thereon, during his&nbsp; lifetime;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in 1915 he&nbsp; appointed one Partenio Rosario, defendants' father,&nbsp; trustee and <i>encargado</i> of said land but said&nbsp; trustee&nbsp; registered the&nbsp; same&nbsp; land in his own name without the knowledge and&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of his principal, Hipolito Rosario; that said lot is now&nbsp; in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants, the sons of the ]ate Partenio Rosario,&nbsp; under Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 6306 of the&nbsp; Register&nbsp; of Deeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangasinan, and that finally&nbsp; that&nbsp; said land&nbsp; has&nbsp; not&nbsp; passed to third persons as buyers in good faith.<br><br>The motion to dismiss states, among&nbsp; others, that even granting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that there really&nbsp; was a trust created between Hipolito Rosario and Partenio Rosario, reconveyance of the property covered by the said title could no longer&nbsp; be&nbsp; had this&nbsp; time considering&nbsp; the time that has elapsed since&nbsp; then.&nbsp; The plaintiffs contend&nbsp; otherwise.<br><br>A careful perusal of the&nbsp; records&nbsp; of these cases&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; the land&nbsp; has been originally&nbsp; registered&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Fartenio&nbsp; Rosario, deceased father&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants, on&nbsp; August 28, 1917&nbsp; (Exhibit 1);&nbsp; that on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1919 said&nbsp; land&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; mortgaged with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National Rank;&nbsp; on February 26,&nbsp; 1923,&nbsp; it&nbsp; has been&nbsp; sold under <i>pacto de retro</i> to Librada Villarin who consolidated her dominion&nbsp; thereon May 3, 1923, and to whom transfer certificate of title&nbsp; No. 1742&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 2)&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued;&nbsp; on&nbsp; September 2, 1925 said&nbsp; Librada Villarin sold&nbsp; the same land&nbsp; to Geminiano Yillarin (Exhibit&nbsp; 3) who on May 18,&nbsp; 1926&nbsp; secured transfer certificate of title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2906 (Exhibit 4); that&nbsp; said&nbsp; Geminiano Villarin sold&nbsp; the same lot&nbsp; on January 14, 1919 to Florentino J.&nbsp; Rosario and Amador Eosario&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 5), the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; herein, who secured Transfer Certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6306&nbsp; in their&nbsp; names&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 11, 1949 (Exhibit&nbsp; 6).&nbsp; All these exhibits, are found&nbsp; in the record of Civil Case. No. 11091.<br><br>It&nbsp; is very&nbsp; evident that since the land was&nbsp; registered in 1917 in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Partenio&nbsp; Rosario several transactions had&nbsp; already been&nbsp; made&nbsp; regarding the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question, the first being a mortgage, then a <i>pacto&nbsp; de retro</i>&nbsp; sale, followed by a&nbsp; definite&nbsp; sale to Geminiano&nbsp; Villarin&nbsp; and finally to&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; herein.&nbsp; Under this setup, even granting that there was a&nbsp; breach of&nbsp; trust,&nbsp; reconveyance of the land in question could no longer be made because the&nbsp; land has already&nbsp; passed&nbsp;&nbsp; to innocent&nbsp; purchasers&nbsp; for&nbsp; value, the last vendees being the&nbsp; defendants herein&nbsp; who&nbsp; happened to be the children&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; original&nbsp; registered&nbsp; owner.&nbsp; The&nbsp; law&nbsp; on&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear.&nbsp; Once^a&nbsp; registered&nbsp; land has&nbsp; been&nbsp; alienated to an innocent purchaser for value, the same may no longer be&nbsp; reconveyed even&nbsp; if the land has been registered&nbsp; fraudulently.<br><br>In&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, the defendants derived&nbsp; their&nbsp; title&nbsp; from one&nbsp; Geminiano&nbsp; Villarin who is not even&nbsp; a&nbsp; remote relative&nbsp; of the original registered owner much less&nbsp; the defendants.&nbsp; They,&nbsp; therefore, could be no other than purchasers in&nbsp; good faith.&nbsp; To&nbsp; allow reconveyance under these&nbsp; circumstances would be to undo all the various transactions that affected the land in question.&nbsp; This would&nbsp; necessarily lead to chaos and confusion.<br><br>Another&nbsp; point to&nbsp; consider is&nbsp; the&nbsp; date when the various&nbsp; trans- actions were&nbsp; had.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortgage&nbsp; with the&nbsp; bank&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1919 the Kale to Librada Villarin&nbsp; in 1923;&nbsp; the sale to Geminiano Villarin in 1926 and the sale to the defendants in 1949—the date of one transaction to&nbsp; that .of another precludes the&nbsp; possibility that the conveyance was&nbsp; simulated&nbsp; or fictitious.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; be&nbsp; a strain to the imagination to consider&nbsp; it otherwise.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing, the court&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; sustains defendants' motion to dismiss, and consequently Civil Case No. 12238 is hereby&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; without pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs. Three&nbsp; motions for reconsideration were denied.</blockquote>Under&nbsp; a&nbsp; liberal construction, the facts&nbsp; alleged in the complaint of the&nbsp; appellants,&nbsp; except&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 7 which is a&nbsp; conclusion,&nbsp; might&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; sufficient to support the&nbsp; prayer&nbsp; for reconveyance,&nbsp; but the allegation in paragraph 4&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint where the appellants&nbsp; state&nbsp; that in&nbsp; 1915&nbsp; their deceased&nbsp; father&nbsp; in his&nbsp; lifetime&nbsp;&nbsp; entrusted the&nbsp; management&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; to the late father of&nbsp; the appellees&nbsp; who registered it in&nbsp; his name without the&nbsp; consent of his principal, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; prayer for accounting of the produce of the parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; since 1915, justify the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss on&nbsp; the ground of prescription.&nbsp; .<br><br>The&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; state in their brief&nbsp; that—<br><blockquote>It&nbsp; should likewise be&nbsp; borne in mind&nbsp; that these two&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; Civil Cases&nbsp; Nos. 11091 and&nbsp; 12238 for recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession&nbsp; and for reconveyance,&nbsp; respectively, are&nbsp; related&nbsp; with one another, so that the&nbsp; lower court, upon the suggestion of&nbsp; both&nbsp; parties, has deemed it expedient and necessary to determine them&nbsp; jointly.<br><br>When our motion&nbsp; to dismiss was&nbsp; argued&nbsp; orally,&nbsp; the parties had reiterated&nbsp; their&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; considering said&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; the court should also take judicial notice&nbsp; of the record&nbsp; of another case (Civil&nbsp; Case No. 11091). * * * .&nbsp; (Pp.&nbsp; 6-7.) </blockquote>The appellants' answer&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; statement is—<br><blockquote>The&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; reiterated&nbsp; that, the documents&nbsp; attached to&nbsp; Civil Case No. 11091 (page 7 of Appellees' Brief), by agreement of the parties, are to be considered&nbsp; by the Court,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; took judicial notice of the same.&nbsp; This is not true by the&nbsp; records&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case, as appellants have denied the due execution&nbsp; and authenticity of .each and every document. attached&nbsp; or&nbsp; appended to defendants' (appellees herein) answer, namely, Exhibit T, Exhibit&nbsp; '2' Exhibit '3', Exhibit&nbsp; '4', Exhibit&nbsp; '5'&nbsp; and&nbsp; Exhibit '61,&nbsp; (Page 3, REPLY TO&nbsp; AMENDED ANSWER dated&nbsp; August 30, 1951, Civil Case&nbsp; No. 11091; pages 11 and 12, APPELLANTS' brief).&nbsp; Pp. 1-2 Memorandum for the Appellants.</blockquote>Denying the genuineness and&nbsp; due execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; documents&nbsp; attached to the appellees' answer&nbsp; in the action for recovery of possession of the parcel of land does not&nbsp; bring the appellants' case under&nbsp; section 8,&nbsp; Rule 15, because it refers&nbsp; to documents&nbsp; upon which&nbsp; the&nbsp; action&nbsp; is based and not to&nbsp; documents attached to the answer of the&nbsp; appellees in support of the allegation that in 1917&nbsp; the parcel&nbsp; of land was registered under&nbsp; Act No. 496, that it was conveyed&nbsp; successively to several&nbsp; persons, and that for that reason&nbsp; the action&nbsp; for recovery of possession of the parcel of land&nbsp; is&nbsp; barred&nbsp; by the statute&nbsp; of&nbsp; limitations.&nbsp; The fact that the appellees are the&nbsp; children&nbsp; of the alleged trustee who, after several conveyances&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parcel&nbsp; of land to other parties, became&nbsp; the owners&nbsp; of or&nbsp; acquired the parcel of land, does&nbsp; not render them liable for the acts&nbsp; of their father nor did they&nbsp; assume upon acquiring the parcel of land the alleged obligation of their father as trustee.&nbsp; The&nbsp; action for&nbsp; reconveyance is an equitable remedy available&nbsp; only&nbsp; when the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land&nbsp; wrongly registered under&nbsp; the Torrens system in the&nbsp; name of one who&nbsp; is not the owner has&nbsp; not passed into the hands&nbsp; of an innocent&nbsp; purchaser for value.<br><br>The&nbsp; order appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A,,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Conception, Endencia</i> and <i> Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
