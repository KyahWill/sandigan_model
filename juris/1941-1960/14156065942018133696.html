<br><br>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DE JOYA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p> This is an appeal from a decree rendered by the Hon. Gervasio 
Diaz, Judge of the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, <em>on </em>December
 3, 1943, admitting to probate a will dated November 3, 1942, executed 
by the deceased Encarnacion Neyra; at the same time denying the 
probate of a previous will dated September 14, 1939, alleged to have 
been executed by the said testatrix. </p>
  <p> Trinidad Neyra, beneficiary in the will executed on November 3, 
1942, filed, on November 10, 1942, a petition in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, for the probate of said will. </p>
  <p> On December 19, 1942, Teodora Neyra, Filar de Guzman, and Maria 
Jacobo Vda. de Blanco, who had not been named as beneficiaries in said 
will, filed on opposition to the probate of the said will dated November
 3, 1942, alleging (1) that at the time of the alleged execution of the 
said will, the testatrix Encarnacion Neyra no longer possessed 
testamentary capacity; (2) that her thumb marks on said instrument had 
been procured by means of fraud by petitioner Trinidad Neyra, and that 
Encarnacion Neyra never intended to consider said document as will; (3) 
that the alleged will, dated November 3, 1942, had not been executed in 
the manner and form prescribed by law; and (4) that Encarnacion Neyra, 
since September 14, 1939, had executed a will, naming as beneficiaries 
said oppositors and others, and that said will had never been revoked or
 amended in any manner whatsoever. </p>
  <p> On December 26, 1942, petitioner Trinidad Neyra filed a reply denying the allegations in the opposition. </p>
  <p> Subsequently, said oppositors filed a counter petition, asking for
 the probate of the first will executed by Encarnacion Neyra, on 
September 14, 1939, marked as Exhibit 16. On March 16, 1943, the 
legatees Trinidad Neyra and Eustaquio Mendoza filed their opposition to 
the probate of said will marked as Exhibit 16, and amended said 
op足position, on September 15, 1943, to which Teodora Neyra and the 
others filed a reply, on September 20, 1943. </p>
  <p> On the dates set for the hearing on the petition filed by Trinidad
 Neyra, and the counter petition mentioned above, said petitioner as 
well as the oppositors, presented evidenee, testimonial and documentary.
 The witnesses presented by the petitioner Trinidad Neyra were Mons. 
Vicente Fernandez, Rev. Fr. Teodoro Garcia, Sor. Andrea Montejo, Dr. 
Moises B. Abad, Dr. Eladio A. Aldecoa, Atty. Ricardo Sikat, petitioner 
Trinidad Neyra herself, and Atty. Alejandro M. Panis, who had acted as 
scrivener in the preparation of said will dated November 3, 1942. </p>
  <p> Teodora Neyra and the other oppositors also presented several 
witnesses, the principal among whom were Presentacion Blanco, Ceferina 
de la Cruz, Acislo Manuel, Dr. Dionisio Parulan, an alleged medical 
expert, and the oppositors Teodora Neyra and Pilar de Guzman themselves.
 </p>
  <p> After considering the evidence, the lower court rendered a decree 
admitting to probate the will dated November 3, 1942; at the same time 
denying the probate of the will dated September 14, 1939. </p>
  <p> From said decision Teodora Neyra and the other oppositors appealed
 to the Court of Appeals for the City of Manila, assigning several 
errors, which may be reduced to the following, to wit, that the trial 
court erred (1) in rinding that Encarnacion Neyra wanted to make a new 
will; (2) in declaring that there was reconciliation between Encarnacion
 Neyra and her sister Trinidad; (3) in accepting as satisfactory the 
evidence submitted by the petitioner; (4) in ignoring the evidence 
submitted by the oppositors; and (5) in not admitting to probate the 
will dated September 14, 1939. </p>
  <p> The evidence, testimonial and documentary, adduced during the 
trial of the case in the court below, has satisfactorily, and 
sufficiently established the following facts: </p>
  <p> That Severo Neyra died intestate in the City of Manila, on May 6, 
1938, leaving certain properties and two children, by his first 
marriage, named Encarnacion Neyra and Trinidad Neyra, and several other 
relatives; that after the death of Severo Neyra, the two sister's, 
Encarnacion Neyra and Trinidad Neyra, had serious quar足rels, in 
connection with the properties left by their deceased father, and so 
serious were their dissensions that, after March 31, 1939, they had two 
litigations in the Court of First Instance of Manila, concerning said 
properties (Exhibits 8 and 9) : In the first case, filed on March 31, 
1939, Trinidad Neyra and others demanded from Encarnacion Neyra et al. 
the annulment of the sale of the property located at No. 366 Raon 
Street, Manila, and it was finally decided in favor of the defendants in
 the Court of First Instance and in .the Court of Appeals, on December 
21, 1943 (G. R. No. 8162, Exhibit 9). </p>
  <p> In the second case, filed on October 25, 1939, Trinidad Neyra demanded from Encarnacion Neyra, one-half <em>(1/2)</em>
 of the property described therein, and one-half (1/2) of the rents, and
 the Court of First Instance decided in favor of the plaintiff, but at 
the same time awarded in favor of the defendant P727.77, under her 
counterclaim; and Trinidad Neyra again elevated the case to the Court of
 Appeals for Manila (G. R. No. 8075) Exhibit 8, which was decided, 
pursuant to the document of compromise marked as Exhibit D; and the 
petition for reconsideration filed therein still remains undecided. </p>
  <p> That Encarnacion Neyra, who had remained single, and who had no 
longer any ascendants, executed a will on September 14, 1939, marked 
Exhibit 16, disposing of her properties in favor of the "Congregacion de
 Religiosas de la Virgen Maria" and her other relatives named Teodora 
Neyra, Pilar de Guzman and Maria Jacobo Vda. de Blanco, making no 
provision whatsoever in said will in favor of her only sister Trinidad 
Neyra, who had become her bitter ene足my; that when the said will was 
brought to the attention of the authorities of said Congregation, after 
due deliberation and consideration, said religious organization declined
 the bounty offered by Encarnacion Neyra, and said decision of the 
Congregation was duly communicated to her; that in order to overcome the
 difficulties encountered by said religious organization in not 
accepting the generosity of Encarnacion Neyra, the latter decided to 
make a new will, and for that purpose, about one week before her death, 
sent for one Ricardo Sikat, an attorney working in the Law Offices of 
Messrs. Feria and Lao, and gave him instructions for the preparation of a
 <em>new will; </em>that Attorney Sikat, instead of preparing a new 
will, in accordance with the express instructions given by Encarnacion 
Neyra, merely prepared a draft in the form of a codicil, marked as 
Exhibit M, amending said will, dated September 14, 1939, again naming 
said religious organization, among others, as beneficiary, and said 
draft of a codicil was also forwarded to the authorities of said 
religious organization, for their consideration and acceptance. </p>
  <p> In the meanwhile, Encarnacion Neyra had become se足riously ill, 
suffering from Addison's disease, and on October 31, 1942, she sent for 
her religious adviser and confessor, Mons. Vicente Fernandez of the 
Quiapo Church to make confession, after which she expressed her desire 
to have a mass celebrated in her house at No. 366 Raon Street, City of 
Manila, so that she might take holy communion, in view of her condition;
 that following the request of Encarnacion Neyra, Mons. Fernandez caused
 the necessary arrangements to be made for the celebration of holy mass 
in the house of Encarnacion Neyra, and, as a matter of fact, on November
 1, 1942, holy mass was solemnized in her house, Fr. Teodoro Garcia, 
also of the Quiapo Church, officiating in said ceremony, on which 
occasion, Encarnacion Neyra, who remained in bed, took holy communion; 
that after said religious ceremony had been terminated, Father Garcia 
talked to Encarnacion Neyra and advised reconciliation between the two 
sisters, Encarnacion Neyra and Trinidad Neyra. Encarnacion Neyra 
accepted said advice and at about noon of the same day (November 1, 
1942), sent Eustaquio Mendoza to fetch her sister Trinidad Neyra, who 
came at about 2.30 that same afternoon; that on seeing one another, the 
two greeted each other in a most affectionate manner, and became 
reconciled; that the two had a long and cordial conversation, in the 
course of which the two sisters also talked about the properties left by
 their deceased father and their litigations which had reached the Court
 of Appeals for the City of Manila, and they agreed to have the said 
appeal dismissed, on the condition that the property involved therein, 
consisting of a small house and lot, should be given exclusively to 
Trinidad Neyra, on the condition that the latter should waive her claim 
for her share in the rents of said property, while under the 
administration of Encarnacion Neyra, and that the two should renounce 
their mutual claims against one another, it was also agreed between the 
two sisters to send for Atty. Alejandro M. Panis, to prepare the 
necessary document embodying the said agreement, but Attorney Panis 
could come only in the afternoon of the following day, November 2, 1942, 
when Encarnacion gave him instructions for the preparation of the 
document embodying their agreement, and other instructions relative to 
the disposition she wanted to make of her properties in her last will 
and testament; that Attorney Panis prepared said document of compromise 
or agreement marked as Exhibit D, as well as the new will and testament 
marked as Exhibit C, naming Trinidad Neyra and Eustaquio Mendoza 
beneficiaries therein, pursuant to the express instructions given by 
Encarnacion Neyra, and said instruments were ready for signature on 
November 8, 1942; that in the afternoon of that day, November 3, 1942, 
Attorney Panis read said will and testament marked as Exhibit D to 
Encarnacion Neyra slowly and in a loud voice, in the presence of Fr, 
Teodoro Garcia, Dr. Moises B. Abad, Dr. Eladio Aldecoa, herein 
petitioner Trinidad Neyra, and others, after which he asked her if its 
terms were in accordance with her wishes, if she had anything else to 
add, or anything to be changed in said will; and as Encarnacion Neyra 
stated that the terms of said will were in accordance with her wishes 
and express instructions, she asked for the pad and the will Exhibit C 
and, with the help of a son of herein petitioner, placed her thumb mark 
at the foot of said will, in the presence of the three attesting 
witnesses, Dr. Moises B. Abad, Dr. Eladio R. Aldecoa, and Atty. 
Alejandro M. Panis, after which the attesting witnesses signed at the 
foot of the document, in the presence of the testatrix Encarnacion 
Neyra, and of each and everyone of the other attesting witnesses. Fr. 
Teodoro Garcia and petitioner Trinidad Neyra and several others were 
also present. </p>
  <p> On November 4, 1942, the testatrix Encarnacion Neyra, due to a heart 'attack, unexpectedly died. </p>
  <p> Although the "Congregation de Religiosas de la Virgen Maria" had 
again decided not to accept the provision made in its favor by the 
testatrix Encarnacion Neyra in the proposed codicil prepared by Atty. 
Ricardo Sikat, said de足cision could not be communicated to the 
testatrix, before her death. </p>
  <p> Mons. Vicente Fernandez and Fr. Teodovo Garcia testified as to the
 request made on October 31, 1942, by Encarnacion Neyra for the 
celebration of holy mass in her house, on November <em>1, </em>1942; 
that said mass was in fact solemnized in her house, on that date, in the
 course of which the testatrix Encarnacion Neyra took holy communion; 
that on the same day, after the mass, Encarnacion held a long 
conversation with Father Garcia, in the course of which, said priest 
advised her to have reconciliation with her sister Trinidad; and that 
said advice was accepted by Encarnacion. </p>
  <p> By the testimony of Trinidad Neyra, it has been shown that 
Encarnacion sent Eustaquio Mendoza to fetch her, and that in fact she 
came to the house of Encarnacion, at about 2.30 o'clock in the afternoon
 that same day, November 1, 1942, with said Eustaquio Mendoza; that on 
seeing one another, Encarnacion and Trinidad Neyra greeted each other 
most affectionately, forgiving one another, after which they talked 
about the property left by their deceased father and the litigation 
pending between them; and the two sisters agreed to settle their case,
 which had been elevated to the Court of Appeals for the City of Manila,
 concerning a certain house and lot, on the understanding that said 
property should be given exclusively to Trinidad, and that the latter 
should renounce her claim against Encarnacion, for her share in the 
rents collected on said property, and, at the same time, Encarnacion 
renounced her claim for P727.77 against Trinidad; and that it was also 
agreed between the two sisters that Atty. Alejandro M. Panis should be 
called to prepare the necessary papers for the settlement of said case. 
Presentacion Blanco, a witness for the oppositors, also testified 
substantially to the foregoing facts. </p>
  <p> By the testimony of Trinidad Neyra and Atty. Alejandro M. Panis, 
and the other attesting witnesses, it has also been shown that Atty. 
Alejandro M. Panis came in the afternoon of the following day, November 
2, 1942, and received instructions from Encarnacion Neyra, not only for 
the preparation of said agreement, but also for the preparation of a new
 will, and consequently Attorney Panis prepared said document of 
compromise and the Mall, dated November 3, 1942, which were both thumb 
marked, in duplicate, in the afternoon of that day, by Encarnacion 
Neyra, who was then of sound mind, as shown by her appearance and 
conversation, aided by a son of Trinidad Neyra, on her" bed in the <em>sala, </em>in
 the presence of the attesting witnesses, Dr. Moises B. Abad, Dr. Eladio
 R. Aldecoa, and Atty. Ale足 jandro M. Panis, who signed in the presence 
of the testatrix and of each other. </p>
  <p> Father Teodoro Garcia was also present at the signing of the will,
 at the request of Encaimacion Neyra, and so was Trinidad Neyra. </p>
  <p> On November 4, 1942, due to a heart attack as a con足 sequence of 
Addison's disease, perhaps, Encarnacion Neyra expired, at about 3 
o'clock in the morning. </p>
  <p> Oppositor Teodora Neyra, her <em>young </em>daughter Ceferina de 
la Cruz, and Presentacion Blanco, daughter of oppositor Maria Jacobo 
Vda. de Blanco, practically corroborated the testimony of the witnesses 
of the petitioner, with reference to the signing of documents, in the 
bedroom of Encarnacion Neyra, on November 3, 1942. </p>
  <p> Teodora Neyra, Presentacion Blanco and Ceferina de la Cruz, 
witnesses for the oppositors, testified, however, that when the thumb 
mark of Encarnacion Neyra was affixed, as stated above, to the document 
of compromise in question, dated November 3, 1942, she was sleeping on 
her bed in the <em>sola; </em>and that the attesting witnesses" were not present, as they were in the <em>caida.</em></p>
  <p> But Ceferina de la Cruz, witness for the oppositors, also stated 
that the attesting witnesses signed the documents thumb marked by 
Encarnacion Neyra, in the <em>sola </em>near her bed, thus contradicting herself and Teodora Neyra and Presentacion Blanco. </p>
  <p> Strange to say, Teodora Neyra, Presentacion Blanco and Ceferina de
 la Cruz also testified that Encarnacion Neyra's thumb mark was affixed 
to the will, only in the morning of November 4, 1942, by Trinidad Neyra 
and Ildefonso del Barrio, when Encarnacion was already dead. </p>
  <p> The testimony of Dr. Dionisio Parulan, alleged medical expert, as 
to the nature and effects of Addison's disease, is absolutely 
unreliable. He had never seen or talked to the testatrix Encarnacion 
Neyra. </p>
  <p> According to medical authorities, the cause or causes of the 
sleeping sickness, known as Addison's disease, are not yet fully known; 
that persons attacked by said disease often live as long as ten (10) 
years after the first attack, while others die after a few weeks only, 
and that as the disease progresses, asthenia sets in, and from 80 per 
cent to 90 per cent of the patients develop tuberculosis, and 
complications of the heart also appear. (Cecil, Textbook of Medicine, 3d
 ed., 1935, pp. 1250, 1252, 1253; MaCrae, Osier's Modem Medicine, 3d 
ed., Vol. V. pp. 272-279). </p>
  <p> And it has been conclusively shown in this case that the testatrix
 Encarnacion Neyra, at the age of 48, died on November 4, 1942, due to a
 heart attack, after an illness of about two (2) years. </p>
  <p>In connection with testamentary capacity, in several cases, this 
court has considered the testimony of witnes足ses, who had known and 
talked to the testators, more trustworthy than the testimony of alleged 
medical experts. </p>
  <p> Testamentary capacity is the capacity to comprehend the nature of 
the transaction in which the testator is engaged at the time, to 
recollect the property to be disposed of, and the persons who would 
naturally be supposed to have claims upon the testator, and to 
comprehend the manner in which the instrument will distribute his 
property among the objects of his bounty. (Bugnao <em>vs. </em>Ubag, 14 Phil., 163.) </p>
  <p> Insomnia, in spite of the testimony of two doctors who testified 
for the opponents to the probate of a will, who stated that it tended to
 destroy mental capacity, was held not to affect the full possession of 
the mental faculties deemed necessary and sufficient for its execution. 
(Caguioa <em>vs. </em>Calderon, 20 Phil., 400.) The testatrix was held to have been <em>compos mentis, </em>in
 spite of the physican's testimony to the contrary, to the effect that 
she was very weak, being in the third or last stage of tuberculosis. 
(Yap Tua <em> vs. </em> Yap Ca Kuan and Yap Ca Liu, 27 Phil., 579.) The 
testimony of the attending physician that the deceased was suffering 
from diabetes and had been in a comatose condition for several days, 
prior to his death, was held not sufficient to establish testamentary 
incapacity, in view of the positive statement of several credible 
witnesses that he was conscious and able to understand what said to him 
and to communicate his desires. (Samson <em>vs. </em>Corrales Tan 
Quintin, 44 Phil., 573.) Where the mind of the testator is in perfectly 
sound condition, neither old age, nor ill health, nor the fact that 
somebody had to guide his hand in order that he might sign, is 
sufficient to invalidate his will. (Amata and Almojuela <em>vs. </em>Tablizo, 48 Phil., 485.) </p>
  <p> Where it appears that <em>a few hours </em>and also a few days 
after the execution of the will, the testator intelligently and 
intelligibly conversed with other persons, although lying down and 
unable to move or stand up unassisted, but could still effect the sale 
of property belonging to him, these circumstances show that the testator
 was in a perfectly sound mental condition at the time of executing the 
will. (Amata and Almojuela <em>vs. </em>Tablizo, 48 Phil., 485.) </p>
  <p> Presentacion Blanco, in the course of her cross-examination, 
frankly admitted that, in the morning and also at about 6 o'clock in the
 afternoon of November 3, 1942, Encarnacion Neyra talked to her and that
 they understood each other clearly, thus showing that the testatrix was
 really of sound mind, at the time of the signing and execution of the 
agreement and will in question. </p>
  <p> It may, therefore, be reasonably concluded that the mental 
faculties of persons suffering from Addison's disease, like the 
testatrix in this case, remain unimpaired, partly due to the fact that, 
on account of the sleep they enjoy, they necessarily receive the benefit
 of physical and mental rest. And that like patients suffering from 
tuberculosis, insomnia or diabetes, they preserve their mental faculties
 until the moments of their death. </p>
  <p> Judging by the authorities above cited, the conclusion made by the
 trial court that the testatrix Encarnacion Neyra was of sound mind and 
possessed testamentary capacity, at the time of the execution of the 
will, cannot be properly disturbed. </p>
  <p> The oppositors also claim that the attesting witnesses were not 
present, at the time that the testatrix thumb marked the will in 
question, on her bed, in the <em>sola </em>of the house, as they were allegedly in the <em>cadda. </em>But
 it has been fully, shown that the attesting witnesses were present at 
the time of the signing and execution of the agreement and will in 
question, in the <em>sala, </em>where the testatrix was lying on her 
bed. The true test is not whether they actually saw each other, at the 
time of the signing of the will, but whether they might have seen each 
other sign, had they chosen to do so; and the attesting witnesses 
actually saw it in this case. (Jaboneta <em>vs. </em>Gustilo, 5 Phil., 541.) And the thnmbmark placed by the testatrix on the will is equivalent to her signature. (Yap Tua <em>vs. </em> Yap Ca Kuan and Yap Ca Liu, 27 Phil., 579.)</p>
  <p> The oppositors as well as their principal witnesses are all 
interested parties, as said oppositors had been named legatees in the 
will dated September 14, 1939, but elim足inated from the will dated 
November 3, 1942. </p>
  <p> On the other hand, the witnesses for the petitioner are all 
trustworthy men, who had absolutely no interest in the final outcome of 
this case. Two of them are ministers of the Gospel, while the three 
attesting witnesses are profes足sional men of irreproachable character, 
who had known and seen and talked to the testatrix. </p>
  <p> Furthermore, the testimony of the oppositors and their witnesses, 
to the effect that there could have been no reconciliation between the 
two sisters, and that the thumb mark of Encarnacion Neyra was affixed to
 the document embodying the agreement, while she was sleeping, on 
November 3, ]942, in their presence; and that her thumb mark was affixed
 to the will in question, when she was already dead, in the morning of 
November 4, 1942, within their view, is preposterous, to say the least. 
Said testimony is contrary to common sense. It violates all sense of 
proportion. The oppositors and their witnesses could not have told the 
truth; they have testified to brazen falsehoods ; and they are, 
therefore, absolutely unworthy of belief. And to the evidence of the 
oppositors is completely applicable the rule <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. </em>(Gonzalez <em>vs. </em>Mauricio, 53 Phil., 728, 735.) </p>
  <p> In the brief presented by counsel for the oppositors and 
appellants, to show the alleged improbability of the reconciliation of 
the two sisters and the execution of the will, dated November 3, 1942, 
they have erroneously placed great reliance on the fact that, up to 
October 31, 1942, the two sisters Encarnacion and Trinidad Neyra were 
bitter enemies. They were banking evidently on the common belief that 
the hatred of relatives is the most violent. Dreadful indeed are the 
feuds of relatives, and difficult the reconciliation. But they had 
forgotten the fact that Encarnacion Neyra was a religious and pious 
woman instructed in the ancient virtues of Christian faith and hope and 
charity, and that it was godly to forgive and better still to forget. </p>
  <p> It was most natural that there should have been reconciliation 
between the two sisters, Encarnacion and Trinidad Neyra, as the latter 
is the nearest relative of the former, her only sister of the whole 
blood. The approach of imminent death must have evoked in her the 
tenderest recollections of childhood. And believing perhaps that her 
little triumphs had not always brought her happiness, and that she had 
not always been fair to her sister, who, in fact, had successively 
instituted two suits against her, to recover what was her due, and for 
which Encarnacion believed she must atone, she finally decided upon 
reconciliation, so that she might depart in peace. </p>
  <p> The record shows that, of the two, Encarnacion lived in greater 
opulence, and that Trinidad had been demanding tenaciously her share; 
and as a Christian woman, Encar足 nacion must have known that no one has 
any right to enrich himself unjustly, at the expense of another. And it 
was, therefore, natural that Encarnacion should desire reconciliation 
with her sister Trinidad, and provide for her in her last will and 
testament. </p>
  <p> As for Eustaquio Mendoza, who, according to the evidence, had 
served Encarnacion Neyra for so many years and so well, it was also 
natural that she should make some provision for him, as gratitude is the
 noblest sentiment that springs from the human heart. </p>
  <p> The conduct of Encarnacion Neyra, in making altogether a new will,
 with new beneficiaries named therein, including principally her 
bitterest enemy of late, which is completely incompatible with the will,
 dated September 14, 1939, may really seem strange and unusual; but, as 
it has been truly said, above the logic of the head is the feeling in 
the heart, and the heart has reasons of its own which the head cannot 
always understand, as in the case of intuitive knowledge of eternal 
verity. </p>
  <p> As Encarnacion Neyra felt the advent of immortality, she naturally
 wanted to follow "the path of the just, which is as the shining light 
that shineth more and more unto the perfect day," so that her memory may
 be blessed. As a Christian woman, she must have loved justice, mercy 
and truth and to follow the law, for this is the whole duty of man. </p>
  <p> In the present case, the court cannot find any reason or 
justification to alter the conclusions set forth in the decree appealed 
from. This court will not reverse any findings of fact by the trial 
court made upon conflicting testimony and depending largely upon the 
credibility of witnesses, who testified in the presence of the trial 
judge, unless the court below failed to take into consideration some 
material facts or circumstances, or to weigh accurately all of the 
material facts and circumstances presented to it for consideration. 
(Baltazar <em>vs. </em>Alberto, 33 Phil., 336; Melliza <em>vs. </em>Towle, 34 Phil., 345; Caragay <em>vs. </em>Urquiza, 53 Phil., 72, 79; Garcia <em>vs. </em>Garcia de Bartolome, 63 Phil, 419.) </p>
  <p> After a careful consideration of the evidence and the law in this 
case, we find it legally impossible to sustain any of the errors 
assigned by the appellants. The judgment appealed from is, therefore, 
affirmed, with costs against the appellants. So ordered. </p>
  <p><em> Ozaeta, Perfecto, Hilado, </em> and <em>Bengzon, J.J., </em>concur.<br>
  <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
