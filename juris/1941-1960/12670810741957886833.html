				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Lino&nbsp; Sales and&nbsp; Visitacion Salud are appealing the decision of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Agrarian Relations in CAR Case No. 103&nbsp; (Batangas 1957), dismissing their&nbsp; petition to&nbsp; eject respondent tenant Maximo Macatangay and ordering&nbsp; them to maintain him in the peaceful possession and cultivation of their landholding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal is based&nbsp; on the claim that the appealed decision is not supported by substantial evidence.<br><br>Respondent Macatangay had been a tenant of petitioners- appellants&nbsp; since 1939.&nbsp; Sometime in April 1955, he&nbsp; was removed as tenant and the land was given to&nbsp; Santiago Villalobos&nbsp; in May of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; year.&nbsp; Dissatisfied&nbsp; with his&nbsp; dismissal, Maximo filed an action against herein petitioners&nbsp; for reinstatement and&nbsp; damages&nbsp; in the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations on April&nbsp; 18, 1955,&nbsp; docketed as&nbsp; CIR Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 5674-R.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; creation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of Agrarian Relations (Republic Act 1267, as&nbsp; amended by Republic Act 1409), the case was transferred&nbsp; to said Agrarian Court.&nbsp; Judgment was rendered&nbsp; in said&nbsp; case in favor of Maximo,&nbsp; ordering petitioners herein&nbsp; as&nbsp; landlords to reinstate him&nbsp; as&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; on&nbsp; the land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; and to pay&nbsp; him the sum of P482.10,&nbsp; corresponding to his 60 per cent share of the harvest from April 8, 1955 when he was dismissed, to the date of his reinstatement at the rate of P11.00 per cavan.&nbsp; On November&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1956, a writ of execution was issued and served on petitioners on December 13, 1956,<br><br>Ostensibly, the execution was carried out, including the payment of&nbsp; the P482.10 to&nbsp; Maximo, the petitioners promising to immediately reinstate Maximo as tenant.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp; fact, however, that the&nbsp; new&nbsp; tenant,&nbsp; Villalobos, had planted the&nbsp; landholding to rice, and&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time of the issuance of the execution, had a standing rice crop thereon, consisting&nbsp; of&nbsp; two varieties, one&nbsp; to be&nbsp; harvested&nbsp; in January 1957 and the other in March of the same year. So, it was&nbsp; agreed that Villalobos be allowed to harvest his crop, and that after the harvest,&nbsp; the landlords, petitioners herein, would actually reinstate Maximo.&nbsp; On the basis&nbsp; of said verbal&nbsp; agreement, Maximo refrained from taking possession of the land and waited for the termination of the&nbsp; harvest by Villalobos and&nbsp; for notification by the landlords of the day when he would be reinstated by them. It would appear that he was&nbsp; not notified, and so, he did not immediately occupy&nbsp; the land for purposes&nbsp; of cultivation, following the harvest in March 1957.&nbsp; Because of this, petitioners herein&nbsp; forthwith filed&nbsp; a petition with the Agrarian Court,&nbsp; CAR Case No. 103 (Batangas 1957). to eject Maximo Macatangay on the ground that although he had been reinstated as tenant, on December 13, 1956, he thereafter abandoned the landholding and failed to work and cultivate it for the agricultural period from January to April, 1957, thereby depriving them of the harvest.<br><br>Maximo denied the allegations of petitioners and claimed that as already stated, his reinstatement as tenant was postponed until after the harvest of&nbsp; the crop planted by Villalobos. The Agrarian Court found as a&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that Maximo&nbsp; was not&nbsp; actually reinstated&nbsp; as tenant on said landholding after the harvest in January and March, 1957, so that it cannot be said that he had&nbsp; abandoned the land since&nbsp; abandonment presupposes&nbsp; actual and previous possession of the landholding.&nbsp; As already said,&nbsp; the basis&nbsp; of the appeal is that&nbsp; the finding of the Agrarian Court was not&nbsp; supported by&nbsp; substantial evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of reference,&nbsp; we&nbsp; reproduce the&nbsp; findings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Agrarian Court.<br><blockquote>"It is duly&nbsp; established&nbsp; by evidence that&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; was reinstated to&nbsp; his&nbsp; landholding upon the enforcement of the writ of execution issue in CIR Case&nbsp; No. 5674-R, on&nbsp; December 13, 1956. Upon his reinstatement the respondent was entitled&nbsp; to take material possession&nbsp; of the Iandholding in question&nbsp; on said&nbsp; date, but in view of the&nbsp; demand&nbsp; of Santiago Villalobos,&nbsp; for payment of&nbsp; his compensation&nbsp; of the labor performed by him in the cultivation and raising of the&nbsp; standing crop&nbsp; thereon, the petitioners&nbsp; and the&nbsp; respondent have&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; that the former shall&nbsp; actually reinstate&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; to said&nbsp; landholding&nbsp; after the harvest of&nbsp; said&nbsp; crop.&nbsp; This agreement was&nbsp; admitted by the petitioner Visitacion Salud de Sales.<br><br>'Q.—Do you mean to say that your agreement with&nbsp; the respondent and Santiago&nbsp; Villalobos was that the respondent should be reinstated actually&nbsp; in the landholding in question&nbsp; after the harvest of the standing crop on&nbsp; December 13,&nbsp; 1956?<br><br>'A.—Our agreement was that,&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; shall be reinstated as tenant after the harvest of the standing crop&nbsp; in January&nbsp; with respect to&nbsp; the&nbsp; one-half planted&nbsp; to wagwag variety&nbsp; and after the harvest in March on&nbsp; the&nbsp; one-half portion planted to&nbsp; pinorsigue.' (t.s.n.&nbsp; June 11, 1957, pp. 104.)<br><br>"Under the aforementioned agreement&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners were duty bound&nbsp; to notify the respondent of the&nbsp; dates of the&nbsp; harvest of the crop&nbsp; standing on the landholding as of December 13, 1956, and to reinstate the&nbsp; latter after said harvests.&nbsp; These were&nbsp; not done by the petitioners.<br><br>"Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent was not&nbsp; actually&nbsp; reinstated&nbsp; to said&nbsp; landholding after the harvests of January and&nbsp; March, 1957.<br>If the&nbsp; respondent was&nbsp; not&nbsp; actually&nbsp; reinstated to his&nbsp; landholding, how&nbsp; could&nbsp; he&nbsp; abandon something which&nbsp; was not turned&nbsp; over&nbsp; to him.&nbsp; Abandonment of a landholding&nbsp; by a tenant presupposes&nbsp; previous actual possession thereof.<br><br>"We, therefore, hold&nbsp; that the respondent&nbsp; is not guilty of abandonment of the landholding in question&nbsp; as&nbsp; charged by the petitioner."<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; have carefully examined the&nbsp; record of this case and we are convinced&nbsp; that the appealed decision is supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; Maximo could not have abandoned the land in question so as to give rise to his ejectment therefrom for the reason that he was never actually reinstated.&nbsp; But in spite of this, lack of reinstatement, Maximo just the same went to the land several times in April 1957, after Villalobos had harvested his crop, in order to prepare the land for cultivation, but that instead of allowing&nbsp; him to work and cultivate the land, petitioners filed the present action for&nbsp; ejectment.&nbsp; It is most unlikely that if Maximo had&nbsp; really been reinstated and placed in possession of the landholding, that he would abandon it, because he depended upon its cultivation for his livelihood, and in fact, he fought his landlords in&nbsp; court to get it back.<br><br>We&nbsp; agree with the&nbsp; trial court that&nbsp; Maximo had not abandoned the land, and therefore, could not be ejected therefrom.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the&nbsp; decision appealed&nbsp; from is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera, </i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
