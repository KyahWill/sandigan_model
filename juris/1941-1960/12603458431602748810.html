				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal is taken directly&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; from the judgment&nbsp; in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 14249 of the Court of First Instance of the&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; wherein the&nbsp; defendants, now appellants,&nbsp; were&nbsp; sentenced as follows:<br><blockquote>"(a) Ordering Celia&nbsp; Reyes to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P26,436.00 with interest at 12 per&nbsp; cent, per&nbsp; annum on P3,436.00 from&nbsp; May 22, 1951,&nbsp; and on P23.000.00&nbsp; from&nbsp; May 24,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; until fully paid, plus attorney's fees which&nbsp; the court fixes at P2,500.00;<br><br>(b) Ordering Celia Reyes and Alto&nbsp; Surety and Insurance Co., Inc.,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; jointly&nbsp; and&nbsp; severally, (the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P25,000.00 with interest thereon&nbsp; at&nbsp; 12 per&nbsp; cent per annum from May 24,&nbsp; 1951, until fully paid,&nbsp; plus additional attorney's&nbsp; fees&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P2,500.00, and the cost of&nbsp; suit;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *" (Rec. App. pp. 125-126.)<br></blockquote>The material facts of the&nbsp; case are&nbsp; succinctly&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"In 1951&nbsp; and for some time prior to that year,&nbsp; Celia&nbsp; Reyes did business under the trade&nbsp; name "Celia David".&nbsp; On May 18, 1951, she ordered&nbsp; by telephone from&nbsp; Hans Wenger,&nbsp; then the manager of plaintiff's foodstuffs department,&nbsp; 600 cases of&nbsp; 'Luneta sardines for the price&nbsp; of P9,936.00.&nbsp; Wenger routed the corresponding&nbsp; sales order to H. B.&nbsp; Mill, then plaintiff's&nbsp; office&nbsp; and credit manager, who approved the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; on c.o.d. basis.&nbsp; (Exhibit A-Deposition).&nbsp; An invoice covering the transaction was prepared and the sardines&nbsp; were delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; Celia&nbsp; Reyes.&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B).&nbsp; Of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreed price&nbsp; of P9.936.00 Celia Reyes&nbsp; has paid P6,500.00 only&nbsp; (Exhibits 16 and 17), leaving an unpaid balance of P3,436.00.<br><br>About May 20,&nbsp; 1951, Celia Reyes again telephoned Wenger and asked for 3,000 cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; 'Modesto, evaporated&nbsp; milk, promising&nbsp; to return the milk when her shipment of 4,500 cases and 500 bundles would arrive.&nbsp; Mill rejected&nbsp; the proposition and Wanger communicated&nbsp; the rejection to her by telephone and informed her that she could&nbsp; have&nbsp; the milk on&nbsp; 'net,&nbsp; cash' basis.&nbsp; She&nbsp; agreed;&nbsp; Wenger prepared a sales invoice&nbsp; for 3,000 cartons of 'Modesto' evaporated milk at P16.00&nbsp; a&nbsp; carton, or for a total&nbsp; price of P48,000.00.&nbsp; Mill approved the transaction&nbsp; and&nbsp; the corresponding invoice was prepared.&nbsp; (Exhibits&nbsp; A-1, pp.&nbsp; 9-13, 27-30; B-Deposition;&nbsp; and C).<br><br>The milk was&nbsp; delivered to Celia Reyes on May 23 and 24, 1951. Jose Techico, plaintiff's collector, went to&nbsp; Celia Reyes to collect after&nbsp; the deliveries of the 600&nbsp; cases of sardines and 3,000 cases&nbsp; of milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had no money&nbsp; and told Techico to return the next day, then the next&nbsp; and again the next, but she still had no money&nbsp; to pay.&nbsp; Mill also demanded&nbsp; payment from her, personally and through the telephone, but she Informed Mill&nbsp; that she had no&nbsp; funds&nbsp; at the time.&nbsp; She visited&nbsp; plaintiff's office on June 13,&nbsp; 1951, and made out a check for&nbsp; P10,000.00&nbsp; as partial payment on&nbsp; her&nbsp; indebtedness but the check&nbsp; was&nbsp; dishonored&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; drawer's insufficiency of funds to&nbsp; meet the amount thereof.&nbsp; The check was intended&nbsp; to cover&nbsp; the cost&nbsp; of the sardines and the balance in the sum of P64.00 as partial payment of the&nbsp; price of the milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibits K, O, O-1)<br><br>To&nbsp; guaranty payment of the price of the 3,000 cases of 'Modesto' evaporated milk Celia Reyes&nbsp; was required to&nbsp; put up a surety bond. She&nbsp; did, on July 5, 1951,&nbsp; through&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Alto Surety and Insurance Co., Inc.,&nbsp; but only for P25,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimize its loss plaintiff had to be content with the&nbsp; bond."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rec. App. 113-115).<br></blockquote>On July 16,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp;&nbsp; Atkins,&nbsp; Kroll and&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Inc., filed&nbsp; suit&nbsp; in the court below to recover the outstanding indebtedness of Celia Reyes and&nbsp; obtained a writ of attachment.&nbsp; Having obtained no satisfaction, it&nbsp; amended the complaint on October&nbsp; 17, 1951 to implead the Alto Surety &amp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc., as&nbsp; additional party&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; to make effective&nbsp; the&nbsp; performance bond guaranteeing&nbsp; Celia Reyes' debt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The surety company admitted-the execution of the bond&nbsp; but defended&nbsp; saying that&nbsp; the bond was not accepted or approved by&nbsp; the creditor, and that its liability depended&nbsp; upon&nbsp; that of the principal debtor&nbsp; Celia. Reyes, while the latter in turn, denied&nbsp; liability for the merchandise and counterclaim for damages. Judgment being rendered, after due trial,&nbsp; against both defendants, as&nbsp; previously stated, this&nbsp; appeal was taken.<br><br>The appeal&nbsp; of&nbsp; Celia Reyes was,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; by our resolution&nbsp; of August&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1957; hence, only the contentions of the surety&nbsp; need now to be considered.<br><br>It is&nbsp; the principal contention&nbsp; of appellant Alto&nbsp; Surety Co. that the bond subscribe by it, with&nbsp; Celia Reyes as principal!, was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into with the&nbsp; understanding that Celia Reyes&nbsp; would&nbsp; be given time to pay&nbsp; her obligations to the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellee, but the latter filed&nbsp; suit shortly after the bond was executed in violation of the understanding.&nbsp; It may have been that Celia Reyes actually hoped that by furnishing the bond,&nbsp; plaintiff would be induced to extend the period for paying her debts;&nbsp; nevertheless, we find&nbsp; nothing in the record to show that this expectation on her part actually was agreed&nbsp; to&nbsp; by the creditor.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is highly significant that the written&nbsp; suretyship agreement makes no mention whatever of any&nbsp; extension&nbsp; of the principal's obligation&nbsp; to pay for the&nbsp; 3000 cases "Modesto" milk she had ordered, nor does&nbsp; it provide that the surety's liability (expressly made solidary with Celia) was&nbsp; conditioned upon&nbsp; her obtaining additional&nbsp; time to&nbsp; make her payments.&nbsp; The conditions of the bond are recited&nbsp; therein (Exhibit G)&nbsp; to be as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"THE&nbsp; CONDITIONS OF THIS OBLIGATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br></div><br>Whereas, on the 24th&nbsp; day&nbsp; of May, 1951, the&nbsp;&nbsp; above-bounded principal and&nbsp; the company entered into&nbsp; a—C.O.D.&nbsp; Sale&nbsp; per Invoice&nbsp; 16171—copy&nbsp; of which&nbsp; is hereto attached, marked&nbsp; Annex 'A', and made a&nbsp; part&nbsp; hereof;<br><br>WHEREAS, the principal is&nbsp; now indebted or otherwise liable&nbsp; to the company&nbsp; under the said agreement; and<br><br>WHEREAS, the COMPANY has&nbsp; required the&nbsp; PRINCIPAL to give a good and&nbsp; sufficient bond in&nbsp; the sum of pesos TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND only (P25,000.00), Philippine Currency to guarantee the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of all the principal's indebtedness&nbsp; now due or which&nbsp; may hereafter&nbsp; become due and the faithful performance of her duty and obligations under the said agreement of the 24th&nbsp; day of May, 1956, and the other terms and conditions of the said agreement.<br><br>NOW,&nbsp; THEREFORE, if the&nbsp; above-bounden&nbsp; PRINCIPAL shall pay&nbsp; all her indebtedness now due or which may hereafter become due to the COMPANY and shall faithfully and truly perform all her obligations under the said agreement of the 24th day of&nbsp; May,&nbsp; 1951, then this obligation&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void, otherwise,&nbsp; it shall&nbsp; remain in&nbsp; full&nbsp; force and&nbsp; effect.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Appellee's Brief, pp. 8-9)<br></blockquote>It is difficult to conceive how&nbsp; such an important condition affecting the&nbsp; surety's liability could&nbsp; be omitted from the terms&nbsp; of the&nbsp; bond prepared by the surety itself; and its absence is strong evidence against the surety's contentions. &nbsp;<br>This finding&nbsp; is corroborated by the fact that when extrajudicial&nbsp; demand for&nbsp; payment&nbsp; was made upon the surety, the latter's written answer (Exhibit&nbsp; I) made no mention whatever of any&nbsp; extended term of payment nor did its answer to the amended complaint interpose that defense.<br><br>We&nbsp; have heretofore&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; (Pacific&nbsp; Tobacco&nbsp; Corp. <i>vs.</i> Lorenzana and Visayan Surety, 102 Phil.,&nbsp; 234 and Philippine Surety &amp; Ins. Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Royal Oil&nbsp; Products,&nbsp; 102&nbsp; Phil., 326),&nbsp; that the <span style="font-style: italic;">strictissimi juris</span> rule&nbsp; of&nbsp; interpretation does not&nbsp; apply to the engagements of corporate sureties engaged in the business of furnishing bonds for compensation, and who&nbsp; are, furthermore, secured from all possible loss&nbsp; by&nbsp; adequate counterbonds. We see&nbsp;&nbsp; no&nbsp; reason for deviating from that norm.&nbsp; We find that the Court below did not err in holding that no extension of the period&nbsp; to pay has been stipulated.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed. Costs in this instance against appellant Alto Surety and Insurance Co. Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
