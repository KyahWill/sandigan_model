				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari from a decision of Judge Baltazar M.&nbsp; Villanueva, Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations, dated April 22, 1957, ,in case No. 33, for unfair labor practice in Cebu. In&nbsp; August, 1955,&nbsp; petitioners were charged with unfair labor practice for having&nbsp; interfered with,&nbsp; restrained or coerced their workers or laborers who are affiliated to, or are&nbsp; members of&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; union.&nbsp; After hearing Judge Villanueva&nbsp; found that the&nbsp; complaint is sustained by&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence submitted&nbsp; at the hearing;&nbsp; that in many instances, respondents showed their anti-union activities towards the Democratic Labor Union, complainant; that respondents were ordered to stop working in the hacienda owned&nbsp; and managed&nbsp; by the petitioners&nbsp; herein because they were members of the Democratic Labor Union; that Jimenez, petitioner herein,&nbsp; had been telling the members of the union that he advised or recommended to the owners of the hacienda not to give cash advances to the members of the union, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judge, therefore, found the&nbsp; information well founded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this decision of the judge, a petition for certiorari has&nbsp; been filed directly with us.<br><br>The most important question which we think to be decisive of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case, is whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; an appeal from a decision of a judge of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations, as in this case, may be appealed&nbsp; directly to this Court, without the previous presentation of a motion for reconsideration of the&nbsp; decision before the Court of Industrial Relations <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span>.&nbsp; Respondents&nbsp; claim that a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">en&nbsp; banc</span> is&nbsp; necessary before an&nbsp; appeal can be made&nbsp; in this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; while petitioners claim that such&nbsp; step is not necessary in unfair labor practice cases, such&nbsp; as the case at bar.&nbsp; The reason for petitioners' contention is the fact that section 5(e) of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875 confers&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; the court <span style="font-style: italic;">or any judge thereof;</span> that appeals&nbsp; in unfair&nbsp; labor practice cases are governed exclusively by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 875, which requires&nbsp; no motion for reconsideration to be presented,&nbsp; prior to the appeal to this Court, to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">en&nbsp; banc.</span><br><br>It is&nbsp; to be noted that Republic Act No. 875 does not propose to amend or modify the&nbsp; constitution&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial Relations or the procedure established in the Act of its creation (C.A. No. 103), or appeals therefrom. Section 1 of Said Commonwealth Act No. 103 expressly provides that if any of the parties aggrieved by a decision or ruling of any of the judges, requests for a reconsideration of said&nbsp; decision, it&nbsp; must be&nbsp; presented to the judges who shall sit together, and that the concurrence of at least three of the five&nbsp; judges shall be necessary for the pronouncement of a&nbsp; decision, order, or award.&nbsp; This provision has always been followed in cases of appeals to this Court by certiorari.&nbsp; To such effect are the rulings of this Court in the cases of Manila&nbsp; Terminal Relief and&nbsp; Mutual Aid Association <i>vs.</i> Manila Terminal Co., 88 Phil.,&nbsp; 395; and Rizal Cement Co. <i>vs.</i> Court of Industrial Relations, G. R. No. L-10312,&nbsp; July 26, 1957.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no provision in the Industrial Peace Act which modifies the constitution of the court or the procedure&nbsp; therein as expressed&nbsp; in Section 1&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 103.&nbsp; And the&nbsp; very language of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Industrial Peace Act&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that in unfair labor practice cases the person aggrieved by any <span style="font-style: italic;">order of the court</span> may&nbsp; appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines&nbsp; (Sec. 6,&nbsp; Rep. Act No. 875).&nbsp; The provision does&nbsp; not authorize&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; from any decision made by a judge but&nbsp; only&nbsp; from decisions of the court. The court&nbsp; is constituted by a presiding judge and&nbsp; four associate judges&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 1, C.A. No. 103).&nbsp;&nbsp; When, therefore, the Industrial&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Act&nbsp; authorizes an appeal from a decision of the court to the Supreme&nbsp; Court, the decision that can be appealed is that rendered by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> and not that rendered by any judge thereof.<br><br>The provision in Commonwealth Act No. 103 authorizing presentation of a motion for reconsideration of a decision or order of the judge to the&nbsp; court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span>, and not direct appeal&nbsp; therefrom to&nbsp; this Court, is also in accord with the principle or exhaustion&nbsp; of administrative remedies before resort can be made to this Court.&nbsp; If the court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> can give the relief that a party may desire, there would be no need of coming to&nbsp; us for such relief.&nbsp; This procedural requirement that a reconsideration must first be sought from the court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> is therefore&nbsp; based on principle&nbsp; and administrative efficiency,&nbsp; aside from the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is expressly provided for by law.<br><br>We find no reason for deviating from this express&nbsp; provision of law which&nbsp; is based on a practical policy,&nbsp; and we are, therefore,&nbsp; constrained to dismiss the petition for certiorari, with costs against petitioners.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Endencia, Barrera,</span>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gutierrez&nbsp; David,&nbsp; JJ., </span>concur.</div>
