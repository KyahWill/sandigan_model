				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The appellant Isaac Farol was, together with several other persons, charged 
with kidnapping for ransom in three criminal cases (Nos. 584, 585 and 587) of 
the Court of First Instance of Batangas, which were instituted following, an 
investigation made by the Philippine Constabulary and other police authorities 
in connection with the kidnapping of (1) Dr. Norberto Quisumbing on July 27, 
1952, (2) a boy name Andres Lara in March, 1953, and (3) Dr. Timoteo Alday on 
June 30 of that same year, the investigation having revealed that the 
kidnappings were perpetrated by an organized gang headed by this appellant.<p></p>
<p>With some of the defendants still unapprehended, the three cases came up 
for hearing and with the conformity of the defense were tried jointly. The trial 
resulted in the conviction of Farol and Apolinar Plandez in Caso No. 584 (for 
the kidnapping of Dr. Norberto Quisumbing), the acquittal of Farol and the 
conviction of Manuel Silva and Apolinar Plandez in Case No. 585 (for the 
kidnapping of Andres Lara) and the conviction of Farol, Manuel Silva, Exequiel 
Silva and Bias Bejasa in Case No, 587 for the kidnapping of Dr. Timoteo Alday), 
the sentence imposed in each case being life imprisonment plus indemnity and 
costs. But though several defendants were convicted, the record now before us 
discloses that only Farol has appealed, the appeal being from the sentence 
imposed upon him for the kidnapping of Drs. Quisumbing and Alday in Cases Nos. 
584 and 587, respectively.</p>
<p>With reference to the kidnapping of Dr. Norberto Quisumbing (Case No. 584), 
the evidence shows and it is not disputed that in the morning of July 27, 1952 
this doctor, then a resident of Pasay City, went with some companions to the 
barrio of Castillo in the municipality of Rosario, Batangas, to inspect his race 
horses. While he was there writing down the names of the horses to be examined, 
a group of armed men, about seven or eight, came and, after identifying him, 
seized and dragged him away from his companions. First they took him to San Juan 
in the same province, where they passed the night, and thereafter they moved him 
from barrio to barrio, keeping him all the time in custody until he was ransomed 
by his family some days later. The negotiations for ransom were effected through 
the Mediation of the appellant Farol, whom the family and friends of Dr. 
Quisumbing had contacted for the purpose, the said appellant having been mayor 
of the town (Rosario) where the kidnapping took place.</p>
<p>Appellant admitted having initiated and conducted the negotiations for 
ransom, but claimed that he only did it out of pity to Dr. Quisumbing's wife. 
According to his version, while he was looking for someone to contact the gang 
of kidnappers, a man - whose name he did not mention - came to tell him that the 
gang wanted to speak to him. Through this man he learned that the gang was 
demanding a ransom of P100,000. But again through this man he succeeded in 
having the demand reduced to P20,000 on the plea that this was all the family of 
Dr. Quisumbing could afford to pay. Following the instructions given by that 
same man, he went by car to the appointed place near the Bantillan bridge in San 
Juan, Batangas, on the night designated for the payment of the ransom. With him, 
besides the driver, were Francisco Medrano, then technical adviser in the Import 
Control Commission, Esteban Mayo of the Games and Amusement Board and 
Quisumbing's son-in-law Anselmo Villar. As they neared the appointed place, he 
got off the car and walked alone till he entered a concrete gate with iron 
grills. There he was met by a man who introduced himself as the one to receive 
the ransom money and who also told him where Dr. Quisumbing would be found. He 
did not believe the kidnappers would "double-cross" him and so he handed the 
money to the man without even seeing the doctor. The man then told him to go 
back to the car and drive in the direction of Candelaria, Quezon province, and 
he would meet Dr. Quisumbing on the road. The man proved to be as good as his 
word, for appellant and his companions soon found the doctor on the road 
indicated, already free from his captors.</p>
<p>As to the kidnapping of Dr. Timoteo Alday (Case No. the evidence shows and it 
is also not disputed that this doctor was, in the afternoon of June 30, 1953, 
fetched from his house in San Jose, Batangas, by Blas Bejasa, one of the accused 
in that case, supposedly to attend to the delivery of the latter's wife in 
barrio Galamayamo of that same municipality. But when the two were already out 
of the <u>poblacion</u>, ths jeep on which they were riding was stopped by a group of 
armed men. who, after identifying the doctor, asked him if he could go with them 
and attend to a man who had been shot. The doctor begged to be excused, telling 
them that he was on his way to a delivery case. But saying that theirs was an 
urgent case, they forced him at gun point to go with them. First, he was taken 
by them to a wooded place, where he was blindfolded and relieved of his watch 
and money. Then when darkness came, they took him to a hut in Cuenca, Batangas. 
From there he was moved from place to place - sometimes blindfolded - until he 
was ransomed eight days later. During his captivity, he was made to write to his 
wife that his kidnappers were demanding a ransom of P70,000 with the threat that 
something serious would happen if the money was not sent and that his life would 
be in danger if the Army should intervene. Through the mediation of Mayor Pasia 
of Cuenca and Mayor Masilu√±gan of San Jose, the ransom demanded was reduced to 
P15,000, and this amount was paid by the doctor's family to the 
kidnappers-through Councilor Remo, now deceased. <br></p><p>Both Dr. Quisumbing and Dr. Alday, it would appear, were kidnapped by a gang organized by 
appellant and operating under his direction. This is shown by the testimony of 
the Government witnesses with corroboration from some of the defendants.</p>
<p>Sixto Fajardo, testifying for the prosecution, declared that he was a former 
companion and errand boy of appellant's and as such had on two occasions 
delivered letters to Juaning Perez, appellant's right-hand man in a gang headed 
and armed by him; that the firearms furnished by appellant to the members of the 
gang were those formerly used by his civilian guards (appellant having been a 
'mayor of the municipality of Rosario); that following his defeat as a candidate 
for member of the provincial board of Batangas in the election of 1951, 
appellant called the members of the gang to a meeting in his coconut grove in 
the barrio of Macalamcam, Rosario, and his father even had a cow slaughtered for 
the occasion; that the meeting was held at night and attended by about 62 men, 
and appellant, taking his position in the middle of the group, Addressed them as 
follows: "All political enemies in Rosario should be robbed and killed and those 
who have money should be kidnapped and detained for ransom, so that we may have 
money"; that of that gang which appellant had organized for the purpose of 
robbing and killing his political enemies and kidnapping the rich for ransom, 
he, witness, came to be a member and he was furnished with a carbine; that realizing later that nothing good could come out of it, he signified his desire 
to quit but Juaning Perez told him not to do so because appellant had given 
orders that he be liquidated should he separate from the group for the reason 
that he already knew too much of the organization's doings and in the event of 
capture.might divulge their activities; and that of the members of the gang 
there were seven who always went together, and those included himself, Juaning 
Perez and Juan Carandang (one of the accused still at large).</p>
<p>Gregorio Albes, an accused who had been discharged so that he could be 
utilized as a witness for the Government, confirmed the existence of the 
kidnapping gang with appellant as its over-all commander. He declared that he 
had been induced to join it by Juaning Perez in April, 1953, and that among its 
members (those he could remember) were Bias Bejasa., Exequiel Silva, Tomas 
Lajara, Manuel Silva, Abdon Bautista, Juaning Perez, Isaias Comia, Timoteo 
Limbo, Victorio Umali, Julian Fortus and Ambrosio Umali; that Juaning Perez, who 
was their immediate chief, often conferred with appellant in the latter's house 
in Macalamcam, and that he heard the two talking about a plan to kidnap Dr. 
Alday, appellant saying that he would furnish the vehicle for the purpose and 
that Dr. Alday should be the one they should kidnap because he was well-to-do; 
that the group that were to apprehend this doctor set out from Macalamcam in a 
car furnished by appellant; that after the kidnapping he heard appellant 
instruct Juaning Perez to demand a large ransom because Alday was rid but that 
he later learned that the ransom paid was only P15,000 that Perez gave him P75 
as his share; that not long thereafter the gang disbanded because of continuous 
raids by the Army and the Constabulary; that he left his firearm in Mabato 
because word had come from appellant that their firearms should be left there 
and that they should hide because the Army ant. the Constabulary were after 
them; and that on October, 1953, he surrendered to the Chief of Police of 
Rosario because Juaning Perez had already died and also because he realized that 
their organization was against the law.</p>
<p>Appellant's co-defendants Blas Bejasa and Exequiel Silva also made 
incriminatory statements against him. Their extra-judicial confessions revealed 
the existence of a snatch gang headed by appellant, and at the trial they 
testified that they were with the group that kidnapped Dr. Alday; that the group 
started from a place near appellant's house in barrio Macalamcam; that just 
before they left, appellant was near the car talking to Juaning Perez; and that 
appellant was the one who ordered them to get on the car and proceed. Blay 
Bejasa further testified that he saw appellant come on that same car the; same 
day and that it was also appellant who furnished the firearms carried by the 
group.</p>
<p>Disclaiming any part in the kidnapping of Drs. Alday and Quisumbing, 
appellant denied having organized any kidnapping gang, and explained that in 
January, 1952, he was, under deten-h tion for 22 days in the Constabulary 
stockade at Canlubang while a criminal case was being prepared against him for 
the murder of three persons; that during the trial of the said case between 
January and July, 1952, he spent most of his time in Manila preparing his 
defense; that he was acquitted in the case on July 12, 1952; that he only came 
to know about the kidnapping of Dr. Quisumbing when he was approached by the 
letter's relatives and friends and asked to help in the search; that reluctant 
though he was at first to intervene for fear of getting involved again in a 
criminal case, he finally acceded to their request after being assured by 
Francisco Medrano and Esteban Mayo that no harm would come to him. He further 
testified that the early part of 1953, shortly after his father's death, he was 
busy in his farms at barrios Rosario and Macalamcam, and that the latter part of 
that year he used to make trips to Quezon and the Bicol provinces looking for 
some lucrative business to engage in.</p>
<p>Not giving credence to appellant's exculpatory statements, and believing 
instead the testimony of Sixto Fajardo and Gregorio Albes, which finds 
corroboration in that of the defendants Bias Bejasa and Exequiel Silva, the 
trial court found appellant guilty as principal in both cases.</p>
<p>After going over the record, we find no reason for disturbing this verdict. 
The evidence is clear that following his defeat as a candidate for member of the 
provincial board of Batangas in the election of 1951, appellant called his band 
of followers to a night meeting and told them that they were to rob and kill 
their political enemies and to kidnap the rich for ransom. He made Juaning 
Perez, his right-hand man, their ostensible commander and furnished them 
firearms to be used for the purpose. He did not take part in the actual 
apprehension of the victims, preferring to remain, as it were, behind the 
scenes. But it is obvious that he was keeping in touch with the snatch gang and 
that it was his wishes or orders that were being followed. He appears in truth 
to be the supreme leader as well as the mastermind of the group.</p>
<p>Thus, in the kidnapping of Dr. Quisumbing, appellant was not with the group 
that snatched and hid this doctor. But it is established that he was sending 
messages to Juaning Perez, his right-hand man, who was in direct command of the 
gang. And the fact that he was in reality their over-all commander, that he kept 
in touch with them and that it was his orders or wishes that were carried out 
may be gleaned from the way he effected the release of this doctor. For he had 
no difficulty in contacting the kidnappers and he was practically the one who 
fixed the amount of the ransom by having it reduced from P100,000 to P20,000. 
The ransom was handed by him to one who did not even have to give his name to 
be recognized as the one authorized to receive it. And he also parted with the 
money without even seeing the man to be ransomed. His very explanation that he 
did not expect to be double-crossed bespeaks close connection between him and 
the gang and jibes with the idea of his being its chief.</p>
<p>So also in the kidnapping of Dr. Alday, the appellant did not appear to be 
with the group when this doctor was seized and taken to different places; but he 
it was who named the do, tor as the one to be kidnapped and he was heard 
discussing the plan with his right-hand man, Juaning Perez. The kidnappers 
gathered at his place and it was he himself who started them off after 
furnishing them a car. He it was also who gave them firearms. Then, after the 
gang had seized Dr. Alday and already had him in custody, appellant instructed 
Juaning Perez to demand a large sum because the doctor was rich. And then after 
the ransom had been paid, appellant sent word to the members of the gang to 
leave their firearms in a designated place and go in hiding because the Army and 
the Constabulary were after them. These facts leave no room for doubt that the 
appellant planned, masterminded and even ordered the kidnapping of Dr. Alday. 
<br><br>Counsel for appellant questions the trustworthiness of the testimony of 
the prosecution witnesses Sixto Fajardo and Gregorio Albes, and of his own 
co-accused Blas Bejasa and Exequiel Silva insomuch as the said testimony links 
him with the kidnapping of the two doctors. This, however, is a matter of 
credibility of which the trial court should be the best judge, having itself 
heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witness on the stand. And 
the record, in our opinion, discloses no compelling reason for holding that 
their testimony was not entitled to the weight given to it by the learned trial 
judge.</p>
<p>After going over the record, we have come to the conclusion that appellant's 
conviction in the two cases (Criminal Cases Nos. 584 and 587) now before us is 
justified by the evidence.<br></p><p>In Criminal Case No. 587, which refers to the 
kidnapping of Dr. Alday, the Solicitor-General recommends the imposition of the 
death penalty on the theory that the crime was committed with the aggravating 
circumstance of craft because Bias Bejasa, one of the kidnappers, succeeded in 
taking the doctor from his house on the pretext that he was to attend to a 
delivery case. There is, however, no sufficient vote for meting out that penalty 
so that the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> imposed below must be allowed to 
stand.</p>
<p>As to Criminal Case No. 584, which refers to the kidnap ping of Dr. 
Quisumbing, there appears to be no question that the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>
perpetua</u> imposed by the lower court is in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Prior to the submission of his brief, the appellant filed a motion for new 
trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence and nullity of judgment.</p>
<p>The alleged newly discovered evidence consists of sworn statements of Blas 
Bejasa and Exequiel Silva, two of appellant's co-accused now serving life 
sentence in Bilibid, to the effect, that what they testified in court about 
appellant being present when the kidnappers left his place in Macalamcam bound 
for San Jose to kidnap Dr. Alday was not true and that they had been induced to 
so testify (by the Constabulary) through torture, threat of bodily harm and 
promise of acquittal, Bejasa even going to the extent of stating that the fiscal 
joined ir that promise. But statements of this kind would, presumably, not be 
hard to get from criminals who, like these affiants, are already in prison for 
life and have therefore little or nothing at all to lose by making a retraction 
that would save someone from the same fate. And we have observed, as a matter of 
fact, that resort to the use of affidavits of recantation for that purpose is 
becoming rather common. Appellate courts must, therefore, be wary of accepting 
such affidavits at their face value, always bearing in mind that the testimony 
which they purport to vary or contradict was taken in an open and free trial in 
a court of justice and under conditions calculated to discourage and forestall 
falsehood, those conditions being, as pointed out in the case of U. S. vs. Dacir 
(26 Phil. 507) that such testimony "is given under the sanction of an oath and 
of the penalties prescribed for perjury; that the witness' story is told in the 
presence of an impartial judge in the course a solemn trial in an open court; 
that the witness is subject to cross-examination, with all the facilities 
afforded thereby to test the truth and accuracy of his statements and to develop 
his attitude of mind towards the parties, and his disposition to assist the 
cause of truth rather than to further some personal end; that the proceedings 
are had under the protection of the court and under such conditions as to 
remove, so far as is humanly possible, all likelihood that undue or unfair 
influences will be exercised to induce the witness to testify falsely; and 
finally that under the watchful eye of a trained judge his manner, his general 
bearing and demeanor and even the intonation of his voice often unconsciously 
disclose the degree of credit to which he is entitled as a witness." Unless 
there be special circumstances which, coupled with the retraction of the 
witness, really raise a doubt as to the truth of the testimony given by him at 
the trial and accepted by the trial judge, and only if such testimony is 
essential to the judgment of conviction so much so that its elimination would 
lead the trial judge to a different conclusion, a new trial based on such 
retraction would not be justified. Otherwise, there would never be an end to a 
criminal litigation and the administration of justice would be at the mercy of 
criminals and the unscrupulous. In the present case, the affidavits of 
retraction furnished by the prisoners Bejasa and Silva, considered with the 
other circumstances of the case, are not enough to raise doubt as to the truth 
of what they testified in court, which testimony is, moreover, merely 
corroborative since there is already the testimony of the prosecution witnesses 
Gregorio Albes and Sixto Fajardo which links appellant to the kidnapping of Dr. 
Quisumbing end Dr. Alday and when taken with the other facts proved, leave no 
room for doubt as to his guilt. In our opinion the said affidavits do not 
warrant a new trial.</p>
<p>As to the alleged nullity of judgment as second ground for new trial, the 
defense alleges that Judge Juan T. Enrique, who heard these cases and signed the 
decision, was no longer judge of the Court of First Instance of Batangas when 
the decision was promulgated in that court on July 9, 1954, having been already 
been appointed judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal and such 
appointment was effective on July 1, 1954. But the allegation is not under oath, 
legally insufficient to destroy the presumption that official duty has been duly 
performed, whereas the following excerpt from the brief for the Government shows 
the factual basis for the claim of nullity to be inaccurate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The argument that the decision appealed from is void because Judge Enriquez 
was no longer Judge of the Court of First Instance of Batangas on July 9, 1954 
when his decision dated June 30, 1954 was promulgated is absolutely without 
merit as being contrary to fact. It is not true that Judge Enriquez became a 
judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal on July 1, 1954, as pretended by 
the defense for the records in the Department of Justice disclose that Judge 
Enriquez' appointment for the Court of First Instance of Rizal was submitted for 
confirmation to the Commission on Appointments only on July 19, 1954, and the 
same was confirmed on July 30, 1954. It is, therefore, logical to conclude that 
Judge Enriquez took his oath as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
very much after the promulgation of the decision in this case on July 9, 1954. 
As a matter of fact, a personal verification from Judge Enriquez confirms our 
belief that he assumed office as Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
after the promulgation of his decision in the Farol case. Furthermore, the 
records in the Department of Justice also show that Judge Luis Reyes who 
succeeded Judge Enriquez in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, only took 
his oath as Judge of the said court on November 13, 1954. It cannot be 
questioned, therefore, that Judge Enriquez was still a judge de jure of Batangas 
not only at the time when the Farol decision was signed and entered with the 
Clerk of Court of Batangas but also when his decision was promulgated. While it 
is true that he was not present in Batangas at the time of the promulgation of 
the decision, that fact, however, will not affect the validity of the judgment 
because Sec. 6 of Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, specifically states that 'when 
the judge is absent or outside of the province his presence is not necessary and 
the judgment may be promulgated or read to the defendant by the Clerk of 
Court.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the motion for new trial is denied and the 
judgments appealed from are affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><i>Paras, Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia, </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</p></div>
