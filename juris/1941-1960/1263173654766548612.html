				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff-appellant sold a parcel of land&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; District of Malate,&nbsp; City of Manila, to the&nbsp; defendants-appellees' for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P150,000,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; transaction was evidenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; sale with mortgage executed on December 18, 1943, providing, among other conditions. as follows:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; it is hereby agreed that of the purchase price of one hundred AND&nbsp; FIFTY&nbsp; THOUSAND&nbsp; PESOS&nbsp; (P150,000.00),&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of ONE hundred&nbsp; thousand pesos&nbsp; (P100,000.00) shall be paid&nbsp; by the PARTY OF THE SECOND PART TO THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART upon the signing of this deed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; receipt "whereof is hereby acknowledge&nbsp; by the PARTY OP THE FIRST PART, and the balance of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.(IO)&nbsp; shall be paid in the manner specified below:<br><br>"That&nbsp; to secure the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; fifty thou- SA.ND PESOS&nbsp; (50,000,00),&nbsp; the&nbsp; PARTY&nbsp; OF&nbsp; THE&nbsp; SECOND&nbsp; PART has transferred and&nbsp; conveyed, and by these presents does&nbsp; hereby transfer&nbsp; and&nbsp; convey&nbsp; by way&nbsp; oi&nbsp; first&nbsp; mortgage, in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART, his heirs, executors, administrators,&nbsp; assigns, and succesors in interests, the parcel of land above described, free from&nbsp; all&nbsp; liens, charges&nbsp; and encumbrances,&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the following terms&nbsp; and conditions:<br><br>"That&nbsp; no&nbsp; payment on&nbsp; the balance of fifty thousand&nbsp; pesos (P50,000.00)&nbsp; shall be made and&nbsp; no interest shall&nbsp; accrue thereon until after one year&nbsp; counted from the&nbsp; date of ratification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Treaty of&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; concluding the present&nbsp; Greater East&nbsp; Asia&nbsp; War; and&nbsp; that thereafter, interest at the rate of eight&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; (8%) per annum shall&nbsp; be paid monthly, payment&nbsp; to&nbsp; be made within the first five (5) days of the month to which the interest corresponds.<br><br>"That&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole amount&nbsp; of FIFTY thousand&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; (P50.000.00) shall be&nbsp; fully paid within a period of three&nbsp; (3) years&nbsp; counted from the date&nbsp; of the expiration of one year after the ratification of the Treaty of&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; concluding1 the present&nbsp; Greater East Asia War, during which period payments on the principal may&nbsp; be&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the party of the second part,&nbsp; together with&nbsp; the interest that&nbsp; may have become due&nbsp; and payable."<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>"That the conditions of this mortgage are such that if the party op the second part, her&nbsp; heirs, executors, administrators,&nbsp; assigns, and successors in interest shall well and truly perform the&nbsp; full obligation as stated in this deed according to the terms&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; then this obligation shall be null and void;&nbsp; otherwise,&nbsp; it&nbsp; shall remain in full force and effect and shall be subject to foreclosure,&nbsp; whether judicially or extra-judicially at the option of the PARTY OF THE FIRST PART."</blockquote>It is noteworthy that no payment&nbsp; on the&nbsp; balance of P50,000.00 was to be made&nbsp; and no interest was to&nbsp; accrue thereon until after one year from the date of the ratification of the Treaty of Peace concluding the Greater East Asia War; that&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; interest at eight&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; per annum,&nbsp; should be paid monthly within the first five days of the corresponding month; and that the whole&nbsp; amount of P50,000.00 should be paid&nbsp; within three years counted from the expiration&nbsp; of one year after the ratification of the Treaty of Peace concluding&nbsp; the Greater&nbsp; East Asia War.<br><br>Contending that the parties&nbsp; had&nbsp; in mind the&nbsp; factual termination of the Greater East Asia War which occurred on September 2,&nbsp; 1945 when the treaty of surrender of the Japanese&nbsp; Imperial Forces to the Allied Forces&nbsp; was&nbsp; signed at Tokyo Bay, and in&nbsp; view of appellees' failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the balance of P50,000.00&nbsp; with stipulated&nbsp; interest thereon, notwithstanding the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; more&nbsp; than four years after September&nbsp; 2, 1945, the appellant&nbsp; instituted on December 12,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; the present action against the appellees, for&nbsp; the collection of said&nbsp; balance and&nbsp; interest, plus&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; attorney's fees, and for the foreclosure of the mortgage.<br><br>After the&nbsp; court had&nbsp; denied a&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; filed by the&nbsp; appellees, the&nbsp; latter filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; answer&nbsp; setting up the principal defenses&nbsp; that they&nbsp; were not&nbsp; as yet under obligation to pay either the balance of P50,000.00&nbsp; or&nbsp; any interest thereon, because the Treaty of Peace concluding the Greater East Asia&nbsp; War has not been ratified&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Philippines;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; any event&nbsp; the appellees&nbsp; should be made to pay in&nbsp; accordance with the Ballantyne Table of Conversion of the Japanese military notes to&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; currency.<br><br>After trial the court rendered&nbsp; a decision holding that the action was&nbsp; premature and accordingly dismissing the complaint without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp; The plaintiffs&nbsp; have appealed.<br><br>The only question that arises in whether,&nbsp; by the terms "after the ratification of the&nbsp; Treaty of Peace concluding the present&nbsp; Greater&nbsp; East Asia War,"&nbsp; the parties contemplated the factual termination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Greater&nbsp; Bast Asia War on September&nbsp; 2, 1945 upon&nbsp; the formal signing of the treaty of surrender of the Japanese. Imperial Forces to&nbsp; the Allied&nbsp; Forces at&nbsp; Tokyo Bay&nbsp; (as contended&nbsp; by the appellant),&nbsp; or the&nbsp; actual ratification&nbsp; by the Philippines of the Treaty of Peace concluding the Greater East Asia War, which has not yet taken place (as contended by the appellees).<br><br>We agree&nbsp; to&nbsp; appellees'&nbsp; observation&nbsp; that&nbsp; the mortgage contract expressly&nbsp; mentions "ratification"&nbsp; of the Treaty of Peace concluding the Greater East&nbsp; Asia&nbsp; War; but we cannot accept the further view that the required ratification should be by the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is significant that the contract&nbsp; used&nbsp; the term&nbsp;&nbsp; "ratification"&nbsp; in a&nbsp; general sense, without reference to any specific&nbsp; country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the other hand,&nbsp; as the Treaty&nbsp; of Peace was expressly described&nbsp; as "concluding&nbsp; the present Greater East Asia War," not a war between the&nbsp; Philippines and Japan, said ratification should be only by&nbsp; a majority of the signatory powers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Article 23(a)&nbsp; of the Treaty&nbsp; of Peace provides&nbsp; that "the&nbsp; present Treaty&nbsp; shall be ratified by the states which sign it, including Japan, and will come into force for&nbsp; all&nbsp; the States&nbsp; which have&nbsp; then&nbsp; ratified it, when instruments&nbsp; of&nbsp; ratification have been deposited by a&nbsp; majority, including the United States of America as the principal&nbsp; occupying Power, of the following States, namely,&nbsp; Australia, Canada, Ceylon, New Zealand,&nbsp; Pakistan, the Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines, the United Kingdom of&nbsp; Great Britain&nbsp; and Northern Ireland, and the United States of&nbsp; America."<br><br>The participating countries,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; Japan, Australia, Canada, Cession,&nbsp; France,&nbsp; New&nbsp; Zealand, Pakistan, United Kingdom of Great Britain and&nbsp; Northern Ireland, and the United States of&nbsp; America,&nbsp; constituting the majority and all&nbsp; concerned with the Greater East Asia War, had already ratified the Treaty of Peace.&nbsp; The United States of America, (which together with Ceylon, last ratified the Treaty) deposited its instrument of ratification on April 28,&nbsp; 1952 when, in accordance with the aforesaid article 23(a), the Treaty came into force.&nbsp; Said date should, in our opinion, be the starting point of the period stipulated in the mort- gage&nbsp; contract.&nbsp; As already pointed out in&nbsp; Mercado vs. Punsalan,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-8366, April&nbsp; 27, 1956, the Greater East&nbsp; Asia War meant "the general war between Japan and the Allied&nbsp; Powers, not the hostilities&nbsp; between the Philippines and Japan in particular, for at the time the mortgage in question was signed, the Philippines was yet under American&nbsp; sovereignty and&nbsp; was&nbsp; involved in the war only&nbsp; because it was&nbsp; a dependency of the United States."<br><br>Accordingly, the obligation of the appellees to pay the balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; P50,000.00 matured&nbsp; on&nbsp; April 29,&nbsp; 1956, and their&nbsp; obligation to pay the&nbsp; stipulated interest commenced on April 29, 1.953.&nbsp; Although on December 12, 1953, when the present action was filed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; within which the balance of P50,000.00 should be&nbsp; paid had not expired, the appellees were already&nbsp; in default in the payment of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be remembered that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter&nbsp; of February 5, 1953&nbsp; (Exhibit 2)&nbsp; the appellant reminded the appellee, Macaria Tinio&nbsp; de Domingo, that "the time is about&nbsp; due for you to make a decision&nbsp; with&nbsp; regard&nbsp; to this matter and to let me&nbsp; know about it,&nbsp; so that I can make the&nbsp; necessary plan&nbsp; accordingly."&nbsp; Even&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; considered said letter&nbsp; as a demand not "honored by the&nbsp; vendees" and which&nbsp; prompted the appellant to institute "present action for the collection of P50,000.00 and damages to foreclose the mortgage on that sum." Appellees' default as to the stipulated interest of course authorized the&nbsp; foreclosure of the&nbsp; mortgage on the entire obligation, because the agreement was that if the appellees "shall well and truly perform the <i>full obligation as stated in this deed according&nbsp; to the terms thereof</i>, then this obligation&nbsp; shall be null and void; otherwise,&nbsp; it shall remain in full force and&nbsp; effect and <i>shall be subject to&nbsp; foreclosure</i>."&nbsp; At&nbsp; any rate, appellees' principal obligation&nbsp; has also now matured.<br><br>Appellees' defense that they should&nbsp; pay the balance of P50,000.00 in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Ballantyne Conversion Table&nbsp; is&nbsp; without merit,&nbsp; since the&nbsp; obligation, under the mortgage&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; was not payable during the&nbsp; Japanese occupation.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the appealed decision is reversed and the defendants-appellees are hereby sentenced to pay to the appellant&nbsp; the sum of P50,000, with&nbsp; interest at the rate of eight percent&nbsp; per annum from&nbsp; April&nbsp; 29, 1953,&nbsp; plus&nbsp; ten per&nbsp; cent&nbsp; of the&nbsp; total amount&nbsp; thus due and payable,&nbsp; as attorney's&nbsp; fees, expenses and costs; it being understood that, upon failure of the appellees to pay within ninety days after notice of this decision, the mortgaged property shall be sold at public&nbsp; auction and the proceeds disposed of in pursuance of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 4 of Rule 70 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
