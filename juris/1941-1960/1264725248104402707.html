				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This appeal&nbsp; is taken by the Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; from&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; Naturalization Case No.&nbsp; 96 of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu,&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; applicant Sy Kiam qualified&nbsp; to&nbsp; assume Filipino citizenship.<br><br>The State counsel contends that petitioner Sy Kiam had mentioned only&nbsp; eleven&nbsp; (11)&nbsp; children had&nbsp; by him&nbsp; with his Filipina wife, Aurora Villaflor,&nbsp; while in the witness stand he&nbsp; (Sy Kiam)&nbsp; disclosed that he had&nbsp; begotten thirteen (13) children,&nbsp; two of whom&nbsp; have died; that there is no evidence that the latter had been&nbsp; enrolled&nbsp; in&nbsp; authorized schools before&nbsp; their death; and that in the absence of such evidence,&nbsp; Sy Kiam can not be said to&nbsp; have&nbsp; fully complied with the conditions set by our Naturalization laws,&nbsp; that require the applicant&nbsp; for&nbsp; naturalization&nbsp; to&nbsp; enroll&nbsp; all&nbsp; his children&nbsp; of school age&nbsp; in&nbsp; recognized schools not&nbsp; limited to any nationality or race&nbsp; (Com. Act 473, sec.&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; par. 6; sec.&nbsp; 6).<br><br>We deem this objection of no importance for&nbsp; it appears of record that Sy Kiam's&nbsp; first&nbsp; child&nbsp; (Juanito)&nbsp; was born on October ,10,&nbsp; 1928,&nbsp; while&nbsp; his two deceased children, Vicenta and Maurieio, died in 1929 and&nbsp; 1932 respectively (t.s.n., p. 15).&nbsp; While their dates of birth do not&nbsp; appear, the&nbsp; foregoing circumstances suffice&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; show&nbsp; that&nbsp; said Vicenta and&nbsp; Mauricio&nbsp; died&nbsp; before reaching school&nbsp; age. The&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; therefore, that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; not&nbsp; enrolled&nbsp; in a recognized school would not be a valid objection against the petition for naturalization.<br><br>The&nbsp; "weightier objection&nbsp; arises from the fact that,&nbsp; according to his own Exhibit "G",&nbsp; Sy Kiam married&nbsp; Aurora Villaflor&nbsp; on 9 February 1950, only&nbsp; six months before applying&nbsp; for naturalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means&nbsp; that he had&nbsp; cohabited with&nbsp; her and begotten&nbsp; thirteen&nbsp; children&nbsp; by her without benefit of marriage; and this Court has&nbsp; ruled that such&nbsp; behavior falls&nbsp; short of the "proper and irreproachable&nbsp; conduct" that&nbsp; our&nbsp; naturalization law requires&nbsp; (Yu Lo vs. Republic, 48 Off. Gaz., 4334; Yu Singco us. Republic, 94 Phil.,&nbsp; 191; 50 Off. Gaz., 104).&nbsp; In the Yu Lo case this Court,&nbsp; speaking through Mr. Justice Montemayor, made the following ruling&nbsp; (at p. 4387) that is squarely applicable to the present case:<br><blockquote>"However,&nbsp; we agree with the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; in&nbsp; so far as it denied the petition for&nbsp; naturalization,&nbsp; on the ground that the conduct and behavior of&nbsp; appellant in cohabiting with Francisca Amable and begetting children by her&nbsp; without the benefit&nbsp; of marriage, from the standpoint of morality&nbsp; and decency, does&nbsp; not&nbsp; meet with&nbsp; the approval not only of&nbsp; this court but of the community where he lives and the country whose citizenship he applied&nbsp; for, which&nbsp; country by the&nbsp; way is&nbsp; mostly Christian and of&nbsp; the Catholic faith.&nbsp; While there&nbsp; may be a few cases of concubinage or cohabitation&nbsp; without the sanction&nbsp; of marriage, by citizens of this country, nevertheless, before admitting an&nbsp; alien into&nbsp; its fold and giving him the rights and privileges of citizenship, this country by law requires of the applicant, among other things,&nbsp; proper and irreproachable&nbsp; conduct. Openly cohabiting&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; woman&nbsp; and maintaining with her&nbsp; what the&nbsp; law considers&nbsp; illicit relations, can hardly be regarded proper and irreproachable conduct.</blockquote>For this&nbsp; reason, we affirm the decision appealed from." We therefore believe&nbsp; that the naturalization should have been refused,&nbsp; and reverse&nbsp; the judgment of the&nbsp; court below, without prejudice&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; renewal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; application provided&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; has observed irreproachable&nbsp; conduct after&nbsp; his marriage for&nbsp; the 5-year period required by section 3 of Commonwealth Act 478 of aliens who&nbsp; are married to&nbsp; Filipino women, and&nbsp; no other disqualifications appear.&nbsp; Without costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
