				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from a judgment of the Court of  First Instance of Cebu  ordering respondents to  reinstate petitioner as foreman  (capataz),  Garbage  Disposal, Office  of the City Engineer, Cebu City, at P3.90 per day from the date of his  removal.</p>
<p>The case was submitted to the court for decision  on a stipulation of facts  the  most pertinent of  which are as follows:  Petitioner was a foreman,  Group Disposal, Office of the City Health Officer, Cebu City, at P3.90 per  day On June  16, 1953, the City Mayor removed him from the service and his place was taken by  Perfecto Abellana, and latter by Pedro E. Gonzales.  Before June 16, 1953, the  Group Disposal  Division,  including  personnel, was transferred from  the City Health Department to the Office of the City Engineer.  In April, 1954, petitioner sought to be reinstated but his petition  was  not headed by the respondents.</p>
<p>On the basis of the  above facts, the Court of First Instance of  Cebu  held that  petitioner is a  person in the Philippine Civil Service, pertaining to the unclassified service (section  670,  Revised Administrative  Code as amended), and his removal from his  position is  a violation of section 694 of the Revised  Administrative  Code and section 4 of Art XII of the Constitution.  The court further held that the notation at the bottom of petitioner's appointment to the  effect that his appointment  is "temporary pending  report from  the Government  Service  Insurance System  as to the appointee's  physical  and medical examination" did  not make  his  appointment merely  temporary.</p>
<p>First  error  assigned on this  appeal is  the  failure  to include in the complaint, the names of the persons holding the Offices of  City Mayor, City Treasurer,  City Auditor and City Engineer, all of Cebu City, they being designated only by  their official positions.  This is no reason  for  a reversal  of the proceedings  and of  the judgment.  As said persons were sued in their  official  capacity,  it is sufficient that they  be designated by their  official positions.</p>
<p>It is also contended that the use of capitals in  the words "Civil  Service" in section 1 and 4 of Article XII of the Constitution and the use of small letters for the same words, "civil  service," in section   670, Revised Administrative Code, indicates that only those pertaining to the classified service are protected in the above-mentioned sections of the Constitution.  We  see  no  validity in this argument. Capital "C"  and "S" in  the words "Civil  Service" were used in the Constitution to  indicate the group.   No capitals are used in the  similar  provisions  of the Code to indicate  the  system.  We see  no  difference between the use of capitals in the  former and  of small  letters in the latter.  There  is no reason  for excluding persons in the unclassified service from the benefits extended  to  those belonging to the classified service.  Both are expressly declared  to belong  to the  Civil Service; hence,  the  same rights and priviliges should be accorded to both.  Persons in the  unclassified  service are so  designated because the nature  of their work and qualifications are not  subject to classification, which is not true of those appointed to the classified service.  This can not be a valid reason for denying previleges to the former that are  granted the latter.</p>
<p>As the removal of petitioner was made without investigation and without cause, said removal is null and void and petitioner is entitled to be reinstated  to the position from which he was removed.   (Lacson vs. Romero,  84 Phil., 740, 47 Off. Gaz. [4], 1778)</p>
<p>There is, however, an,  additional objection to the reinstatement raised in the  memorandum submitted  by the attorneys for the respondents in  lieu of  oral  argument. This is the fact that as petitioner was  removed on June 16, 1953  and only filed his petition on July  1, 1954, or after a delay of one  year and 15  days, petitioner  should  no longer  be allowed  to  claim  the  remedy,  he  being considered as having abandoned his office.</p>
<p>We can not or should  not overlook this objection.  If an employee is illegally dismissed, he may conform to such illegal dismissal or acquiesce therein, or by  his  inaction and by sleeping on his rights he may  in law be considered as having abandoned the  office to  which he  is entitled to he reinstated.   These  defenses  are valid defenses  to  an action for reinstatement.   To that effect is our  decision in the  case of  Mesias vs.  Jover,  et al.,  97 Phil., 899, decided November 22, 1955.  In that  case we cited with approval Nicolas vs. United States, 66 L. Ed. 133, and the following ruling therein  contained:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A person illegally dismissed from office is not thereby exonerated from the obligation to take steps  for his own protection, and may not  for  an unreasonable  length  of time,  acquiesce to the order of removal * * * and then sue to recover the salary attached to the position.  In  case of unreasonable delay he may be held to have abandoned title to the office and any right to recover its emoluments." (Mesias <em>vs.</em> Jover, supra.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Difficulty in applying the principle lies in the fact that the law has not fixed any period which may be deemed to be considered as an abandonment of office.   In the abovecited case decided by the Federal Supreme Court of the United States, 11 months was considered an unreasonable delay  amounting to abandonment of office and  of the right to recover its emoluments.   H6wever, we note that in actions  of <em>quo warranto</em> involving right to  an office, the action must be instituted within the period of one year. This has been the law in the island since 1901, the period having been originally fixed in section  216 of the  Code of Civil Proceedure (Act No. 190).  We find this provision to be  an  expression of policy on the part of the State that persons  claiming a right to an office  of  which they are illegally dispossessed should immediately take steps to recover  said office and that if they do not do  so within a period of one year, they shall be considered as having lost their right thereto by abandonment.   There are weighty reasons  of public policy and convenience that  demand the adoption of a similar period for persons claiming rights to positions in  the  civil service.  There  must  be stability in  the service   so  that public  business may  be  unduly retarded; delays in the statement of the  right  to positions in the service  must  be  discouraged.   The  following considerations as to public officers, by Mr. Justice Bengzon, may well be applicable to employees in  the civil service:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Furthermore, constitutional rights may certainly be waived, and the inaction of the officer for one year could be validly considered as waiver, i.e., a renunciation which no principle of justice may prevent, he being at liberty to resign his position anytime he pleases. "And there is  good justification for the  limitation period; it is not proper that the title to public office should be  subjected to continued  uncertainly, and the peoples' interest requires that such right should  be determined as speedily as practicable."   (Tumulak <em>vs.</em> Egay,  46  Off.Gaz., 18], 3693,  3695.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the  Government must be immediately informed or advised if any person claims to be  entitled to an office or a position in the civil service as against another actually holding it, so 1&amp;at title Government may not be faced with the predicament of having to pay two salaries, one,  for the person actually holding the office,  although illegally, and another, for one not actually rendering service although entitled to do so.   We hold that in  view  of  the policy of the State contained in the law fixing the period of one year within which  actions  for <em>quo warranto</em> may be instituted, any person claiming right to a position in the civil service should also be required  to file his petition for  reinstatement within the  period of one year,  otherwise he is thereby considered as having  abandoned  his office.</p>
<p>One other point, merely procedural,  needs to be considered.   This is the fact that the objection  as  to  the delay in filing the  action  is  raised, for the first time in this  Court,  not  having  been raised in  the  court  below. The  above circumstance  (belated objection) would  bar the consideration if it were a defense merely.  However, we consider it to be  essential to the petitioner's right of action that the same is filed within a year from  the illegal removal.  The delay  is not merely a defense which may be interposed against it subject to waiver. It is essential: to petitioner's cause of action and may be considered even at this stage of the action.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We would go farther by holding: that the period fixed in the rule is a  condition precedent to the existence of the cause, of action, with the  result that, if a complaint is not filed within  one year, it cannot prosper although  the matter is not set up in the answer or motion to dismiss."  (Abeto vs. Hodas, 46 Off. Gaz., [3], 930, 932.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A defense of failure to state a cause of action is not  waived by failure to raise same as a defense  (section 10, Rule 9),</p>
<p>For all the foregoing considerations, we hold that as petitioner was dismissed on June 16,  1953  and did  not file his petition for mandamus for his reinstatement until July 1, 1956, or after a period of  one year, he  is deemed: to have abandoned  his  right to his former position and is not entitled  to reinstatement therein  by  mandamus. Without  costs.  So  ordered.</p>

    <em>DISSENTING:</em><br>
    <br>
</p>
<p><strong>CONCEPCION,  <em>J., </em></strong></p>
<p>I  dissent.   Delay in  bringing  an action  can have no more effect than that of prescription of action or laches. It affects merely the <em>"enforcement</em>"  of a right of action, not the existence thereof.   The  period  of one year for the commencement of the auction  in<em> quo warranto</em> proceedings is prescribed  in the Rules of Court which would be unconstitutional if the same should seek to  affect the cause of action, for then they would  impair  substantive  rights.</p>
