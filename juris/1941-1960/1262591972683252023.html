				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Complainant Francisco M. Ortega was employed by the Saulog Transit, Inc., owned and&nbsp; operated by&nbsp; Eliseo&nbsp; Saulog, first as conductor&nbsp; (from September 1948 to July 8, 1951) and later as inspector&nbsp; (from July 10, 1951&nbsp; to August 12, 1954).&nbsp; As conductor he received a salary of P4.50 a day from the time he started&nbsp; working up&nbsp; to October, 1948,&nbsp; when his salary was increased to P6.00 a&nbsp; day, until he became an inspector, when again it was increased to P7.00 a day.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a conductor he began working from 4:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.mÂ» three times a week,&nbsp; and from&nbsp; 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.&nbsp; four times a week; as an inspector he had no fixed working schedule,&nbsp; but he actually-rendered at least twelve hours every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Decision of the WAS, Department of Labor.)&nbsp; Believing himself&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to over time pay,&nbsp; complainant filed, in April,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim with the Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; Service, Department of Labor, Regional Office No. I, for the payment of the overtime service he&nbsp; rendered to the company.&nbsp; After&nbsp; several continuances the case was again set for hearing on June 30,1955, but neither of the parties&nbsp; appeared on said date;&nbsp; so&nbsp; the hearing was once more postponed to July 16,1955, on which date only complainant appeared.&nbsp; After considering complainant's testimony, Felipe N. Aurea, Investigator of&nbsp; the WAS, rendered a decision,&nbsp; dated August 18,&nbsp; 1955, finding respondent company liable to complainant for overtime pay in&nbsp; the amount of P13,101.81,&nbsp; and requiring&nbsp; it to deposit said amount with&nbsp; the WAS.&nbsp; On August&nbsp; 22, 1955, both complainant and the respondent were furnished with copies of the decision, but respondent did not appeal therefrom within the reglamentary period.<br><br>In&nbsp; the meantime, complainant&nbsp; filed with the Court of First Instance of Cavite a&nbsp; complaint for overtime pay similar to that&nbsp; filed with the Wage Administration Service. Before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite could hear the case, and on December 11, 1956, complainant filed with the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal a petition for the execution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned decision of the&nbsp; WAS. Respondent filed an opposition thereto on the ground that the court is not empowered to enforce the decision of the regional office, as said decision&nbsp; is without authority of law.<br><br>The Court of First Instance of Rizal granted the petition for execution,&nbsp; and upon failure of respondent to&nbsp; secure an order to reconsider the&nbsp; order for execution, it appealed the case to this Court.<br><br>Appellant assigns five errors.&nbsp; However, the resolution of the third will dispose of the case.<br><br>Under the third&nbsp; assignment of&nbsp; error, it is alleged that the decision of the WAS, which was enforced by the lower court, and the writ of execution are both illegal, because the parties have not agreed to a mediation or arbitration in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the "Code of Rules and&nbsp; Regulations to Implement&nbsp; the Minimum Wage Law," issued by the Secretary of Labor, or the Arbitration Law&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 876).&nbsp; The Code of Rules, promulgated On January 20, 1953 by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Labor pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Section 11 of Republic Act No. 602, seeks to implement the provisions of Sections 15(D), 15(E) and&nbsp; 16(A)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 602&nbsp; (by outlining the&nbsp; procedure to be followed in case the Secretary of Labor chooses&nbsp; to bring an action in court for the recovery of wages or to&nbsp; restrain violations of the&nbsp; provisions of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 602.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under said Code, the claims investigator or attorney is required to endeavor&nbsp; to reconcile&nbsp; the parties or ask them&nbsp; if they are willing to arbitrate or submit&nbsp; their case to arbitration.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the event that mediation fails and the&nbsp; parties are not willing to arbitrate, the claims attorney shall find out if the claim is meritorious or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sees. 6 &amp;&nbsp; 7, Article 7, Code&nbsp; of Rules.)&nbsp; If meritorious, the attorney will prepare the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; complaint and petition for indigency for&nbsp; court action, as the case&nbsp; may be, within&nbsp; one week after receiving the case&nbsp; (Sec. 14, Id.).<br><br>In the case at bar,&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent did not appear at the trial, so&nbsp; that no mediation or arbitration could be&nbsp; had to enable&nbsp; the claims attorney to convince the parties to come to an agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the lack of such mediation or arbitration, the claims&nbsp; investigator went right ahead to hear the evidence&nbsp; of the complainant and&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a decision on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; action is irregular and does not conform to&nbsp; the procedure laid down&nbsp; by law.&nbsp; What the&nbsp; claims attorney should have&nbsp; done was to bring an action in&nbsp; court&nbsp; to recover payment for overtime service rendered,&nbsp; in behalf of the complainant.<br><br>In Potente <i>vs.</i> Saulog Transit, Inc.,&nbsp; 105 Phil.,&nbsp; 525, we held that the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission&nbsp; has no authority to render a decision&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sense in which this term is used in legal&nbsp; parlance.&nbsp; If the claim is&nbsp; considered meritorious action may be brought before "any competent court" for the recovery of the sum of money it considers&nbsp; due to the claimant&nbsp; and Section 51 of&nbsp; Act No. 3428&nbsp; does not authorized the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of a&nbsp; writ of execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; a decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission.&nbsp; Similarly,&nbsp; the WAS&nbsp; has no power to render a&nbsp; decision that can&nbsp; be enforced in the courts of justice.&nbsp; It is only when an arbitration agreement or compromise is entered into between the&nbsp; parties that a judgment can be rendered by the WAS and enforced by the courts.<br><br>The order of the lower court of December 24, 1956,&nbsp; ordering the issuance of the writ of execution as well as the writ of execution of January 10,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; are declared null and void and hereby set aside.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Concepcion,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia,&nbsp; JJ,, </span>concur.</div>
