				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On 17 August 1955 the petitioners&nbsp; brought an action for detainer against&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Lisings&nbsp; in the Municipal Court of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; After denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint and&nbsp; hearing, the Court rendered judgment&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; respondent Lisings to vacate&nbsp; the premises described in the complaint and&nbsp; to pay the petitioners P30 a month beginning June 1955 for the use&nbsp; and occupation of the premises until they shall&nbsp; have actually vacated and restored the possession thereof to the plaintiffs, P50 for attorney's fee, and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; From this judgment the respondent Lisings appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila by filing in due time&nbsp; a notice&nbsp; of appeal and, appeal&nbsp; and supersedeas bonds.&nbsp; During&nbsp; the&nbsp; pendency of the appeal, or on&nbsp; 11&nbsp; January 1956, the petitionermoved; for execution of the judgment of the Municipal&nbsp; Court, on the ground that the respondent Lisings&nbsp; failed to pay or deposit the monthly rental of P30 for December 1955 during the first 10 days of January 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent Lisings objected.&nbsp; On 24 January 1956 the Court of First Instance of Manila denied the motion for execution for the reason that the&nbsp; Municipal Court had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the case, the question&nbsp; of ownership&nbsp; or title&nbsp; to the premises being involved&nbsp; or litigated, and set the ease for hearing of the case in the exercise of its origin<br><br>There&nbsp; is no plausible reason for disturbing the ruling made by the respondent Court to the effect that "the question of title or ownership is necessarily involved" in the case or for&nbsp; reversing&nbsp; its order that the "ease be set for trial on the merits on 24 February 1956 at 8:30 a.m. in the exercise&nbsp; of the original jurisdiction of&nbsp; this court under section 11, Rule 40&nbsp; of the Rules of Court."&nbsp; The record shows that&nbsp; both&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Lisings consistently claim&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioners claim that they are the owners&nbsp; of the building on 14-C&nbsp; Lerma,&nbsp; Sampaloc,&nbsp; Manila, where a&nbsp; billard hall is being run and&nbsp; operated, and that they allowed the respondent Ruperto Lising to reside there as their&nbsp; employee&nbsp; in charge of the billiard hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondent Lisings, on the other hand, deny vehemently this claim,&nbsp; alleging that they are the owners of the building and that the true contract of lease is that executed on&nbsp; 14 June 1954 where they, as owners, are the lessors, and the peti- tioners,&nbsp; their&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; or lessees.&nbsp; The petitioners&nbsp; base their claim of ownership of the premises upon an agreement of&nbsp; sale entered into between&nbsp; them and the respondent Lisings on 21 July 1954.&nbsp; The respondent Lisings, however, assail&nbsp; vigorously&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement, on the ground that they were deceived and misled to si<br><br>The petitioners maintain that there exists a relationship of landlord-employer&nbsp; and&nbsp; tenant-employee&nbsp; between&nbsp; them and the respondent Lisings by virtue of the contract of lease entered into&nbsp; by and between them on 22 July 1954,&nbsp; where it is stipulated among other things, that the respondent Ruperto Lising shall occupy, free of charge, the mezzanine floor of the building at No. 14-C Lerma, Sampaloc, Manila, as incharge&nbsp; of the billiard hall to be operated therein, and that he shall be given a compensation to be mutually agreed upon by them later on, which may either be&nbsp; a&nbsp; percentage or&nbsp; a fixed amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; argue that because of the contract of lease dated 22 July 1954 the respondents have admitted&nbsp; their&nbsp; status as mere&nbsp;&nbsp; tenants, and that, consequently&nbsp; they cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; permitted to deny&nbsp; the title of the petitioners as their&nbsp; landlords&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; commencement of the relationship of landlord and&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; between&nbsp; them, relying upon section&nbsp; 68(6), Rule&nbsp; 123,&nbsp; on conclusive presumptions and&nbsp; upon the case of&nbsp; Sevilla vs. Tolentino, 51 Phil. 333.&nbsp; However, an examination of the pleadings filed in the case reveals that the contract of lease dated 22 July 1954,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; based their action for detainer&nbsp; against the&nbsp; respondent Lisings&nbsp; in the Municipal Court,&nbsp; was not attached to the complaint and&nbsp; pleaded, as required&nbsp; by&nbsp; secti<br><br>The petition for mandamus and injunction ig denied, with costs against the petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
