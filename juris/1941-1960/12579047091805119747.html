				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner filed this  petition  in  the Court of  First  Instance  of  Cebu seeking  Philippine citizenship.  The petition was opposed by the government on the ground that petitioner is not morally irreproachable,  is anti-Filipino and has not  evinced  a sincere desire to become  a Filipino citizen.  After hearing,  the court rendered judgment in favor of petitioner, and the government has appealed. <br><br>It appears that petitioner was born on May 5, 1923 in Manila and is a Chinese citizen.  Since then he resided in said city until 1952 when he  moved to Cebu City.  He is at  present employed as  Assistant Manager of  the East Visayan Motors Co., Inc.,  in Cebu City;  with a  monthly salary  of P500.  He  is  married  to  Josephine  Hsieh, a Chinese citizen, who bore his one  child now one year  old. He is  able to speak and write  Spanish, the Visayan and Tagalog dialects.   He  believes in the principle underlying the Philippine Constitution and is not opposed to organized government.  He does not defend or teach the  necessity of violence, personal  assault  or assassination  for the predominance of his ideas.  He  is  not  a believer in the practice of polygamy and does not  suffer from  any incurable  or contagious disease.  It is  his  intention to reside continuously in the Philippines and to renounce all allegiance  to any foreign state or sovereignty, particularly China. <br><br>The government, on its part, tried to establish  through the testimony of Leonardo P. Balaga and  Enrique  Arcenas, spokesmen  of the workers of the East  Visayan Motors  Co.,  Inc., who  signed  a petition  opposing  the grant of Philippine  citizenship to petitioner,  the following facts:  that petitioner showed  his anti-Filipino  attitude when he opposed  the granting of bonuses to the  laborers of  said company and when he discriminated  against them in  giving  charitable  contributions; that at one time  and in the presence of several persons, he sarcastically uttered the following: "The  Philippine Government  has nationalized  almost  everything  including labor, agriculture,  professional practice and the onfy; thing that the Philippine Government  can not nationalize is Nationalist China";  and that  petitioner  showed  arrogance in  dealing with  his Filipino employees when on several instances he ridiculed them by  giving  them  instructions  in  the   presence  of visitors. <br><br>The government  now contends that  the   lower  court erred (1)  in not declaring that petitioner  failed to  file his declaration of  intention to become  a Filipino citizen in accordance with Section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law;  (2)  in not  finding Jesus  Verallo incompetent to act as a witness for petitioner; and  (3)  in  holding that petitioner  has all the qualifications prescribed by law to acquire Philippine  citizenship. <br><br>Section  5 of the Revised  Naturalization Law provides that one year prior to the filing of a petition for Philippine  citizenship,  petitioner  shall file in the  Bureau  of Justice  a  declaration of intention to become a Filipino citizen,  except when he  is born  in  this  country  or has continuously resided  therein  for a  period  of 30  years. Petitioner, it is true,  did  not file such declaration  of  intention but this is because he claims to have been born in the Philippines and this he has  established  not only by his own testimony and that of his father but by sufficient documentary evidence.  Thus, he presented as evidence his Alien Certificate of Residence No. A-40086 and his Native Born Certificate  of Residence No.  57370 wherein  it  appears that he was born in  Manila on May 5, 1923.  These are official documents  which were issued  in due course by the immigration  authorities and unless  their genuineness is assailed, which was not, we have to give them due probative value.   It is not  therefore correct to say that  the evidence of petitioner on  this point is  not supported by documentary evidence.  Moreover, it likewise appears that petitioner has  resided continuously in this country for a period of more than  30  years and this has  not also been disputed.   This also has the effect of exempting petitioner from the requirement relative to the filing of a declaration of intention. <br><br>It is contended that Jesus Verallo, one of the character witnesses presented by  petitioner, is incompetent to testify in his behalf because he admitted that while he came to know petitioner in 1939, he  however lost  contact with him in 1941, immediately  after the outbreak of the war, and only met  him again  in  1952.  From this  admission the government draws the conclusion that said witness is incompetent to testify for  petitioner because  the law requires that he must  have at least  known petitioner continuously for a period of 5  years.  It  appears however, that  this  witness  has  known  petitioner  from 1939  to 1941, when he  lost contact of him, and from 1952 to 1955 when  he actually testified, which gives a resultant  period of acquaintance of around 6  years.  This period is more than  sufficient to  satisfy  the  requirement  of the law, for  undoubtedly one  cannot  exact a more stringent  interpretation  considering the well-known rule  that  "laws regulating citizenship should receive a  liberal construction in favor of the claimant"  (Roa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>., Collector of Customs, 23 Phil., 315; <span style="font-style: italic;">See also</span> U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ong Tianse, 29 Phil., 333). <br><br>With regard to the  third  error, it  is contended that petitioner is disqualified to become a Filipino citizen because he  has shown to be arrogant, discriminatory  and anti-Filipino in his behavior.   This  contention  in  effect is based on the testimony of Leonardo P. Balaga and Enrique Arcenas who testified  that  petitioner showed his anti-Filipino attitude when he opposed  the granting of bonuses to the laborers of the company where they  were working  and discriminated  against them in giving charitable contributions  to  Filipinos and that  he  on certain occasion  sarcastically made the following remark:  "The Philippine Government has nationalized almost everything including  labor, agriculture, professional  practice and the only thing  that  the Philippine Government cannot nationalize is Nationalist China."  The government also lays stress on  the petition of about 40 laborers opposing the granting of Philippine citizenship to  petitioner. <br><br>It has been proven however that both Balaga and Arcenas have an axe to grind against petitioner who because of his appointment as Assistant Manager of the  East Visayan Motors Co., Inc., caused the loss of their positions in that company.  It appears  that Balaga was formerly the business manager of that company and Arcenas its credit or collection manager but when petitioner assumed the position of assistant general manager,  both were relieved of their positions for having petitioner assumed the duties  discharged by them.   It also appears that  they were  officers  and prominent  members  of  the union  to which said laborers  belong  and as such  they became resentful when petitioner did not evince sympathy to some of the demands of the  union  for their  betterment which caused them to stage a walkout on May 9, 1955.   It likewise appears that petitioner had nothing to  do with the grant of  bonuses or  increase of  salaries  of the  laborers but that  the same  are always  acted upon  by  the  board of  directors.  And it is noteworthy that not one  of those who allegedly signed the petition has appeared to  testify in  court  in spite  of the opportunity given  them  to  do so.  And  after examining and weighing the testimony or evidence of both parties,  the lower court has reached the following conclusion:<br><blockquote>"After examining the grounds  adduced  by the  opposition  witnesses in support of the opposition,  the  Court finds that same do not  show that the  petitioner does  not  possess  the  qualifications required  by law for the acquisition of Philippine citizenship, nor do  they  establish  that  said petitioner is disqualified to  be naturalized as  Filipino citizen.  On  the  contrary,  from  the  preponderance of  evidence, especially  the  testimonies  of  Dr.  Fernando M.  Aranda and Jesus  Verallo whose testimonies this Court has no  reason  to doubt,  it  has  been established that  the  petitioner possesses good moral character and  has  invariably conducted himself in a proper  and irreproachable manner during his residence in  the Philippines.  It  has,  likewise,  been shown through these witnesses  that  the petitioner mingles socially  with the Filipinos and has  evinced a sincere desire to learn  and embrace  the  customs, traditions and ideals  of  the  Filipinos.  In  fact,  according to  Dr. Fernando  M. Aranda, who has  known the  petitioner for sometime now  and who is  his  neighbor at Orchid  Street, Cebu City, said  petitioner is a  respected  member  of the community wherein they live  and is a  member of  good standing of  the  so-called  Good  Neighbor Association  in  the Flower District, Cebu City, which is an  organization  dedicated  to civic, social  welfare and religious  activities  wherein petitioner actively participates. <br><br>"On the  whole,  from the evidence  adduced  during the hearing, the Court finds sufficiently established that the petitioner possesses all  the necessary  qualifications  to become a Filipino citizen as enumerated in  Section 2 of  the  Revised  Naturalization  Law and none  of  the disqualifications. Consequently,  the  Court is  of the opinion that the  present  petition  for  naturalization  should  be granted."</blockquote>As  regards  the alleged utterance of petitioner  of certain  sarcastic remarks  in connection with the  enactment of the  Nationalization Law,  the same cannot be  given much importance considering that at that time conflicting opinions had been expressed as regards the propriety of its enactment to the extent that there were even Filipinos who manifested  their  disapproval of  the law.  As  the lower court has  said: "Such  free  expression of opinion, needless to  say,  is but natural in a democratic  country like the Philippines where people enjoy  freedom of speech. Certainly, Filipinos and aliens alike  who might have  criticized  the  provisions of the  nationalization law  cannot be branded as anti-Filipino in sentiments."  We  cannot therefore give to such remarks the implication that appellant now wants  to draw from it  in an attempt to  disqualify  petitioner from becoming a  Filipino citizen.<br><br>Wherefore,  the  decision appealed  from  is  affirmed,. without pronouncement as  to  costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><br></div>REYES,  J. B. L., J., <span style="font-style: italic;">dissenting</span>: <br><br>The decision of the Court of First Instance practically admits  that during the time that applicant was manager of the  East Visayan Motors  Co., Inc., there was discrimination against Filipinos in the matter of salary increases  and bonuses.   The only excuse  given is that these matters were  determined exclusively by the management and the Board of Directors, and were not decided by the applicant. <br><br>The excuse is insufficient, because  there is not one  iota of evidence  to show that this applicant (who was a member of  the  Board of Directors) <span style="font-style: italic;"> ever protested or  registered a protest </span>against the discrimination of which the Filipino employees were victims.  By adopting a passive attitude towards discrimination against Filipinos, the applicant  showed that he had not, as yet, become identified with them; that he still  is a  Chinese  in sentiment.  To my mind, the  applicant has not evinced "a sincere desire to embrace  Filipino customs,  traditions  and  ideals", and he is therefore disqualified under section  4, paragraph  (<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) of the Naturalization  Act.  The latter provision  is  proof that the  admission of an  alien to Filipino citizenship is predicated upon  the  assumption that he has  become  assimilated into  being  one  of  us  in feelings  and ideals. Certainly the process  of identification is not expected to start with  the  naturalization  itself; the conferment  of citizenship should be  the  culmination of a process of  assimilation started long  before  naturalization  was sought. Why should we admit  into our policy any one who remains an  alien  in  thoughts, principles  and  sentiment? <br><br>For these  reasons, I am compelled  to dissent. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Padilla, Labrador</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Concepcion,  JJ.,</span>  concur. <br></div>
