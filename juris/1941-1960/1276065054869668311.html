				<H3>FELIPE LUNA, PETITIONER, VS. GAVINO S. ABAYA, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL (CALOOCAN BRANCH), AND HORTENSIO A. DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A. <em>Statement</em>: This is a petition to annul three orders of
the court of first instance of. Rizal in connection with its civil case
number 75, entitled Eustaquio C. Olvina <em>vs</em>. Felipe Luna. The
first order dated September 29, 1947, declared both plaintiff and
defendant in default as against the complaint in intervention of
Hortensio A. Domingo; the second, dated August 31, 1948, rendered
judgment against both, adjudging Hortensio A. Domingo the owner of the
premises in question; and the third required the execution of such
judgment.
<p> At the request of petitioner we issued a writ of preliminary injunction after he had filed a suitable bond.</p>
<p> B. <em>The facts</em>: (1) On November 20, 1946, Eustaquio C.
Olvina brought suit against Felipe Luna, alleging that he was owner of
a house and lot in Caloocan, Rizal; that on January 26, 1945, he
borrowed money from Felipe Luna and mortgaged said realty; that through
deceit he signed a deed of <em>pacto de retro</em> instead of
mortgage; and that through ejectment proceedings Luna obtained
possession. He asked for declaration of dominion and other allied
remedies.</p>
<p> (2) On January 12, 1947, the defendant Luna answered, and asserting their contract was a conditional sale, pleaded <em>res judicata.</em></p>
<p> (3) On June 21, 1947, Hortensio A. Domingo filed a complaint in intervention averring that on October 15, 1942, he
purchased the property from Olvina, who reserved the right to
repurchase it within one year; that Olvina failed to buy it back; and
that Luna knew this sale when he purchased the realty in 1945. Domingo
therefore prayed for declaration of ownership and other consequent
relief against both parties.</p>
<p> (4) On August 4, 1947, the court admitted the complaint in intervention.</p>
<p> (5) On September 3, 1947, the intervenor submitted a motion asking
that plaintiff and defendant be declared in default for failure "to
file their answer to intervenor's complaint of intervention" within ten
days "under section 5, Rule 13, of the Rules of Court".</p>
<p> (6) As requested, on September 29, 1947, the court issued an order holding the plaintiff and the defendant in default.</p>
<p> (7) The intervenor was subsequently permitted to present his
evidence, and on August 31, 1948, a decision was rendered upholding
Domingo's ownership of the house and, among other things, ordering
Felipe Luna to vacate it and pay rents from November, 1946.</p>
<p> (8) On October 23, 1948, Felipe Luna moved that the judgment be set
aside, and the case reinstated, alleging that he had just been notified
of the decision and that he had a good defense because he was an
innocent purchaser for value without notice, whose document was duly
inscribed in the Registry, etc. The petition was supported by an
affidavit of merit.</p>
<p> (9) On March 15, 1949, the motion Was denied.</p>
<p> (10) On April 19, 1949, the defendant through another attorney
reiterated the petition for reinstatement and, upon equitable
considerations, asked that the default order be lifted.</p>
<p> (11) On July 14, 1949, the motion w|as denied.</p>
<p> (12) On September 13, 1949, Felipe Luna through a third attorney
moved that the default order |and the judgment against him be set
aside, for the reason that said default order was not authorized by
law.</p>
<p> (13) On October 28, 1949, the court denied the motion and directed the issuance of execution.</p>
<p> (14) On November 8, 1949, this petition for certiorari was filed.
It is mainly grounded upon the illegality of the order of default.</p>
<p> C. <em>Discussion</em>: In applying for the default order and in
issuing it, Hortensio A. Domingo and the lower court expressly invoked
section 5 of Rule 13, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 5. <em>Time</em>.—Unless a different period
is fixed by the court, the complaint or answer in intervention shall be
filed within ten (10) days from notice of the order permitting such
intervention."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> There was plain error. The ten-day period is fixed <em>for the intervenor</em>,
who may either present a complaint or an answer after his petition for
intervention has been granted. In the Olvina-Luna litigation the
intervenor already submitted his complaint. The 10-day period was not
meant for the plaintiff nor the defendant.</p>
<p> Realizing their mistake, respondents presently quote section 4 of Rule 13, which prescribes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 4. <em>Complaint or answer in intervention if permitted</em>.—If
permitted, the intervention shall be made by complaint filed and served
in regular form, and may be answered as if it were an original
complaint; but where intervenor unites with the defendant in resisting
the claims of the plaintiff, the intervention may be made in the form
of an answer to the complaint."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they argue that plaintiff and defendant were duty bound to
answer the complaint in intervention within fifteen days from service,
and that such period had expired on September 29, 1947, when the
default order was entered. The reply to this is that the section says,
"may be answered" and the word "may" is usually permissive, not
mandatory. Furthermore, supposing that it is mandatory, by the very
count of respondents, the 15-day period had not yet expired on
September 3, 1947 when the motion for default was made. Obviously this
is the reckoning date—not the day of the order.</p>
<p> Respondents maintain that the service of the notice of hearing
"cured whatever irregularity the order of default may have created".
The service was not actual. If at all, it was merely constructive. And
even if actually received, the notice would have afforded no remedy,
for the reason that even if defendant had appeared at the hearing
pursuant to such notice, he could adduce no evidence, nor could he be
heard because of the default order <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>.
The service of such notice was unnecessary and useless, and therefore
it could have no curative effect. It is just the same as if the court
had not sent the notice and had proceeded to admit the intervenor's
evidence in the absence and without the knowledge of the adverse
parties.</p>
<p> As the judgment of August 31, 1948, was promulgated almost a year
after the order of default, the idea crossed our minds that herein
petitioner should be held negligent for not having requested the
lifting thereof within that long period of time; but the thought had to
be promptly rejected because the date is not shown when he was advised
of such default order, if he was notified at all. The possible
suggestion that he should have been alerted by the receipt of copy of
the application for default, may be answered with the statement that he
understood he was not in default and had every right to relax,
expecting the court to rule accordingly.</p>
<p> From the foregoing considerations, we conclude that the defendant
Felipe Luna was deprived of his day in court through a patently
erroneous interpretation of the rules.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A default judgment may be set aside where it was
entered by the clerk without any authority therefor, as where default
was improperly entered for failure of plaintiff to answer a cross
complaint <em>which under the circumstances was unnecessary</em>. Also
a judgment entered contrary to the course of the court by inadvertence,
improvidence, mistake, or the like may be set aside. A judgment maybe
set aside whether there was a total lack of authority to enter any
judgment or only lack of authority to enter a particular judgment, <em>when
the entry of such a judgment was premature, as where it was entered
before expiration of the time for the filing of an answer</em>, before
expiration of a continuance granted by the trial judge, pending an
application for a change of venue, prior to the day on which the cause
was docketed for trial, or prior to the date reserved for decision on a
demurrer. <em>A default judgment erroneously rendered where defendant "was not in default may be vacated</em>."  (49 C. J. S., pp. 617-618). (Italics ours).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> D. <em>Judgment</em>: Wherefore, the order of default and the
proceedings subsequent or pursuant thereto should be, and are hereby,
annulled and set aside.</p>
<em>Ozaeta, Pablo, Tuason, Montemayor</em>, and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur.
