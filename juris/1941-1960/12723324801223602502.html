				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are two appeals from&nbsp; one and the same decision of the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental, in civil case No. 2678 thereof.<br><br>On&nbsp; Febraury 13, 1952, the same was instituted by the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; two&nbsp; promissory notes of defendant Julian L.&nbsp; Teves, in the aggregate&nbsp; sum of P3,130.00, plus&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees and costs. Simultaneously, plaintiff filed a verified ex parte motion for a writ of preliminary attachment, which was granted by the court the next day.&nbsp; In&nbsp; due course,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; filed an answer alleging that the&nbsp; sum of money&nbsp; delivered to him by&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; consisted&nbsp; of valueless&nbsp; notes,&nbsp; which were not legal tender, and&nbsp; setting up a&nbsp; counter-claim for P20,000.00, for moral damages on account of the allegations of said ex parte motion, which were branded as defamatory and absolutely false.&nbsp; After appropriate proceedings,&nbsp; decision was&nbsp; rendered, the dispositive part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which is of the following tenor:<br><blockquote>"Premises considered, the Court&nbsp; hereby holds and so orders: "(1)&nbsp; For the defendant Mr. Julian L. Teves to&nbsp; pay to .the plaintiff, thru the Iatter's Negros Oriental Agency with office in&nbsp; Dumar guete&nbsp; City, the following&nbsp; amounts: One thousand&nbsp; four hundred eighty-nine pesos (Pl,489.00) in full payment of the loan of P3,130.00 released in emergency notes; Twenty pesos (P20.00)&nbsp; for the filing fees; and One hundred forty-eight and 90/100 pesos (P148.90) as attorney's fees&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; promissory notes&nbsp; signed by defendant;<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; For the dismissal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; counter-claim of&nbsp; defendant for moral damages of P20,000.00;<br><br>"(3)&nbsp; For the dismissal of the claim of Pl,000.00 by defendant for attorney's fees, said defendant having caused the bringing of this action by reason of his refusal to pay unless so ordered by the Court.<br><br>"No&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; is made&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; incurred by plaintiff in relation to the attachment of defendant's properties, said attachment being unfounded and unjustified."</blockquote>Both parties have appealed&nbsp; from said decision and the questions for determination&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court are: (1) whether the sums of money received by the defendant from the plaintiff were legal tender or not;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative case,&nbsp; what&nbsp; amount is due from the defendant under his aforementioned promissory notes;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; whether the defendant should recover&nbsp; moral damages from&nbsp; the plaintiff.<br><br>With reference to the first question, defendant testified that the consideration for his aforementioned&nbsp; promissory notes&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to him by the&nbsp; plaintiff in&nbsp; emergency currency, which&nbsp; the people&nbsp; in the mountains, where he and his family stayed, for some time, refused&nbsp; to receive, and&nbsp; that part of&nbsp; said&nbsp; notes&nbsp; were&nbsp; destroyed, when&nbsp; his house was&nbsp; consumed by fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court found correctly&nbsp; that, this&nbsp; notwithstanding, defendant is bound to comply with the obligation&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; said&nbsp; promissory notes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, his promissory note Exhibit C, for P2,235.00, is dated April 23,&nbsp; 1942.&nbsp; His&nbsp; other&nbsp; promissory note Exhibit D, for&nbsp; P895.00, is dated May 18, 1942.&nbsp; At&nbsp; that time, the province of Negros Oriental was still&nbsp; unoccupied by the Japanese, who&nbsp; landed&nbsp; therein on May 26,&nbsp; 1942. Hence, it is&nbsp; not claimed that the&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; represented by said promissory notes were paid by the plaintiff in Japanese military notes.&nbsp; What is more, the very defendant testified that said payment was&nbsp; made in "emergency notes", referring to the currency which the&nbsp; officers&nbsp; of the Commonwealth&nbsp; in unoccupied areas were&nbsp; authorized to issue by President Quezon before he left the&nbsp; Philippines in 1942. Said emergency notes were then valid and legal tender.&nbsp; Otherwise, the same would not have been accepted by the defendant.&nbsp; In the language of the lower court:<br><blockquote>* * * That these&nbsp; so-called 'Emergency Notes'&nbsp; were&nbsp; valid and can be implied further from the fact that immediately after liberation, the President of the Commonwealth issued an&nbsp; Executive Order No. 25, dated November 18, 1944, which prohibited&nbsp; the <i>further</i> use and circulation of such kind of 'notes' from said date (see Monde jar <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Nicolo, 43 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp; No. 12, 5099; De Asis <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Melendreras et al., C.A. 44&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz. No. 9, 3327).&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that the government <i>redeemed</i>&nbsp; such 'Emergency Notes' under the&nbsp; provisions of Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 369 in&nbsp; relation to Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 22, is additional&nbsp; proof&nbsp; that the said. 'Notes' were&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as legal tender at the time that&nbsp; they were&nbsp; printed&nbsp; and issued."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, p. 17.)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Obviously, the&nbsp; alleged refusal of some people to receive said emergency notes&nbsp; from the&nbsp; defendant and the alleged destruction thereof, while in his posession, by fire, affects neither the validity of the promissory notes in question, nor plaintiffs right to demand payment thereof. The second question was&nbsp; decided by the lower court in the light of the spirit of Republic Act No. 369, entitled "An Act&nbsp; providing for the redemption of emergency and guerrilla currency notes registered and&nbsp; deposited under the provisions of Republic Act Numbered Twenty-two, appropriating funds therefor, and for other&nbsp; purposes."&nbsp; Applying paragraph&nbsp; (6) of section 1 of said Act, reading:<br><blockquote>"For holders of the following registered post-guerrilla&nbsp; notes one hundred <i>per centum</i>&nbsp; for&nbsp; the first five hundred pesos;&nbsp; fifty per centum for&nbsp; all amounts&nbsp; in excess&nbsp; of&nbsp; five&nbsp; hundred pesos up&nbsp; to one thousand pesos; thirty <i>per centum</i> for&nbsp; all&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; in excess of one thousand pesos up to&nbsp; ten thousand pesos;&nbsp; and fifteen <i>per centum</i> for all amounts in excess of ten thousand&nbsp; pesos, with pre ference to the payment in favor of holders of small amounts."<br></blockquote>the lower court concluded that P3,130&nbsp; in emergency notes is equivalent to P1,489 in present currency and sentenced the defendant to pay&nbsp; this sum to the plaintiff.<br><br>Both parties concede the applicability of said Act&nbsp; of Congress,&nbsp; but defendant&nbsp; assails the computation&nbsp; of the lower court as&nbsp; erroneous, and asserts that the&nbsp; amount collectible by the plaintiff is Pl,389 only, whereas the latter contends that, instead of invoking subdivision (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of section 1 of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 369, the lower court should have applied subdivision&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; of the same section, pursuant to which&nbsp; holders of emergency currency issues shall&nbsp; be paid in post liberation&nbsp; currency at the rate of one hundred (100%) <i>per centum.</i><br><br>It is, however, clear from&nbsp; the&nbsp; language of&nbsp; said subdivision&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; of section 1, that the same refers to holders of "guerrilla" notes, to which class those received by&nbsp; the defendant from the plaintiff did not belong.&nbsp; As&nbsp; already adverted to, the promissory notes in question were issued, and the consideration therefor&nbsp; was received by the defendant from the plaintiff, <i>prior</i> to the military occupation of Negros Oriental by the Japanese.&nbsp; At that time, there could have been, and there were, neither guerrillas, nor&nbsp; guerilla notes,&nbsp; in Negros Oriental.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more, defendant's evidence positively shows that said consideration was delivered to the defendant in "emergency" notes, which&nbsp; are&nbsp; the subject-matter of subdivision (<i>a</i>) of section 1, pursuant to which&nbsp; "holders of * * * emergency currency issues" shall be paid at the rate of "one hundred (100%) <i>per centum</i>". Obviously, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the face value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said notes,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggregate&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P3,130.00 in present currency.<br><br>The lower court decided the third question in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant upon the ground; (<i>a</i>) that, by his inaction, the latter had waived his objection to the&nbsp; irregularity in the issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment; (<i>b</i>) that, under the facts of the case, defendant would be entitled only to actual damages, which have&nbsp; not been proven; and (<i>c</i>) that the false&nbsp; and defamatory&nbsp; character of the allegations in plaintiff's<i> ex parte</i>&nbsp; motion for a writ of preliminary&nbsp; attachment, do not warrant a recovery of moral damages, said motion being in&nbsp; the nature of a privileged communication.<br><br>Said motion of the plaintiff was granted because of the averment&nbsp; therein to&nbsp; the effect "that&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; has removed or; disposed of&nbsp; his properties, and is about to do&nbsp; so, with intent to defraud his creditors,&nbsp; especially the plaintiff herein".&nbsp; Defendant established by his testimony, which has not been&nbsp; contradicted,&nbsp; that this allegation is not true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; it appears that the defendant is the owner of&nbsp; extensive&nbsp; lands and has a sugar quota of about 20,000&nbsp; piculs&nbsp; a year; that he had been municipal mayor and provincial governor for&nbsp; several terms that&nbsp; he was a member of&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; once; and that he is a prominent member of the community, which regards him with great respect.&nbsp; We&nbsp; note,&nbsp; however, that the&nbsp; main allegation in his counter-claim relative to the moral damages he seeks to recover is:<br><blockquote>3. "That&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing allegations by&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; aforesaid motion<i> ex parte</i> for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment,&nbsp; are defamatory and absolutely false, and have no foundation of truth whatsoever,&nbsp; plaintiff knowing&nbsp; them to&nbsp; be&nbsp; false;&nbsp; have greatly embarrassed and hurt defendant's position in the&nbsp; social, political and business&nbsp; world;&nbsp; have exposed&nbsp; and placed&nbsp; defendant to public ridicule; and! have caused him great and&nbsp; extreme mental anguish and moral suffering, to the value of not less than Twenty thousand pesos&nbsp; (P20,000.00).<br><br>4. "That&nbsp; to&nbsp; defend&nbsp; defendant's honor and for&nbsp; the purpose of securing the present redress&nbsp; for the wrong done him&nbsp; by plaintiff, defendant has to secure&nbsp; attorney's services at P1,000.00."<br></blockquote>Upon the other hand, testifying thereon,&nbsp; he said:<br><blockquote>"R.&nbsp; Una&nbsp; manana, se&nbsp; me&nbsp; acerc6—no&nbsp; se,&nbsp; no&nbsp; le&nbsp; he&nbsp; conocido, que es encargado del&nbsp; Sheriff—me hablo&nbsp; sobre esa cuenta y juntamente dijo, "Esa casa voy a embargar.'&nbsp; Le pregunte, 'Que cuenta es esa?'; me contesto, 'Esta cuenta del banco.'&nbsp; Le dije, 'Mejor que se aclare esto ante los tribunales."&nbsp; Entonces, me&nbsp; acerco el driver y me&nbsp; dijo que iba&nbsp; a embargar&nbsp; mi automovil.&nbsp; Entonces, dije, 'No lo toque el&nbsp; coche; porque si&nbsp; no, a&nbsp; ver&nbsp; si ocurre&nbsp; algo, no&nbsp; ya&nbsp; a punetazoes&nbsp; sino&nbsp; que lo llevare a&nbsp; los tribunales.'&nbsp; Entonces, cogi el coche y me marche y <i>nadia mas me ha molestado</i>" (p.&nbsp; 22, ten.)&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)<br></blockquote>In other words, defendant's answer relies upon the falsity of the averments in plaintiff's motion as the cause for his alleged mental anguish and moral suffering, whereas his testimony&nbsp; stresses&nbsp; the embarrassment occasioned by the alleged attempt of a deputy sheriff to attach a&nbsp; car of the defendant.&nbsp; It will&nbsp; be observed,&nbsp; also, that a&nbsp; driver (defendant&nbsp; did not say whose&nbsp; driver&nbsp; he&nbsp; was), merely told <i>him</i> that said officer wanted to levy attachment upon defendant's car.&nbsp; It does not appear that the deputy sheriff had conveyed such&nbsp; intent, either to the defendant or to said driver, who was not placed on the witness stand and might have simply jumped at a conclusion, the accuracy of which&nbsp; we are not in a position to verify.&nbsp; Again, the record does not disclose any overt act of said&nbsp; officer to seize the aforementioned car.&nbsp; In fact, defendant drove it away without being molested, either then, or at any time thereafter.<br><br>Considering, therefore, that defendant appears to have suffered no actual damages;&nbsp; that the assessment of moral damages "is left to&nbsp; the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of each case."&nbsp; (Art. 2216, Civil Code of the Philippines); that <i>the writ of preliminary attachment was never executed;</i>&nbsp; that we&nbsp; do not know&nbsp; what specific acts, if any, were performed by the deputy sheriff in his alleged&nbsp; attempt&nbsp; to levy attachment upon the car of defendant herein; that&nbsp; his debts to the plaintiff&nbsp; drew no interest whatsoever; and that said&nbsp; debts had been outstanding for about&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10) years,&nbsp; when this&nbsp; case was filed,&nbsp; and about thirteen&nbsp; (13)&nbsp; years, when the .decision appealed from was rendered, we are not prepared to hold that the&nbsp; lower court had erred, or&nbsp; abused its discretion, in not sentencing&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; to pay moral damages.<br><br>Wherefore, with the&nbsp; modification that defendant&nbsp; shall pay to the plaintiff&nbsp; the sum of P3,130.00 in present currency, plus P313.00 by way of attorney's fees, the decision appealed from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, in all other&nbsp; respects, with the&nbsp; costs of&nbsp; both instances against&nbsp; the defendant. It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
