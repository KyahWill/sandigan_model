				G.R. No. L-1833, May 13, 1949</h4>
				<H3>MEDARDO MUÃ‘OZ, PETITIONER, VS. EMILIO RILLORAZA, JOSE B. BERNABE AND MANUEL ESCUDERO, ASSOCIATE JUDGES OF THE PEOPLE'S COURT, FOURTH DIVISION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petitioner was accused of treason before the People's Court in 
an information dated February 23, 1946. No bail was recommended in the 
information. He pleaded not guilty and applied for bail. By agreement of the 
parties the court set the bail application and the case on the merits for joint 
hearing on January 15, 1947; but on said date the court postponed the hearing to 
March 17 and 18, 1947, upon motion of the defense and over the objection of the 
prosecution. On March 17, 1947, again upon motion of the defense and over the 
objection of the prosecution, the court ordered the hearing postponed "until 
further petition of defense or until new assignment." Two subsequent assignments 
for hearing made by the court were likewise postponed upon petition of the 
prosecution with the conformity of the defense. At last the agreed joint hearing 
was commenced on November 19, 1947.
<p align="justify">After the first witness for the prosecution had testified the 
petitioner moved the court to limit the hearing to his application for bail so 
that he might enjoy provisional liberty pending the trial on the merits. That 
motion was denied by the court, which continued the joint hearing on November 
20, 1947, at which another witness for the prosectution testified, over the 
objection of the petitioner, who had asked that the joint hearing be suspended 
until he could raise the question of his bail before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p align="justify">The continuation of the joint hearing having been set by the 
court for December 12, 15 and 16, 1947, the petitioner, on December 3, filed the 
present petition for the writ of mandamus to compel the respondent judges of the 
Fourth Division of the then People's Court to hear and decide his application 
for bail before continuing the hearing of his case on the merits, and for the 
writ of preliminary injunction to restrain them form continuing the joint 
hearing. This Court required the respondents to answer but declined to restrain 
them.</p>
<ol><li>
<div align="justify">Respondents did not unlawfully neglect the performance of 
their official duty to hear the petitioner's application for bail. As a matter 
of fact the very act complained of is that they persisted in hearing that 
application. But that hearing, the petitioner complains, was at the same time a 
hearing of the case on the merits and the resolution on his application for bail 
might be delayed. Hence he wanted a summary hearing on his application before 
the trial on the merits.<br><br></div>
<div align="justify">Considering that the joint hearing on the application for 
bail and on hte merits of the main case was adopted by the respondents by 
agreement of both parties, and that the repeated postponements of that hearing 
with the consequent delay were made at petitioner's instance or with his 
conformity, we find no factual and legal basis upon which to declare the 
respondents guilty of an unlawful neglect of duty to justify the issuance fo the 
mandatory writ prayed for. It is true that the petitioner had the right to apply 
for bial and to have his application heard summarily and promptly. But that 
right could be waived, and he did waive it, firstly, by agreeing to a joint 
hearing and, secondly, by himself asking and consenting to repeated 
postponements. He therefore cannot be said to have been unlawfully excluded from 
the use and enjoyment of his right. (See Sec. 3, Rule 67.) <br><br></div>
</li><li>
<div align="justify">It was discretionary on the part of the respondent judges to 
permit or not to permit the petitioner to go back on his previous agreement for 
a joint hearing in the interest of justice. That discretion cannot be controlled 
by this Court through the writ of mandamus.</div></li></ol>
<p align="justify">We do not know, although we may assume, that after the filing 
of this petition the respondent judges continued with the hearing and received 
sufficient evidence upon which to decide the application for bail. If that be so 
and if the application had not been decided up to the time the People's Court 
was abolished, the petitioner could and should urge the proper Court of First 
Instance to decide it.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is denied, without prejudice to petitioner's 
seeking a prompt decision on his application for bail in the proper Court of 
First Instance, in case he has not yet done so. No pronouncement as to 
costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PERFECTO, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">We dissent from the majority's decision. In our opinion, the 
petition should be granted and thus we vote.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for bail should have been and should be disposed 
of without any delay. Otherwise, the purposes of the provisions of the 
Constitution on bail would be defeated. Bailing of an accused is a pre.iminayr 
step in criminal proceedings and should not be postponed regardless of any 
consideration. As in this case, said step is delayed until the evidence on the 
merits shall have been presented. Such delay will make useless the 
constitutional guarantee as to the right of an accused to be bailed. </p> The trial court failed to do its official duty and the Supreme 
Court also is failing to do its duty by refusing to give to petitioner the 
remedy he is praying for.</div>
