				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal by certiorari against a decision of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations holding that&nbsp; tournahauler drivers&nbsp; and their&nbsp; helpers and truck&nbsp; drivers, employed in transporting cane from the field&nbsp; to&nbsp; the "switch" where they are loaded on railroad cars for transportation to the mill, are industrial workers and therefore entitled to 50 per cent for overtime&nbsp; work&nbsp; in excess of 8 hours&nbsp; and whatever they are entitled&nbsp; thereto, from&nbsp; 1947 to 1952.<br><br>It is&nbsp; first&nbsp; contended&nbsp; that the work of harvesting the cane; an admittedly agricultural work, should include that of loading it in tournahaulers and trucks and of transporting it in these railroad "switches&nbsp; as&nbsp; the same&nbsp; constitute what is&nbsp; known as the "initial means&nbsp; of transporting the cane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such work is claimed to be similar to bringing farm products to the roadside.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; American&nbsp; Fruit (1948)&nbsp; 75 N.L.E.B.&nbsp; 1157 and L.&nbsp; Maxey, Inc.&nbsp; (1948)&nbsp; 78 N.L.E.B. 525 are cited&nbsp; in&nbsp; support of this claim.&nbsp; In the first case the nature&nbsp; of the work&nbsp; of grove&nbsp; truck drivers, who were employed by the Fruit Growers, was as follows:<br><blockquote>"During&nbsp; the&nbsp; harvesting season,&nbsp; from&nbsp; October or&nbsp; November&nbsp; to May or June, the Employer&nbsp; requires tile services&nbsp; of fine,grave truck drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are&nbsp; hired by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Employer's&nbsp; field superintendent, who, together with the Employer's field&nbsp; foreman, gives them their orders and supervises their work.&nbsp; Paid with the Employer's checks, they drive trucks&nbsp; owned by&nbsp; the Employer.&nbsp; They&nbsp; report&nbsp; daily for work at the&nbsp; Employer's&nbsp; packing&nbsp; house&nbsp; where&nbsp; they&nbsp; punch the time&nbsp; clock&nbsp; used by&nbsp; the&nbsp; employer's&nbsp; packing house&nbsp; employees at&nbsp; the&nbsp; beginning&nbsp; and&nbsp; end&nbsp; of each&nbsp; day.&nbsp; They convey&nbsp; empty fruit&nbsp; containers from&nbsp; the&nbsp; packing&nbsp; house&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; groves&nbsp; where fruit is&nbsp; being harvested.&nbsp; The&nbsp; nearest grove serviced by the Employer is about&nbsp; 3%&nbsp; miles from&nbsp; the packing house;&nbsp; the&nbsp; furthest is approximately&nbsp; SE miles&nbsp; away.&nbsp; The time spent&nbsp; by&nbsp; grove truck drivers in transit and at the groves varies considerably.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the boxes have been filed with fruit and loaded on&nbsp; the trucks by the harvest hands, the grove truck drivers bring the&nbsp; trucks back&nbsp; to the Employer's packing house.. Upon their&nbsp; return&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plant, the. drivers spend an hour or more at&nbsp; the packing&nbsp; house, unloading the fruit and moving it to the designated location&nbsp; where each grower's fruit is&nbsp; being stored prior to packing-.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grove truck&nbsp; drivers work from1 9 to 11 hours&nbsp; per&nbsp; day, averaging&nbsp; four round trips."<br></blockquote>But it&nbsp; was held&nbsp; that said grove&nbsp; truck drivers are not agricultural workers,&nbsp; thus:<br><blockquote>"It is&nbsp; also clear from&nbsp; the record that the&nbsp; functions of the grove truck&nbsp; drivers are&nbsp; of&nbsp; a non-agricultural nature.&nbsp; The&nbsp; mere fact that these employees are engaged in handling agricultural products does, not&nbsp; of&nbsp; itself&nbsp; classify&nbsp; them&nbsp; as 'agricultural&nbsp; laborer.' The administrate regulations of governmental agencies and the decision of the&nbsp; Courts interpreting&nbsp; the 'agricultural&nbsp; labor'&nbsp; exemption&nbsp;&nbsp; in various&nbsp; statutes,&nbsp; including&nbsp; National Labor Relations&nbsp; Act, make it&nbsp; clear&nbsp; that&nbsp; there is a differentiation&nbsp; between those engaged&nbsp; in industrial activities connected with the processing and marketing&nbsp; of agricultural products, and those who are&nbsp; engaged in work incidental&nbsp; to&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; farming operations.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to - the&nbsp; status of workers such as those here involved, the&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of the Courts&nbsp; interpreting the Agricultural exemptions in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Friar Labor Standards Act&nbsp; of 1938, indicate that they are not engaged&nbsp; in 'agriculture' as defined in section 3 ( <span style="font-style: italic;">f)</span>&nbsp; of that Act, as the&nbsp; employer&nbsp; is not a grower,' and its&nbsp; packing facilities&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; located 'on&nbsp; a farm,' * * *."<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; the other case,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; held:<br><blockquote>"4. The Petitioner seeks a unit of all the Employer's truck drivers at its&nbsp; Frostproof, Florida, plant,&nbsp; excluding supervisors as defined by the Act.&nbsp; The Employer is&nbsp; in&nbsp; general agreement with the unit . sought by&nbsp; the Petitioner, but would exclude&nbsp; therefrom goat-truck drivers and flat&nbsp; bodied truck drivers upon the ground that they are agricultural employees&nbsp; and&nbsp; thus&nbsp; excluded from&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; of collective bargaining.<br><br>"The Employer&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the harvesting,&nbsp; packaging, and marketing of citrus fruit grown&nbsp; in its own orchards and in orchards owned&nbsp; by&nbsp; independent&nbsp; growers.&nbsp; As part&nbsp; of this operation, the fruit is picked&nbsp; and loaded onto trucks by field&nbsp; crews.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; then either&nbsp; hauled by the Employer's goat trucks to the roadside where the fruit is transferred to a semi-trailer&nbsp; for&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; to the plant,&nbsp; or it&nbsp; is hauled&nbsp; directly from the grove to the plant by either goat-or flat-bodied trucks.&nbsp; Except&nbsp; for&nbsp; the operation&nbsp; of hauling the fruit from the orchard to the roadside, the goat and flat bodied drivers have similar&nbsp; duties.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; record indicates&nbsp; that goat-truck&nbsp; drivers&nbsp; spend part of their time in&nbsp; hauling fruit from the orchard to&nbsp; the roadside&nbsp; as&nbsp; distinguished&nbsp; from&nbsp; the hauling.of fruit directly from the orchard to&nbsp; the plant.&nbsp; The evidence&nbsp; is&nbsp; in conflict as to what percentage of their time goat-truck drivers spend on each type of hauling operation,<br><br>"The Board has held that the function of&nbsp; goat-truck drivers&nbsp; in hauling fruit from the&nbsp; orchard&nbsp; to the roadside&nbsp; is within the agricultural exemption, and requires that employees thus&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; be excluded from the&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, the Board&nbsp; has&nbsp; held that the&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; products from farm to processing plant is work which&nbsp; is not covered by the agricultural exemption."<br></blockquote>As pointed out&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent, however,&nbsp; the above&nbsp; cases were&nbsp; decided&nbsp; on questions involving collective bargaining, not&nbsp; the&nbsp; interpretation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Eight-Hour&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Law. This&nbsp; notwithstanding,&nbsp; we find nothing therein which&nbsp; can be&nbsp; said to support&nbsp; petitioner's claim;&nbsp; they do hold the truck&nbsp; drivers hauling agricultural produce to a plant are non-agricultural.<br><br>If petitioner were&nbsp; a small farmer using tractors&nbsp; and trucks on a small scale, its contention would perhaps merit serious,&nbsp; if not&nbsp; favorable, consideration, because, the very ones engaged in cutting the cane would be the&nbsp; same ones that bring it to the "switches."&nbsp; But petitioner is a highly mechanized&nbsp; industrial concern,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; work of planting and harvesting&nbsp; clearly distinguished&nbsp; from&nbsp; that of transporting the&nbsp; cane from the fields,&nbsp; first to a "switch" and later to the mill.&nbsp; The rule, therefore, should&nbsp; be that all its workers are to be considered industr-j&amp;l workers, except1 those devoted to purely agricultural work.&nbsp; We can perhaps concede that the actual&nbsp; loading of the cane on the trucks and tournahaulers is part of the agricultural operation.&nbsp; This may be done by the laborers cutting the cane themselves.&nbsp; In the case of Vives <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Serralles,&nbsp; 145 F.&nbsp; 2d. 551-554&nbsp; (cited&nbsp; by petitioner), the workers held to be agricultural workers were those engaged in operating cars, from&nbsp; one place to another.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this case can have no application to the case at bar,&nbsp; which concerns&nbsp; drivers of trucks and tournahaulers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both drivers and operators of . trucks and tournahaulers are distinct from tho&nbsp; harvesters or from&nbsp; the loaders;&nbsp; they&nbsp; do no other&nbsp; work than hauling. They do no agricultural&nbsp; work of&nbsp; any kind at&nbsp; all;&nbsp; the industry which employs them is a big one permitting specialization for the different phases&nbsp; of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the highly industrialized organization&nbsp; to which&nbsp; they&nbsp; belong, it seems more in consonance with reason to consider them part of the mill organization, not of the agricultural workers as are the planters and harvesters.<br><br>It is&nbsp; also contended that it&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; unjust to&nbsp; make petitioner liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; overtime of said laborers&nbsp; in&nbsp; view of the fact that the Secretary of Labor had previously been consulted and reliance had been placed&nbsp; in good faith in his opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find&nbsp; nothing in this official's opinion which supports petitioner's contention.&nbsp; The&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; says,<br><blockquote>"We agree with you and Mr. A. A. Werner&nbsp; of the Pampanga Sugar Mills that the tractor drivers and their helpers while in&nbsp; the field engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; plowing&nbsp; and harrowing&nbsp; and in other activities closely connected with such work are included in the&nbsp; term 'farm laborers' and,' therefore, exempt from the- 8-hour&nbsp; requirement under Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 444. * * *."'&nbsp; (See p. 5 and 114 of the Record&nbsp; on Appeal)<br></blockquote>By no stretch of reasoning may the above opinion be interpreted to mean&nbsp; that drivers of trucks and tournahaulers engaged in transporting cane&nbsp; to&nbsp; "switches" are farm&nbsp; laborers.&nbsp; If petitioner&nbsp; had interpreted the above&nbsp; opinion in the sense that&nbsp; tournahaulers and&nbsp; truck drivers are to be&nbsp; considered farm laborers, it can blame&nbsp; no one else therefore, much less the Secretary of Labor, for the latter's opinion contains nothing to justify his belief or inference.<br><br>The last argument&nbsp; is that&nbsp; as the&nbsp; Secretary of Labor has not issued the permit required&nbsp; by section 2&nbsp; of the Eight-Hour Labor Law, the tournahauler and truck drivers should not be entitled to overtime pay, in accordance&nbsp; with the ruling in the case of Pasumil Workers&nbsp; Union <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of Industrial Eolations, 89 Phil., S70, 375-376.&nbsp; The case cited has become&nbsp; obsolete because of the&nbsp; repeal of&nbsp; Acts Nos. 4123 and 4242.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Commonwealth Act No. 444, only the employer has the obligation to secure authority to perform overtime work.&nbsp; Why should a violation by him of&nbsp; his duty&nbsp; exempt him from liability?&nbsp; This matter has already&nbsp; been settled against the petitioner by Us&nbsp; in Gotamco&nbsp; Lumber&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations, (85 Phil., 291).<br><blockquote>"The decision now under review&nbsp; grants to all workers and&nbsp; employees of the company 50 per cent additional compensation for work performed in&nbsp; excess of eight hours a day including&nbsp; Sundays&nbsp; and Holidays effective&nbsp; October&nbsp; 21, 1947.&nbsp; The petitioner maintains that as the overtime work has been performed without a permission from the Department of Labor,&nbsp; no extra&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; should be authorized.&nbsp; Several&nbsp; decisions of this&nbsp; court&nbsp; were invoked. But&nbsp; those decisions were based on the reasoning&nbsp; that 'as both the laborer&nbsp; and the employer are duty bound' to secure the permit from the Department of Labor, both were in<span style="font-style: italic;"> pari delicto.</span>&nbsp; However, the present&nbsp; law in effect imposes that duty upon the employer.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act No. 444)."<br></blockquote>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; considerations, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
