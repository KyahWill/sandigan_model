				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On&nbsp; February 23, 1954, Pedro&nbsp; Icong, an employee&nbsp; of the petitioner, was sleeping&nbsp; on board&nbsp; the tatter's vessel, M/V "Miss Leyte," when it caught fire.&nbsp; Awakened by the fire, Pedro Icong jumped overboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, he has not been heard of.&nbsp;&nbsp; The employee was unmarried, receiving daily P4.00 with meals estimated at P1.20, and respondent Juan Icong,&nbsp; his father, was his partial dependent.&nbsp; On April 30,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the latter filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission and the petitioner a notice of claim for death compensation.&nbsp; The petitioner reported the matter to the Commission&nbsp; only on August 17, 1954.&nbsp; The Commission rendered an award in favor of&nbsp; respondent Juan Icong in the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P2,038.40, plus P200.00 for burial&nbsp; expenses and P20.00 as legal fee.<br><br>The petitioner has appealed to this Court for the review of the award and has presented three points of law, namely: I. That Article&nbsp; 391 of the Civil Code&nbsp; of the Philippines was not applied in determining whether&nbsp; or not Pedro Icong should be&nbsp; considered dead; II. That Section 49 of Republic Act No. 772, providing for the right of the employer&nbsp; to notice&nbsp; and hearing of the claim against&nbsp; him,&nbsp; was&nbsp; disregarded; III. That&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Icong should have&nbsp; been guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; notorious negligence&nbsp; in&nbsp; jumping overboard.<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioner contends that in the absence of proof of, the&nbsp; death of&nbsp; Pedro Icong, the nearest&nbsp; approach to the matter, from the&nbsp; facts of his case,&nbsp; is the provision on the presumption of death established&nbsp; in Article 391&nbsp; of the Civil Code of the Philippines,&nbsp; according to which the person to be presumed dead must be unheard of for&nbsp; at least four years; that inasmuch as Pedro Icong had been missing for only a few months from the alleged accident, there is as yet no legal presumption of death on&nbsp; which to base any award for compensation.<br><br>The petitioner next contends that it never had its day in court, because no notice of any hearing was ever served upon it; and&nbsp; as this error affects its&nbsp; substantive rights, the decision under review was without jurisdiction.<br><br>It is lastly contended that although there was admittedly an alarm of fire; no person other than Pedro Icong jumped . overboard; that the. usual course of a prudent man under the circumstance would&nbsp; be to&nbsp; resort to a life saver, life raft or life boat and to await instructions from the captain and his officers; that the act of Pedro Icong was in complete disregard of adverse&nbsp; consequences&nbsp; constituting gross negligence which is a bar to the right of compensation.<br><br>The respondent Commission obviously did not apply the rule on&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; of death because&nbsp; in the employer's report&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accident&nbsp; submitted by&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; laborer Pedro Icong&nbsp; was&nbsp; reported as the only casualty,&nbsp; and in transmitting said report petitioner's counsel had implicitly admitted the fact of Pedro Icong's death.&nbsp; We agree with this conclusion.<br><br>Quite recently, in&nbsp; the case of Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. <i>vs.</i> Nieves Baens&nbsp; del Rosario, et al., G. R. No. L-13130, promulgated Oct.&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1959,&nbsp; we reproduced with approval the explanation of the&nbsp; respondent Commissioner&nbsp; therein that Article 391 of the Civil Code of the Philippines relating to presumption of death of persons aboard a vessel lost during a sea voyage&nbsp; applies to cases&nbsp; wherein the vessel cannot be located nor accounted for,&nbsp; or when its fate is unknown or there is no trace of its whereabouts, inasmuch as the word "lost" used in referring to a vessel must be given the same meaning as "missing" employed in connection with an&nbsp; aeroplane,&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons taking both means of conveyance being&nbsp; the object of the rule expressed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same sentence.&nbsp; In the instant case, none of the foregoing conditions appear to exist.&nbsp; The fate of petitioner's vessel is not unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not lost or missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter&nbsp; of fact, it had been definitely destroyed by fire and washed ashore.&nbsp; And in view of the further&nbsp; fact that when petitioner's vessel caught fire,&nbsp; Pedro Icong jumped overboard and since then had not been heard&nbsp; from, the aforementioned rule&nbsp; on&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; of&nbsp; death&nbsp; does not&nbsp; apply.<br><br>Instead the rule on preponderance of evidence applies to establish the fact of death.&nbsp; In the same case of Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc., <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, we said:<br><blockquote>"Where a person was last seen in a state of imminent peril that might probably result in&nbsp; his death&nbsp; and has never been seen or heard from again, though&nbsp; diligent search has been made, inference of immediate death may be drawn."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Brownlee et al.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Mutual Benefit, Health and Accident Association, 29 Fed [2nd] 71).<br></blockquote>As to the alleged lack of notice of hearing, the records disclose that the petitioner did not file with the respondent Commission the employer's report&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accident within the period prescribed by Section 45&nbsp; of Act No. 4328, as amended by Republic Act No. 772, and that neither was its right to controvert&nbsp; the claim ever alleged.&nbsp; Under the law such failure results in the loss of the right to controvert the claim on jurisdictional grounds;&nbsp; the employer cannot be subsequently heard to complain that the law was strictly construed against him.<br><br>We rule that the act of&nbsp; Pedro Icong in jumping overboard upon&nbsp; waking up and&nbsp; finding the vessel on fire is not constitutive of gross negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent Commission correctly termed it as "rather impelled by&nbsp; fright or by the instinct of self-preservation."&nbsp; "The kind of negligence on the part of the employee which will exempt the employer from liability for injuries suffered by the former is notorious negligence.&nbsp; Such negligence must be proved, the burden of proof resting on the employer.&nbsp; The correct presumption to be followed&nbsp; is that&nbsp; when a warning of danger is given, the laborer by instinct of self-preservation takes precaution to avoid such danger unless an&nbsp; intention fa attributed to end his life."&nbsp; (Francisco's Comments on Labor Laws, 2nd Ed., p.&nbsp; 888.)<br><br>In view of what has been said, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
