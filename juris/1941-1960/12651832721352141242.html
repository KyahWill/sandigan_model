				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for&nbsp; review of a resolution of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals entered on January 29, 1955 holding that it has&nbsp; jurisdiction to hear and decide the original case of mandamus then pending between the parties in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila under section 22 of Republic Act No. 1125.<p>It appears that original case of mandamus was pending in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila where it was originally filed when Republic Act No. 1125 creating the Court of Tax Appeals was enacted into law (July 16, 1954).&nbsp; On&nbsp; September 29,&nbsp; 1954, the Court of First Instance of Manila, upon a verbal motion of the Solicitor General and after the parties were&nbsp; given an opportunity to be heard, issued an order remanding the case to&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals for final disposition pursuant to section 22 of said Act.</p><p>On December&nbsp; 10, 1954, petitioner filed a motion before the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals praying that the case be&nbsp; ordered returned to the Court of First Instance of Manila for trial&nbsp; and&nbsp; final disposition on the ground that it&nbsp; involves primarily the issue of unfair competition and&nbsp; not a&nbsp; disputed assessment of the Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore it does not come under said section of Republic Act No. 1125.&nbsp; Respondents Vicente I. Cruz, Yam&nbsp; Nan, and&nbsp; New World Printing Press&nbsp; filed a written opposition to said motion stating,&nbsp; among other things, that the question&nbsp; of unfair competition&nbsp; raised&nbsp; by&nbsp; petitioner is but an incident of the&nbsp; main issue which is&nbsp; the authority&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue and&nbsp; the Secretary of Finance to approve and recommend for use by merchants&nbsp; any&nbsp; simplified&nbsp; set of bookkeeping records that comply with the requirements&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law and regulations pursuant to section 334 in relation to section 338 of the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; And since this is a matter that arises under the National Internal Revenue Code, they contend that the Court of Tax Appeals&nbsp; has jurisdiction to try and decide the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention having been upheld, petitioner interposed the present petition for review.</p><p>The question to be determined is whether&nbsp; the case of mandamus which was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila by petitioner against respondents is one which should be remanded&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals under section 22 of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1125.&nbsp; Said section provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 22.<em> Pending&nbsp; eases to be&nbsp; remanded to Court.</em>—All cases involving disputed&nbsp; assessment of Internal Revenue taxes or customs duties&nbsp; pending determination before the Court of First Instance shall be certified and remanded&nbsp; by the respective Clerk of Court to the Court of Tax Appeals for final disposition thereof."</p></blockquote><p>In the amended petition filed by petitioner in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila, he alleged that through his intellectual effort and at&nbsp; great&nbsp; expense and&nbsp; sacrifice of time,&nbsp; effort and money, he had devised a simplified book-keeping set; that scarcely had he placed said simplified bookkeeping set in the market when respondents Vicente I. Cruz,&nbsp; Sabina&nbsp; R, Soriano, New World Printing&nbsp; Press and Yam Nan flooded the market with their alleged simplified bookkeeping sets which they claim to be their own individual "devices" when, in truth and in fact, such&nbsp; sets were&nbsp; mere copies and reproductions of&nbsp; the instructions, forms and&nbsp; proorma&nbsp; financial&nbsp; statements contained in Revenue Regulations No. V—13; that the Secretary of Finance, Undersecretary of&nbsp; Finance, and the&nbsp; Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, abetted&nbsp; and&nbsp; encouraged&nbsp; the&nbsp; unfair competition indulged in by&nbsp; their&nbsp; co-respondents in that, despite their knowledge that the bookkeeping&nbsp; sets of said co-respondents are virtual reproduction of the instructions, forms and&nbsp; pro-forma&nbsp; financial&nbsp; statements contained in said Internal&nbsp; Revenue Regulations, the aforesaid officials gave&nbsp; permission,&nbsp; approval,&nbsp; and&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; their co-respondents to print, publish, and sell to the&nbsp; public their bookkeeping sets; and that&nbsp; the above acts of respondents constitute unfair competition and a violation of existing law&nbsp; for&nbsp; which reason&nbsp; petitioner seeks relief by&nbsp; asking the court to enjoin said government officials&nbsp; from allowing the sale of the alleged fraudulent bookkeeping sets and to award him&nbsp; the damages he has&nbsp; suffered on account of the unfair&nbsp; competition&nbsp; resorted to by respondents.</p><p>In&nbsp; holding that it has jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; hear this&nbsp; case of mandamus under section 22 of Republic Act No. 1125, the Court of Tax Appeals intimated that,&nbsp; while said section apparently only&nbsp; refers to cases "involving disputed assessment of Internal Revenue&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; or&nbsp; customs duties pending&nbsp; determination before the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance", and the&nbsp; present case admittedly does not involve any&nbsp; assessment of the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, it cannot be said&nbsp; that it is excluded from its operation and scope&nbsp; it&nbsp; appearing that the&nbsp; main issue involved arises under the National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code.&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals has adopted the view that said section 22 should not be interpreted&nbsp; alone but in connection with&nbsp; section&nbsp; 7 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Act&nbsp; which, among other things, provides that the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals has jurisdiction to review by appeal "other matters arising under&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code&nbsp; or other law or part of&nbsp; law administered by the Bureau&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue."&nbsp; And after stating that&nbsp; in framing section 22 Congress&nbsp; must have&nbsp; committed an oversight in not including therein those cases specified in section 7, the Court of Tax Appeals made this&nbsp; remark: "The omission as pointed out above is clearly&nbsp; an oversight on the part of Congress and the deficiency&nbsp; should be supplied if we are to accomplish the purpose and intention of Congress&nbsp; in the creation of this court.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; section 22 of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1125, should&nbsp; be interpreted&nbsp; in such manner as would make it harmonize with section 7 of the same Act&nbsp; in order to avoid confusion and&nbsp; absurd consequences."</p><p>We agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; the view&nbsp; that section 22 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1125 should be interpreted in&nbsp; such a manner as to make it harmonize with section 7 of the same Act&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the primordial purpose behind the approval of said Act by Congress is to give to the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals exclusive appellate jurisdiction "over all tax, customs,&nbsp; and real&nbsp; estate assessment&nbsp; cases throughout the&nbsp; Philippines and to hear and decide them as soon as possible", but we disagree with the conclusion that the present case comes within the purview of the&nbsp; clause&nbsp; "other matters arising under the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code&nbsp; or other&nbsp; law or&nbsp; part&nbsp; of law administered by&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal Revenue"&nbsp; appearing in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 1, of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1125.</p><p>Section&nbsp; 7 of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1125&nbsp; provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 7.<em> Jurisdiction</em>.—The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review&nbsp; by appeal, as herein&nbsp; provided,—&nbsp; </p><p>"(1) Decisions&nbsp; of the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue in cases involving disputed&nbsp; assessments, refunds&nbsp; of internal&nbsp; revenue&nbsp; taxes, fees&nbsp; or other&nbsp; charges, penalties imposed in&nbsp; relation thereto, or other&nbsp; matters arising under the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code or other law or part&nbsp; of law administered&nbsp; by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; </p><p>"(2) Decisions of the Commissioner of Customs in cases involving liability for customs&nbsp; duties, fees&nbsp; or other money charges; seizure, detention or release of property affected;&nbsp; fines, forfeitures or other penalties imposed&nbsp; in relation thereto; or other matters arising under the&nbsp; Customs Law or other law&nbsp; or part of&nbsp; law administered by the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Customs; and&nbsp; </p><p>"(3) Decisions of provincial or city Boards of Assessment Appeals in cases involving the assessment and taxation of real property or other matters arising under the Assessment Law, including rules and regulations relative thereto."</p></blockquote><p>Note that the law gives to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs, and the provincial or city&nbsp; Boards of Assessment Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that in&nbsp; defining the cases that may be&nbsp; reviewed&nbsp; the law begins by&nbsp; enumerating them&nbsp; and then adds&nbsp; a&nbsp; general&nbsp; clause pertaining to&nbsp; other&nbsp; matters that may arise under the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code, the&nbsp; Customs Law and the Assessment Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; shows that the&nbsp; "other matters" that may come under the general clause&nbsp; should be of the same nature as&nbsp; those&nbsp; that have preceded them&nbsp; applying the&nbsp; rule of construction known as ejusdem generis.&nbsp; In other words, in order,that a matter&nbsp; may come&nbsp; under the general clause,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is necessary that it belongs to the same kind or class therein specifically enumerated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, it should be deemed foreign or extraneous and is not included.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It is a general rule of statutory construction&nbsp; that where general&nbsp; words follow&nbsp; an&nbsp; enumeration of&nbsp; persons or things,&nbsp; by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general&nbsp; words are not to he construed in their widest extent, but&nbsp; are to be held as applying only to persons&nbsp; or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned.&nbsp; </p><p>"This rule is commonly called the 'ejusdem generis' rule because it teaches us that broad and comprehensive&nbsp; expressions in&nbsp; an act, such as 'and all others,' or 'any others,' are usually to be restricted to persons or things 'of the same&nbsp; kind' or class with those specially named in the preceding words. It is of very frequent use and application&nbsp; in the interpretation of statutes.&nbsp; </p><p><em>"Illustrations and Applications</em>&nbsp; </p><p>"The&nbsp; rule&nbsp; of 'ejusdem generis'&nbsp; is&nbsp; properly applied&nbsp; to&nbsp; a statute exempting from taxation certain enumerated kinds of&nbsp; property and 'other articles,'&nbsp; the general term being strictly confined to the similitude of&nbsp; those&nbsp; specifically named."&nbsp; (Black&nbsp; on Interpretation of Laws, 2nd ed.,&nbsp; 203; See also Smith, Bell &amp; Co., Ltd.&nbsp; vs. Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Davao,&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-7084,&nbsp; promulgated October&nbsp; 27, 1954.)&nbsp; </p><p>"Where general words follow&nbsp; the designation of particular things, or classes of persons or&nbsp; subjects, the general&nbsp; words&nbsp; will usually be construed to include only those persons or things of the same class or general nature as those specifically enumerated.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; where a law prohibits the exclusion of any persons on account of their color from 'barber shops, eating houses, or other places of public&nbsp; resort,' the latter phrase will be restricted to places of the same general character of those specifically enumerated.&nbsp; This is the rule known&nbsp; as&nbsp; 'ejusdem&nbsp; generis',&nbsp; and it&nbsp; is founded upon the&nbsp; idea that if&nbsp; the legislature intended&nbsp; the general words to be used in an unrestricted sense, the particular&nbsp; classes&nbsp; would not have been mentioned."&nbsp; (Crawford, The Construction of Statutes pp. 326-327.)</p></blockquote><p>The question involved in the mandamus case&nbsp; does not cover any disputed&nbsp; assessment or&nbsp; refund of any internal&nbsp; revenue&nbsp; tax,&nbsp; fee, charge or penalty imposed in relation thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, involves unfair competition arising&nbsp; from the use of simplified set of bookkeeping records required by section 334 of the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; This has nothing to do&nbsp; with&nbsp; any assessment or&nbsp; refund of any tax, fee or penalty.&nbsp; It cannot be pretended that for any violation of the Internal Revenue Law, Customs Law, or Assessment Law,&nbsp; the case may be&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals, for&nbsp; if such were&nbsp; the case,&nbsp; then the latter court would also have jurisdiction to review&nbsp; cases involving penal provisions such&nbsp; as those&nbsp; embodied in Title XI of the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, such court does not have criminal jurisdiction. </p><p>Wherefore, the resolution&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; reversed. The Court orders.&nbsp; that&nbsp; the original&nbsp; case of mandamus (Civil Case No. 21227)&nbsp; be returned to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; for trial and final disposition, without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
