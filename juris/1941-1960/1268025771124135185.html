				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">On July 18, 1952, respondent Juan Santos filed an application with the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission (.Case No. 67556)&nbsp; for a certificate of public convenience to operate a TPU-service on the line and territory of Adela&nbsp; to Upper Mangyan via&nbsp; San Jose&nbsp; and&nbsp; Mangarin,&nbsp; Mindoro&nbsp;&nbsp; (now Occidental&nbsp; Mindoro), with the&nbsp; use of 10 units.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application was heard on November 5, 1952 with no opposition from any&nbsp; one, and&nbsp; at the hearing, respondent Santos testified that there were as yet no authorized operators on the&nbsp; line applied for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, no&nbsp; action was&nbsp; taken on the&nbsp; application,&nbsp; and it lay dormant until 1955.<p>Subsequently, on August 20, 1954,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Fidel&nbsp; del Rosario was granted&nbsp; by the Commission in its&nbsp; Case No. 79719 a certificate of public convenience valid for 25 years to operate&nbsp; a TPU-service in Occidental Mindoro,&nbsp; with the use of three unite on the line of Adela-Central-Camihauit and&nbsp; vice-versa, and two units on the line Caminauit Pandurucan-Mangyan&nbsp; and vice-versa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner later filed another&nbsp; application for authority&nbsp; to operate additional trips along the same lines&nbsp; with the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; 10 more units (Case No. 81392), which was approved by the Commission on November 20, 1954 for "7 auto&nbsp; trucks only instead of 10,"&nbsp; although&nbsp; it found that&nbsp; petitioner was "financially capable of&nbsp; purchasing&nbsp; the ten trucks applied for".</p><p>On July 19, 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission rendered&nbsp; judgment on the&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; application of respondent Juan Santos&nbsp; (Case No. 67556), granting him a certificate of public convenience to operate two auto-trucks along&nbsp; the line Adela-Upper Mangyan via San Jose and Mangarin and vice-versa in Occidental&nbsp; Mindoro for a period of&nbsp; five years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning of this&nbsp; decision, petitioner Del Rosario filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Commission on August&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1955 a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration thereof and&nbsp; for reopening of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case to be given opportunity to oppose the application of Santos.&nbsp; In said motion&nbsp; for reconsideration, petitioner,&nbsp; alleged that&nbsp; his present&nbsp; service of 12 units and 1 reserve along&nbsp; the same lines applied for by Santos was sufficient,&nbsp; adequate, and&nbsp; Satisfactory; that&nbsp; the authority given to&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; to operate 2 units along the same lines would result in ruinous competition to petitioner; and that the application of respondent Santos was granted without&nbsp; notice to petitioner and on the basis of testimony given before&nbsp; petitioner had been authorized to&nbsp; operate a total&nbsp; of 12&nbsp; units on&nbsp; the lines applied for&nbsp; by Santos.&nbsp; Petitioner Del Rosario&nbsp; also opposed Santos 'petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; substitution of&nbsp; his former&nbsp; equipment which "were no longer serviceable" with new and&nbsp; better equipment.</p><p>After hearing the arguments of both parties, the&nbsp; Commission issued on September&nbsp; 19, 1955 an&nbsp; order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; motion for reconsideration and reopening of&nbsp; Case No. 67556 on the grounds that at the time the application of respondent Santos was filed, heard, and submitted, petitioner had not yet .been granted a certificate of&nbsp; public convenience; that the Commission's decision granting the application of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Santos took into consideration its&nbsp; own records regarding petitioner's service on the&nbsp; same lines; and that the certificate granted to respondent Santos was only for five years, without extension of&nbsp; line or increase of equipment or trips.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; same&nbsp; order, the Commission granted Santos' petition for substitution of equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this order petitioner Fidel del&nbsp; Rosario appealed to this court by petition for review.</p><p>Considering the radical change of conditions that occurred during the pendency of&nbsp; the application of Santos,&nbsp; after it was heard in 1952, due&nbsp; to petitioner subsequent operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; his own&nbsp; line,&nbsp; and the need of&nbsp; protecting established&nbsp; operators and of avoiding&nbsp; the cutthroat competition whenever possible, in order that the&nbsp; service to the public may not suffer (Batangas Transportation Co. <em>vs</em>. Bi√±an Transportation supra,&nbsp; p. 934),&nbsp; we are of the opinion that the&nbsp; petitioner should be given ample opportunity to substantiate his&nbsp; objection against the&nbsp; authority granted to&nbsp; Santos.&nbsp; While the Commission stated in order appealed from that it has taken into&nbsp; account petitioner's service on the same lines, there may be relevant facts, though not on the record,&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner may&nbsp; introduce in&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and which the&nbsp; Commission was not able&nbsp; to consider&nbsp; or to which it might have given the wrong emphasis.</p><p>The orders of July 9 and September 19, 1955,&nbsp; appealed from are&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set aside, and the records&nbsp; ordered remanded&nbsp; with instructions for the&nbsp; Commission to reopen the proceedings and grant to the petitioner,&nbsp; Fidel del Rosario, opportunity to be heard and&nbsp; to substantiate his objections&nbsp; against the proposed&nbsp; service of respondent Juan Santos.&nbsp; Cost against the latter.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
