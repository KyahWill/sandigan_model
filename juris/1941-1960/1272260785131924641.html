				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is certified to this Court by the Court of Appeals upon the ground that the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue.  The supposed questions of jurisdiction are, <i>first</i>, whether or not there is sufficient evidence to show that the protestant  has duly filed his certificate  of candidacy, and second, whether the trial court has or has  no authority to pass upon the validity of the ballots adjudicated to the protestant which have not  been challenged  by  the  protestee in his counter-protest.<br><br>Article VIII, section 2, No. 3, of the Constitution confers upon the  Supreme Court jurisdiction over  "all cases in which the jurisdiction  of any trial court is  in issue."  Section 138, No. 3,  of the  Revised Administrative  Code  as amended  by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 3 and 259, provides that the Supreme Court shall  have appellate jurisdiction over "all cases in which the jurisdiction of any inferior court is in  issue."  It has been held that the word "jurisdiction" as  used  in the constitutions and  in  the  statutes "means jurisdiction as to the subject-matter only,  unless an exception arises by reason  of its employment in a broader sense."   (15 C. J.  735; Johnson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Wells, 91 Fed.  1; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Lee, 84 Fed. 626; Vinal <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Continental Constr., etc. Co., 34 Fed.  228; Starnes <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Mutual  Loan  etc., Co., 102 Ga. 597; 29 SE 452.)  There is in our  Constitution or in the law aforecited  nothing  which  may lend the  word "jurisdiction" therein used a broader  meaning than jurisdiction over the subject-matter.   On the contrary,  having due regard to the manifest purpose of the law, which is to confine the  appellate jurisdiction  of this  Court to cases of vital importance involving questions  of fundamental char- acter,  such,  for instance, as the question of validity of statute, treaty or ordinance,  or the legality of any tax, import or assessment which may affect the  very existence of the government, or criminal cases wherein life  imprisonment or death penalty is imposed, we are  of the opinion, and so hold, that the issue of jurisdiction which confers appellate powers upon this Court in a given case is not such question as  is dependent exclusively upon  minor matters of fact or upon a mere construction of the pleadings, but that which  has reference to the more important question of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject-matter as determined by law.<br><br>Jurisdiction over the subject-matter is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong (C. J. S., p. 36) and is conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the  court and defines its powers  (Banco Espafiol Filipino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Palanca, 37 Phil. 921; Perkins  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Dizon, 40  Off. Gaz.  No. 7, 3d  Sup. p. 216; Ng Si Chok <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Vera, G. R. No. 45674).   The question, therefore, of whether a  court has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, calls for interpretation and application of the law of jurisdiction which distributes the judicial power among the different courts in the Philippines, and since the ruling on the matter is of far-reaching consequences, affecting, as it may, the very life and  structure of our judicial system, the  law has deemed it wise to place the power and authority to act thereon in the highest court of the land. In the instant case, there is no such question of jurisdiction as above described.  Both parties agree that if  the due filing of the protestant's certificate of candidacy is proven, the trial court has jurisdiction, but that if such fact is not proven the trial court has no jurisdiction  except to dismiss the case.  There is, therefore, no  question between the parties as to what the jurisdiction of  the trial court is according to law in either case.  The real question between them is one of fact—whether or not the protestant's certificate of candidacy has been duly filed.  And not until this fact is proved can the question of jurisdiction be determined. Neither is the second question one of jurisdiction within the purview of the legal provisions above quoted.  Whether certain ballots  are or are not pertinent to the issue  raised in the pleadings, is merely  a question  of relevancy of evidence.  It may be true that the court by an erroneous ruling on such question may encroach upon issues completely foreign to those defined in the pleadings, but in such  case the question of  jurisdiction that may arise  would not be  one of jurisdiction over the subject-matter but of jurisdiction over the issue.  In order that a court may validly try and  decide a case, it must have jurisdiction over the subject-matter and jurisdiction over the persons of the parties.  (Banco Espafiol Filipino <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Palanca, 37  Phil. 921; Perkins <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Dizon, 40 Off. Gaz. No. 7, 3d Sup. p. 216.)  But in some instances it is said that the court should also have jurisdiction over the issue (15 C. J. 734; Hutts <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Martin, 134 Ind. 587, 33 N.E. 676), meaning thereby that the issue being tried and decided by  the court be within the issues raised in the pleadings.  But this kind of jurisdiction should be distinguished from jurisdiction over the subject-matter, the latter being conferred by law and the former  by the pleadings. Jurisdiction over the issue, unlike jurisdiction over the subject-matter, may be conferred by consent either express or implied of the  parties.  (Rule 17,  sec.  4, Rules of Court.) Although an issue is not duly pleaded it may validly be tried and decided if  no timely  objection is made thereto by the parties.  This  cannot be  done when jurisdiction over the subject-matter  is involved.  In truth, jurisdiction over the issue is  an expression  of a principle  that is involved in jurisdiction over the persons of the parties. Where, for instance,  an  issue is not duly pleaded in the complaint, the defendant cannot be said  to have been  served with process as to that issue.  (Cf. Atkins etc. Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Domingo, 44 Phil. 680).  At any rate, whether or not the court has jurisdiction over a specific issue is a question that requires nothing except an  examination of the  pleadings, and  this  function is without  such importance as to call for the intervention of this Court.<br><br>Furthermore,  this question of jurisdiction is unsubstantial.  It is a well-settled rule that the institution of suffrage is of  public, not private, interest,  and the court may examine all the ballots after the ballot boxes are opened in order to determine which are legal and which are illegal, even though neither of the parties raised  any question as to their illegality.  (Yalung <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Atienza, 52 Phil. 781; Cecilio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Tomacruz, 62 Phil. 689; Cosculluela <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Gaston, 63 Phil. 41).<br><br>Wherefore, this case is hereby remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.J.,  Abad Santos,  Diaz,  Horritteno</span>,  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ozaeta, JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Laurel, J.</span>, concurs in the result.</div>
