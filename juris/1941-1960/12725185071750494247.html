				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the Philippine Veterans Board from a decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, Judge Gavino S. Abaya presiding, ordering the board to&nbsp; release Treasury Warrant&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2773868&nbsp; for P1,253.23 and the treasury warrants covering the subsequent monthly pension payments corresponding to petitioner Paula&nbsp; Aquino Policarpio, "as granted to her by law".<p>The facts&nbsp; are not controverted.&nbsp; The appellee was the widow of a member&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Armed Forces killed in action in&nbsp; 1942; upon&nbsp; her&nbsp; application&nbsp; duly&nbsp; approved, she was granted&nbsp; a monthly pension by the appellant Board.&nbsp; The pension&nbsp; was&nbsp; stopped&nbsp; in&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1948 because&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow received a similar&nbsp; pension from U. S. Veterans Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the latter&nbsp; certified&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appellant that&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow had&nbsp; ceased receiving her&nbsp; pension from the&nbsp; U S.&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; since&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; where-upon, in&nbsp; February 11, 1953, petitioner Policarpio applied to appellant for the&nbsp; resumption of her&nbsp; former pension. On February 28,&nbsp; 1953, the Secretary of the Philippine Veterans Board issued a&nbsp; memorandum that&nbsp; petitioner's pension&nbsp; was resumed effective January 30,&nbsp; 1951;&nbsp; and in view&nbsp; thereof the auditor caused treasury warrants to be&nbsp; prepared in favor&nbsp; of the widow.&nbsp; Delivery&nbsp; of&nbsp; the warrants was,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; subsequently stopped, for&nbsp; the reason that the appellant&nbsp; Board "had&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; granted the restoration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner's pension".</p><p>On the' basis of&nbsp; such facts, and in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; refusal of the board officers&nbsp; to release the warrants, petitioner Policarpio applied&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance for a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; mandamus to compel their&nbsp; release.&nbsp;&nbsp; In its&nbsp; answer the board specifically pleaded that the&nbsp; preparation of the warrants was ordered by mistake, because Policarpio's&nbsp; petition&nbsp; had not been&nbsp; as&nbsp; yet&nbsp; acted upon by&nbsp; the Board.</p><p>Submitted on the facts alleged, by agreement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties the court below decreed the issuance of the writ complained of&nbsp; on&nbsp; the basis thatâ€”</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"The fact that the Secretary has signed the memorandum for the chairman&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; board restoring petitioner's pension,&nbsp; and the further fact&nbsp; that said check has been drawn&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; such memorandum&nbsp; are sufficient reasons to justify&nbsp; the release of the same in payment of petitioner's accumulated pension".&nbsp; (Rec. p. 45)</blockquote><p>The decision&nbsp; is untenable.&nbsp; It being an established&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; resumption of the pension had not yet been approved by the&nbsp; Veterans Board, the memorandum of the Secretary and the preparation of the warrants&nbsp; were obviously unauthorized,&nbsp; and the taking of such action proves nothing&nbsp; but that the error or lack of authority was not discovered' until later, as shown&nbsp; by the subsequent withholding of&nbsp; the&nbsp; warrants.</p><p>It was improper to&nbsp; compel&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; of the warrants, because the Board might, in the exercise of it&amp; discretion, refuse to&nbsp; restore petitioner's&nbsp; pension;&nbsp; and even if its refusal should be wrongful or&nbsp; erroneous, the court could not properly intervene until the appellee-petitioner should have exhausted her administrative remedies.&nbsp;&nbsp; (De la Paz <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Alcaraz, supra, p. 130; Miguel&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Vda. de Reyes, 93 Phil., 542.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the court below should have limited itself to ordering the Board to take action upon Policarpio's petition that her pension payments be resumed.</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"* *&nbsp; * And it is a well-settled rule&nbsp; that&nbsp; mandamus&nbsp; does not lie to review or control&nbsp; the action or decision of a pension board or other board or officer having&nbsp; authority over&nbsp; pension matters, where&nbsp; the action or decision is one resting&nbsp; in&nbsp; the discretion of such board or officer, or where it involves the construction of the law&nbsp; and the application&nbsp; of the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; thereto. * * * Where&nbsp; a pension board or officer simply refuses to take any action whatever, the court&nbsp; will issue a mandamus&nbsp; to compel it or him to take some action, but will not attempt to prescribe the&nbsp; action to be taken and thereby control the discretion&nbsp; or&nbsp; judgment of the board or officer.&nbsp; * * *" '(40 Am.&nbsp; Jur.&nbsp; pp. 993, 994).</blockquote><p>The decision appealed from is modified in&nbsp; the sense of merely requiring the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; Philippine Veterans Board to act without delay upon the application of February 11, 1953 for the restoration&nbsp; of&nbsp; pension benefits to appellee Paula, Aquino Policarpio.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista. Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endenda,</em>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
