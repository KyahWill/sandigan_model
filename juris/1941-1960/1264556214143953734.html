				G.R. No. L-1878, March 09, 1949</h4>
				<H3>MAMERTO RAMIREZ ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FIDEL IBAÑEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LAGUNA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Petitioners allege in substance the following:
<p align="justify">That Rev. P. Leo A. Cullum has instigated N.V. Sinclair to 
disregard and violate the provisions of Act 3, Title 26, Book 1 of the 
<i>Novisima Recopilacion</i> which provided for the expulsion from the 
Philippines of the priests of the Company of Jesus and the confiscation of their 
properties and temporalities and their incorporation to the Crom, and that 
according to said provisions, put into effect by the <i>Real Cedula</i> of Queen 
Isabel II, dated October 19, 1852, the said priests are perpetually prohibited 
from recovering said properties which include the lands now known as the San 
Pedro Tunasan Estate in the municipality of San Pedro, Laguna;</p>
<p align="justify">That N.V. Sinclair, under the name of "El Colegio de San 
Jose," which failed in 1915 to register as a unipersonal corporation, instituted 
in the Court of First Instance of Laguna on December 10, 1947, an action against 
53 persons for the recovery of the sum of P433,307.61 as alleged rents in 
arrears due before the war from the properties involved in this case;</p>
<p align="justify">That no one of petitioners is a defendant in said action, civil 
case No. 9039, and that petitioners are exclusive owners of their respective 
lands in the municipality of San Pedro, and that their crops of palay in said 
parcels are not litigated in said case;</p>
<p align="justify">That the new complaint, based on a decision previously rendered 
in civil case No. 6663 against several residents of San Pedro, has been filed 
with malice, in violation of Section 6 of Rule 39, Rules of Court—which requires 
the filing of a new action based on the original claim—with knowledge of 
plaintiff that the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter, that the 
money claim falls under the law of moratorium, and after the cause of action 
based on case No. 6663 was renounced in favor of the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines by Rev. John F. Hurley (then the Superior of the Company of Jesus), 
in a public document executed on September 27, 1939;</p>
<p align="justify">That said Rev. Leo F. Cullum and N.V. Sinclair, secured on 
December 10, 1947, thru misrepresentation, the appointment <i>ex parte</i> as 
receiver of respondent Segundo Mastrili, who, since December 15, 1947, with the 
assistance of officers and soldiers of the military police, have prohibited 
petitioners from gathering and taking a single grain of their crop of palay, 
from picking any fruit from their trees, and from plowing or sowing any part of 
their lands without the permission of said receiver, to the extent of detaining 
without judicial warrant Ricardo Gerodias and Florencio Ambayec, of maltreating 
Enrique Marcellana and causing contusions to Marcos Vierneza due to blows 
inflicted on several parts of his body;</p>
<p align="justify">That as a result, about 3,500 cavanes of palay have been 
exposed to destruction by the elements of nature and of being eaten by bird and 
field animals;</p>
<p align="justify">That the MP officers and soldiers assisting the receiver have 
been acting under the command of Brigadier General Castañeda and on orders of 
the Secretary of Justice;</p>
<p align="justify">That instead of stopping the acts of the other respondents, the 
respondent judge issued on December 16, 1947, an order requiring the persons 
mentioned in the charge dated December 15, 1947, to appear in court on December 
22, 1947, for an investigation of charges for contempt; and,</p>
<p align="justify">That should said order be allowed to continue in force, the 
petitioners and their respective families will be put in danger of enduring 
hunger, other sufferings and irreparable damages due to the acts of 
respondents.</p>
<p align="justify">As remedies, petitioners pray that, not being parties in civil 
case No. 9039, they be not held amenable to any order that may be issued in said 
case, and that respondents be ordered not to interfere with or prevent 
petitioners from harvesting their crops of palay in their respective lands.</p>
<p align="justify">Attached to the petition is a copy of the summons in case No. 
9039 and of the order of December 10, 1947, appointing Segundo C. Mastrili as 
receiver to take possession of the properties and improvements involved in case 
No. 6663 (Jose H. Guevara, et al. vs. Carlos Young, et al.) whose judgment is 
sought to be revived in said case, and also a copy of the complaint in case No. 
9039.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners having prayed for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction, respondents opposed the prayer alleging:</p>
<p align="justify">That there is no urgency for the issuance of said writ of 
preliminary injunction because the crops are being harvested by the tenants 
under the supervision of the receiver, and those already harvested, constitute 
only one sixth of the total estimated crops, as the remaining five sixths are 
not yet ready for harvest;</p>
<p align="justify">That the laborers or harvesters receive their share right in 
the field immediately after the harvest, while the shares of the tenants or 
lessees could not as yet be delivered because the palay has to be stacked and 
dried and said shares are usually delivered after the threshing, sometime during 
the months of February and March;</p>
<p align="justify">That in case No. 6663, the judgment of which is sought to be 
revived, a receiver has also been appointed.</p>
<p align="justify">That the Colegio de San Jose did not transfer to the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines its rights to the judgment in its favor in civil 
case No. 6663 with respect to the agricultural lands which are now the subject 
of controversy, but only its rights therein pertaining to the portion of the 
hacienda used as homesites;</p>
<p align="justify">That since the judgment in case No. 6663 sought to be revived 
orders the ejectment of the defendants due to their default in the payment of 
the annual rentals, and the sum of P433,307.61 mentioned in the complaint 
represents rents prior to liberation, and the rents from December, 1945 
amounting to P90,000, the subject matter is not within the purview of the 
moratorium; and,</p>
<p align="justify">That the petition for the issuance of a writ of prohibition is 
premature because the motion for reconsideration of the order appointing the 
receiver is still pending resolution by respondent judge.</p>
<p align="justify">On January 13, 1948, this Court allowed the intervention in 
this case as co-petitioners of 75 other persons.</p>
<p align="justify">On March 22, 1948, by majority resolution, this Court denied 
petitioners' prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>
<p align="justify">This case was heard on the merits in Baguio on May 19, 1948, at 
which hearing the parties submitted a written agreement which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Ambas partes convienen:</p>
<p align="justify">"El depositario retendra los 30 por ciento de la cosecha 
(sujeto a las ordenes del Juzgado, la cosecha liquida sera retenida por el 
depositario) y dejara los 70 por ciento como participacion del aparcero al que 
labran actualmente el terreno. Y los que actualmente laborean el terreno 
continuaran trabajandolo su respective parcela, bajo la administracion, 
supervision y control del depositario, entendiendose sin embargo que todo aqui 
constatado no afectara el resultado del asunto pendiente en el Juzgado de 
primera instancia de Laguna; y ambas partes firmaran un recibo en duplicado de 
la participacion que ha recibido cada uno.</p>
</blockquote><p style="margin-left: 80px;" align="justify">"Baguio, Mayo 19, 1948.</p><blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;" align="justify">"Conforme:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 120px;">
<p align="justify">"(Fdo.) JUAN S. RUSTIA </p>
<p align="justify">"(Fdo.) MANUEL A. CALANOG </p>
<p align="justify">"(Fdo.) DEOGRACIAS REYES </p>
<p align="justify">"(Fdo.) JOSE M. LUISON </p>
<p align="justify">"(Fdo.) ROBERTO GUIANZON"</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On April 8, 1948, petitioners filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the resolution of this Court of March 22, 1948, which denied 
the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. That motion was kept under 
advisement to be considered upon the decision of the case on the merits.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners also filed a petition on August 7, 1948, praying 
that respondents be enjoined from acting on a petition filed with the Court of 
First Instance of Laguna by the receiver for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction to prohibit Attorney Rustia and the mayor of San Pedro, 
Laguna, as well as all their attorneys, agents, employees, privies and/or 
representatives from going into the fields under the administration of the 
receiver, and in a resolution of August 13, 1948, this Court ordered that said 
petition be acted upon when the case is decided on the merits.</p>
<p align="justify">Because all the questions involved in this case have been 
practically disposed of by the resolution of this Court dated March 22, 1948, 
the same is reproduced here-under, together with the dissenting opinion of the 
writer of this decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The 'Reiteracion de la Peticion de Interdicto Prohibitorio 
Preliminar' filed by counsel for petitioners in L-1873, Ramirez et al. vs. Judge 
Ibañez, et al., is denied, it appearing that respondent Judge had given the 
parties a chance to be heard on the question of privity and identity of the 
land, and that, instead of arguing at the hearing, the present case was 
immediately brought here. Mr. Justice Perfecto dissented in a separate 
opinion.</p></blockquote>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>"PERFECTO, J.:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The fact that due course has been given to this case is an 
evidence that, upon the pleadings, this Court has found that the petition is 
meritorious. Otherwise, this Court would have dismissed the petition from the 
very beginning, without causing respondents the trouble of appearing and showing 
their side of the question.</p>
<p align="justify">"Upon the above premise, the wit of preliminary injunction 
prayed by petitioners appears to be necessary so as to save petitioners from 
further irreparable damages.</p>
<p align="justify">"Petitioners' contention that they have never been a party in 
the original case, upon the decision of which the receivership proceedings 
through which they are being deprived of the products of their labor, the crops 
that cost them time, effort, work, capital, is based, appears to be well taken 
and fully supported by the very pleadings in the lower court. It will be 
extremely unjust not to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, and to condemn them to 
starvation Tantalian wise, at the very sight of the crops they raised, even to 
touch which they are prohibited by the physical force at respondents' 
command.</p>
<p align="justify">"Respondents' plight appears to be more pitiable by the 
attitude shown by respondents at the hearing of this case, in which the receiver 
made the express commitment to allow petitioners to take their respective crops 
upon condition that they will furnish the receiver data as to the amount of said 
crops for record purposes. Petitioners accepted the condition, and the parties 
were allowed to withdraw from the hearing so as to put in writing the verbal 
agreement made before us. When both parties submitted their pleadings on 
February 16, 1948, the very date of the hearing, the receiver appeared to have 
backed out from the agreement, disregarding completely the commitment made 
before us in open court. This showing of bad faith should not be ignored by the 
Supreme Court nor rewarded by a denial of the petition for a writ of preliminary 
injunction.</p>
<p align="justify">"It has been said repeatedly that party litigants must appear 
before the courts of justice with clean hands to deserve hearing and remedy. In 
this case, the respondent receiver has appeared before us with hands tainted 
with bad faith, and the victims of the dirty trick, wantonly performed before 
our own eyes, are deprived of the remedy they are entitled to.</p>
<p align="justify">"We dissent from the majority resolution."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The main purpose of petitioners in this case is to enjoin 
respondents from depriving said petitioners of the possession of the lands 
claimed by them and of the crops therein, involved in the receivership in case 
No. 9039, upon the main theory that petitioners are not parties to said case nor 
parties or privies of the parties in case No. 6663, whose judgment is intended 
to be revived in case No. 9039.</p>
<p align="justify">The majority of this Court are of opinion that, before 
petitioners can seek any remedy from this Court, they must wait for the final 
action of respondent judge on the two questions, namely, as to whether or not 
petitioners are privies of the defendants in cases Nos. 6663 and 9039 of the 
lower court, and as to the identity of the lands in question in said cases, it 
appearing that respondent judge had given the petitioners a chance to be heard 
on said questions.</p>
<p align="justify">For all the foregoing, with the writer of this opinion 
dissenting, the petition is dismissed, with costs. In view of this result, the 
two pending incidental petitions are also denied.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, 
JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Paras, J.</i>, concurs in the result.<br><i>Feria, 
J.</i>, concurs in the dismissal of the petition.</p>
