				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is certiorari and mandamus filed against the Commissioner of Civil Service, and the Mayor and the Municipal Board of the City of Manila, to. obtain a ruling that petitioner's reinstatement as&nbsp; police lieutenant of&nbsp; Manila is obligatory upon the respondent Mayor.<p>In&nbsp; 1941&nbsp; Adriano B. Velasquez was a lieutenant&nbsp; of the Manila police when he was accused, and convicted together with&nbsp; policeman Federico Barba of the crime of extortion; he began serving his twenty-year sentence on August 18, 1944, but he was liberated by the guerrillas on February 13, 1945; he asked&nbsp; for reinstatement on March&nbsp; 3, 1945, but the Provost Marshall of the U. S. Army,&nbsp; then acting" as Chief of Police denied his request;&nbsp; his subsequent requests for&nbsp; re-appointment were likewise refused;&nbsp; then on&nbsp; August 24,&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp; Federico Barba&nbsp; who had been accused and&nbsp; convicted like herein&nbsp; petitioner, re-entered the police force; this gave Velasquez some hopes, so in January 1954 he began mandamus proceedings to compel the Mayor to re-appoint him as police&nbsp; lieutenant,&nbsp; maintaining the theory that it was the latter's duty to reinstate him under Executive&nbsp; Order No. 223 dated September 25, 1939, which reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"A person who has served six months&nbsp; or less in the Philippines Civil Service may be reinstated as a probationer within&nbsp; a period of one year following&nbsp; his separation from the service under the former appointment; *&nbsp; * * and&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; person who has served five years&nbsp; or more may be reinstated within ten&nbsp; years from the daite of his separation from the service."</p></blockquote><p>The Manila court of first instance,&nbsp; and this Court on appeal (G. R. No- L-7730, August 1954)&nbsp; found the mandamus petition to be without merit, not only because under the terms of said Order,&nbsp; reinstatement <em>was discretionary,</em> but also because the&nbsp; said Order did&nbsp; not apply to him; inasmuch as he had been separated&nbsp; from the service for cause:<em> his twenty-year sentence.</em></p><p>A few months later,&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; Velasquez started this&nbsp; second&nbsp; attempt to return to duty; and obviously in an effort&nbsp; to evade the&nbsp; doctrine of<em> res judicata</em> "chose a different theory" and included, as new defendants&nbsp; the Commissioner of Civil Service and the Municipal Boards However, as thev Solicitor General&nbsp; and the City&nbsp; Fiscal suggest,&nbsp; a party may not renew a&nbsp; litigation by the expedieht of simply joining new parties.&nbsp; And the controversy here&nbsp; is the same&nbsp; as in G. R-&nbsp; No. L-7730: does&nbsp; Velasquez have the right to go back to his job?</p><p>Our decision, in August said no: he&nbsp; had no right to compel reinstatement.&nbsp; It is alleged&nbsp; however that in this&nbsp; petition a new issue—not squarely debated in the former case—is&nbsp; presently raised: illegality&nbsp; of petitioner's&nbsp; separation from his position&nbsp; as police&nbsp; lieutenant.&nbsp; Even if the point had not been&nbsp; discussed&nbsp; then,&nbsp; still" the principle of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> applies,&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; the&nbsp; point&nbsp; could and should have&nbsp; been asserted then and&nbsp; there.&nbsp; At that time petitioner claimed he should be taken back because he had a right to be reinstated.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could and should have added i because he had been illegally separated from the service.</p><p>The doctrine is, that a final judgment is conclusive not only as to every matter which was offered to sustain the petitioner's claim or demand, <em>but also as to any other ad' missible matter</em> which might&nbsp; have been offered for that purpose.&nbsp; Pefialosa <em>vs.</em> Tuason, 22 Phil.,&nbsp; 303, 312; Philippine National Bank <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Barreto,&nbsp; 52&nbsp; Phil., 818, 824,&nbsp; (<em>See</em> Moran Comments under&nbsp; section 45 Rule 39.)&nbsp; The&nbsp; party is bound by the previous decision, even if his cause "had not been&nbsp; properly ventilated" by his former counsel who failed to see and develop a pertinent issue.</p><p>Of course, this is&nbsp; not&nbsp; an implied&nbsp; admission that&nbsp; if petitioner's&nbsp; cause were examined&nbsp; anew in&nbsp; the light&nbsp; of arguments&nbsp; advanced by his&nbsp; new counsel, he would have a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it is not necessary to go over the same grounds, considering our views expressed thru Mr.&nbsp; Justice Labrador in a recent decision:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"If an employee is illegally&nbsp; dismissed, he&nbsp; may conform to&nbsp; such illegal dismissal or acquiesce therein, or by his inaction and&nbsp; by sleeping on&nbsp; his&nbsp; rights he&nbsp; may&nbsp; in law&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as having abandoned the office to&nbsp; which&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; entitled to be&nbsp; reinstated. These defenses are valid defenses to an action for reinstatement. * * *&nbsp; </p><p>We hold that in view of the&nbsp; policy&nbsp; of the State contained in the law fixing the period of one year within which&nbsp; actions for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> may be justified,&nbsp; any.person claiming right to a position in the civil&nbsp; service should also be required to file his petition for reinstatement within the period of one year, otherwise he is thereby considered as having abandoned his office."&nbsp; (Unabia <em>vs.</em> City Mayor, supra, p. 253)</p></blockquote><p>According to appellant, he&nbsp; was removed by the then Acting Chief of Police&nbsp; on March 3, 1945; but he&nbsp; applied to the courts&nbsp; for&nbsp; reinstatement only in January&nbsp; 1954, after nine&nbsp; years.&nbsp; He waited too long.</p><p>The Manila&nbsp; court's order dismissing this&nbsp; second petition should therefore be&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
