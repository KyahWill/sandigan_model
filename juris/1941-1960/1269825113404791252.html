				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> During the pendency of Special Proceedings No. 9086 in the 
Branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided by Judge Tiburcio 
Tancinco, wherein Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo is suing out a writ of habeas 
corpus, directed to Mother Superior M. Margolari, F.M.M. (the petitioner in the 
case before us) to produce the body of Philomena Agudo before said court, 
because it is alleged that she is being detained and deprived of her liberty by 
said Mother Superior, and that the custody of Philomena Agudo be given to 
Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo, on September 2, 1949, the court Issued a writ 
addressed to the Sheriff of Manila, commanding the latter to produce the body of 
said Philomena Agudo and to summon the respondent Mother Superior M. Margolari 
of the Saint Anthony's Institution, to appear likewise before the court issuing 
the said order.
<p align="justify">At the hearing of said case and upon receiving the testimony of 
Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo, on September 8, 1949, the court issued an order in 
the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In the interest of equity and pending the final determination 
of this proceedings, the Sheriff of the City of Manila is hereby directed to 
take immediately from the care of Mother M. Margolari. Mother Superior of St. 
Anthony's Institution the body of Philomena Agudo and to deliver the said 
Philomena Agudo to the care and custody of the Social Welfare Commissioner, 
Manila.</p>
<p align="justify">"The expenses incident to Philomena's stay in the above named 
Institution shall, be borne by the petitioner herein. A representative of the 
Social Welfare Commissioner shall accompany Philomena Agudo to this Court at the 
next hearing of this case on September 14, 1949 at 8:00 o'clock in the 
morning.</p>
<p align="justify">"It is also ordered that any interested party or parties in 
this case may be allowed to visit Philomena at the Social Welfare Commission at 
any appropriate time of the day."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In an urgent motion, counsel for Mother M. Margolari moved for 
the reconsideration of said order of September 8, 1949, on the ground that: (1) 
There is no necessity for Philomena Agudo to be placed under the care and 
custody of the Social Welfare Commissioner; the respondent is placing Philomena 
Agudo at the disposal of the court, for which purpose she was offering to post a 
bond of P1,000 to guaranty Philomena Agudo's appearance at any time she is 
needed by the court. (2) Philomena Agudo, being of age and with sufficient 
discretion to decide where it is best for her to stay, does not want to leave 
the Saint Anthony's Institution. (3) She fears, that if she is taken out from 
the Saint Anthony's Institution, she may be physically molested and harassed, 
(4) She is a strong willed girl who can not be influenced by anybody, and having 
made up her mind to embrace the religious life, not even her own mother can 
prevail upon her to give up her intention; on the other hand, if she did not 
wish to take up the religious life, neither the respondent Mother M. Margolari 
nor anyone else can prevail upon her to embrace such life. And (5) in an 
affidavit attached to this record as Annex F, Philomena Agudo declared that she 
is a postulant in the Saint Anthony's Institution of her own free will and 
volition and not due to force, duress or intimidation or undue influence on the 
part of anybody, and that she is staying in that institution voluntarily and 
deliberately and has "not authorized" her "mother or anybody" to file the habeas 
corpus petition, and therefore repudiates such move to take her away from the 
convent, "as contrary to her desire and wishes and she is happy and content in 
the convent."</p>
<p align="justify">It is further stated in the motion for reconsideration that 
sometime in February, 1948, she had applied for admission as a postulant in the 
Saint Anthony's Institution and was admitted only sometime in June, 1949. During 
the intervening period of about one year and four months, between her 
application and admission, "she had every chance and opportunity to deliberate 
and decide whether she should take up the religious life or not." The fact 
that—the motion for reconsideration concludes—"she was not immediately accepted 
also proves that no undue and improper influence had been brought to bear upon 
her by the respondent; otherwise, said postulant would have been immediately 
admitted."</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel, therefore, prayed that the order issued by the court 
"placing Philomena Agudo under the care and custody of the Social Welfare 
Commissioner and/or the Welfareville pending the trial of the instant 
proceedings be reconsidered, and that she be allowed to continue staying in the 
Saint Anthony's Institution."</p>
<p align="justify">After consideration of the motion of the respondent, the court 
denied the same and maintained its order of September 8, 1949. The court ruled, 
however, that "in view of the oral manifestation of counsel for the respondent 
that he will institute the necessary proceedings with the Supreme Court 
impugning the validity of this Court's order of September 8, 1949, the Sheriff 
of the City of Manila is hereby ordered to hold in abeyance, for a period of one 
day only, from the date the respondent is notified hereof, the execution of said 
order of September 8, 1949."</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel then filed on behalf of Mother M. Margolari, a petition 
for certiorari with prohibition and preliminary injunction praying this Court to 
issue an order requiring the court below to certify to this court the record of 
case No. 9086, particularly the orders of September 8 and 12, 1949, so that the 
same may be reviewed by us; to issue a writ of preliminary injunction after the 
necessary bond has been filed, restraining the Honorable Tiburcio Tancinco, 
Judge of the 5th Branch of the Court of First Instance and Macario Ofilada, 
ex-oficio Sheriff of the City of Manila, from executing and enforcing the 
aforementioned orders of September 8 and 12, 1949, and after hearing the parties 
to render a decision declaring said orders of September 8 and 12, 1949, "to be 
null and void, and forever restraining the respondent judge and sheriff from 
enforcing or executing the same, and permitting Philomena Agudo to stay or live 
where she may choose during the pendency of the habeas corpus proceedings in the 
Court below."</p>
<p align="justify">Predicated on the above, the question brought before us for our 
determination is whether or not the court below has acted illegally and with 
abuse of discretion in issuing the above-quoted order of September 8, 1949, 
taking Philomena Agudo from the care of M. Margolari, Mother Superior of Saint 
Anthony's Institution and committing her to the care and custody of the Social 
Welfare Commissioner.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo argues that, pursuant 
to Section 12 of Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, the respondent judge has the 
power to issue the order of September 8, for the safekeeping of the person of 
Philomena Agudo. Said Section 12 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 12. <i>Hearing on return</i>. <i>Adjournments</i>.—When 
the writ is returned before one judge, at a time when the court is in session, 
he may forthwith adjourn the case into the court, there to be heard and 
determined. The court or judge before whom the writ is returned or adjourned 
must immediately proceed to hear and examine the return, and such other matters 
as are properly submitted for consideration, unless for good cause shown the 
hearing is adjourned, in nhich event the court or judge shall make such order 
for the safekeeping of the person imprisoned or restrained as the nature of the 
case requires. If the person imprisoned or restrained is not produced because of 
his alleged sickness or infirmity, the court or judge must be satisfied that it 
is so grave that such person cannot be produced without danger, before 
proceeding to hear and dispose of the matter. On the hearing the court or judge 
shall disregard matters of form and technicalities in respect to any warrant or 
order of commitment of a court or officer authorized to commit by 
law."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The facts which gave rise to these proceedings, examined in the 
light of the clear provisions of the above-quoted rule, evidently lead us to the 
conclusion that the order in question can find no support in the letter or 
spirit thereof. Philomena Agudo is in no need of protection or safekeeping. Her 
personal safety not being in danger, and inasmuch as she is safe in the convent 
where she is now, the order complained of is without basis.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition is, therefore, granted. No pronouncement is made as to 
costs.</p>

<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><b>CONCURRING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>OZAETA, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">Concurring in the result of the majority decision, I wish to 
record the mental processes by which I arrived at my own conclusion:</p>
<p align="justify">The main case pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila 
out of which this incident arose is a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by 
Mrs. Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo to recover the rightful custody of her 
24-year-old daughter Philomena Agudo which is alleged to be withheld from her by 
the therein respondent (petitioner herein). Mother Superior M. Margolari, F.M.M. 
Mrs. Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo contends in said case that her daughter 
Philomena left her custody wihtout her knowledge and consent to embrace the 
religious life in St. Anthony's Institution under the direction and control of 
Mother Superior M. Margolari. Mrs. Agudo invokes article 321 of the Civil Code, 
which says that notwithstanding the provision of article 320 to the effect that 
a person of age is qualified for all acts of civil life, "unmarried daughters 
who have attained their majority but are under twenty-five years of age cannot 
leave the parental home without permission of the father or mother in whose 
company they live, except to marry, or when the father or mother has remarried." 
In her return the Mohter superior alleges: "That under the provisions of article 
321 of the civil Code, Philomena Agudo, who is already 24 years of age, has the 
right to leave the parental home without her parent's consent, and to take the 
religious life."</p>
<p align="justify">Upon an adjournment of the hearing of the petition for habeas 
corpus Judge Tancinco, acceding to an oral motion of counsel for Mrs. Agudo, 
ordered that in the interest of equity and pending the final determination of 
the proceedings Philomena Agudo be delivered to the care and custody of the 
Social Welfare Commissioner, upon the authoirty of section 12 of Rule 102, which 
says that when the hearing of a petition for habeas corpus is adjourned "the 
court or judge shall make such order for the safe-keeping of the person 
imprisoned or restrained as the nature of the case requires."</p>
<p align="justify">According to the manifestation made by counsel in open court 
during the hearing of the present petition for certiorari to annul that order of 
Judge Tancinco, the purpose of Mrs. Agudo in seeking such order was to place her 
daughter Philomena beyond the control and supposed undue influence of the 
authorities of the St. Anthony's Institution so that when she, Philomena, should 
testify in the habeas corpus proceeding her testimony would be free from such 
influence. In other words, Mrs. Agudo apprehends that if her daughter should 
remain in the custody of the St. Anthony's Institution up to the time she is 
called to testify in the main case, she might testify that she had left the 
parental home and had decided to embrace the religious live of her won free will 
and without have been induced by anybody to do so, and that such testimony might 
not reflect the truth but only the wishes or instructions of the authorities of 
the St. Anthony's Institution, under whose control and direction she now is.</p>
<p align="justify">I am of the opinion that upon the circumstances above narrated 
the nature of the case does not require the transfer of the custody of Philomena 
Agudo from the St. Anthony's Institution to the Social Welfare Commissioner 
pending the determination of the habeas corpus proceeding, for the following 
reasons:</p>
<ol><li>Mrs. Agudo's fear that her daughter's testimony might be unduly influenced 
by the authorities of the St. Anthony's Institution seems to have been induced 
by a misapprehension regarding the materiality to the result of her petition for 
habeas curpus of whether or not her daughter had left the parental home of her 
own free will. As I construe article 321 of the Civil Code, upon which her 
petition for habeas corpus is predicated, in order to invoke it she does not 
have to prove that her unmarried daughter under twenty-five years of age left 
the parental home thru the inducement of anohter person or that she is being 
restrained or deprived of her liberty. Said article 321 says that "unmarried 
daughters who have attained their majority but are under twenty-five years of 
age cannot leave the parental home without permission of the father or mother in 
whose company the live, except to marry, or when the father or mother has 
remarried." The real controversy is between an unmarried daughter under 
twenty-five years of age and her mother. May the daughter, of her won free will 
but wihout the consent of her parent, leave the parental home and live a life of 
her own somewhere else? That, in my opinion, is the question (one of first 
impression) which the respondent judge has to decide in the habeas corpus 
proceeding pending before him. If he decides it int eh negative, the petition 
for habeas corpus will prosper regardless of whether or not the unmarried 
daughter in question left the parental home of her own free will and whether or 
not she is free to remain in or leave the St. Anthony's Institution, where she 
now is.<br><br>
</li><li>The nature of the case does not requred the delivery of the preson of 
Philomena Agudo to the Social Welfare Commissioner for safekeeping because it 
appears from her affidavit attached to the recored that she feels safe in the 
St. Anthony's Institution and prefers to stay there pending the determination of 
the habeas corpus proceeding rather than be delivered to the custody of the 
Social Welfare Commissioner. Her wishes on this matter of prevention and 
safekeeping pending the hearing cannot be disregarded without doing violence to 
her dignity as a human person. To respect her wishes is not to prejudice the 
right asserted by her mother under article 321 above cited, which the respondent 
judge is called upon to decide after trying the case on the merits. </li></ol>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>REYES, J.:</b></p> I dissent. It seems evident that the purpose of the respondent 
judge in entrusting to the Welfare Commissioner, until the next hearing of the 
main case (Mercedes Reyes Vda. de Agudo vs. Mother M. Margolari, F.M.M.), the 
custody of the person alleged to be illegally detained in said case is to place 
the said person beyond the influence of either party. This does not constitute a 
grave abuse of discretion in the exercise of the authority conferred upon the 
trial judge by section 12 of Rule 102 adn should therefore not be interfered 
with by this Court.</div>
