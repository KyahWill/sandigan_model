<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
convicting the herein appellant of the crime of robbery and imposing an 
indeterminate sentence of not less than two years, four months and one day of 
<i>prisión correccional</i>, nor more than eight years and one day of <i>prisión 
mayor</i>, to indemnify Gen. J. T. Smith, one of the offended parties in the sum 
of P117, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half 
of the costs.
<p>On August 7, 1945, at about 3 o'clock a.m., appellant Antonio Mape and a 
companion whom he named as Andres Salas (still unapprehended), entered the house 
occupied by Brigadier-General J. T. Smith and Lt. W. Gallows at No. 47 Gilmore 
street, Quezon City, by breaking through the wire screen of the kitchen door. 
Once inside the house, appellant Mape went into the room occupied by Lieutenant 
Gallows, while Salas entered another. Just as appellant was leaving the room of 
Lieutenant Gallows, the latter, who was then in bed but awake, pursued and 
caught him. General Smith then came and helped Lieutenant Gallows in subduing 
appellant. When the police arrived, upon call, they found in appellant's 
possession a wallet valued at P5, a fountainpen valued at P15, and P100 in cash, 
all belonging to Lieutenant Gallows. Meanwhile, appellant's companion had 
escaped and from Gen. Smith's room there were missing a wrist watch valued at 
P100 and a Parker fountainpen valued at P17.</p>
<p>Appellant alleges drunkenness as a defense, claiming that his companion Salas 
made him drunk prior to their going to the house of the offended parties. This 
uncorroborated statement of appellant reveals itself clearly as an attempt to 
tinge with truth his allegation that his nocturnal visit had for its purpose a 
purely business transaction. The fact, however, that the stolen articles 
including the amount of P100 belonging to Lieutenant Gallows were found in his 
possession immediately after his apprehension within the house itself and at the 
unusual hour of 3 o'clock a. m., discredits this unsupported defense. The 
records of the case prove appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>The crime having been committed at night time, the aggravating circumstance 
of nocturnity enters into consideration. The mitigating circumstance of 
drunkenness not having been creditably established, cannot serve to offset the 
aggravating circumstance of nocturnity.</p>
<p>The applicable portion of article 299 of the Revised Penal Code reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When said offenders do not carry arms and the value of the property taken 
does not exceed 250 pesos, they shall suffer the penalty prescribed in the two 
next preceding paragraphs, in its minimum period."</p></blockquote>
<p>The penalty prescribed in the "two next preceding paragraphs" is the next 
lower in degree to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusión 
temporal</i> in its minimum period, which would be <i>prisión correccional</i> 
medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> minimum. The minimum of this, namely, <i>prisión 
correccional</i> medium, is the penalty in cases where the offenders do not 
carry arms and the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, as in the instant 
case. Due to the presence of one aggravating circumstances—nocturnity—this 
penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> medium must be applied in its maximum 
period as provided for in section 3 of article 64. After dividing <i>prisión 
correccional</i> medium into three periods, its maximum period would be 3 years, 
6 months and 21 days to 4 years and 2 months.</p>
<p>The minimum of the penalty in this case must be computed in connection with 
the Indeterminate Sentence Law which provides in its section 1, that the minimum 
of the indeterminate penalty "shall be within the range of the penalty next 
lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense." For purposes of the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty next lower should be determined without 
regard as to whether the basic penalty provided by the Code should be applied in 
its maximum or minimum period as circumstances modifying liability may require. 
(People <i>vs</i>. Gonzalez, 73 Phil., 549). In the instant case, prescinding 
from the circumstances modifying criminal liability which are the fact that the 
offender did not carry arms and the amount taken was less than 250 pesos, and 
the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, the basic penalty would be that 
"prescribed in the two next preceding paragraphs," namely, <i>prisión 
correccional</i> medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> minimum. It is from this basic 
penalty that the penalty next lower in degree must be computed. In accordance 
with section 4, article 61, of the Code, this penalty next lower would be 
<i>arresto mayor</i> medium to <i>prisión correccional</i> minimum, from within 
the range of which the minimum of the penalty in this case must be taken for 
purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>
<p>Judgment is accordingly modified and appellant is sentenced to the 
indeterminate penalty of 2 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months. In all 
other respects, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with 
costs.</p><i>Pablo,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em> </div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Generally we would refrain from taking part in the decision of cases in 
which, as in the present one, the attorney for the appellant is a son of the 
writer. The importance of the legal question debated in this case compelled us 
to accede to our brethrens' suggestion that we should not refuse to 
intervene.</p>
<p>There is no disagreement as to the facts in this case as proved by the 
evidence. Upon them, appellant appears to be guilty of the crime of robbery as 
punished by article 299 of the Revised Penal Code, his case falling under the 
penultimate paragraph of said article, it appearing that the property taken does 
not exceed P250 and the accused did not carry arms in committing the crime.</p>
<p>Under the said penultimate paragraph the penalty for the crime at bar is the 
same prescribed in the antipenultimate paragraph of article 299 and the one 
preceding it, that is, minimum <i>prisión mayor</i> to medium <i>prisión 
correccional</i>, but to be applied "in its minimum period."</p>
<p>The minimum period in question is medium <i>prisión correccional</i>. The 
attendance of one aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crime 
requires that medium <i>prisión correccional</i> should be divided, under the 
tri-partite system of the Revised Penal Code, in three sub-periods, and that the 
highest of them should be applied in the present case.</p>
<p>Sections 1 and 2 of Act No. 4103 of the Philippine Legislature as amended by 
Act No. 4225 of the Philippine Legislature are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. Hereafter, in imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished 
by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall sentence the 
accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of which shall be that 
which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under 
the rules of the said Code, and to a minimum which shall be within the range of 
the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense; and if 
the offense is punished by any other law, the court shall sentence the accused 
to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the 
maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum 
term prescribed by the same.</p>
<p>"SEC. 2. This Act shall not apply to persons convicted of offenses punished 
with death penalty or life imprisonment; to those convicted of treason, 
conspiracy or proposal to commit treason; to those convicted of misprision of 
treason, rebellion, sedition or espionage; to those convicted of piracy; to 
those wha are habitual delinquents; to those who shall have escaped from 
confinement or evaded sentence; to those who having been granted conditional 
pardon by the Chief Executive shall have violated the terms thereof; to those 
whose maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed one year; nor to those 
already sentenced by final judgment at the time of approval of this Act, except 
as provided in section five hereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, the indeterminate penalty that must be imposed on appellant 
should be medium <i>prisión correccional</i> in its highest sub-period to a 
penalty that must be taken from the range of minimum <i>prisión correccional</i> 
to medium <i>arresto mayor</i>.</p>
<p>The main disagreement between the majority and the minority lies on the 
question as to what is the penalty provided by the Revised Penal Code for the 
crime at bar, the majority maintaining that the penalty is medium <i>prisión 
correccional</i> to minimum <i>prisión mayor</i>, while the minority is of the 
opinion that it is just medium <i>prisión correccional</i>, the disagreement 
being the result of conflicting interpretations of the penultimate paragraph of 
article 299 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>To our mind the minority position is untenable. The paragraph in question 
specifically provides that "when said offenders do not carry arms and the value 
of the property taken does not exceed P250, they shall suffer the penalty 
prescribed in the two next preceding paragraphs, in its minimum period," and the 
penalty in the "two next preceding paragraphs" referred to is medium <i>prisión 
correccional</i> to minimum <i>prisión mayor</i>, but with the proviso that it 
should be applied "in its minimum period." The minority would narrow the 
provision of the penultimate paragraph in question as if it is written therein 
that the offense shall be punished but by medium <i>prisión correccional</i>, a 
thing essentially different from what the law-maker intended to provide.</p>
<p>The fact that, under the penultimate paragraph in question, the offender will 
be finally punished with medium <i>prisión correccional</i> is no reason for 
concluding that that covers the whole range of the penalty intended by the 
law-maker, in the same way that because the accused in a specific treason case 
is punished with <i>reclusión perpetua</i>, we should close our eyes to the fact 
that article 114 of the Revised Penal Code also provides <i>reclusión 
temporal</i> and death as parts of the group of penalties provided for 
treason.</p>
<p>If we should follow the minority's theory to its natural consequences we 
would even come to the conclusion of dismissing their contention that the 
penalty for the crime at bar is medium <i>prisión correccional</i>, because the 
same is not to be applied, and cannot be applied, in its whole range, but only 
in its maximum sub-period, the one to be applied to appellant, because in the 
commission of his crime there is the attendance of one aggravating 
circumstance.</p>
<p>If we take the maximum sub-period of medium <i>prisión correccional</i> as 
the maximum indeterminate penalty, the minimum indeterminate penalty must be 
taken from the medium sub-period of medium <i>prisión correccional</i>, a result 
that will appear absurd, as it will defeat the purposes of the Law of 
Indeterminate Sentence.</p>
<p>If the position of the minority to the effect that medium <i>prisión 
correccional</i> constitutes the whole range of the penalty provided by the 
penultimate paragraph of article 299 in question is correct, to be consistent, 
the indeterminate minimum penalty must be taken from minimum <i>prisión 
correccional</i>, because that is the penalty "next lower in degree" to that of 
medium <i>prisión correccional</i>. But the minority would jump as far to medium 
<i>arresto mayor</i>, leaving two unexplained and unexplainable gaps, the 
intermediary penalties of maximum <i>arresto mayor</i> and minimum <i>prisión 
correccional</i>.</p>
<p>The system of penalties adopted by the Revised Penal Code is both rigid and 
elastic. Its rigidity lies in the classification of penalties. Its elasticity 
lies in the application of the specific penalty to be imposed within the range 
of each class, period, or degree of penalty. The elasticity has further been 
enlarged by the Law of Indeterminate Sentence, not only in the range of penalty, 
but in its actual application. In not limiting themselves in providing just 
medium <i>prisión correccional</i> in the penultimate paragraph of article 299 
in question, the authors followed only the system adopted, by enlarging the 
range of the penalty that may be imposed.</p>For all the foregoing, we concur in 
the decision.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>BENGZON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur. I am inclined to disagree with the doctrine in People <i>vs</i>. 
Gonzalez (73 Phil., 549 [1942]), modifying People <i>vs</i>. Gayrama (60 Phil., 
796 [1936]) and People <i>vs</i>. Co Pao (58 Phil., 545, 550 [1933]) which in 
turn modified the earliest case on the point U. S. <i>vs</i>. Fuentes (4 Phil., 
404 [1905]). But I believe that lower courts and lawyers, and parties, are 
entitled to know definitely what the law is, and that such changes of view do 
not make for public convenience. So, until the Penal Code is amended, I propose 
to yield and conform to the latest pronouncement.</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the foregoing concurring opinion 
of Mr. Justice Bengzon.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em> </div>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code defines four cases of robbery and fixes 
the penalty corresponding to each. For the purpose of this dissenting opinion, I 
would group them as follows:</p>
<p><i>First Case</i>. The penalty of <i>prisión mayor</i> in its medium period 
to <i>reclusión temporal</i> in its minimum period shall be imposed upon any 
armed person who commits robbery in an inhabited house or public building or 
edifice devoted to religious worship, if the value of the property taken exceeds 
250 pesos, and if—</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the 
robbery was committed, by any of the foregoing means:</p>
<ol><li>Through an opening not intended for entrance or egress; 
</li><li>By breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door or window; 
</li><li>By using false keys, picklocks or similar tools; 
</li><li>By using any fictitious name or pretending the exercise of public authority; 
or if— </li></ol>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The robbery be committed under any of the following 
circumstances:</p>
<ol><li>By the breaking of doors, wardrobes, chests, or any other kind of locked or 
sealed furniture or receptacle; 
</li><li>By taking such furniture or objects away to be broken or forced open outside 
the place of the robbery. </li></ol>
<p><i>Second Case</i>. When the offenders do not carry arm and the value of the 
property taken exceeds 250 pesos, or when the offenders are armed but the value 
of the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, the penalty is that next lower 
in degree to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusión 
temporal</i> in its minimum period, or <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium 
period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its minimum period.</p>
<p><i>Third Case</i>. When the offenders do not carry arm and the value of the 
property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, the penalty is the minimum period of 
<i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its 
minimum period, or <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period.</p>
<p><i>Fourth Case</i>. If the robbery be committed in one of the dependencies of 
an inhabited house, public building or building dedicated to religious worship, 
the penalties next lower in degree than those imposed in the three cases 
above-mentioned shall be imposed, or <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium 
period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its minimum period if the offenders come under 
the first case; <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period if the 
offenders come under the second case; and <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium 
period if the offenders come under the third case.</p>
<p>The appellant herein is convicted of robbery of the third case. The majority 
assume that the penalty prescribed by the Penal Code is <i>prisión 
correccional</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its minimum 
period, but that in view of the attending circumstances that the appellant did 
not carry arm and the value of the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, the 
penalty that should be imposed on him is <i>prisión correccional</i> in its 
medium degree. In determining the next lower penalty for the purpose of applying 
the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the majority insist that the prescribed penalty 
is <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in 
its minimum period, and not <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period, on 
the ground that the latter penalty is to be actually imposed only in view of the 
attending circumstances aforementioned.</p>
<p>The Indeterminate Sentence Law provides that "in imposing a prison sentence 
for an offense punished by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court 
shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum term of 
which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances, could be 
properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and to a minimum which shall 
be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code for 
the offense." (Sec. 1, Com. Act No. 4103, as amended by Act No. 4225.) The 
"attending circumstances" spoken of in the Indeterminate Sentence Law 
undoubtedly refer to mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and this 
conclusion becomes inescapable because in the illustration given in the 
Committee Report, House, Third Session, regarding the imposition of the House of 
Representatives, H-3321, 9th Philippine Legislature, Third Session, regarding 
the imposition of the maximum penalty of the indeterminate sentence, mitigating 
and aggravating circumstances are mentioned. (People <i>vs</i>. Ducosin, 59 
Phil., 109, 115.)</p>
<p>The facts that the offender does not carry arm and that the value of the 
property taken does not exceed 250 pesos are essential elements or integral 
parts of the robbery of the third case or, according to article 62, subsection 
1, of the Revised Penal Code, "circumstances which in themselves constitute a 
crime specially punishable by law or which are included by the law in defining a 
crime and prescribing the penalty therefor."</p>
<p>The penalty prescribed by the Code for robbery of the third case is 
<i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period, and not <i>prisión 
correccional</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its minimum 
period, which latter penalty is that imposed for the second case. If the Code 
has defined and penalized the third case by providing that "when said offenders 
do not carry arms and the value of the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, 
they shall suffer the penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium 
period," it cannot be argued that the prescribed penalty is any other than 
<i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period. And yet this is the ruling of 
the majority, simply because the Code does not directly mention "<i>prisión 
correccional</i> in its medium period" but does so by referring to "the penalty 
next lower in degree" to that prescribed for the second case.</p>
<p>The penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period may of course 
be divided into three periods (minimum, medium, maximum) with a view to imposing 
the correct penalty in the light of the presence or absence of any mitigating or 
aggravating circumstance. But <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period 
should be the basis for determining the next lower penalty for the purpose of 
applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the minimum penalty may be taken from <i>prisión 
correccional</i> in its minimum period, in accordance with People <i>vs</i>. Co 
Pao (58 Phil., 545, 550), People <i>vs</i>. Gayrama (60 Phil., 796 [1936]), and 
People <i>vs</i>. Haloot (64 Phil, 739), or from <i>arresto mayor</i> in its 
medium period, in accordance with United States <i>vs</i>. Fuentes (4 Phil., 
404), and People <i>vs</i>. Gonzalez (73 Phil. 549 [1942]), but never from the 
whole range of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión 
correccional</i> in its minimum period which is the penalty next lower in degree 
to that of <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium period to <i>prisión 
mayor</i> in its minimum period, because the latter is not prescribed by the 
Revised Penal Code for the offense of which the appellant is herein convicted, 
robbery of the third case. There are good reasons for the view that the next 
lower penalty is <i>prisión correccional</i> in its minimum period, but I had 
agreed to the doctrine laid down in the Gonzalez case, which is a reiteration of 
the Fuentes case, because it is more favorable to the accused.</p>
<p>In my opinion, therefore, the appellant should be sentenced to the minimum 
penalty of not more than 4 months or less than 2 months and 1 day of <i>arresto 
mayor</i>.</p>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the foregoing 
opinion.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em> </div>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>We concur with the majority in that the penalty prescribed by the Code for 
the offense of robbery when the offender does not carry arms and the value of 
the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, committed by the appellant, 
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The penalty prescribed in the 'two next preceding paragraphs' is the next 
lower in degree to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusión 
temporal</i> in its minimum period, which would be <i>prisión correccional</i> 
medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> minimum. The minimum of this, namely, <i>prisión 
correccional</i> medium, is the penalty in cases where the offenders do not 
carry arms and the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos, as in the instant 
case. Due to the presence of one aggravating circumstance—nocturnity—this 
penalty of <i>prisión correccional</i> medium must be applied in its maximum 
period as provided for in section 3 of article 64. After dividing <i>prisión 
correccional</i> medium into three periods, its maximum period would be 3 years, 
6 months and 21 days to 4 years and 2 months."</p></blockquote>
<p>But we dissent from the majority's conclusion that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For purposes of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty next lower 
should be determined without regard as to whether the basic penalty provided by 
the Code should be applied in its maximum or minimum period as circumstances 
modifying liability may require. (People <i>vs</i>. Gonzalez, 73 Phil., 549). In 
the instant case, prescinding from the circumstances modifying criminal 
liability which are the fact that the offender did not carry arms and the amount 
taken was less than 250 pesos, * * * the basic penalty would be that 'prescribed 
in the two next preceeding paragraphs,' namely, <i>prision correccional</i> 
medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> minimum. It is from this basic penalty that the 
penalty next lower in degree must be computed."</p></blockquote>
<p>We do not see any reason why, in determining the maximum penalty, the 
majority decision considers "<i>prisión correccional</i>" <i>in its medium 
period</i> as the penalty prescribed by the Code for the offense committed by 
the appellant, but instead of considering the same <i>prisión correccional</i> 
in its medium, the majority considers <i>prisión correccional</i> in its medium 
to <i>prisión mayor</i> in its minimum period as the penalty prescribed by the 
Code for the purpose of determining the penalty next lower in degree within the 
range of which the minimum of the penalty must be taken for the purpose of the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law. Section 1 of this law simply provides that the 
minimum of the indeterminate penalty "shall be within the range of the penalty 
next lower to that prescribed by law." There is nothing in said law to authorize 
a method of computation to determine the penalty next lower in degree for the 
purpose of the minimum of the indeterminate penalty, different from that for 
other purposes.</p>
<p>It is correct, and we agree, that in order to determine the penalty next 
lower in degree for the purpose of imposing the minimum indeterminate penalty, 
the penalty prescribed by the Code for the offenses must be taken as the basis, 
without taking into consideration the attending mitigating or aggravating 
circumstance which may decrease, to the minimum or increase to the maximum 
period, the penalty which may be imposed <i>by the court</i>, because this is 
not directly prescribed by the law. But it is not correct, and we can not agree, 
that the penalty specifically imposed by the Code in its minimum or maximum 
period in consideration of the qualifying circumstances that are elements or 
ingredients of a complex offense, should not be considered as the penalty 
prescribed for the purpose of determining the minimum indeterminate penalty. 
That the value of the property taken was less than 250 pesos and the offenders 
did not carry arms, are not aggravating or mitigating circumstances modifying 
the criminal liability; they are qualifying circumstances that integrate that 
complex offense. They are part and parcel of the specific offense committed by 
the appellant irrespective of the mitigating or aggravating circumstances which 
might attend the commission of said offense. Without said qualifying 
circumstances the offense committed and the penalty therefor would be different, 
just as the treachery which qualifies and makes the illegal killing of a person 
murder instead of homicide.</p>
<p>The <i>prisión correccional</i> medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> minimum can 
not be considered as the penalty prescribed by the Code, since said penalty is 
prescribed for the offenses penalized in the next two preceding paragraphs in 
consideration of the different qualifying circumstances that integrate them, and 
the penalty for the offense at bar is the minimum thereof. To consider the 
penalty of <i>presidio correccional</i> in its medium to <i>prisión mayor</i> in 
its minimum period, instead of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium period, as the 
basic penalty for determining the minimum indeterminate penalty to be imposed 
upon the appellant, would be to punish a less serious offense with the same 
minimum indeterminate penalty which the Penal Code provides for the more serious 
offense of robbery of an amount less than 250 pesos but <i>with arms</i>, or of 
<i>more than 250</i> pesos without arms, defined or punished in the next two 
preceding paragraphs.</p>Besides, it is a maxim that, in case of doubt, criminal 
laws must be construed in favor of the accused, and our construction of the law 
is not only in accordance with the letter and spirit thereof, but in favor of 
the accused. According to our construction the minimum indeterminate penalty 
should be within the range of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its medium period from 2 
months and 1 day to 4 months, or will not exceed 4 months; while under the 
contrary construction, the minimum should be within the range of <i>arresto 
mayor</i> in its medium to <i>prisión correccional</i> in its minimum period, 
that is, from 2 months and 1 day to 2 years, or it may be 2 years.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>Mi posición en esta causa es peculiar. Estoy sustancialmente de acuerdo con 
la ponencia; difiero de esta sólo en aquella parte en donde se sienta la 
conclusión de que, para los efectos de la sentencia indeterminada, la pena 
minima que debe imponerse al acusado debe tomarse del siguiente arco—de arresto 
mayor en su grado medio a prisión correccional en su grado mínimo. Naturalmente 
mi disconformidad en este respecto se extiende al razonamiento que ha hecho 
posible dicha conclusión.</p>Estoy más inclinado a sostener la conclusión a que 
han llegado sobre este particular los Magistrados Parás y Feria, a saber: que, 
bajo la ley de sentencia indeterminada, la pena mínima debe quedar circunscrita 
dentro del período medio de arresto mayor, o sea, de 2 meses y 1 día a 4 meses, 
sin que en ningún caso exceda de 4 meses. Pero como, de hecho, la pena mínima 
que se impone en la ponencia es la de 2 meses y 1 día, se sigue que en la 
presente causa, por lo menos, la parcial disconformidad entre la sentencia y la 
disidencia es tan sólo abstracta y más bien dice relación con la discreción que 
en lo futuro pueden ejercer los Jueces en la imposición del mínimum de la pena 
correspondiente.</div>
