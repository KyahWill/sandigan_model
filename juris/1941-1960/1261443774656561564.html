				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the morning of June 13, 1951, Hoc Hong, <em>alias</em> Yap Kiana, his 
wife, Sumanbuyan Tagacaolo, Segundo Bancil and Marcos Lampiada were found dead 
in the house and store of said spouses, at Sanghai, municipality of Malita, 
province of Davao. The deceased had multiple wounds, which are described in the 
medico-legal report (Exhibit A) as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Hoc Hong, <em>alias</em> Yap Kiana (Chinese).—(a) A poorly-built in 
structure, 48 years, male, married, merchant, born at Amoy, China, was already

<p>(<em>c</em>) Wound, incised, multiple (4 in number), arm, right.</p>
<p>(<em>d</em>) That cause of death was instantaneous, and that hemorrhage was 
the secondary cause."</p></blockquote>
<p>The bodies of Yap Kiana and Marcos Lampiada were on their respective mats, 
about 3 meters away from each other, in a recumbent position, indicating that 
they were attacked while asleep. Sumanbuyan Tagacaolo and Segundo Bancil were 
about 6 meters and 3 feet, respectively, away from Yap Kiana. Moreover, the sum 
of P150.00 and several articles the value of which aggregate P500.00, more or 
less, had disappeared from the house. After due investigation by the 
authorities, Bandali Tagacaolo, Bancil Bandali and Sugandil Tagacaolo were 
accused of robbery with quadruple homicide. Upon arraignment, Bancil Bandali - 
hereinafter referred to, for the sake of brevity, as Bancil - pleaded guilty and 
was sentenced accordingly. Then, his co-defendants, Bandali Tagacaolo and 
Sugandil Tagacaolo, who had entered a plea of not guilty, were tried separately. 
In due course, the Court of First Instance of Davao thereafter rendered judgment 
acquitting Sugandil Tagacaolo, for insufficiency of the evidence, with one-third 
of the costs <em>de oficio</em>, and finding Bandali Tagacaolo guilty, beyond 
reasonable doubt, as charged, and sentencing him to life imprisonment, with rhe 
accessory penalties provided by law, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased 
in the sums of P3,000 and P650, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, as well as to pay one-third of the costs. Bandali Tagacaolo, 
hereinafter referred to as Bandali, has appealed from this decision, and the 
only question for determination before us is the sufficiency of the evidence to 
warrant his conviction.</p>
<p>Upon a review of the record, we are satisfied that the issue must be answered 
in the affirmative. It appears that Bandali is the father of his co-defendant 
Bancil, who had pleaded guilty to the charge and is now serving the 
corresponding sentence. Both lived in the former's house in Malita, Davao, 
together with Juan Mamat, <em>alias</em> Lumomban a son-in-law of Bandali and 
brother-in-law of Bancil. Mamat testified that Bandali and Bancil left their 
common dwelling on June 12, 1951, at about 6:00 p.m.; that said defendants did 
not sleep in the house that evening; that they returned thereto on June 13, 
1951, at about 4:00 a.m.; that Bandali then brought with him the 'patakia" (a 
container for chewing beetlenut and tobacco) Exhibit G, a firearm and a bolo; 
that Bancil was then carrying a shotgun, which, later on, turned out to have 
been taken from Yap Kiana, that upon inquiry by Mamat, appellant herein said 
that Exhibit G had come from Yap Kiana, whom they had killed that night; and 
that Bandali, however, warned him against reporting it to anybody.</p>
<p>This testimony was partly corroborated by Tumalasik Tagacaolo, who asserted 
positively that the "patakia", Exhibit G, is his property; that, sometime before 
the occurrence, he delivered it, by way of pledge, to Yap Kiana; and that it was 
supposed to be in the possession of Yap Kiana, at the time of his death, he 
(Tumalasik) having failed to redeem it. Moreover, it is not disputed that when 
the house of Bandali was searched by members of the police force, Exhibit G was 
found inside his pillow, mixed kapok.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, the evidence for the defense consisted merely of the 
testimony of appellant to the effect that he had not committed the crime 
charged; that he bought Exhibit G from Tumalasik; and that the incriminating 
testimony of his son-in-law, Juan Mamat, was prompted by his alleged wish to 
appropriate a land belonging to him (appellant). Clearly, however, this 
testimony is insufficient to offset the evidence for the prosecution or to 
impair either its credibility or its weight. To begin with, the alleged sale of 
Exhibit G by Tumalasik is negated by the testimony of the latter, who had no 
possible motive to commit perjury. Indeed, had Exhibit G been purchased by 
appellant, he would not have hidden it inside his pillow.</p>
<p>Secondly, the improper motive imputed to Mamat can not be regarded as an 
established fact, considering that appellant's testimony is uncorroborated and 
naturally biased, and that if, as the defense would have us believe, be was 
advised by Mamat of his intention to appropriate said land, appellant would not 
have allowed Mamat to continue living in his (appellant's) house.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the testimony of Mamat was corroborated by that of Tumalasik, by the 
fact that Exhibit G had been concealed by appellant inside his pillow, antf by 
the circumstance that appellant had to resort to perjury in order to explain his 
possession of said object, which Yap Kiana held at the time of his death.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt, therefore, about appellant's guilt. Inasmuch as the 
offense was commited with the aggravating circumstances of treachery, night 
time, and dwelling of two of the victim, it becomes necessary to determine 
whether the penaly of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death provided by law (Art. 
294, par. 1, of the Revised Penal Code) should be imposed in its maximum period. 
Considering, however, that appellant is an illiterate member of the 
non-Christian tribes and that the number of votes necessary to mete out the 
death sentence is lacking, the proper penalty is life imprisonment although a 
member of the Court believes that, in view of the conditions under which the 
offense was perpetrated, appellant shou!d never be pardoned and the decision 
appealed from should be modified accordingly. Furthermore, the indemnity of P650 
therein provided should be understood to be due to the heirs of the spouses Hoc 
Hong, <em>alias</em> Yap Kiana, and Sumanbuyan Tagacaolo, to whom the stolen 
property obviously belongs.</p>
<p>Thus modified as to the penalty, and with the aforementioned clarification as 
regards the indemnity, said decision is hereby affirmed, therefore, in all other 
respects, with costs against the defendant-appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed with some modification.</em></p></div>
