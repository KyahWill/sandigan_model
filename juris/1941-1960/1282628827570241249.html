</style><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Public Service Commission. The 
issues are set forth in said decision, from which we quote:
<blockquote>
<p>"Pedro de Guia, an authorized TPU operator between San Juan and Manila, 
applies in this case for a <u>change</u> of route and termini of his present 
authorized operation under Case No. 38387, as amended by Case No. 62705, from 
the intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt Streets via Mandaluyong, up to 
Quiapo. The proposed change is a line starting from the corner of Lt. Artiaga 
and N. Domingo about one (1) kilometer distant from applicant's present starting 
point of operation at the corner of N. Domingo and Blumentritt up to Divisoria. 
For the operation on the new line, applicant will use the same five (5) units 
now operated by him on the old line.</p>
<p>"Antonio Heras and Vicente Heras, operators in the same region, are opposed 
to this application, chiefly on the ground that the proposed service is 
unnecessary and that approval of the same would only cause wasteful or ruinous 
competition. It will be noted that of the twenty (20), or more operators who may 
be affected by this application and who are notified of the contents thereof and 
of the date of hearing, only Antonio Heras and Vicente Heras prosecuted their 
opposition against the application.</p>
<p>"For convenience of reference, a sketch, prepared in the Commission, showing 
the lines operated by contending parties, is attached to the records. The solid 
blue line on the sketch shows the present authorized service of applicant de 
Guia. The proposed line of de Guia. is represented by a broken blue line. The 
solid and broken red lines represent the authorized lines of operation of the 
oppositor Antonio Haras, while the broken line in ink represents the line of 
operation of oppositor Vicente Heras." (Record on Appeal pp. 
26-27.)</p></blockquote>
<p>After due hearing, the Public Service Commission rendered a decision granting 
the authority sought by Pedro de Guia and ordering that the certificate of 
public convenience prayed for by him be issued. The aforementioned oppositors, 
Antonio Heras and Vicente Heras, have appealed from said decision and, in their 
brief, they maintain that;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. "The Commission erred and exceeded its powers in allowing the 
respondent-appellee to establish an <u>unnecessary new service</u> in another 
territory and operate on a <u>new route</u> which is <u>already adequately</u> 
served by the present operators without clear and convincing evidence to support 
reasonably the decision of the Commission submitted for review.</p>
<p>2. "The Commission erred and acted in abuse of discretion in permitting the 
respondent-appellee to <u>discontinue and abandon</u> the operation on his old 
line and to use in the operation of the new service the remaining five units 
authorized in case No. 38387 in competition with regular operators <u>without 
first securing the cancellation of the certificate of public convenience issued 
in said case No, 38387</u>.</p>
<p>3. Commission erred and committed an abuse of discretion in allowing 
<u>wasteful and ruinous competition</u> which will result from the operation of 
the new service by the respondent-appellee on his new route notwithstanding the 
evidence presented in the course of the hearing that jeepneys and big buses 
operating in this territory follow one after the other and that traffic along 
this route direct to Divisoria is adequately provided by the present established 
operators." (Petitioners-Appellants Brief, pp. 5-6)(Underscoring 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error involves questions of fact, in connection with 
which the decision appealed from has the following to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The evidence of the applicant is to the effect that there is no direct 
service along his proposed line from the intersection of Lt. Artiaga and N. 
Domingo to Divisoria; that the volume of traffic in the region justifies the 
change proposed by him, and that the abandonment of his present line of 
operation represent ed by the solid blue line will not be prejudicial to the 
public because there is sufficient service left. This statement is confirmed by 
the records of the Commission, which show that without the service of Pedro de 
Guia along his old route, there will still remain nineteen (19) units operated 
by other operators. That there is no direct service between Lt. Artiaga and 
Divisoria is also confirmed by the records of the Commission.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, oppositors Antonio Heras and Vicente Haras, operating 
about seventeen (17) units between Boston and City Hall and between N. Domingo 
and Quiapo as shown in the sketch (15 units for the former and 2 units for the 
latter), contend, by their evidence, that the present service by them and other 
operators in the region is sufficient and that the approval of this application 
will only cause wasteful or ruinous competition. There is, however, no concrete 
evidence on this point of wasteful or ruinous competition.</p>
<p>"By referring to the sketch of the territory involved in this controversy, it 
will readily be noted that while the proposed operation of Mr. de Guia is 
concurrent with that of the oppositors along a major portion of the line, the 
service of the oppositors is entirely different and distinct from that of the 
applicant. Whereas the line of Antonio Heras where he operates ten (10) units 
starts from a point called Boston, that of the applicant starts from Lt. 
Artiaga, which is 2.5 kilometers distant from Boston,. Also the terminal of 
Antonio Heras is at City Hall, while that of the applicant is Divisoria. It is 
therefore not unusual that upon reaching Lt. Artiaga or any other point down the 
line; that the busses of Antonio Heras are already filled to capacity and can 
not admit more passengers and that passengers bound for Divisoria have to 
transfer to other busses for Divisoria, generally at the intersection of Legarda 
and Azcarraga Streets. The interval of trips of oppositor Antonio Heras along 
the line as per his authorized time schedule is ten (10) minutes and not five 
(5) as stated by one of his witnesses. Likewise, the starting point of the other 
oppositors Vicente Heras is from the corner of N. Domingo and Blumentritt, about 
one (1) kilometer distant from the starting point of the proposed operation of 
applicant at Lt. Artiaga, and Vicente Heras’ terminal is Quiapo whereas the 
terminal of the applicant is Divisoria. By their evidence, oppositors lay 
emphasis on the fact that there are already many operators operating along the 
N. Domingo Street in San Juan but it appears that illegal operation is prevalent 
along this line. That is why an agent of the Commission had to be stationed at 
the intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt Streets to apprehend the illegal 
operators, and while some witnesses have testified that they can avail of direct 
service from N. Domingo in San Juan up to Divisoria, this operation appears to 
be illegal because the records of the Commission show that there is no 
authorized direct transportation service from Lt. Artiaga up to Divisoria, the 
proposed line of the applicant. The prevalence of these illegal operations 
indicate that there is need for the proposed service of the applicant. The 
Commission assumes that, unlike other operators who conduct illegal operations 
along N. Domingo Street from San Juan up to Divisoria, applicant desires to be 
within the law seeking authority for conducting such operation, and in this he 
should be welcomed.</p>
<p>"Considering that oppositors’ operation is entirely different and distinct 
from that of the applicant; that there is no authorized/direct operation from 
Lt. Artiaga to Divisoria and that abandonment of applicant's old line from the 
intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt Streets up to Quiapo via Mandaluyong 
will not prejudice the public as there is already a sufficient service therein, 
and convinced from the evidence of record on volume of traffic and there is need 
for the direct service proposed by the applicant between the intersection of Lt. 
Artiaga and N. Domingo up to Divisoria and that no wasteful competition will 
result therefrom, the Commission believes that the application filed in this 
case should be; as it is hereby, APPROVED" (Petitioners-Appellants’ Brief, pp. 
27-30.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from being borne out by the records, the foregoing findings of fact are 
conclusive upon this Court. Hence, the first assignment of error is devoid of 
merit.</p>
<p>Under their second assignment of error, appellants raise a question of fact 
and one of law, namely; whether or not the original route of respondent de Guia 
may be abandoned without detriment to public service; and whether said 
abandonment may be effected "without first securing the cancellation of the 
certificate of public convenience issued" for said original route. As regards 
the last question, suffice it to say that appellee’s application for a change of 
route amounts to a petition for cancellation of the authority to operate in his 
original route, simultaneously with the grant of authority to operate in the new 
route. Similarly, when the latter route was approved in the decision appealed 
from, the Public Service Commission, in effect, withdrew appellee's authority to 
operate in the original route. No legal provision or authority has been cited in 
support of the theory that the former certificate of public convenience must be 
cancelled before a new one, for a modified route, could be applied for.</p>
<p>Referring to the aforementioned question of fact, it appears that the 
appellee had introduced evidence to the effect "that the abandonment of his 
present line x x x will not be prejudicial to the public because there is 
sufficient service left," and the Public Service Commission found that "this 
statement is confirmed by the records of the Commission which shows that without 
the service of Pedro de Guia alone, there will remain nineteen (19) units 
operated by other operators". Said Commission further held that "abandonment of 
applicant’s old line from the intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt Streets 
up to Quiapo via Mandaluyong will not prejudice the public as there are already 
sufficient service therein x x x."</p>
<p>It is, likewise, urged that, before granting appellee's petition for 
authority to change route and termini, the Public Service Commission should have 
given appellants an opportunity to improve their service if deficient or 
inadequate. There is absolutely no merit in this contention, for, although parts 
of their respective routes are identical, "the service of the oppositors is" - 
in the language of the Public Service Commission - "entirely different and 
distinct from that of the applicant." Indeed, the termini of the line applied 
for by herein appellee are the intersection of N. Domingo and Lt. Artiaga, in 
San Juan Del Monte, Rizal, and the Divisoria market, in Manila, whereas Antonio 
Heras operates two (2) lines, one starting at the intersection of N. Domingo and 
Boston Streets, and another at the intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt 
Streets, in San Juan Del Monte, Rizal, and the termini of both lines is the City 
Hall of Manila, and the termini of the line of Vicente Heras are the 
intersection of N. Domingo and Blumentritt, in San Juan Del Monte, Rizal, and 
the intersection of Arlegui and Barbosa Streets, Quiapo, Manila.</p>
<p>The last assignment of error is a mere corollary of those already disposed 
of, and, consequently, it needs no further discussion.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed in 
toto, with costs against appellants Antonio Heras and Vicente Heras.</p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>

Labrador</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
