				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; Hon. Gregorio S.&nbsp; Narvasa, presiding, granting the petition of&nbsp; Ko Wai Me to be admitted to the country as a temporary visitor. <br><br>The record discloses that on June 28, 1956,&nbsp; Chua&nbsp; Tao, alleged husband&nbsp; of the petitioner, asked the Department of Foreign Affairs, through the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Immigration, for the. issuance of a temporary visitor's visa in favor of his alleged wife,' petitioner&nbsp; herein Ko&nbsp; Wai&nbsp; Me.&nbsp; In its indorsement&nbsp; dated July 7, 1956, the Bureau&nbsp; of Immigration,&nbsp; through&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; L. Galang,&nbsp; recommended denial of said application.&nbsp;&nbsp; He called attention to the decision of the Board of Commissioners dated September 29, 1954, finding petitioner&nbsp; herein Ko Wai Me guilty of violation of the provisions of the Immigration Act, for having&nbsp; slipped into the&nbsp; country surreptitiously while a passenger aboard&nbsp; the S. S.&nbsp; President&nbsp; Cleveland, which arrived in Manila on January 9, 1953, without inspection and admission by, or permission of, the immigration authoritiesâ€”she failed to appear before the&nbsp; departure&nbsp; control officer when said&nbsp; vessel&nbsp; left port&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1959 (Annex "B", p. 14, Record).&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspite of this adverse comment the Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Foreign Affairs&nbsp; authorized the issuance of a visitor's visa to petitioner Ko Wai&nbsp; Me, provided she is in possession of a valid Chinese Nationalist passport, a round trip plane or ship ticket to Hongkong&nbsp; and re-entry permit to Hongkong valid at least 6 months,&nbsp; and that the Philippine Consulate is satisfied after thorough screening that she is the wife of Chua Tao, a Chinese resident of the Philippines, and is otherwise&nbsp; admissible and&nbsp; without any derogatory information against her (Annex "C", p.&nbsp; 15, Record).&nbsp; Because of this order of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, petitioner was granted&nbsp; a visa and she arrived in the port of Manila aboard a Cathay plane on September&nbsp; 28, 1956. <br><br>On&nbsp; October. 1,&nbsp; 1956, an&nbsp; inquiry&nbsp; was made&nbsp; by the Board of Special&nbsp; Inquiry and,&nbsp; thereafter, on October 4, 1956, the Board&nbsp; recommended&nbsp; that she be admitted for entry (Annex "G", p.&nbsp; 19, Record).&nbsp; It is to be noted that the Board expressly stated that a warrant for her arrest and deportation was issued on January 19, 1953, for having entered the country without inspection&nbsp; and admission&nbsp; by the&nbsp; immigration&nbsp; authorities and ordered deported&nbsp; in a decision&nbsp; of the Board of Commissioners on September 5, 1954, at her own expense.&nbsp; It stated that&nbsp; as&nbsp; she had not been deported as shown in her acts, she could be admitted as temporary visitor for 3 months from date of her arrival. The report of the Board of Special Inquiry passed through the&nbsp; hands of&nbsp; First Deputy&nbsp; Commissioner Francisco de la Rosa, who made the following&nbsp; note&nbsp; to Commissioner Galang: <br><blockquote>"KO WAI ME qualifies for entry as a&nbsp; temporary visitor&nbsp; under the Cabinet policy in view of the satisfactory evidence showing her marriage to a local resident alien.&nbsp; In&nbsp; view of her proper documentation as she possesses a valid passport and a valid visa for entry into&nbsp; the Philippines and the fact that she is applying for temporary admission only,&nbsp; her&nbsp; case falls under Section&nbsp; 29 (b)&nbsp; (2) in which the Commissioner is given the discretion to permit her entry."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit "1", par. I).<br></blockquote>The second&nbsp; Deputy Commissioner, according to Commissioner de la Rosa, was of the opinion that&nbsp; since the petitioner was a previous deportee who may be admitted only in the discretion of the Commissioner,&nbsp; the case should be referred to Commissioner Galang.&nbsp; So they&nbsp; endorsed the papers to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner, with the notation that appellant may be admitted only in the discretion of Commissioner Galang (t. s. n., p. 7-de la Rosa). <br><br>Upon receipt of the note or indorsement of the deputy commissioners, respondent Commissioner Galang on September 18, 1959, decided&nbsp; petitioner's exclusion and ordered his first deputy commissioner to effect&nbsp; exclusion (Exhibit "1-a").&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner de la Rosa did then issue, in accordance with his superior's instructions, an order for&nbsp; petitioner's exclusion.&nbsp; The order is as follows: <br><br>"It appearing&nbsp; that the Commissioner of&nbsp; Immigration did not permit Ko Wai&nbsp; Me, Chinese, female, 31 years of age,&nbsp; to enter as a temporary visitor, in the exercise of his discretion under Section 29 (b) (2)&nbsp; of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, and it further&nbsp; appearing that he manifested his decision to&nbsp; effect the&nbsp; exclusion of the above-mentioned applicant, per&nbsp; his instruction to the First Deputy Commissioner in his note to him of October 18, 1956,&nbsp; and in compliance therewith,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is hereby ordered that said Ko Wai Me be excluded in accordance with law."&nbsp; (Exhibit "2").<br><br>The legal ground upon which the&nbsp; exclusion was based is the provision of Section 29 (6)&nbsp; (2) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended. <br><br>The&nbsp; court below held that as the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of exclusion issued for Commissioner Galang by First Deputy Commissioner de la Rosa has nothing to support it and that on the other hand, the Board of Special Inquiry had rendered a favorable decision upon the&nbsp; right of petitioner to enter, the&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of Commissioners rendered&nbsp; their&nbsp; unanimous decision&nbsp; disapproving&nbsp; the application&nbsp; without&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; to support it and said decision is&nbsp; a&nbsp; nullity.<br><blockquote>"We have shown&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Order of Exclusion&nbsp; of the petitioner dated October 19, 1956 has&nbsp; nothing to&nbsp; support&nbsp; it. On the&nbsp; other hand, we have clearly established by documentary evidence that the Board of&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Inquiry of the Bureau of Immigration has rendered a favorable&nbsp; decision upon&nbsp; the question of the right&nbsp; of the petitioner&nbsp; to enter the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; Such decision has become final, there having been no appeal and there being no showing that the three members of the&nbsp; Board who rendered a unanimous decision abused their authority.&nbsp; This Honorable Court therefore has jurisdiction to review the Order of Exclusion in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case with nothing to support it and which Order is therefore a nullity, it being directly attacked&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp; Much&nbsp; more&nbsp; so,&nbsp; when&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no showing, as in this instant case, that the Board of Special Inquiry abused its&nbsp; authority when it found&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; decision that the petitioner has a right to enter the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to administrative decisions,&nbsp; it has been held: <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">'A verdict&nbsp; or&nbsp; decision with nothing to&nbsp; support it is a nullity, at least when directly attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp; In such case, this court has jurisdiction to review, though, as we have generally held, the decision of the administrative officers upon the question of the right of an alien&nbsp; to&nbsp; enter the Philippine Islands is final when no abuse of authority is shown.'&nbsp; (Edwards <i>vs.</i> McCoy, 22 Philippine 598; Ngo Yao &amp; Chua Eng Cheng <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sheriff of Manila 27 Phil., 378)".<br></div></blockquote>There are no grounds legal or factual to support the conclusion&nbsp; arrived at&nbsp; by his Honor,&nbsp; the judge below.&nbsp;&nbsp; The report&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board of Special&nbsp; Inquiry,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "E", expressly mentions the fact that petitioner&nbsp; herein had by a final&nbsp; decision of the Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Immigration. Commissioners (Annex "B") been ordered arrested on a warrant of arrest dated June&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; for entry without inspection&nbsp; and admission, but that she left the country voluntarily at her own expense.&nbsp; On these facts, contained in the very decision of the Board of Special Inquiry, this Board concluded that petitioner had not been deported within the purview of the Philippine Immigration Act.&nbsp; This&nbsp; conclusion, i. e., of the Board of Special Inquiry&nbsp; that the voluntary departure of an alien ordered by a final&nbsp; decision of the Commissioners of Immigration to be deported is not deportation or exclusion if deportee leaves the country voluntarily&nbsp; and at her own expense, is, indeed, error.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere fact that the petitioner herein voluntarily left the Islands at&nbsp; her own&nbsp; expense did not have the effect of revoking the final order of deportation and the decision supporting the same.&nbsp; The mere fact that she voluntarily departed at her own expense did not erase the fact that she had&nbsp; entered the country surreptitiously and without permit from&nbsp; the proper&nbsp; authorities and with proper documents and is subject to deportation.&nbsp; Evidently, the first deputy commissioner,&nbsp; in believing that the petitioner could only be admitted in the discretion of Commissioner, actually reversed the legal conclusion of the Board of Special Inquiry, that by the petitioner's voluntary&nbsp; exit from&nbsp; the Philippines at her own expense,&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense that had been committed against the Immigration laws had been completely wiped out.&nbsp; This&nbsp; principle, that voluntary departure&nbsp; of a deportee sentenced to&nbsp; deportation did not operate to revoke the final decision of deportation, is the reason or ground why the deputy commissioners had decided that petitioner&nbsp; may&nbsp; only&nbsp; be authorized&nbsp; entry under the provisions of sub-paragraph (2), paragraph (b), Section 29 of the Immigration Act, as amended, which is as follows: "<br><blockquote>Sec. 29. (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) The&nbsp; following classes of aliens shall be&nbsp; excluded from entry into the Philippines: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br></div><br>'(15) Persons who have been excluded&nbsp; or deported from the Philippines, but this provision may be waived&nbsp; in the discretion of the Commissioner of Immigration:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however,</span> That the Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; shall not exercise his discretion in favor of aliens excluded&nbsp; or&nbsp; deported on the ground of conviction for any crime involving&nbsp; moral&nbsp; turpitude or for any crime&nbsp; penalized under sections forty-five and forty-six of this Act or&nbsp; on the ground of having engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; hoarding, black-marketing or profiteering unless such aliens have previously resided in the Philippines immediately before&nbsp; his exclusion or deportation&nbsp; for&nbsp; a period of ten&nbsp; years or more or are married to native Filipino women."&nbsp; (Pp. 15-16, Brief for the appellants).&nbsp; </blockquote>Even&nbsp; admitting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo </span>that as the petitioner herein is not a deportee because she had not been deported, because she voluntarily left&nbsp; the country at&nbsp; her own&nbsp; expense, then at least she is a person who&nbsp; has been excluded from the Philippines within&nbsp; the meaning of the first&nbsp; paragraph of the above section.&nbsp; The decision of the Board of Immigration Commissioners&nbsp; ordering her deportation is conclusive evidence of this fact.&nbsp; As such she can only be admitted when the Commissioner waives the application of the law in favor of allowing the alien to enter the Philippines. <br><br>We find that the decision appealed from is not supported by the law, and we hereby&nbsp; set it aside&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas&nbsp; corpus</span>, with costs in both instances against the petitioner-appellee.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
