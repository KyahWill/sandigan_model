				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition under Rule 67 for a writ of certiorari with preliminary injunction.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; seeks&nbsp; to anunl and set aside the order of the Court of Industrial Relations dated&nbsp; 1&nbsp; June 1955 deferring action on&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner's motion to dismiss tine complaint or demand for back pay filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents for lack of jurisdiction of the respondent court and to restrain&nbsp; it from proceeding with the determination of Case No. 397-V(7).<br><br>On 1 September 1955 a writ of preliminary injunction was issued restraining the respondent Court of Industrial Relations from proceeding with the ease.<br><br>Petitioner avers that on 7&nbsp; April 1951 am amended petition was filed by 425 members of the Luzon Labor Union with the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations alleging that at the outbreak of the Pacific war in December 1941, at the instance&nbsp; of the Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; the herein petitioner, they worked with the&nbsp; United States Army&nbsp; by hauling military equipment to Bataan; that some of them died during the war and were represented by their heirs; that sometime&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1945 the Company, en the&nbsp; promise to pay them four to five years back pay, induced some thirty&nbsp; chauffeurs to testify,&nbsp; as they did&nbsp; in fact testify, before the United States&nbsp; military&nbsp; authorities that the Company&nbsp; had 400 trucks commandeered by the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; Army; and that according&nbsp; to their information the Company, was paid by the&nbsp; War Damage Commission for its&nbsp; trucks and other services related to the work of the claimants.&nbsp; They prayed that after hearing&nbsp; the Company be&nbsp; ordered to pay them back&nbsp; wages earned&nbsp; during the war in the respective amounts&nbsp; as computed by them.<br><br>On 5 May 1955 the Company filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that as the claim was purely&nbsp; and exclusively for sums of money allegedly owing to certain persons, "most of whom&nbsp; have already severed their&nbsp; connection with the&nbsp; Company," the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations had no&nbsp; jurisdiction over the subject&nbsp; matter.&nbsp; To&nbsp; abbreviate the proceedings and to avoid repeated presentation of the same evidence, on 1 June 1955&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; deferred action on several&nbsp; motions filed by the&nbsp; Company including the motion' to dismiss, on the ground that the motion alleged facts which should be established by&nbsp; competent evidence. A motion for reconsideration was denied.<br><br>Petitioner contends that&nbsp; the Court committed&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss and that its taking cognizance of the case would be a&nbsp; waste of time because it had no jurisdiction .to hear 4nd decide it for lack of employer-employee relationship between the&nbsp; petitioner and the respondents.<br><br>The petitioner&nbsp; admitted that&nbsp; some of&nbsp; the claimants for back pay were still under its employ when it averred in its motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss filed in the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations that "* * * this case is purely and exclusively a claim for sums of money supposedly owing to certain 'persons, <i>most </i> of&nbsp; whom&nbsp; have long ago severed their connections with the&nbsp; Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; Company * * **&nbsp; (Annex-C), thereby implying that some of them were still in its&nbsp; employ. And in its own memorandum&nbsp; filed in&nbsp; this "Court the petitioner admits that "some of the claimants, not more than 60, have been employed anew by the petitioner"&nbsp; As there exists an&nbsp; employer-employee relation between the petitioner&nbsp; and the&nbsp; claimants for back pay even with&nbsp; respect only&nbsp; to some of them, and their claim 1 for back pay is a potential source of dispute between management and labor, the respondent Court has jurisdiction to pass upon and decide the demand made by the respondents.<br><br>As the respondent Court has jurisdiction over the case, the order of 1 June 1955 deferring action on&nbsp; the petitioner's motion to&nbsp; dismiss is just interlocutory and can&nbsp; not.be appealed.<br><br>The petition is denied and the writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; heretofore issued&nbsp; discharged, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
