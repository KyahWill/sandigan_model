				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On January 14, 1955, the Philippine National Bank filed a complaint in&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Peace Court of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, against&nbsp; several defendants,&nbsp; among them&nbsp; appellant Felipe Quirino who was duly served with summons but&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to appear&nbsp; and&nbsp; answer&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; complaint on&nbsp; the date, place&nbsp; and time set&nbsp; in said&nbsp; summons.&nbsp;&nbsp; On motion of plaintiff&nbsp; bank, appellant Quirino was declared in&nbsp; default on February 15,&nbsp; 1955, and&nbsp; on February&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1955, the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to introduce&nbsp; its evidence.&nbsp; On the same day, judgment&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered in its&nbsp; favor and against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; February&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; appellant Quirino, learning&nbsp; of the judgment rendered against him, filed a&nbsp; "petition&nbsp; to lift order of default"&nbsp; with the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur.&nbsp; The hank tiled&nbsp; a motion to dismiss the petition on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; it stated no cause of&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting&nbsp; upon said&nbsp; petition to&nbsp; dismiss, the Court, presided by&nbsp; Judge Francisco Geronimo, found the petition to be&nbsp; "not sufficient&nbsp; in form and&nbsp; substance, for the relief&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 88 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court&nbsp; can only&nbsp; be availed&nbsp; of when the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; from which the relief&nbsp; is&nbsp; sought&nbsp; has already become final."&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court stated&nbsp; that the&nbsp; correct procedure followed for petitioner Quirino&nbsp; "should have been&nbsp; to file&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion in the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Court of Vigan, asking&nbsp; for the setting&nbsp; aside of&nbsp; the Judgment by default&nbsp; and for a&nbsp; new trial in accordance with section&nbsp; 16, Rule&nbsp; 4, of the Rules of Court, and&nbsp; that should, said&nbsp; petition be denied, then petitioner will' appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance." Consequently, the petition for&nbsp; relief was dismissed, without pronouncement as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; Defendant-petitioner&nbsp; is now appealing that order of dismissal&nbsp; direct to&nbsp; us. <br><br>We&nbsp; are in complete&nbsp; accord with&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; and counsel for the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; bank&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; position&nbsp; taken by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the&nbsp; appellant filed his petition&nbsp; for relief before the Court of First Instance, the&nbsp; judgment against him by the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace had&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; become final and executory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, relief under Rule&nbsp; 38 of the Rules of Court was not in order for the reason that&nbsp; said relief is available only <i>after</i> a decision or a judgment from which&nbsp; relief is&nbsp; sought'4s final and&nbsp; executory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; is our ruling in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Veluz vs. Justice of the Peace Court of&nbsp; Sariaya, 42 Phil. 557, wherein we said:<br><blockquote>"* * * *&nbsp; Certainly&nbsp; there is no&nbsp; occasion for&nbsp; putting&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggrieved&nbsp; person to the trouble&nbsp; of presenting" the&nbsp; petition permitted by said&nbsp; sections, to the Court of First Instance during&nbsp; that time when the trial court, upon its&nbsp; authority, may correct&nbsp; any&nbsp; error, mistake, or injustice which he has committed.&nbsp; <i>Said sections&nbsp; are only applicable after the judgment has become final&nbsp; and after the time has elapsed for perfecting an appeal.</i>&nbsp; A judge has an inherent&nbsp; right, while his judgment&nbsp; is still in bis control, to correct error, mistakes, or injustices. After the judgment has become final, he loses his right to change or modify it in the slightest&nbsp; decree, except for the purpose of&nbsp; correcting" clerical errors."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.) </blockquote>Before&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; relief from a&nbsp; decision rendered by a court,&nbsp; it&nbsp; should be given&nbsp; an&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; correct&nbsp; any mistake or&nbsp; injustice&nbsp; committed&nbsp; whenever&nbsp; possible,&nbsp; and this naturally is possible where said judgment has&nbsp; not&nbsp; yet become&nbsp; final.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law&nbsp; contemplates&nbsp; that relief may be sought and may be granted by the Court&nbsp; of First Instance where&nbsp; said&nbsp; relief is no longer&nbsp; available in the inferior court,&nbsp; because it has&nbsp; lost&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over the&nbsp; case by reason of the decision having become final.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no reason for the&nbsp; law requiring the aggrieved party to go to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance for relief and&nbsp; dragging to the&nbsp; same&nbsp; court the&nbsp; winning&nbsp; party,&nbsp; causing&nbsp; unnecessary expense and&nbsp; loss of time to&nbsp; both when&nbsp; the&nbsp; same relief, could&nbsp; be&nbsp; sought and granted in the Justice of the Peace Court,&nbsp; the court of origin. <br><br>Defendant-appellant&nbsp; contends that the&nbsp; only&nbsp; relief available to him&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace Court is that provided&nbsp; in <br><blockquote>Section 14, Rule 4, which reads as follows-, "Sec.&nbsp; 14. <i>Vacating dismissal&nbsp; and defaults</i>.—Within&nbsp; two hours after the entry&nbsp; of a dismissal or default,&nbsp; as&nbsp; provided in&nbsp; the&nbsp; last two preceding&nbsp; sections,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; may set made&nbsp; such&nbsp; entry&nbsp; and allow the party against whom such dismissal&nbsp; or default had&nbsp; been entered to have&nbsp; a&nbsp; trial upon the merits of&nbsp; the cause, if such party appears and makes&nbsp; it manifest to the&nbsp; court&nbsp; that his failure to appear at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; and place designated in the summons&nbsp; was, by reason&nbsp; of fraud, accident,&nbsp; or mistake."; </blockquote>and that after the expiration of said two hours,&nbsp; all. doors of relief&nbsp; are closed to&nbsp; him.&nbsp; But as&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; and counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee correctly maintain,&nbsp; even after the expiration of&nbsp; two&nbsp; hours&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; rendition&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the default judgment, within the period for&nbsp; appeal when&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; has not yet become final, the&nbsp; aggrieved party may, under section 16 of the same Rule 4 of the Rules of Court, still ask for&nbsp; new trial.Section 16&nbsp; provides: <br><blockquote> "Sec. 16. <i>New trial</i>.—Within the time provided for perfecting an appeal from a judgment rendered by an inferior&nbsp; court and before an appeal&nbsp; is so perfected,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; may grant&nbsp; a new&nbsp; trial to correct an error or injustice it may have committed."</blockquote>The case&nbsp; of Abadilla&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Manila, G. R.&nbsp; No. 48262,&nbsp; Lawyers' Journal, August 31, 1937, p. 744, is in point.&nbsp;&nbsp; In said case, the&nbsp; plaintiff filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; complaint in the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila and&nbsp; defendant was summoned to&nbsp; appear on August 10, 1984 and&nbsp; answer' the complaint.&nbsp; Defendant failed to appear on that date either personally&nbsp; or&nbsp; by&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; and judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; default against him was rendered.&nbsp; On August 81,&nbsp; 1984, defend- ant&nbsp; petitioned the reopening&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case and&nbsp; two&nbsp; days later, the Municipal&nbsp; Court set aside its&nbsp; decision&nbsp; and set the case for&nbsp; hearing.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration was presented&nbsp; by the plaintiff but it was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the case reached this&nbsp; Tribunal,&nbsp; we&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; that: <br><blockquote>The Municipal Court&nbsp; "not&nbsp; having lost all control to change, alter or modify&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; within its discretion, its previous&nbsp; decision might be&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; and a new trial&nbsp; or&nbsp; re-hearing granted.&nbsp; That is an inherent&nbsp; power of the courts as to&nbsp; decisions before&nbsp; they become final&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * *." </blockquote>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the appealed order of dismissal is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Jlndencia,</span>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ</span>.,&nbsp; concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><i>DISSENTING OPINION</i></center><br><br>Reyes, A., J., : <br><br>Ten days after he&nbsp; had been&nbsp; declared in default&nbsp; and seven&nbsp; days&nbsp; after&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; by&nbsp; default&nbsp;&nbsp; had been taken against him in the justice of the&nbsp; peace court, the defendant Felipe Quirino&nbsp; (appellant&nbsp; herein) filed&nbsp; a petition for relief&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance to have the&nbsp; said judgment set aside&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 1 of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 38,&nbsp; which reads: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. <i>Petition to&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance for relief&nbsp; from judgment of inferior&nbsp; court</i>.—When a judgment&nbsp; is rendered by an inferior&nbsp; court, and a party to&nbsp; the case, by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, has been unjustly deprived of a hearing therein,&nbsp; or&nbsp; has been prevented from taking an appeal, he may file a petition in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the province in "which the&nbsp; original judgment was&nbsp; rendered,&nbsp; praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; judgment bis set. aside and the case tried upon&nbsp; its merits." </blockquote>The petition&nbsp; was filed within the&nbsp; time, fixed in section&nbsp; 3 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; but&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; it&nbsp; as&nbsp; premature, and the&nbsp; majority of&nbsp; this Court sustain that&nbsp; ruling,&nbsp; declaring that relief under&nbsp; Rule 38 was&nbsp; not&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; on the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; that the judgment by default had&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; become&nbsp; final&nbsp; so that the&nbsp; defendant could still file a motion in the justice of&nbsp; the peace court "asking for the&nbsp; setting&nbsp; aside of the&nbsp; judgment by default and for a new trial in accordance with section 16 of&nbsp; Rule 4." <br><br>I cannot subscribe to this view. <br><br>Relief from default in the justice of the peace&nbsp; court is governed by the&nbsp; following provision of the&nbsp; Rules of Court: <br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 14. <i>Vacating&nbsp; dismissals&nbsp; and&nbsp; defaults</i>.—Within two hours&nbsp; after the entry of a&nbsp; dismissal or default, as provided in the&nbsp; last two preceding sections,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court may&nbsp; set aside such entry&nbsp;&nbsp; and allow the party&nbsp; against&nbsp; whom&nbsp; such&nbsp; dismissal or default&nbsp; had&nbsp; been entered to have a trial upon the merits&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause, if such party appears&nbsp; and makes it manifest&nbsp; to the&nbsp; court&nbsp; that&nbsp; his failure to appear at&nbsp; the time and place&nbsp; designated in the summons was by reason of fraud, accident or mistake."&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 14, Rule&nbsp; 4.) </blockquote>Note&nbsp; that the above section of&nbsp; Rule -1&nbsp; limits the time for setting aside an&nbsp; entry of default&nbsp; (so that the case may be tried on&nbsp; the merits) to two hours after such&nbsp; entry. It is a&nbsp; mistake&nbsp; to&nbsp; suppose that after the lapse of those two hours, the defendant in&nbsp; default may&nbsp; still come to the justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the peace court&nbsp; and ask for a new trial&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 16 of the same&nbsp; Rule, which&nbsp; says: <br><blockquote>"SEC. 16.&nbsp; <i>New trial</i>—Within the time&nbsp; provided for perfecting an appeal from a&nbsp; judgment rendered by an inferior court and before an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is so perfected, the&nbsp; court may grant a new&nbsp; trial to correct an&nbsp; error or injustice it may have committed.</blockquote>As will be&nbsp; noted, this section&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule 4 does&nbsp; not speak of default, while on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, it specifically&nbsp; refers to a case&nbsp; where an appeal may be perfected and is, therefore,&nbsp; not applicable&nbsp; where,&nbsp; as in the&nbsp; present case,&nbsp; an appeal is&nbsp; not&nbsp; allowed, it&nbsp; being&nbsp; settled doctrine that a defendant in default loses his standing in court and&nbsp; has&nbsp; no right to appeal from the judgment on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lim Toco&nbsp; vs. Pay&nbsp; 80 Phil. 166; Reyes vs. Catholic Archbishop of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; et al., <i>supra</i>; and&nbsp; Tecson vs. Melendres,&nbsp; 88 Phil.,&nbsp; 70S).&nbsp;&nbsp; To apply section&nbsp; 16 of Rule&nbsp; 4 to the present case&nbsp; is to make&nbsp; a mockery of this time-honored doctrine and make a dead letter&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 14 of the same Rule. <br><br>Under the Ruling&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; just cited, a&nbsp; defendant loses his standing in court once he is declared in default, and the only way he&nbsp; may regain such standing is through a&nbsp; petition for relief under section 14&nbsp; of Rule 4&nbsp; within two hours after the&nbsp; entry of default&nbsp; or under section 1 of Rule 88 if those two hours have already elapsed.&nbsp; Until the defendant has regained his standing in court through this procedure, he has no right to a new trial or to&nbsp; ask for a reconsideration of the judgment of default rendered against him. <br><br>As&nbsp; precedents for&nbsp; the rule&nbsp; they&nbsp; now want to&nbsp; adopt, the majority&nbsp; cite&nbsp; the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of Veins&nbsp; vs. Justice'&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace of&nbsp; Sariaya (42 Phil. 557) and Abadilla vs. Municipal Court of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; (G. R. No. 43282,&nbsp; Lawyer's Journal, August 31,&nbsp; 19S7, p. 744!).&nbsp; But these cases are hardly in point. <br><br>The Veluz&nbsp;&nbsp; case was not&nbsp; one of default&nbsp; as this Court took&nbsp; pains to&nbsp; point out in its&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; for' not only&nbsp; had defendants therein appeared and answered the complaint but the cause&nbsp; had thereafter been set down for trial several times.&nbsp; What&nbsp; happened is that on the&nbsp; last&nbsp; day set&nbsp; for trial&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of <br><br>&nbsp;the peace rendered judgment against them after&nbsp; hearing the plaintiff and his witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within an hour after the rendition of the judgment and&nbsp; after the plaintiff&nbsp; and his witnesses had left, the,defendants filed a motion to set aside the judgment&nbsp; under section 55 of Act 190 (now section 14, Rule 4) without serving copy thereof upon the plaintiff, and the latter upon learning of the same, filed his written opposition contending, among other&nbsp; things, that the judgment rendered by the justice of the peace was not a judgment by default as erroneously stated in his decision, so that,defendants' only remedy was by appeal to the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this opposition, however, the justice of the&nbsp; peace granted the motion and set aside his judgment.&nbsp; On the theory that the justice of the peace had exceeded his jurisdiction,&nbsp; the plaintiff petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to annul&nbsp; the&nbsp; order granting the motion.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this Court denied the writ, holding that until a decision becomes <i>final</i> it is under the control of the court; that it does not require statutory authority for a court to correct its error or mistakes during the time it has control over its&nbsp; decisions; and that&nbsp; since in&nbsp; actions of&nbsp; forcible entry and&nbsp; detainer the judgments of&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of the peace do not become final&nbsp; for a period of five days (section 88, Act&nbsp; 190), the justice of&nbsp; the peace may,&nbsp; during that period, correct or modify such judgments or grant a new&nbsp; trial if he discovers that an error or mistake has&nbsp; been committed.&nbsp; The case thus is&nbsp; authority for&nbsp; the proposition that a justice of the peace court has&nbsp; the inherent power to revoke or&nbsp; modify&nbsp; its judgment before the&nbsp; same has become final;&nbsp; but it in no way&nbsp; supports the view herein taken by the majority that&nbsp; a&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; who has&nbsp; been declared in default in the justice of the peace court may still, notwithstanding the fact&nbsp;&nbsp; that he has already lost his standing in court, file therein a motion other than that which, by express provision of the Rules (section 14,&nbsp; Rule 4), is&nbsp; authorized to&nbsp; be filed within two hours after the entry of default.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant's&nbsp; remedy after the lapse of those two hours&nbsp; is to&nbsp; ask for&nbsp; relief&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance in accordance with&nbsp; Rule 38,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that is precisely what the defendant in the present case did.&nbsp;&nbsp; To require&nbsp; him to file his motion in the justice of the peace court where he has already lost his legal&nbsp; standing would be to order him to do that which he is barred from doing.<br><br>In the&nbsp; other case cited by the&nbsp; majority—Abadilla vs. Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila, supra—-it&nbsp; appears that the defendant was summoned to appear on August 10,&nbsp; 1934 to answer the complaint in the municipal court of&nbsp; Manila, but&nbsp; having failed to appear personally on that day—although&nbsp; he did send an answer to the complaint—judgment by default was rendered against&nbsp; him on&nbsp; that&nbsp; same&nbsp; day. On August 21, 1.934 he&nbsp; petitioned&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; for&nbsp; the re- opening of the case and two days later the&nbsp; municipal judge entered an order setting aside his decision and&nbsp; again setting the case for hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question presented&nbsp; was whether the&nbsp; municipal judge&nbsp; exceeded&nbsp; his&nbsp; jurisdiction when he set aside&nbsp; his&nbsp; decision beyond the time—two hours—permitted&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 55&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act 190&nbsp; (now section 14 of Rule 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; Answering&nbsp; the question in the negative,&nbsp; this Court held that section 55 of Act 190 did not apply and that&nbsp; <i>the facts disclosed were closely enough&nbsp; analogous to those found in the ease of Veluz&nbsp; vs. Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace of Sariaya, supra, to require&nbsp; that a similar ruling be made</i>. "In&nbsp; other words," we there said, "the court not having lost&nbsp; all control to change, alter, or&nbsp; modify a&nbsp; judgment within&nbsp; its discretion,&nbsp; its&nbsp; previous&nbsp; decision might be set aside and a&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial or rehearing granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; is an inherent power of the courts as to decisions&nbsp; before&nbsp; they become final, and the same rule would apply here."&nbsp; Needless&nbsp; to&nbsp; say,&nbsp; this&nbsp; case only reiterated&nbsp; the doctrine&nbsp; laid down in the Veluz case&nbsp; that before the judgment of an inferior court has become final&nbsp; that court&nbsp; has&nbsp; the inherent&nbsp; power to revoke or modify it.&nbsp; And since this the court may do <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span>, it is immaterial&nbsp; whether a petition for that purpose has been made&nbsp; or&nbsp; not.&nbsp; It follows that&nbsp; like&nbsp; the Veluz&nbsp; case the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Abadilla&nbsp; vs. Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Manila, supra,&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; authority for holding that a&nbsp; defendant who&nbsp; has already&nbsp; been declared in default&nbsp; and as&nbsp; a consequence&nbsp; has lost&nbsp; his&nbsp; legal standing&nbsp; in court has still the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; file&nbsp; therein a&nbsp; motion to have the&nbsp; order of default stricken off otherwise&nbsp; than as authorized in section 14 of Rule 4. <br><br>For&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing reasons I vote to reverse the order complained from. <br><br><i>Reyes, ,J.
