				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from&nbsp; the order of Hon.&nbsp; Manuel P. Barcelona,&nbsp; Judge, Batangas&nbsp; court&nbsp; of&nbsp; first instance,&nbsp; dismissing plaintiff's complaint whereby&nbsp; demand was made against defendants for damages amounting to two thousand eight hundred pesos (P2,800).<br><br>The complaint alleged that&nbsp; while&nbsp; in the&nbsp; employ of defendant Foster Wheeler Corporation as a steel&nbsp; man, Victorino&nbsp; Manalo&nbsp; was&nbsp; accidentally struck&nbsp; by a&nbsp; steel plate and suffered injuries, for which he accordingly asked compensation in the sum above-mentioned.<br><br>Upon motion of defendants, His&nbsp; Honor dismissed the case on the ground&nbsp; that the court had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to entertain it.&nbsp; He cited section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation Act,&nbsp; which read as follows:<br><br>"Sec.&nbsp; 46. <i>Jurisdiction.</i> The Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commissioner shall have exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp; to hoar and decide claims for compensation&nbsp; under the Workmen's Compensation Act,&nbsp; subject to appeal to the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court, in the same manner and,in the same period&nbsp; as provided by law and by Rules of Court for appeal from the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations to the&nbsp; Supreme Court (See 24,&nbsp; Republic Act No. .772).&nbsp; ('Italics ours.)<br><br>Answering plaintiff's contention&nbsp; that the damages could be demanded and assessed under the Civil Code, (not under the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Law), His&nbsp; Honor&nbsp; quoted section 5 of the latter statute&nbsp; which is of the following tenor:<br><blockquote>"Sec, 5. <i>Exclusive right to compensation.</i>—The rights and remedies granted by this Act to an employee&nbsp; by reason of a personal injury entitling him to&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; shall exclude&nbsp; all other rights and remedies accruing&nbsp; to the employee, his personal representatives, dependents or nearest of tins against the&nbsp; employer under the Civil Code ,and other laws, because of said injury"&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>We are of the opinion that the law has been properly applied.&nbsp; It being&nbsp; quite clear,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no possibility of interpreting it—as appellant has tried to do—in the sense that "where claims for compensation have already been filed with the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission, no further claims for&nbsp; the <i>same injury</i>&nbsp; may be filed&nbsp; under either the New Civil Code or other laws."<br><br>The Legislature evidently deemed it best, in the interest of expediency and uniformity, that all claims&nbsp; of workmen against their&nbsp; employers for damages due to accidents suffered in the course of employment&nbsp; shall be investigated and adjudicated by the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission, subject&nbsp; to the appeal in the law provided.<br><br>This&nbsp; exclusive remedy&nbsp; and&nbsp; jurisdiction has been observed in two&nbsp; decisions of this Tribunal<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>&nbsp; which the trial judge correctly followed.<br><br>Judgment affirmed,&nbsp; without costs, this being a pauper's appeal.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </span></sup>Castro <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sagales, 50 off.
