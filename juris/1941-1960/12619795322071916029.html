				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On March&nbsp; 1, 1954,&nbsp; Chang Kim Timoteo Vergel&nbsp; de Dios filed an amended petition for naturalization in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Bulacan.&nbsp; After&nbsp; hearing, the trial court denied the petition&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that applicant had&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to establish to its&nbsp; satisfaction&nbsp; that he&nbsp; could speak and&nbsp; write English or Spanish.&nbsp; Petitioner is now appealing from that decision to us. <br><br>The evidence shows the following facts.&nbsp; Petitioner was born&nbsp; in&nbsp; Amoy,&nbsp; China on&nbsp; December&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1910&nbsp; and&nbsp; came to the Philippines on&nbsp; October 1, 1925 and since then had resided&nbsp; continuously in the Philippines&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; present time.&nbsp; On October 20, 1942,&nbsp; he married Socorro Ignacio, a pure Filipina of Plaridel, Bulacan, and by her he had six children, named Timoteo, Angelito,&nbsp; Norma, Jesus, Mario and Teresita,&nbsp; all surnamed Vergel&nbsp; de Dios; the first one born on July 15, 1944 and the last one on September&nbsp; 16, 1953.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were&nbsp; all baptized in the Roman Catholic Church.<br><br>Petitioner himself&nbsp; just before he married&nbsp; his wife was baptized&nbsp; as a&nbsp; catholic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of his children of school age are now going to school, one&nbsp; at a public school and&nbsp; the two others at a private school recognized by the Government, the&nbsp; St.&nbsp; James Institute&nbsp; of Plaridel. There is no question as to petitioner's good moral character. No less&nbsp; than the Mayor&nbsp; and the Vice-Mayor of Plaridel, his vouching witnesses, testified to&nbsp; that effect. Petitioner had&nbsp; identified himself&nbsp; so well with the com- munity wherein he lives, that is, Banga, Plaridel, Bulacan, that he was chosen Manager' of the Indoor Baseball League of Plaridel, to which (eague he had contributed generously in the form of uniforms and equipment for the players. During&nbsp; the&nbsp; war he joined the resistance movement and became a regular member&nbsp; of the guerrilla,&nbsp; and after the war, he&nbsp; was mustered out as sergeant of that organization by the United States Philippine Islands&nbsp; Forces,&nbsp; Kakarong Regiment, 2nd Brigade.&nbsp; For several&nbsp; years&nbsp; and up to the present time, he has been running a&nbsp; bakery, a hardware, and a sari-sari store in his place, which gave him a&nbsp; net income&nbsp; of&nbsp; P524.49&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; gross&nbsp; income&nbsp; of P14,691.75 in 1954.&nbsp; He had been paying his income taxes regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the employees&nbsp; in his establishments&nbsp; and business&nbsp; are all&nbsp; Filipinos.&nbsp; The very trial&nbsp; court would appear to have been fully&nbsp; satisfied with his qualifications and lack of disqualification for&nbsp; naturalization except his alleged deficiency in the knowledge of the English language. It is true that his knowledge of the said&nbsp; language is&nbsp; far from&nbsp; perfect,&nbsp; not even proficient, but&nbsp; as we have&nbsp; held in several naturalization cases,&nbsp; perfection and proficiency in either English or Spanish is not required of a petitioner for naturalization; and that it is enough that he spoke and wrote the language in such a manner that he could make himself understood in the community where he lives and could understand those dealing with him in said language.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> <br><br>At&nbsp; the hearing of&nbsp; his&nbsp; petition he&nbsp; testified partly&nbsp; in English and partly in Tagalog with preference for Tagalog because he said that he could express himself more clearly and satisfactorily&nbsp; in&nbsp; the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was asked to write out&nbsp; his answer to a question in English&nbsp; on&nbsp; a piece&nbsp; of paper,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "W".&nbsp; We have&nbsp; examined the said exhibit and, though far short of being a model in caligrjtphy and syntax, we&nbsp; are satisfied that it meets the&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; requirement of the law.&nbsp; We have been favorably impressed by&nbsp; the conduct and record of petitioner as&nbsp; a resident&nbsp; of Plaridel, Bulacan,&nbsp; prior to his application for&nbsp; naturalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; have considered&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; many cases&nbsp;&nbsp; of naturalization&nbsp; and we&nbsp; have&nbsp; seldom&nbsp; come across a more deserving applicant for Philippine citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp; His identifying himself with the&nbsp; Filipinos in his community to&nbsp; the extent&nbsp; of being elected&nbsp; Manager of the&nbsp; indoor baseball league&nbsp; in Plaridel, his&nbsp; joining&nbsp; the&nbsp; resistance&nbsp; movement,&nbsp; reaching the rank of&nbsp; sergeant when mustered out, hia marrying&nbsp; a Pilipina woman, his&nbsp; enrolling&nbsp; his children of school age in public&nbsp; and private schools&nbsp; (not Chinese), his conducting&nbsp; three kinds of business&nbsp; with&nbsp; substantial success and profit to himself and his family and employing an all Filipino&nbsp; force&nbsp; in said business,&nbsp; and the testimony of the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of&nbsp; Plaridel&nbsp; as&nbsp; to his&nbsp; good moral character and his having obtained&nbsp; a&nbsp; clearance from practically all municipal officials of Plaridel, including the Chief of Police, the Justice of the Peace, the Clerk of Court of&nbsp; Bulacan, the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal, the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Armed&nbsp; Forces of the&nbsp; Philippines (MIS), the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Prisons, the&nbsp; Bureau of Immigration, the Deportation Board,&nbsp; etc., all testify to&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; he would be a desirable and valuable citizen of the Philippines. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In&nbsp; view of the foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby&nbsp; reversed, and petitioner's application for naturalization&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.]<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<i>Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.
