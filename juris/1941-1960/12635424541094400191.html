				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Certiorari against  an  order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon. Ruperto Kapunan,  Jr.  presiding, ordering the  return to the complainant in criminal  case No. 34250,  People vs. Roberto Soto, of 100 sheets of galvanized iron roofing  which  had been sold by the accused in  said case to petitioner  herein,  Chua Hai.  The order is as follows: <br><blockquote>"Counsel for  the complainant  in this case seeks the  return of the  700 sheets  of  galvanized  iron now  with the Manila  Police Department which form part of the hardware materials involved in this case.  Chua Hai, one of the persons who purchased from the accused one  hundred (100)  pieces of the said galvanized  iron sheets, opposes the said motion on  the ground that the question of ownership  should be determined  in the proper proceedings, claiming that he has a valid title to the 100 pieces, having bought them from the accused  Roberto Soto on February 1, 1956.   Roberto Soto is presently at large,  his arrest having been ordered by this Court on June 13, 1956, for failure to appear for trial. <br><br>"Considering the provisions of Article 105  of the Revised Penal Code, the  said  700 sheets, except  five  of them  which are to be retained for purposes of evidence,  are hereby ordered  returned to the complainant, subject, however,  to the condition that the complainant post a bond in an amount equal to twice the value of 100 sheets in favor of Chua Hai who has a claim of ownership to the said 100 sheets, and without  prejudice  on the part of  said Chua Hai to file the corresponding action on the  matter of ownership thereof by virtue of his purchase from the herein accused."</blockquote>From the facts  alleged in the  pleadings  presented  in this case, we gather the following;: On  January 31, 1956, Roberto  Soto  purchased  from Youngstown  Hardware, owned by Ong Shu, 700 corrugated galvanized iron sheets and 249  pieces of round  iron  bar for  P6,137.70, and  in payment thereof  he issued  a  check drawn  against  the Security  Bank  and Trust Company for P7,000.00,  without informing Ong Shu that he had no sufficient  funds in  said bank to answer for the same.   When the  check was presented  for  payment, it was dishonored  for insufficiency of funds.  Soto sold 165 sheets in Pangasinan and 535  sheets in  Calapan, Mindoro.  Of  those  sold  in Pangasinan,  100 were sold to petitioner  Chua Hai.  When the case was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Roberto Soto, for  estafa, the offended  party filed a petition asking that the 700 galvanized iron sheets, which were  deposited  with the  Manila Police Department, be returned to him, as  owner of the Youngstown Hardware. Petitioner herein opposed  the motion with respect to the 100 sheets  that he had  bought  from Soto.  Notwithstanding  the opposition,  the court ordered  the return of the galvanized iron sheets to  Ong Shu.  Petitioner then presented a motion  to reconsider the order, alleging that by the return thereof to the  offended party, the court had not only violated the contract of deposit, because it was in that concept that  petitioner had delivered the 100 sheets to the Manila Police Department, and that said return to Ong Shu amounted to a deprivation of his property  without due process of  law.   It is  also  claimed that Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, under whose  authority the return was ordered,  can be invoked only  after the termination  of the  criminal  case and not  while  said criminal case is still pending trial. <br><br>The court having  given no heed to these protests  on the part of the petitioner, the latter brought the present petition  to this Court alleging that the  order  of  the respondent judge constitutes a deprivation of petitioner's property without due process of law, violating the contract of deposit under which the sheets  were  delivered to the police department of  the City of Manila, and determining the respective  rights of petitioner  and respondent  Ong Shu  without a  previous trial of  the criminal case—all of which constitute a grave abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction.  In answer to the petition, it is  claimed that  as respondent  Ong Shu is the owner of the property, he has the right to recover possession thereof even if said property appears to have  fallen  into the  possession of a third party who acquired it by legal  means, provided that said form of acquisition is  not that provided for in Article 464 of the Civil Code (where property has been  pledged in a  monte de piedad established under authority  of the Government) ; that even if the property was acquired in good  faith, the owner who has been unlawfully deprived thereof may recover it from the person in possession of the same unless a person in possession acquired it in good faith at a public sale.   (Art. 559, Civil Code of the Philippines).  It is also  claimed that  under the provisions of Article 105 of  the Revised  Penal  Code, under  which restitution is made  by a return of the  thing  itself whenever possible, the galvanized iron  sheets in  question should be returned to  the offended party,  the owner,  and that there is no provision  of law requiring that the criminal case must first be  finally  disposed  of  before restitution of the  goods swindled can be ordered returned  to  the owner.  In answer  to the  allegation that petitioner has been deprived of his property without due  process of law, it  is alleged that same is without foundation  because  the petitioner was given ample time  to be heard.  As to  the claim that  the  galvanized  iron  sheets  in  question were deposited  with the Manila Police Department,  it is  argued that the delivery to the Manila Police Department was by virtue of the order of the court, because the said sheets were the subject of  or are the instruments of the commission of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa,</span> and the court had the power to order  the return thereof to the owner  after it had satisfied itself  of the ownership  thereof by  the  offended party.  It is also alleged in defense that petitioner's rights, if any, are sufficiently protected by the  bond that the court has  required to be filed. <br><br>We find  the case  meritorious,  since  petitioner's good faith is not questioned.  To deprive the possessor in good faith, even  temporarily and provisionally,  of the chattels possessed, violates the rule of Art. 559 of the  Civil Code. The latter  declares  that  possession of  chattels  in good faith is <span style="font-style: italic;">equivalent to title</span>; i.e., that  for all intents and purposes, the  possessor is  the  owner,  until ordered by the proper court to restore the thing to the  one who was illegally deprived thereof.   Until such decree is  rendered (and it can <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span> be rendered in a criminal proceeding in which the  possessor is not  a party), the  possessor,  as presumptive owner, is entitled to hold and enjoy the thing; and "every possessor has a right to be respected in his possession;  and  should he be disturbed therein  he shall be protected in or restored to said possession  by the means established  by  the laws and the  Rules of  Court."  (Art. 539, New Civil Code). <br><br>The decision of the court below, instead of conforming to Arts. 559 and 539 of the Civil Code, directs  the possessor to surrender the chattel to  the claimant Ong  Shu before the latter has proved that he was illegally deprived thereof,  without taking into account that the mere filing  of a criminal action for <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> is no proof that <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was in fact committed.  Instead  of regarding  the  possessor  as the owner of the chattel until illegal  deprivation is shown, the  court below  regards the possessor of the  chattel not as an owner, but as a usurper, and compels him to surrender  possession even before the illegal  deprivation  is proved.  We see no warrant for such a reversal of legal rules. <br><br>It can not be assumed at this  stage of the proceedings that respondent Ong Shu is still the owner of the property; to  do so it take for granted that the <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was in fact committed,  when  so far, the trial  on the merits has not even started, and the presumption  of innocence holds full sway. <br><br>In the third place, the civil liability of the offender  to make restitution, under  Art.  105  of  the Revised Penal Code, <span style="font-style: italic;">does not arise</span> until his criminal liability  is finally declared, since the former is a consequence of the latter. Art. 105 of the Revised Penal Code,  therefore,  can not be invoked  to  justify the order of the court  below,  since that very article recognizes the title of an innocent purchaser when it says: <br><blockquote>"ART. 105. Restitution— *  *  * <br><br>The thing itself  shall be restored,  even though it be found  in the possession of a third  person who has acquired it by lawful means, saving to the latter his action against  the  proper person who may be  liable to him. <br><br>This provision  is <span style="font-style: italic;">not applicable</span> in cases in which the  <span style="font-style: italic;">thing has been acquired</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">by  the third person in the manner and under the requirements</span> which, by law, bar an action for its recovery."   (B.P.C.) (Italics supplied)</blockquote>The last paragraph of Article 105 plainly refers to those cases where recovery  is  denied by  the civil  law, notwithstanding the fact that the former owner was deprived of his chattels  through  crime.   One of these cases is that provided  for in Art. 85 of the Code of  Commerce: <br><blockquote>"ART. 85.—La  compra de  mercaderias en  almacenes  o tiendas abiertas al publico causara prescripcion de derecho a favor  del comprador respecto  de las mercaderias adquiridas, quedando   a salvo en su caso los derechos del propietario de los objetos vendidos para ejercitar las acciones  civiles o criminates que puedan corresponderle contra el que los vendiere indebidamente.   (Civ. 464)<br><br>Para los efectos de esta  prescripcion,  se reputaran almacenes o tiendas  abiertas  al publico: <br><ol><li>° Los que establezcan los comerciantes inscritos.<br><br> </li><li>° Los que establezcan los comerciantes no inscritos, siempre que los almacenes o tiendas permanezcan  abiertos al publico por espacio de echo dias  consecutivos, o se hayan anunciado por medio de  rotulos, muestras o titulos en el  local mismo, o por  avisos repartidos al publico o insertos en  los diarios de la  localidad."</li></ol></blockquote>Notwithstanding  the claim of some  authors that this Art. 85 has been repealed, the fact is that its  rule exists and has been confirmed  by Article 1505 of the new Civil Code: <br><blockquote>"ART. 1505. Subject to the provisions  of this  Title, where goods are sold by a person who is not  the owner thereof, and  who does not sell them under authority or with consent  of  the owner, the buyer acquires no better title to  the goods than  the seller had, unless the owner of the goods is by his  conduct  precluded  from denying the  seller's  authority to sell. <br><br>Nothing in  this Title, however, shall  affect: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * * * *<br></div><br>(3)  Purchases made in a merchant's store, or in fairs, or markets, in accordance with the Code of Commerce and special laws." (C.C.)</blockquote>But even if the articles in dispute had not been acquired in a market,  fair or  merchant's store, still, so  far as disclosed, the facts do not justify a finding that  the former owner, respondent Ong Shu, was  <span style="font-style: italic;">illegally</span> deprived of the iron sheets, at least in so far as appellant was concerned. It is not denied that Ong Shu delivered the sheets to Solo upon  a  perfected  contract  of sale,  and  such   delivery transferred title or  ownership to  the purchaser.   Says Art. 1496: <br><blockquote>"ART. 1496. The  ownership of the thing sold  is acquired by the vendee from the moment it is  delivered to him in any  of  the ways specified in articles 1497 to 1501, or in any other manner signifying an agreement that the possession  is transferred from the vendor to the  vendee."   (C.C.)</blockquote> The  failure of the  buyer to make good the  price  does not, in law, cause the ownership to revest in the  seller until and unless the bilateral contract of  sale is  first rescinded or resolved pursuant to Article 1191 of the new Civil Code. <br><br>And, assuming that the  consent of Ong Shu to the sale in favor of Sotto was  obtained by the latter through fraud or  deceit,  the contract was not  thereby  rendered  void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab  initio</span>, but only voidable  by reason  of the fraud, and Article 1390 expressly provides that: <br><blockquote>"ART. 1390. The following contracts  are voidable or  annullable, even though there may have been no damage  to  the contracting parties: <br><br>(1) Those where one of the parties is incapable of giving consent to a contract;                <br><br>(2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud. These contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification."  (C.C.) </blockquote>Agreeably to this provision, Article 1506 prescribes: <br><blockquote>"ART. 1506. Where the seller of goods has a voidable title thereto, but his title has not been avoided at the time of the sale, the buyer acquires a good title to  the goods, provided he buys them in good faith, for value, and without notice of the seller's defect of  title." (C.C.)</blockquote> Hence, until the contract  of Ong Shu with Soto is set aside by a competent court  (assuming  that the fraud  is established to its satisfaction), the validity of appellant's claim to the property in question can not be disputed, and his right to the possession thereof should be respected. <br><br>It is no excuse that the  respondent  Ong Shu was required  to post a  redelivery bond.   An indemnity bond, while answering for damages, is not, by itself alone,  sufficient reason for disturbing property rights, whether temporarily or permanently. If the invasion is not warranted, the filing of a bond will not make it justifiable. <br><br>Questions of ownership and possession being eminently eivil in character, they should not  be settled by  exclusive reference to the  Revised  Penal Code.  If  Ong  Shu has reason  to  fear that petitioner Chua Hai  may dispose of the chattels in dispute and  thereby render  nugatory his eventual right to restitution, then the proper remedy lies in a civil suit and attachment, not  in an order presuming to adjudicate  in  a criminal  case  the civil  rights of one who is not involved therein. <br><br>Summing up, we hold: <br><br>1)  That the acquirer and possessor in good faith, of a chattel  or movable  property is entitled to be respected and protected  in  his possession,  as  if he  were the true owner thereof,  until a competent court  rules otherwise;<br><br>2)  That being considered, in the meantime, as the true owner, the possessor in good faith can not be compelled to surrender possession nor  to be required to institute  an action for the  recovery of the chattel, whether or not  an Indemnity bond is issued in his favor; <br><br>3)  That the filing of an information charging that the chattel was illegally obtained through <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> from its true owner by the transferor of the  <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> possessor does not warrant disturbing the possession of the chattel against the will  of the possessor;  and <br><br>4)  That the judge  taking cognizance of the criminal case  against the  vendor  of the possessor  in good faith has not right to interfere with  the possession of the latter, who is not a party to the criminal proceedings, and such unwarranted interference  is not  made justifiable  by requiring  a  bond  to  answer for damages  caused  to  the possessor. <br><br>Wherefore, the  writ  of  certiorari  is granted, and the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Criminal Case  No. 34250, dated  July 31, 1956,  is hereby revoked and set aside, as issued in abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction.   Costs  against appellant Ong Shu. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia,</span> JJ., concur. <br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FELIX</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">J</span>., <br><br>The issue in this case  revolves around the proposition of whether  or not "goods purchased by an accused,  for which he paid with a rubber check, can be seized from a third party  who bought the same in good faith and for a  valuable consideration  before the offender, who  was charged with <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, is tried and convicted."<br><br>I  concur  with  the  reasons  adduced  in  the  majority decision but the main basis of my vote with the majority of the Court is based  on the principle that Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code relied upon by the lower Court for the issuance of the order which We  revoked and  set aside  in  this instance,  cannot be invoked and made applicable to the case at bar. <br><br>As it is known, among the civil liabilities established by Articles 100 to 103 of the Revised Penal Code restitution is included and Article 105  of the same Code dealing on restitution, provides the following: <br><blockquote>ART.  105. <span style="font-style: italic;">Restitution</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">How  Made</span>.—The restitution of the <span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">itself must be made  whenever possible,</span> with  allowance  for  the deterioration or diminution of  value  as determined by the court. <br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">thing itself </span>shall be restored, even though it be found in the possession  of a third person who has acquired it by lawful means, saving  to the latter his action against the proper person who may be liable  to him. <br><br>This  provision <span style="font-style: italic;">is not applicable in  cases in which the thing  has been acquired by the  third person in the manner and under the requirements which, by law, bar an action for its recovery.</span></blockquote>There  is no dispute that petitioner herein, Chua Hai, purchased from Roberto Sotto  100 sheets  of galvanized iron roofing  in good faith and for value, and there is no denial either that this  stock comes from and is a part of the 700  sheets that Roberto Sotto bought and paid with a check that bounced for lack of funds.   Under such circumstances,  there is no question that the  purchase was perfected by the agreement of  the respondent Ong Shu and  defendant Sotto and as a consequence of the transaction, upon delivery of the  sheets to the latter, ownership of the same was conveyed and  transferred  <span style="font-style: italic;">legally</span> to the purchaser who, from that moment, with  or without payment of  the  consideration therefor  was  in  turn entitled to sell and convey all  or a portion of  the property in question  to  a third party who definitely  acquired said goods, specially when he acted in good faith  and for value. Had those goods  been sold  on credit by  Ong Shu to Roberto  Sotto,  the failure of the latter to pay the purchase price  thereof  would  not entitle the  vendor, under the circumstances  obtaining  in  the  instant case, to  take the goods  from Chua Hai and much less without a previous court action.   And the same thing can be said in the case at  bar where  the vendor was induced to  part  with his property by the issuance of a rubber check.  Both in the case of sale on credit as well as in the case of sale through the payment with rubber check, the transaction is perfected and the transfer of ownership verified, the difference being only circumscribed to the liability of the first purchaser  (Sotto)  which in the first case would be merely civil, while in  the latter  case is also criminal.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> The first sale of the property having been legally consummated, the 100  sheets of  galvanized iron  herein involved  could not be recovered from Chua  Hai even in case of Sotto's conviction of estafa,  because under the terms of Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, the <span style="font-style: italic;">restitution of the thing is not possible  for the reason  that said thing  has  been acquired by the third persons  (Chua Hai) in the manner and under  the requirements which</span> (in addition to  the  other means enumerated in  the majority decision) <span style="font-style: italic;">bar, by law</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">an action for its recovery.</span>  I am, therefore, of the opinion and thus hold  that  in cases where the  ownership  of the effects of the crime has  already been transferred by the offender to an  innocent third party, the restitution of the <span style="font-style: italic;">thing itself</span> referred to in Article 105 of  the Revised Penal Code must necessarily be limited  to  cases in  which the offended party was  <span style="font-style: italic;">illegally deprived</span> of the property involved  in the crime committed, such as in cases of robbery and  theft,  but  not to  cases  wherein the offended party has not been deprived of  his property which he delivered to the purchaser with the expectation, of course, of receiving the consideration  of the sale. <br><br>I, therefore, concur in the majority decision penned by Mr. Justice J. B.  L.  Reyes.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>See People vs. Ma Su (Chino), 90 Phil., 706. <br><br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING<br><br></span><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="justify">LABRADOR, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">J</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.,</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: normal;">I dissent. Before proceeding to the discussion of the facts it seems necessary for an understanding of this dissent that this is a certiorari originally instituted in this Court against an order of Judge Ruperto Kapunan, Jr. of the Court of First Instance of Manila. As a case of certiorari, not a petition for review, the only pertinent issue, as I see it, is whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the order against which the petition is instituted was issued in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. The order issued by the respondent judge was provisional in character, subject to the outcome of the criminal case and any other future litigation respecting the property subject of the proceedings.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The certiorari seeks to set aside the order for the return to the complainant in criminal case No. 34250, People vs. Roberto Soto, of 100 sheets of galvanized iron roofing which had been sold by the accused in said case to petitioner herein, Chua Hai. The order is as follows:</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><blockquote>"Counsel for the complainant in this case seeks the return of the 700 sheets of galvanized iron now with the Manila Police Department which form part of the hardware materials involved in this case. Chua Hai, one of the persons who purchased from the accused one hundred (100) pieces of the said galvanized iron sheets, opposes the said motion on the ground that the question of ownership should be determined in the proper proceedings, claiming that he has a valid title to the 100 pieces, having bought them from the accused Roberto Soto on February 1, 1956. Roberto Soto is presently at large, his arrest having been ordered by this Court on June 13, 1956, for failure to appear for trial.<br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"Considering the provisions of Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, the said 700 sheets, except five of them which are to be retained for purposes of evidence, are hereby ordered returned to the complainant, subject, however, to the condition that the complainant post a bond in an amount equal to twice the value of 100 sheets in favor of Chua Hai who has a claim of ownership to the said 100 sheets, and without prejudice on the part of said Chua Hai to file the corresponding action on the matter of ownership thereof by virtue of his purchase from the herein accused."</span></blockquote></span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">From the facts alleged in the pleadings prescribed in this case, we gather the following: On January 31, 1956, Roberto Soto purchased from Youngstown Hardware, owned by Ong Shu, 700 corrugated galvanized iron sheets and 249 pieces of round iron bar for P6,137.70, and in payment thereof he issued a check drawn against the Security Bank and Trust Company for P7,000.00, without informing Ong Shu that he had no sufficient funds in said bank to answer for the same. When the check was presented for payment it was dishonored for insufficiency of funds. Soto sold 165 sheets in Pangasinan and 535 sheets in Calapan, Mindoro. Of those sold in Pangasinan, 100 was sold to petitioner Chua Hai. When the case was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Roberto Soto, for estafa, the offended party filed a petition asking that the 700 galvanized iron sheets which were deposited with the Manila Police Department be returned to him, as owner of the Youngstown Hardware. Petitioner herein opposed the motion with respect to the 100 sheets that he had bought from Soto. Notwithstanding the opposition the court ordered the return of the galvanized iron sheets to Ong Shu. Petitioner then presented a motion to reconsider the order, alleging that by the return thereof to the offended party, the court had not only violated the contract of deposit, because it was in that concept that petitioner had delivered the 100 sheets to the Manila Police Department, and that said return to Ong Shu amounted to a deprivation of his property without due process of law. It is also claimed that Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, under whose authority the return was ordered, can be invoked only after the termination of the criminal case and not while said criminal case is still pending trial.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The court giving no heed to these protests on the part of the petitioner, the latter brought the present petition to this Court alleging that the order, of the respondent judge constitutes a deprivation of petitioner's property without due process of law, violating the contract of deposit under which the sheets were delivered to the police department of the City of Manila, and determining the respective rights of petitioner and respondent Ong Shu without a previous trial of the criminal case—all of which constitute a grave abuse of discretion and excess of jurisdiction. In answer to the petition it is claimed that as respondent Ong Shu is the owner of the property, he has the right to recover possession thereof even if said property appears to have fallen into the possession of a third party who acquired it by legal means, provided that said form of acquisition is not that provided for in Article 464 of the Civil Code (where property has been pledged in a <span style="font-style: italic;">monte de piedad</span> established under authority of the Government); that even if the property was acquired in good faith, the owner who has been unlawfully deprived thereof may recover it from the person in possession of the same unless a person in possession acquired it in good faith at a public sale (Art. 559, Civil Code of the Philippines). It is also claimed that under the provisions of Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code, under which restitution is made by a return of the thing itself whenever possible, the galvanized iron sheets in question should be returned to the offended party, the owner, and that there is no provision of law requiring that the criminal case must first be finally disposed of before restitution of the goods swindled can be ordered returned to the owner. In answer to the allegation that petitioner has been deprived of his property without due process of law, it is alleged that same is without foundation because the petitioner was given ample time to be heard. As to the claim that the galvanized iron sheets in question were deposited with the Manila Police Department, it is argued that the delivery to the Manila Police Department was by virtue of the order of the court, because the said sheets were the subject of or are the instruments of the commission of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, and the court had the power to order the return thereof to the owner after it had satisfied itself of the ownership thereof by the offended party. It is also alleged in defense that petitioner's rights, if any, are sufficiently protected by the bond that the court has required to be filed.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I find no merit in the contention that petitioner was deprived of the possession and ownership of the galvanized iron sheets without due process of law, it appearing that sufficient opportunity was given him to explain his right to the possession and ownership thereof when he presented him motion for reconsideration which the court heard and which it finally denied. The claim that the respective rights of the petitioner and the respondent owner can only be decided in the final criminal action is also without merit. The criminal case seeks to determine the fact of the commission of the crime by the accused. When as in this case it cannot be seriously contended that the galvanized iron sheet in question were not the ones that the accused had taken away from the offended party by illegal means, there is no advantage to be gained by postponing the determination of the ownership of the stolen property as between the offended party and the purchaser. Anyway, the order of the court is merely provisional in character and it is expressly provided therein that the claims of the parties to the property are to be determined in the final action that the petitioner may file, if he desires to do so.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The decision of the majority supposedly rests on the provisions of Article 599 of the Civil Code, which is as follows:</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><blockquote>"The possession of movable property acquired in good faith is equivalent to a title. Nevertheless, one who has lost any movable or has been unlawfully deprived thereof, may recover it from the person in possession of the same. <br><br>"If the possessor of a movable lost or of which the owner has been unlawfully deprived, has acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the owner can not obtain its return without reimbursing the price paid therefor."</blockquote></span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">We fully agree with the majority that this Article covers the case, but we are of the humble opinion that the provision that is applicable is not paragraph 1, but paragraph 2. Granting that the petitioner was a possessor in good faith, the facts disclosed not by the information alone, but by the motion for the return of the goods and other parts of the record show that these movable properties used to belong to the respondent Ong Shu and that he was deprived thereof unlawfully because a certain person purchased it with a bogus check. As between the purchaser and Ong Shu, the lawful owner, even if the former is clothed with all the good faith, the owner of the property Ong Shu has a better right to recover possession thereof. The criminal law provides that the subject of a crime can always be recovered from whoever is in possession of the same, irrespective of the good faith of the possessor. Were we to adopt the ruling of the majority, we will be encouraging crooks because by artful connivance with supposed buyers in good faith (and the worst part of it is good faith is always presumed), we will have a holiday for crooks, thieves and robbers.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">While it is true that the information does not deny the good faith of petitioner, but as against that of the lawful owner, Ong Shu, the latter should be given preference.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">It is not disputed that the respondent Ong Shu was originally the lawful owner. If that is so and he was deprived of the property by a criminal act, how can such ownership now have been destroyed and can now be denied. The only way by which the petitioner, the buyer from the thief, can be protected in his possession is by applying the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 599 of the Civil Code, which reads:</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><blockquote>"If the possessor of a movable lost or of which the owner has been unlawfully deprived, has acquired it in good faith at a public sale, the owner can not obtain its return without reimbursing the price paid therefor."</blockquote></span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Note that we have underlined the words public sale. This he has not proved and no evidence has been shown or is insinuated in the record. Even if he had acquired it at public sale, the right for reimbursement of the price still remains. The price is fully guaranteed by the bond approved by the court.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><br style="font-weight: normal;"></div><div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div></span></div></div></div>
