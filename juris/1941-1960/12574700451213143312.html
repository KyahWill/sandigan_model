				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Alleging abandonment and concubinage, plaintiff Socorro Matubis, filed with 
the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, on April 24, 1956, a complaint for 
Legal Separation and change of surname against her husband defendant Zoilo 
Praxedes.
<p>The allegations of the complaint were denied by defendant spouse, who 
interposed the defense that it was plaintiff who left the conjugal home.</p>
<p>During the trial, wherein the plaintiff alone introduced oral as well as 
documentary evidence, the following facts were established:</p>
<p>Plaintiff and defendant were legally married on January 10, 1943, at Iriga, 
Camarines Sur. For failure to agree on how they should live as husband and wife, 
the couple, on May 30, 1944, agreed to live separately from each other, which 
status remained unchanged until the present. On April 3, 1948, plaintiff and 
defendant entered into an agreement (Exhibit B), the significant portions of 
which are hereunder reproduced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * (<em>a</em>) That both of us relinquish our right over the other aa 
legal husband and wife.</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) That both of us is free to get any mate and live with as husband 
and wife without any interference by any of us, nor either of us can prosecute 
the other for adultery or Concubinage or any other crime or suit arising from 
our separation.</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) That I, the wife, is no longer entitled for any support front my 
husband or any benefits he may receive thereafter, nor I the husband is not 
entitled for anything from my wife.</p>
<p>(<em>d</em>) That neither of us can claim anything from the other from the 
time we verbally separated, that is from May 30, 1944 to the present when we 
made our verbal separation into writing."</p></blockquote>
<p>In January, 1955, defendant began cohabiting with one Asuncion Rebulado and 
on September 1, 1955, said Asuncion gave birth to a child who was recorded as 
the child of said defendant (Exh. C). It was shown also that defendant and 
Asuncion deported themselves as husband and wife and were generally reputed as 
such in the community.</p>
<p>After the trial, without the defendant adducing any evidence, the court <em>a 
quo</em> rendered judgment holding that the acts of defendant constituted 
concubinage, a ground for legal separation. It, however, dismissed the complaint 
by stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While this legal ground exists, the suit must be dismissed for two reasons, 
viz.:</p>
<p>Under Art. 102 of the new Civil Code, an action for legal separation cannot 
be filed except within one year from and after the date on which the plaintiff 
became cognizant of the cause and within five years from and after the date when 
the cause occurred. The plaintiff became aware of the illegal cohabitation of 
her husband with Asuncion Rebulado in January, 1955. The complaint was filed on 
April 24, 1956. The present action was, therefore, filed out of time and for 
that reason the action is barred.</p>
<p>Article 100 of the new Civil Code provides that the legal separation may be 
claimed only by the innocent spouse, provided there has been no condonation of 
or consent to the adultery or concubinage. As shown in Exhibit B, the plaintiff 
has consented to the commission of concubinage by her husband. Her consent is 
clear from the following stipulations: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'(b) That both of us is free to get any mate and live with as husband and 
wife without any interference by any of us, nor either of us can prosecute the 
other for adultery or concubinage or any other crime or suit arising from our 
separation.' (Exh. B).</p></blockquote>
<p>This stipulation is an unbridled license she gave her husband to commit 
concubinage. Having consented to the concubinage, the plaintiff cannot claim 
legal separation."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above decision is now before us for review, plaintiff-appellant claiming 
that it was error for the lower court to have considered that the period to 
bring the action has already elapsed and that there was consent on the part of 
the plaintiff to the concubinage. The proposition, therefore, calls for the 
interpretation of the provisions of the law upon which the lower court based its 
judgment of dismissal.</p>
<p>Article 102 of the new Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An action for legal separation cannot be filed except within one year from 
and after the date on which the plaintiff became cognizant of the cause and 
within five years from and after the date when such cause 
occurred."</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint was filed outside the periods provided for by the above 
Article. By the very admission of plaintiff, she came to know the ground 
(concubinage) for the legal separation in January, 1955. She instituted the 
complaint only on April 24, 1956. It is to be noted that appellant did not even 
press this matter in her brief.</p>
<p>The very wording of the agreement Exhibit B, gives no room for interpretation 
other than that given by the trial judge. Counsel in his brief submits that the 
agreement is divided into two parts. The first part having to do with the act of 
living separately which he claims to be legal, and the second part-that which 
becomes a license to commit the ground for legal separation, which is admittedly 
illegal. We do not share appellant's view. Condonation and consent on the part 
of plaintiff are necessarily the import of paragraph 6(b) of the agreement. The 
condonation and consent here are not only implied but expressed. The law (Art. 
100 Civil Code), specifically provides that legal separation may be claimed only 
by the innocent spouse, provided there has been no condonation of or consent to 
the adultery or concubinage. Having condoned and/or consented in writing, the 
plaintiff is now undeserving of the court's sympathy (People <em>vs</em>. 
Schnecken-burger, 73 Phil., 413). Plaintiff's counsel even .agrees that the 
complaint should be dismissed. He claims, however, that the grounds for the 
dismissal should not be those stated in the decision of the lower court, "but on 
the ground that plaintiff and defendant have already been <em>legally</em> 
separated from each other, but without the marital bond having been affected, 
long before the effectivity of the new Civil Code" (appellant's brief, pp. 7-8). 
Again, we cannot subscribe to counsel's contention, because it is contrary to 
the evidence.</p>
<p>Conformably with the foregoing, we find that the decision appealed from is in 
accordance with the evidence and the law on the matter. The same is hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David. JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
