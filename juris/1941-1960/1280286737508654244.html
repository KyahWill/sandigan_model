				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 4, 1948, the accused was charged in the Justice of the Peace 
Court of Tanjay, Oriental Negros, with the crime of less serious physical 
injuries for having inflicted on the right arm of Fortunato Sanoy injuries 
which, according to the complaint, would take "from 20 to 30 days to heal." 
Pleading guilty to the complaint, the accused was on that same day convicted of 
the crime charged and sentenced to 2 months and 1 day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, 
and two days later he began to serve his sentence. It would seem, however, that 
Sanoy's injuries did not heal within the period formerly estimated, and so, on 
March 12, 1948, the provincial fiscal filed an information in the same court 
charging the accused with serious physical injuries. Again the accused pleaded 
guilty whereupon he was bound over to the Court of First Instance. There the 
provincial fiscal, on May 5, 1948, filed the corresponding information for the 
said crime, alleging that the wounds inflicted by the accused on the right hand 
of Fortunato Sanoy required medical attendance and incapacitated him for labor 
for a period of more than 90 days, causing deformity and the loss of the use of 
said member. The accused moved to have this last information quashed on the 
ground that it put him twice in jeopardy, and as the motion was granted, the 
fiscal appealed to this Court.
<p>The Constitution enjoins that "no person shall be twice put in jeopardy or 
punished for the same offense." (Art. III, Section 1 [20].) In an attempt to 
implement this constitutional mandate, the Rules of Court (Rule 113, Section 9) 
make conviction or acquittal of the accused a bar to his subsequent prosecution, 
not only for the same offense, but also "for any offense which necessarily 
includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former 
complaint or information." In the present case there is no question that the 
offense of serious physical injuries charged in the last information necessarily 
includes the lesser offense charged in the first complaint and of which the 
accused was convicted in the justice of the peace court, and there should 
likewise be no question that, were we to follow the doctrine laid down by this 
Court in People <em>vs</em>. Tarok, 40 Off. Gaz. 3488), and reiterated in People 
<em>vs</em>. Villasis, (46 Off. Gaz. [Supp. to No. 1], p. 268<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>) we would have no alternative but to 
dismiss the present appeal. However, this Court in its recent decision in the 
case of Conrado Melo <em>vs</em>. People, et al., (85 Phil., 974), has already 
repealed the doctrine laid down in the Tarok case as contrary to the real 
meaning of double jeopardy as intended by the Constitution and the Rules of 
Court and "obnoxious to the administration of justice," and has reverted to the 
rule that "where after the first prosecution a new fact supervenes for which the 
defendant is responsible, which changes the character of the offense and, 
together with the facts existing at the time, constitutes a new and distinct 
offense (15 Am. Jur. 66), the accused cannot be said to be in second jeopardy if 
indicted for the new offense." That rule applies to the present case where, 
after the first prosecution for a lesser crime, new facts have supervened which, 
together with those already in existence at the time of the first prosecution, 
have made the offense graver and the penalty first imposed legally 
inadequate.</p>
<p>Wherefore, following the ruling laid down in the said case of Melo 
<em>vs</em>. People et al, <em>supra</em>, the order appealed from is hereby 
revoked and the respondent court ordered to proceed with the trial of the case 
under the new information, but with the understanding that, in case of 
conviction for the second offense, the accused be credited with the penalty 
already suffered by him under the first conviction. Without costs.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Padilla, </i>and <i>Tuason, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><br><br>
