				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Pampanga, Hon. Massimo Abano, presiding, prohibiting Lorenzo D. Licup, Justice&nbsp; of the Peace of Clark Field, from&nbsp; taking cognizance of Criminal Case No. 523 filed in said justice of the peace court and entitled The People of the Philippine <i>vs.</i> Cayetano B.&nbsp; Liwanag, accused, for violation&nbsp; of section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code.<br><br>In said criminal case, Robert S. Hamill, Major, USAF, Assistant Base Provost Marshal,&nbsp; Clark&nbsp; Air Force Base, province of Pampanga, filed an amended complaint against Liwanag for violation of section 174 of the Internal Revenue . Code.&nbsp; It is alleged in the&nbsp; amended complaint that Liwanag, "a private individual, without authority whatsoever,&nbsp; and without paying the corresponding specific tax of Two Pesos&nbsp; (P2) per cartoon, * * *, did then&nbsp; and there willfully, unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously, possess and have in his control seventeen cartoons of imported free of tax American cigarettes for use only of the US Military and Naval Forces stationed in the Philippines * * *."&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint was subscribed and sworn to before Judge Lorenzo T. Licup. Counsel for Liwanag moved to quash the complaint in the Justice of the Peace Court,&nbsp; but this was denied.&nbsp; There upon&nbsp; Liwanag filed a petition&nbsp; for prohibition&nbsp; with the Court of&nbsp; First Instance, alleging i;hat&nbsp; Robert S. Hamill has no personal capacity to subscribe to the complaint and the Justice of the Peace court, therefore, acquired no jurisdiction to&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; the&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation The Court of&nbsp; First Instance held that respondent Robert S. Hamill is not&nbsp; a peace&nbsp; officer of the Republic of the Philippines and, therefore, is not authorized to file a&nbsp; complaint in accordance with section&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 106 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Against this&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; the complainant Robert S. s Hamill has filed this appeal.<br><br>We note that the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; should have been prosecuted in the name&nbsp; of the&nbsp; People of the Philippines,&nbsp; which is the offended party and the plaintiff in the criminal case filed against accused Cayetano&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Liwanag.&nbsp; When Liwanag, however, filed&nbsp; his&nbsp; petition for prohibition,&nbsp; he predicated his action oh&nbsp; the claim that Robert S. Hamill&nbsp; is not an officer of the Government of the Philippines and can not represent, the plaintiff, the People of the Philippines, in the criminal case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, in accordance&nbsp; with this theory, the&nbsp; People&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines was not made a party in the prohibition ease.&nbsp; This theory was sustained by the lower court.&nbsp; The real party in interest is not Robert S. Hamill, but the People of the&gt; Philippines, although the complaint .was&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by Hamill.&nbsp; However, we assume, for purposes of the appeal, that Hamill&nbsp; is representing the People, of the Philippines,&nbsp; as he represented it&nbsp; when he filed the amended complaint.<br><br>It is admitted that the Provost Marshal&nbsp; of Clark&nbsp; Field is a peace officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Provost Marshals&nbsp; in Army&nbsp; bases are police&nbsp; officers, and&nbsp; they have&nbsp; the powers&nbsp; and&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of chiefs of police in&nbsp; municipalities.<br><blockquote>"An officer appointed in an army iircamp, garrison, or the field, to preserve order&nbsp; as head of the&nbsp; military police, arrest soldiers guilty of offenses&nbsp; of a general nature, secure prisoners properly delivered into&nbsp; his .custody&nbsp; by military or naval&nbsp; authority, and to perform other duties pertaining to police and discipline."&nbsp; (Webster's International Dictionary, second edition, unabridged, p. 1995.)<br></blockquote>The essence of the decision appealed from is that as the Provost Marshal of Clark Field is not a peace officer of the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines, he is not authorized to&nbsp; file a complaint for violation of the Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; We find this&nbsp; theory to&nbsp; be incorrect.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement between the Republic&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines and the United States of America,&nbsp; for the establishment of bases by the latter within the territory of the former, laws of the Philippines continue to&nbsp; be in force in said bases&nbsp; except when otherwise&nbsp; agreed upon in&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; And&nbsp; for the purpose of hearing eases therein, justices of the peace are appointed and hold&nbsp; office.&nbsp; They are not appointed by the United States of America, but by the President of the Philippines, subject to confirmation by the Commission, on Appointments.&nbsp; But other than&nbsp; justices&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace, no other&nbsp; officers of the Republic of the Philippines are appointed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the bases, much&nbsp; less peace officers, although agents of the Republic of the Philippines may have access in the bases to&nbsp; see that the laws of the Philippines are enforced.&nbsp; But the question of peace and order within the bases is&nbsp; left to peace officers of the United States of America, the&nbsp; chief of whom is the provost marshal.&nbsp; To allow peace&nbsp; officers&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Republic&nbsp; to go therein and&nbsp; make arrests or institute prosecutions for violation of Philippine laws would certainly give occasion for conflicts of authority.&nbsp; So no provision is made for the appointment of peace&nbsp; officers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Republic of the Philippines within the bases, and it is understood that the enforcement of Philippines laws is left to the officers of the United States of America.&nbsp; It is illogical to deny to these peace officers (of the&nbsp; United States)&nbsp; the power to prosecute&nbsp; violations of Philippine&nbsp; laws in&nbsp; the&nbsp; military bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since&nbsp; these bases were&nbsp; established the Republic of the Philippines has abstained from appointing peace officers of its own; this must have been with the understanding that the.execution of Philippine laws would be taken care of&nbsp; therein by the peace&nbsp; officers of the United States of America.&nbsp; It would be inconvenient if not detrimental to the enforcement of the laws of&nbsp; the Philippines for&nbsp; peace officers&nbsp; of the Republic of the Philippines alone to be the ones authorized to prosecute offenses before the justice of the peace courts established&nbsp; in the&nbsp; bases.&nbsp; It is,&nbsp; furthermore,&nbsp; technical ceremony to allow a provost&nbsp; marshal to apprehend&nbsp; violators of&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; laws and deny him&nbsp; the authority to prosecute such offenses before a Philippine court established inside the bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was never&nbsp; in the&nbsp; contemplation of the parties when the agreements regarding&nbsp; the&nbsp; bases were entered into.&nbsp; The absence of peace&nbsp; officers&nbsp; of the Republic of the Philippines in these bases is due to the fact that the enforcement and prosecution of offenses&nbsp; against Philippine laws was intended to be lodged with the peace officers of the United States of America.<br><br>We&nbsp; hold that provost marshals&nbsp; in&nbsp; military bases established&nbsp; by agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States&nbsp; of America&nbsp; have the power&nbsp; and . authority to file complaints for violation of Philippine laws. The decision appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and the action&nbsp; for&nbsp; prohibition,,&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the petitioner-appellee Cayetano B.&nbsp; Liwanag.<br><br><i>Par√°s, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
