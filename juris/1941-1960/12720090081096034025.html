				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila
absolving defendant Santiago Syjuco, Inc. of the complaint and
condemning the plaintiff to pay to said defendant the sum of P18,000 as
principal acid the further sum of P5,130 as interest thereon from
August 6, 1944, to May 5, 1949, or a total of P23,130, Philippine
currency, with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from May 6,
1949, until said amount is paid in full, with costs against the
plaintiff. <p> The facts of this case as reflected in the pleadings and, the
evidence, stripped of unnecessary details, are well narrated in the
brief submitted by counsel for the Philippine National Bank, and which
for purposes of this decision are hereunder reproduced:</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>"The
appellee, Philippine National Bank, hereinafter .to be referred to as
the Bank, was the owner of two (2) parcels of land known as Lots 871
and 872 of the Murcia Cadastre, Negros Occidental, more particularly
described in Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 17176 and 17175,
respectively. On March 9, 1936, the Bank executed a contract to sell
the said properties to the plaintiff, Jose Ponce de Leon, hereinafter
to be referred to as Ponde de Leon, for the total price of P26,300,
payable as follows: fa) P2,630 upon the execution of the said deed; and
(<em>b</em>) the balance of P23,670 in ten (10) annual amortizations,
the first amortization to fall due one year after the execution of the
said contract (See Annex "A", Syjuco's Segunda Contestacion Enmendada).</p>
      <p>"On
May 5, 1944, Ponce de Leon obtained a loan from Santiago Syjuco, Inc.,
hereinafter to be referred to as Syjuco, in the amount of P200.00 in
Japanese Military Notes, payable within one (1) year from May 5, 1948.
It was also provided in said promissory note that the promisor (Ponce
de Leon) could not pay, and the payee (Syjuco) could not demand, the
payment of said note except within the aforementioned period. To secure
the payment of said obligation, Ponce de Leon mortgaged in favor of
Syjuco the parcels of land which he agreed to purchase from the Bank
(See Annex 'A' Syjuco's Segunda Contestacion Enmendada).</p>
      <p>
"On May 6, 1944, Ponce de Leon paid the Bank the Balance of the
purchase price amounting to P23,670 in Japanese Military notes and, on
the same date, the Bank executed in favor of Ponce de Leon a deed of
absolute salo6f the aforementioned parcels of land (See Annex "F",
Syjuco's Segunda Contestacion Enmendada).</p>
      <p> "The deed of
sale executed by the Bank in favor of Ponce de Leon and the deed of
mortgage executed by Ponce de Leon in favor of Syjuco were registered
in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental and, as a
consequence of such registration, Transfer Certificate of Title Nos.
17175 and 17176 in the name of the Bank were cancelled and Transfer
Certificates of Title No. 398 (P.R.) and No. 399 (P.R.), respectively,
were issued in the name of Ponce de Leon. The mortgage in favor of
Syjuco was annotated on the back of said certificates.</p>
      <p>
"On July 31, 1944, Ponce de Leon obtained an additional loan from
Syjuco in the amount of P16,000 in Japanese Military notes and executed
in the latter's favor a promissory note of the same tenor as the one he
had previously executed (R. on Appeal, pp. 23-24).</p>
      <p> "On
several occasions in October, 1944, Ponce de Leon tendered to Syjuco
the amount of P254,880 in Japanese military notes in full payment of
his Indebtedness to Syjuco. The amount tendered included not only the
interests up to the time of the tender, but also all the interest up to
May 5, 1948. Ponce de Leon also wrote to Syjuco a letter tendering the
payment of his indebtedness, including interests up to May 5, 1948.
Syjuco, however, refused to accept such repeated tenders. During the
trial, Ponce de Leon explained that he wanted to settle his obligations
because as a member of the guerrilla forces he was being hunted by the
Japanese and he was afraid of getting caught and killed (t.s.n. pp.
23-24).</p>
      <p> "In view of Syjuco's refusal to accept the
payment tendered by Ponce de Leon, the latter deposited with the Clerk
of the Court of First Instance of Manila the amount of P254,880 and, on
November 4, 1944, he filed a complaint consigning the amount so
deposited to Syjuco. To this complaint Syjuco filed his answer. The
records of this case were destroyed as a result of the war and after
the liberation the same were reconstituted (R. on A. pp.1-17).</p>
      <p>
"On May 15, 1946, Ponce de Leon filed a petition in the Court of First
Instance of Negros Occidental for the reconstitution of transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 17175 and 17176 in the name of the Bank and,
in an order dated June 4, 1946, the Court ordered the reconstitution of
said titles. In compliance with said order, the Register of Deeds of
Negros Occidental issued Certificates of Title Nos. 1297-R and 1298-R
in the name of the Bank. Ponce de Leon then filed with the Register of
Deeds a copy of the deed of sale of the properties covered by the said
certificates of title issued by the Bank in his (Ponce de Leon's) favor
and the Register of Deeds cancelled the said Certificates of Title Nos.
1297-R and 1298-R and issued in favor of Ponce de Leon Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 526-N and 527-N (R. on A. pp. 48-50).</p>
      <p>
"On August 16, 1946, Ponce de Leon obtained an overdraft account from
the Bank in an.amount not exceeding P135,000 and, on the same date, he
executed a mortgage of the two parcels of land covered by the
reconstituted Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 526-N and 527-N in
favor of the said Bank to secure the payment of any amount which he may
obtain from the Bank under the aforementioned overdraft account. The
overdraft account was granted by the Bank to Ponce de Leon in good
faith, said Bank not being aware of the mortgage which Ponce de Leon
had executed in favor of Syjuco during the Japanese occupation, and
said Bank believing that the said properties had no lien or incumbrance
in favor of anybody since no lien or encumbrance appeared annotated on
the reconstituted Certificates of Title Nos. 526-N and 527-N in the
name of Ponce de Leon (See Testimony of Atty. Endriga).</p>
      <p>
"On September 28, 1946, Syjuco filed a second amended answer to Ponce
de Leon's complaint and, in its "Tercera Reconvencion", it claimed
that Ponce de Leon, by.reconstituting the titles in the name of the
Bank, by causing the Register of Deeds to nave the said titles
transferred in his (Ponce de Leon's name, and by subsequently
mortgaging the said properties to the Bank as a guaranty for his
overdraft account, had violated the conditions of the mortgage which
Ponce de Leon has executed in its favor during the Japanese occupation.
Syjuco then prayed that the mortgage in his favor be foreclosed and the
mortgage executed by Ponce de Leon in favor of the Bank be declared
null and void (R. on A. pp. 32-53).</p>
      <p> "Ponce de Leon
objected to the inclusion of the Bank as a cross-defendant. (R. on A.
pp. 55-58). Notwithstanding said objection, however, the lower court
ordered the inclusion of the Bank as a cross-defendant (R. on A. pp.
59-60).</p>
      <p> "On June 28, 1947, the Bank filed a motion to
drop on the ground that it had been misjoined and to dismiss on the
ground that the venue was improperly laid and there is another action
pending between the same parties for the same cause (R. on A. pp.
65-75). The said motion was denied by the lower court in its order
dated October 7, 1947 (R. on A. pp. 95-100). In view of such denial,
the Bank filed its answer on October 29, 1947 (R. on A. pp. 101-106).</p>
      <p>
"On June 24, 1949, the lower court rendered a decision absolving Syjuco
from Ponce de Leon's complaint and condemning Ponce de Leon to pay
Syjuco the total amount of P23,130 with interest at the legal rate from
May 6, 1949, until fully paid (R. on A. pp. 107-135). Both Ponce de
Leon and Syjuco filed their appeal from this decision."</p>
</blockquote>
	<p> The principal questions to be determined in this
appeal are: (1) Did the lower court err in not giving validity to the
consignation made by the plaintiff of the principal and interest of his
two promissory notes with the clerk of court?; (2) did the lower court
err in reducing the principal and interest of said promissory notes to
their just proportions using as a pattern the Ballantyne schedule in
effecting the reduction?; (3) did the lower court err in disregarding
the defense of moratorium set up by the plaintiff against the
counterclaim of defendant Syjuco?; and (4) did the lower court err in
not passing on the question of priority between the mortgage claim of
defendant Syjuco and that of the Philippine National Bank on the same
set of properties on the ground that they are situated in a province
different from that in which this action was brought? We will discuss
these issues in the order in which they are propounded.</p>
	<ol><li>
It appears that plaintiff obtained from defendant Syjuco two loans in
1944; One is for P200,000 obtained on May 5, 1944, and another for
«.6,000 obtained on July 31, 1944. These two loans appear in two
promissory notes signed by the plaintiff which were couched in
practically the same terms and conditions and were secured by two deeds
of mortgage covering the same parcels of land. In said promissory notes
it was expressly agreed upon that plaintiff shall pay the loans "within
one year from May 5, 19^8, * * * peso for peso in the coin or currency
of the Government of the Philippines that, at the time of payment above
fixed, it is the legal tender for public and private debts, with
Interest at the rate of 6% per annum, payable in advance for the first
year, and semi-annually in advance during the succeeding years", and
that, the period above set forth having been established for the mutual
benefit of the debtor and creditor, the former binds himself to pay,
and the latter not to demand the payment of, the loans except within
the period above mentioned. And as a corollary to the above
stipulations, It was likewise agreed upon in the two deeds of mortgage
that nif either party should attempt to annul or alter any of the
stipulations of this deed or of the note which it secures, or do
anything which has for its purpose or effect an alteration or annulment
of any of said stipulations, he binds himself to indemnify the other
for the losses and damages, which the parties hereby liquidate and fix
at the amount of P200,000".</li></ol>
	<p> The facts show that, on November 15, 1944, or thereabouts,
contrary to the stipulation above mentioned, plaintiff offered to pay
to the defendant not only the principal sum due on the two promissory
notes but also all the interests which said principal sum may earn up
to the dates of maturity of the two notes, and as the defendant refused
to accept the payment so tendered, plaintiff deposited the money with
the clerk of court and brought this action to compel the defendant to
accept it to relieve himself of further liability.</p>
	<p> The
question now to be determined is, is the consignation made by the
plaintiff valid in the light of the law and the stipulations agreed
upon in the two promissory notes signed by the plaintiff? Our answer is
in the negative.</p>
	<p> In order that consignation may be effective,
the debtor must first comply with certain requirements prescribed by
law. The debtor must show (1) that there was a debt due; (2) that the
consignation of the obligation had been made because the creditor to
whom tender of payment was made refused to accept it, or because he was
absent or Incapacitated, or because several persons claimed to be
entitled to receive the amount due (Art. 1176, Civil Code); (3) that
previous notice of the consignation had been given to the person
interested in the performance of the obligation (Art. 1177, Civil
Code); (4) that the amount due was placed at the disposal of the court
(Art. 1178, Civil Code); and (5) that after the consignation had been
made the person interested was notified thereof (Art. 1178, Civil
Code). In the instant case, while it is admitted that a debt existed,
that the consignation was made because of the refusal of the creditor
to accept it, and the filing of the complaint to compel its acceptance
on the part of the creditor can be considered sufficient notice to the
consignation to the creditor, nevertheless, it appears that at least
two of the above requirements have not been complied with. Thus, it
appears that plaintiff, before making the consignation with the clerk
of court, failed to give previous notice thereof to the person
interested in the performance of the obligation. It also appears that
the obligation was not yet due and demandable when the money was
consigned, because, as already stated, by the very express provisions
of the document evidencing the same, the obligation was to be paid
within one year after May 5,1948, and the consignation was made before
this period matured. The failure of these two requirements is enough
ground to render the consignation ineffective. And it cannot be
contended that plaintiff is justified in accelerating the payment of
the obligation because be was willing to pay the interests due up to
the date of its maturity, because, under the law, in a monetary
obligation contracted with a period, the presumption is that the same
is deemed constituted in favor of both the creditor and the debtor
unless from its tenor or from other circumstances it appears that the
period has been established for the benefit of either one of them (Art.
1127, Civil Code). Here no such exception or circumstance exists.</p>
	<p>
It may be argued that the creditor has nothing to lose but everything
to gain by the acceleration of payment of the obligation because the
debtor has offered to pay all the Interests up to the date it would
become due, but this argument loses force if we consider that the
payment of Interests is not the only reason why a creditor cannot be
forced to accept payment contrary to the stipulation. There are other
reasons why this cannot be done. One of them is that the creditor may
want to keep his money invested safely instead of having it in his
hands (Moore <em>vs.</em> Cord 14 Wis. 231). Another reason is that
the creditor by fixing a period protects himself against sudden decline
in the purchasing power of the currency loaned specially at a time when
there are many factors that influence the fluctuation of the currency
(Kemmerer on Money, pp. 9-10). And all available authorities on the
matter are agreed that, unless the creditor consents, the debtor has no
right to accelerate the time of payment even if the premature tender
"included an offer to pay principal and interest in full" (17 A.L.R.
866-867; 23 L.R.A. (N.S.) 43; see ruling of this Court in the recent
case of Ilusorio <em>vs.</em> Busuego, G.R. No. L-882, September 30, 1949).</p>
	<p>
Tested by the law and authorities we have cited above, the conclusion
is Inescapable that the consignation made by the plaintiff is invalid
and, therefore, did not have the effect of relieving him of his
obligation. </p>
	<ol start="2"><li> The next question to be
determined is whether the lower court erred in reducing the amount of
the loans by applying the Balltntyne schedule.</li></ol>
	<p> This is not the first time that this question has been
raised. On two previous occasions this Court had been called upon to
rule on a similar question and has decided that when the creditor and
the debtor have agreed on a term within which the payment of the
obligation should be paid and on the currency in which payment should
be made, that stipulation should be given force and effect unless it
appears to be contrary to law, moral or public order. Thus, in one case
this Court said: "One who borrowed P4,000 in Japanese military notes on
October 5, 1944, to be paid one year after, in currency then
prevailing, was ordered by the Supreme Court to pay said sum after
October 5, 1945, that is, after liberation, in Philippine currency
(Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez et al., G.R. No. L-19^7, May 31, 1949). In Another case, wherein the parties executed a deed of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
of a parcel of land for the sum of P5,000 in Japanese military notes
agreeing that within 30 days after the expiration of one year from June
24, 1944, the aforementioned land may be redeemed <em>sa ganito ding halaga </em>(at the same price), the Court held that the&nbsp;<em></em>phrase <em>"sa ganito ding halaga"</em>
meant the same price of P5,000 in the currency prevailing at the time
of redemption and not the equivalent in Philippine currency of P5,000
in Japanese war notes". The Court further said, "The parties herein
gambled and speculated on the date of the termination of the war and
the liberation of the Philippines by America. This can be gleaned from
the stipulation about redemption, particularly that portion to the
effect that redemption could be effected not before the expiration of
one year from June 24, 1944. This kind of agreement is permitted by
law. We find nothing immoral or unlawful in it"(Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia, G.R. No. L-1826, Aug. 5, 1949).</p>
	<p>
In this particular case, the terms agreed upon are clearer and more
conclusive than the ones cited because the plaintiff agreed not only
not to pay the obligation within one year from May 5, 1948, but also to
pay peso; for peso in the coin or currency of the Government that at
the time of payment it is the legal tender for public and private
debts. This stipulation is permitted by law because there is nothing
immoral or improper In it. And It is not oppressive because it appears
that plaintiff used a great portion of that money to pay his
obligations during the Japanese occupation as shown by the fact that he
settled his account with the Philippine National Bank and other
accounts to the tune of P100,000. It would seem therefore clear that
plaintiff has no other alternative than to pay the defendant his
obligation peso; for peso in the present currency as expressly agreed
upon in the two promissory notes in question. The decision of the lower
court on this point should, therefore, be modified.</p>
	<p> As
regards the penal clause contained in the two deeds of mortgage herein
involved, we agree to the following finding of the court <i>a quo</i>: "The
attempt made by the plaintiff to pay the obligation before the arrival
of the term fixed for the purpose may be wrong; but it may be
attributed to an honest belief that .the term was not binding and not
to a desire to modify the .contract". This penal clause should be
strictly construed.</p>
	<ol start="3"><li> As regards the third
question, we find that the lower court erred in disregarding the
defense of . moratorium set up by the plaintiff against the
counterclaim of the defendant on the sole ground that this defense was
not raised by the plaintiff in his pleadings. An examination of the
record shows that the plaintiff raised this question in his pleadings.
This must have been overlooked by the court.</li></ol>
	<p> The lower court, therefore, should have passed upon this
defense in the light of Executive Order No. 25, as amended by Executive
Order No. 32, which suspended payment of all obligations contracted
before March 10, 1945. We note, however, that said moratorium orders
have already been modified by Republic Act No. 342 in the sense of
limiting the ban on obligations contracted before the outbreak of war
to creditors who have filed claims for reparations with the Philippine
War Damage Commission, leaving them open to obligations contracted
during the Japanese occupation (Uy <em>vs.</em> Kalaw Katigbak,
G.R.No. L-1830, Dec. 1, 1949). As the obligation in question has been
contracted during enemy occupation the same is still covered by the
moratorium orders. The claim of counsel for the defendant that the
moratorium orders cannot be invoked because they are unconstitutional
cannot now be determined it appearing that it has been raised for the
first,,time in this instance. This defense of moratorium was raised by
plaintiff in his reply to the amended answer of the defendant dated
August 1, 1946, and in his motion to dismiss the counterclaim dated
October 29, 1946, but the defendant did not traverse that allegation
nor raise the constitutionality of the moratorium orders in any of Its
pleadings filed In the lower court. It Is a well known rule that this
Court can only consider a question of constitutionality when it has
been raised by any of the parties in the lower court (Laperal <em>vs.</em> City of Manila, 62 Phil. 352; Macondray &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Benito and Ocampo, 62 Phil. 137).</p>
	<ol start="4"><li>
The facts relative to the execution of the deed of mortgage In favor of
the Philippine National Bank on the two lots in question are as
follows: On March 9, 1936, the Philippine National Bank was the owner
of lots Nob. 872 and 871 of the Murcia Cadastre, Negros Occidental,
covered by Certificates of Titles Nos. 17175 and 17176 respectively. On
the same date, the Bank sold the two lots to the plaintiff and as a
result Transfer Certificates of Titles Nos. 398 and 399 were issued in
the name of the plaintiff. On May 5, 1944, plaintiff mortgaged these
lots to defendant Syjuco to guarantee the payment of two loans, one for
7200,000 and another for 716,000. The mortgage was registered in
accordance with law. Then liberation came. Plaintiff taking advantage
of the destruction of the records of the office of the Register of
Deeds of Negros Occidental, obtained from the Court of First Instance
of said province the reconstitution of Transfer Certificates of Titles
Nos. 17175 and 17176 and, by virtue thereof, the register of deeds
issued transfer certificates of titles Nos.1297-R and 1298-R. In the
name of the Philippine National Bank. Then he secured the cancellation
of the titles last named and the issuance of Transfer Certificates of
Titles Nos. 526-N and 527-N in his name without informing the court of
the encumbrance existing in favor of defendant Syjuco. After securing
the new titles In his name, plaintiff obtained a loan from the
Philippine National Bank for the sum of P135,000 on the security of the
property covered by said reconstituted titles. On said titles no
encumbrance appears annotated, but it was noted thereon that they would
be subject to whatever claim may be filed by virtue of documents or
Instruments previously registered but which, for some reason, do not
appear annotated thereon, as required by a circular of the Department
of Justice.</li></ol>
	<p> From the foregoing facts, it clearly appears that the
mortgage executed in favor of defendant Syjuco is prior in point of
time and in point of registration to that executed in favor of the
Philippine National Bank, let alone the fact that when the later
mortgage was executed, the Bank must have known, as it was its duty to
find out, that there was a warning appearing In the reconstituted
titles that the same were subject to whatever encumbrance may exist
which for one reason or another does not appear in said titles. With
such warning, the Bank should have taken the necessary precaution to
Inquire into the existence of any hidden transaction or encumbrance
that might affect the property that was being offered in security such
as the one existing in favor of the defendant, and when the Bank
accepted as security the titles offered by the plaintiff without any
further Inquiry, it assumed the risk and the consequences resulting
therefrom. Moreover, it also appears that this same question of
priority has already been threshed out and determined by the Court of
First Instance of Negros Occidental in the cadastral proceedings
covering the two lots In question wherein the court ordered the
cancellation of the reconstituted titles Issued In the name of the
plaintiff and the reconstitution of the former titles copies of which
were In the possession of defendant Syjuco, subject only to the
requirement that the mortgage in favor of the Philippine National Bank
be annotated on said new titles. In other words, the court declared
valid the titles originally issued in the name of the plaintiff wherein
the encumbrance In favor of the defendant Syjuco appears and declared
Invalid the reconstituted titles secured by plaintiff through fraud and
misrepresentation. This order is now final because no appeal has been
taken therefrom by any Interested party.</p>
	<p> We have, therefore,
no other alternative than to declare that the mortgage claim of the
defendant Syjuco Is entitled to priority over that of the Philippine
National Bank. This question can be threshed out here regardless of
venue because the counterclaim Is but ancillary to the main case (1
Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 2nd ed., 201).</p>
	<p> In view
of the foregoing, the decision appealed from should be modified In the
sense of ordering the plaintiff to pay to defendant Syjuco the sum of
P2l6,000, Philippine currency, value of two promissory notes, with
Interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from May 6, 1949, until
said amount is paid in full. It is further ordered that should said
amount, together with the corresponding interests, be not paid within
90 days from the date this Judgment becomes final, the properties
mortgaged should be sold at public auction, and the proceeds applied to
the payment of this judgment in accordance with law, with costs
against the plaintiff.</p>
<p> However, this Judgment shall be held In abeyance, or no order for
the execution thereof shall be issued, until after the moratorium
orders shall have been lifted.</p>

	  <p align="left">The
plaintiff obtained from, defendant Syjuco on May 5, 1944, a loan of
P200,000 and on July 31, 1944, another loan of P16,000, payable "within
one year from May 5, 1948." On November 15, 1944, the plaintiff offered
to pay the entire indebtedness plus all the interest up to the date of
maturity. Upon Syjuco's refusal to accept the tendered payment, the
plaintiff deposited the amount with the clerk of the Court of First
Instance of Manila and instituted the present action .to compel Syjuco
to accept payment. The records of the case were destroyed during the
war, but they were duly reconstituted after the liberation. The trial
court sentenced the plaintiff to pay to Syjuco the total sum of
P23,130, representing the whole indebtedness plus interest from August
6, 1944, to May 5, 1949, computed according to the Ballantyne scale of
values. From this judgment Syjuco has appealed, claiming the right to
be paid the sum of P216,000, actual Philippine currency, plus P200,000
as penalty agreed upon in the contract. The majority of this Court
sustains Syjuco1s claim for P216,000. </p>
	  <div align="justify">
	    <p> As the same questions have been resolved in Ilusorio <em>vs.</em> Busuego, G. R. No. L-822, September 30, 1949,<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez, May 31, 1949,<sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup> 46 O.

G. 644, in which I dissented, I have to disagree with the majority in the case at bar. </p>
	    <p>
On the question whether a debtor can pay an indebtedness before the
date of maturity provided corresponding interest is paid, I said the
following in Ilusorio <em>vs.</em> Busuego . </p>
	    <blockquote>
          <p>
"In other words, I hold that the mortgagor has the right to pay the
indebtedness at any time within three years provided that, as in this
case, he pays the interest for the whole term of the mortgage. In the
ordinary course of things, a loan is granted in consideration of
interest, and if by the early payment of the obligation, the creditor
would not lose any part of the stipulated interest, both paragraphs 3
and 4 would practically be enforced. It cannot be alleged that the
creditor herein, in addition to interest, wanted to have his money in
the safekeeping of the debtor, because the contract is one 6f loan and
not of deposit. It is to be remembered, moreover, that the debt was
being paid in the same currency loaned (Japanese money). The effect of
inflation is one.of the risks naturally incident to the money-lending
business, and the lender should protect himself against it by plain
covenants." </p>
        </blockquote>
	    <p> On the matter of
requiring a loan obtained in Japanese war notes to be paid after the
liberation in equivalent Philippine currency, I am hereinbelow
reproducing at length what I stated in Bofio <em>vs.</em> Gomez which
should have greater application and force, because while in the Bono
case the amount of the loan is only 54,000, in the case at bar.the
debtor is being ordered to pay the large sum of P216,000: </p>
	    <blockquote>
          <p>
"The principal defense set up by Bono is that the note is contrary to
law, morals or public order. This defense was flatly overruled in the
court of origin,seconded by the Court of Appeals. The judgment of the
latter court is now before us upon appeal by certiorari of Cristobal
Bono. </p>
          <p> "The situation is one in which a borrower
of. P4,000.00 in Japanese war notes is made to pay the same amount in
currency of the present Philippine Republic. In other words, the
borrower of P4,000 during the latter part of the Japanese military
occupation whichf in ordinary practical terms, could hardly purchase a
cavan of riffie, is now compelled no pay &amp;4,000.00 in actual
Philippine currency which, In the same ordinary practical terms, may be
held equivalent to at least 100 cavanes of rice. Said borrower is
compelled to do so, merely because in his promissory note he agreed to
pay after one year in pesos of the Philippine currency, and expressly
waived any postwar arrangement devaluating the amount borrowed in
October, 1944. </p>
          <p> "The Court of Appeals held that the
commitment of Cristobal Roño to settle his indebtedness in the legal
tender at the time of payment is not against the law, morals or public
order. We readily acquiesce in the proposition that the contract is not
contrary to law or public order, for we are aware of no statute or
public policy which prohibits a person from bringing about or causing
his own financial reverses. But we are of the opinion that, if enforced
to the letter, it is against morals. If the contract was entered into
in times of peace, its obligations should have i»he force of law
between the parties and must be performed in accordance with their
stipulations (Art. 1091, Civil Code). But when as in the case.at bar,
the borrower had to obtain a loan during war time, when living
conditions were abnormal and oppressive, everything was uncertain, and
everybody was fighting for his survival, our conscience and common
sense demand that his acts be judged by.compatible standards.</p>
          <p>"The
Court of Appeals found that everybody was aware of the developments of
the war outside of official propaganda and that, in so far as knowledge
of war events is concerned, Roño was more or less on an equal footing
with Gomez. This means that all knew the bombings by the American air
forces of various parts of the Islands in September, 1944, and of the
decisive defeats of the Axis powers in Europe, and that the mighty
forces of the Allies would soon, as in fact they did, concentrate on
and crush Japan, with the result that the Japanese war notes would
accordingly become worthless. It may of course be supposed that Roño
knowingly bound himself to his pact. But this is true merely in theory.
Although, as found also by the Court of Appeals, Roño was not entirely
an ignorant man because he is a mechanic and knows English, the fact
nevertheless remains that the lender, Jose L. Gomez, was a lawyer, and
the exaggerated way the promissory note is worded plainly shows that
the latter must have thoroughly studied the transaction with Roño and
imposed the conditions evidenced therein to his one-sided advantage. It
is needless to say that borrowers are always at the mercy of
unscrupulous money lenders. 'Necessitous men are not, truly speaking,
free men; but, to answer a present emergency, will submit to any terms
that the crafty may impose upon them.' (Marquez et al. <em>vs.</em> Valencia, 44 O. G. p. 895, 897<sup><span style="color: red;">[*]</span></sup>, quoting Villa <em>vs.</em>
Santiago, 38 Phil. 157, 164). We cannot believe, as intimated in the
testimony of Sinforosa A. de Gomez (wife of Jose L. Gomez), that Roño
informed them that he would use the money to purchase a jitney, for the
simple reason that, in view of the inflated value of the Japanese war
notes in October, 1944, the amount of P4,000 could not possibly
purchase a jitney. At any rate, even accepting the conjecture that said
amount was invested by Roño in his business, the circumstance still
makes him a necessitous man that had to submit to the terms of his
lender. That a contract like the one in question is shocking to the
conscience and therefore immoral becomes patent When we resort to the
example of a borrower of P2,000.00 just before the liberation, when a
kilo of sugar already cost P2,000.00, being compelled! to pay the same
in Philippine currency now when a kilo of sugar hardly costs P0.50. Where is the conscience of anyone who will collect P2,000,00 for a
loan of virtually fifty centavos?</p>
          <p>"The Court of
Appeals argued that the parties took equal risks, since it was
impossible to predict the exact time at which the Philippines would be
liberated and that, supposing that the liberation had been delayed for
more than one year, Gomez might have been the loser and Roño the
winner, for the Japanese currency might have further diminished in
value. To this we would answer that Gomez would then be paid in the
same currency that was borrowed and during the same war time when the
loan was extended. This would not be unusual, as the parties are still
under the very environment's that surrounded the execution of the
contract."</p>
        </blockquote>
	    <p> I may add the following observations contained in my dissenting opinion in Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia:</p>
	    <blockquote>
          <p>
"The majority also hold that the contract here in question is aleatory.
This is open to doubt. Aleatory contracts, or those depending on
chance, are covered by Title HI, Book IV, of the Civil Code. It is to
be noted that, under article 1790, an aleatory contract involves the
occurrence of an event which is uncertain or will happen at an
indeterminate time. Moreover, the contracts contemplated by the Code as
being aleatory, are grouped under insurance, contracts, gambling and
betting, and life annuities. It follows that the contract now under
consideration, which is one of loan, does not fall under any of those
groups of aleatory contracts. At any rate, the contract of loan herein
involved is clearly not dependent upon any uncertain event. The loan
was granted on a definite date and has to be paid on a definite date.
Both dates are certain. The payment of the loan has to be effected
regardless of the result of the war.</p>
          <p> "As the
contract in question contemplated that the payment is to be made in the
same currency that was loaned, and the parties are presumed never to
have intended that said payment would be made in what has become
valueless money, justice demands that the indebtedness be paid in
actual Philippine currency at an equivalent amount determined in the
Ballantyne schedule, in the absence of evidence as to such value. The
exceptions mentioned in the Ballantyne schedule refer to contracts in
which the obligation is payable by something other than legal tender.
Indeed, the majority in Hilado <em>vs.</em> De la Costa et al.,<sup><span style="color: red;">[*]</span></sup>
G. R. No. L-150, decided on April 30, 1949, held that 'what the debtor
should pay is the value of the Japanese war notes in relation to the
peso of Philippine currency obtaining on the date when and at the place
where the obligation was incurred, unless <em>the parties had agreed otherwise.' </em>This
underscored clause undoubtedly contemplates an agreement to pay in a
consideration other than legal tender of the Philippine, such as gold
doilars, pounds sterling, Spanish pesetas, or the like. It cannot be
otherwise, since if the intention is merely to pay in legal tender, no
express stipulation is necessary, because under section 1612 of the
Revised Administrative Code, the Philippine currency is the legal
tender for all debts.</p>
          <p> "In reiteration of my stand in the case of Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez, <em>supra</em>,
I wish to emphazise that to require the herein respondent to pay the
sum of P5,000.00, actual Philippine currency, in return for an
indebtedness obtained in Japanese military notes equivalent in actual
Philippine currency according to the Ballantyne schedule, to only
P790.26 as found by the Court of Appeals, is unconscionable."</p>
        </blockquote>
	    <p> In my considered opinion, the appealed judgment should at most be affirmed.</p>

        <p><strong>PADILLA,</strong> <em>J., </em></p>
        <p>I.dissent.
A loan of a sum of money is usually made for the purpose of earning
interest. The creditor should not be allowed to exact and impose unfair
terms and conditions, such as that of barring the debtor from paying
the principal of the loan before the time agreed upon. By the payment
of the principal of the loan together with the stipulated interests
accrued and to accrue up to thru time agreed upon for payment of the
principal, the purpose or aim of the loan is attained—all to the
advantage and benefit of the creditor. The stipulated sum to be paid by
the debtor as penalty or liquidated damages equal to the principal of
the loan if payment thereof be made before the agreed upon, even if the
debtor pays at the same time the stipulated interests accrued and to
accrue up to the time agreed upon for payment of the principal, is <em>contra bonos mores, </em>against public policy, and should be disregarded and deemed as not written in the contract. </p>
	    <p>
A loan of P200,000 in Japanese war notes was made on 5 May 1944,
payable within one year from 5 May 1944. An additional loan of P16,000
in Japanese war notes was made on 31 July 1944, payable within the same
period of time as the previous one. On different occasions in October
1944, the debtor tendered the sum of P254,.330 in full payment of the
principal of the loan and the stipulated interests up to 5 May 1948, a
tender refused by the creditor. In view of this refusal, the debtor
deposited the sum and filed a complaint in the competent court to
compel the creditor to accept the sum thus tendered and deposited.</p>
	    <p>
To compel the debtor after the moratorium shall have been removed to
pay in the present currency the principal of the loan made in Japanese
war notes, which at the time of the loan had very little value or
purchasing power, and the stipulated interests up to the date of
payment thereof, is so shocking to the conscience of a fair-minded
person that it will constitute a blot on the administration of justice
in this Republic. To that I cannot give my assent.</p>
	    <p> The
requirement that previous notice of consignation be made to the
creditor was practically complied with by the deposit in court of the
sum of money tendered and the filing of the complaint by the debtor
against the creditor to compel the latter to accept the payment of the
sum of money thus tendered and deposited. The notice of consignation is
superfluous where a complaint is filed and the sum of money tendered
for payment of the principal of the loan and stipulated interests is
deposited in court, because to avoid litigation the creditor or any
party interested in the fulfillment of the obligation may-still accept
the payment of the sum of money deposited after he receives the
summons. It does not appear in this case that any party other than the
creditor was interested in the fulfillment of the obligation at the
time the consignation was made. </p>
	    <p> The cross-claim of the
creditor should have been dismissed. The consignation made by the
debtor should have been upheld, or if the provisions as to consignation
not adhered to or complied with, then the creditor should be entitled
at most to the sum awarded by the trial court. </p></div>
