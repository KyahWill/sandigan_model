				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Criminal Cases Nos. 21502 and 21503 of the Cqurt of First Instance of 
Pangasinan, for the crime of murder upon the person of Amado Sanchez and 
attempted murder upon that of Hilario Cruz, respectively, which were jointly 
heard, by agreement of the parties, said court rendered a single decision 
convicting Victoriano Sorio, <em>alias</em> Pianong, and his sons, Alfredo 
Sorio, <em>alias</em> Fred, and Cesar Sorio, of murder in the first case, and 
light threat, in the second case, and sentenced each one of them, in the former, 
to life imprisonment, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of Amado 
Sanchez, deceased, in the sum of P4,000.00, and to pay the costs, and, in the 
latter, to ten (10) days of <em>arresto menor</em> and to pay the costs, said 
penalties to be served consecutively. Victoriano Sorio has appealed from said 
decision insofar only as the first case is concerned.
<p>It appears that on October 26, 1956, Hilario Cruz, the offended party in Case 
No. 21503, an employee in the office of the Highway District Engineer of 
Pangasinan, housed in a structure known as garage or motor pool, near the 
capitol building, in Lingayen, Pangasinan, reported to the Highway District 
Engineer Marcelino Samson, that herein appellant, Victoriano Sorio, and one 
Agustin Banloa, another employee in said office, had stolen therefrom a roll of 
barbed wire and that, in the morning of December 3, 1956, said Hilario Cruz was 
advised by his brother, Fructuoso Cruz, not to go to said capitol, because Mandy 
which was the nickname of Amado Sanchez, had tipped him. (Fructuoso) that 
appellant, his son Alfredo and others were looking for him (Hilario Cruz) and 
Amado Sanchez, armed with weapons. In the language of the lower court, the 
following took place subsequently that same morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a) that on the morning of December 3, 1956, at around 9:00 o'clock, the 
three accused were seen at the garage compound near the capitol building at 
Lingayen, Pangasinan, Fred Sorio and Cesar Sorio near the building where the 
District Engineer lives, and in whose ground floor, Hilario Cruz was holding 
office, Fred Sorio, around one meter from the window near which Hilario Cruz had 
his desk, and a few meters away was Cesar Sorio, and around twelve meters away 
was Victoriano Sorio, Fred Sorio and Cesar Sorio, having their weapons tucked 
inside their pants; (b) that Fred Sorio approached Hilario Cruz and told him to 
go out, but the latter in turn asked the former to go inside if he wanted 
something; (c) that when Fred Sorio was one foot away from Hilario Cruz, he 
unsheated his dagger and said, 'Father, come', and Victoriano Sorio said, and 
'Go ahead, get inside, if you do not go inside, I will be the one', and then 
Fred Sorio pushed the door, but Hilario Cruz was able to close it before and the 
three accused were, later on, brought out from the garage compound by Perfecto 
Rancudo thru the outer gate; (d) that once outside the garage compound and while 
the three accused were going towards the west a Pantranco bus passed by and 
stopped in front of the capitol building, and when the bus started to proceed, 
the accused said. 'Para, para', for which the bus stopped, and they placed 
themselves near the bus, Fred Sorio, at the left side, Cesar Sorio, at right, 
and Victoriano Sorio behind the bus, all of them unsheating their 'balisong' 
when they were nearing the Pantranco bus and while thus deployed, Alfredo Sorio 
asked Amado Sanchez to come down saying: 'Mandy, come down: (e) that immediately 
after alighting from the bus, Amado Sanchez ran towards the stairs of the 
capitol building, but after reaching the first ladder, he was overtaken by Cesar 
Sorio who, almost behind his- victim, stabbed him at the left side, below the 
breast, thereupon, the poor victim turned back and tried to run down the ladder, 
but he was blocked by Alfredo Sorio who gave him several stab blow's; (f) that 
in spite of the mortal blows he had already received, Sanchez continued to run, 
but was pursued but had to fall near a bamboo arch in front of the capitol 
building, and while lying prostrate, Cesar Sorio gave him further blows, and 
left, not before telling his brother, Alfredo Sorio; 'That is enough brother, he 
is already dead, and, later on, going to where his father Victoriano, 
<em>alias</em> Pianong was; and that Alfredo, alias Fred Sorio going to where 
Sanchez was said: 'So, you are still alive', and then stabbed the deceased 
several times; (g) that while the three accused were hurrying towards the 
Pantranco bus, Victoriano Sorio made sign with his hand urging Fred Sorio to go 
ahead and while his two sons were chasing Sanchez, he urged them saying: 'Sigue, 
sigue' (Go ahead, go ahead); and (h) that the late Amado Sanchez was taken to 
the Pangasinan Provincial Hospital still alive, but died upon reaching the 
hospital."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the other hand, the defense tried to prove that what happened was 
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the morning of December 3, 1956, upon previous understanding the other 
two accused Alfredo Sorio and Cesar Sorio met in the Office of the Cashier 
(District Engineer) in the Capitol building in Lingayen. Province of Pangasinan. 
After collecting his pay Cesar loaned his brother Fred some money and afterwards 
went to a sari-sari store at the back of the Capitol building to pay his bills 
while Fred went to the opposite direction. While in the store he saw persons 
rushing towards the front of the building to witness a fight that was going on. 
He also followed and when he reached the front door he saw his brother Fred 
locked up in deadly combat with the deceased Amado Sanchez. Seeing this, he ran 
towards the East where the garage is located to inform his father Victoriano 
Sorio of what he saw, The encounter which lasted approximately ten to fifteen 
minutes proved fatal for Amado Sanchez after receiving various mortal wounds 
from Fred Sorio. When appellant Victoriano Sorio and his son Cesar, arrived in 
front of the Capitol building, the fight was all over whereupon herein appellant 
advised his other son Fred Sorio to surrender and go peacefully with a police 
officer to the Municipal building. He was accompanied by Cesar Sorio. Several 
persons placed the body of Amado Sanchez in a car owned by a provincial board 
member and took it to the provincial hospital at Dagupan where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival." (Pp. 3-4, Appellant's Brief.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as this version of the defense is inconsistent With that of the 
prosecution, the case hinges mainly on the relative credibility of the testimony 
of the opposing witnesses, which was decided by the lower court in favor of the 
prosecution and against the defense. The record before us fully justifies the 
action thus taken by His Honor, the trial Judge. Indeed, the theory of the 
prosecution is bolstered up by the fact that neither Alfredo Sorio nor Cesar' 
Sorio has appealed from the decision of the lower court, although both, or, at 
least, Cesar Sorio would have been absolutely innocent, if their version of the 
occurrence were true.</p>
<p>Appellant maintains, however, that he should be acquitted of the charge of 
murder for he had not laid hands upon the person of Amado Sanchez and the 
latter's death was due to injuries inflicted, not by him (appellant) ; but by 
his sons, Alfredo and Cesar. It is mainly urged by appellant that the existence 
of conspiracy between him and his aforementioned children has not been 
sufficiently established.</p>
<p>In this connection the prosecution placed on the witness stand Hilario Cruz, 
who was corroborated by his brother Fructuoso Cruz, his (Hilario's) officemate 
Dante Fernandez, Highway District Engineer Marcelino Sam-eon, security guard 
Perfecto Rancudo and Corleto Angeles, a janitor in the Provincial Capitol of 
Pangasinan. The prosecution introduced also, the testimony of Gervacio de la 
Cruz, one of the passengers of the Pantranco bus above mentioned, Feliciano 
Najera, municipal treasurer of Alaminos, Pangasinan (who was in the capitol at 
the time of the occurrence), Manuel Villa (who was supervising the work of a 
detail of prisoners, in front of the capitol, about 30 meters therefrom, near a 
bamboo arch, a few paces from which Amado Sanchez fell down mortally wounded), 
Jaime San Juan (one of the convicts forming part of said detail), and 
Hermenegildo Santos, a government employee who happened to be at the threshold 
of the capitol when the crime charged was committed, apart from the testimony of 
the physician (Dr. Braulio de Venecia) who made an autopsy of the body of Amado 
Sanchez and the report on the result thereof. It is, likewise, worthy of notice 
that the defense has not even tried to impugn the motives of these witnesses in 
testifying as they did, and that appellant did not take the witness stand to 
deny any of the incriminatory acts imputed to him by said witnesses for the 
prosecution. More specifically, the following facts, which are relevant to 
appellant's participation in the commission of the offense charged, have been 
established, to wit:</p>
<ol><li>On October 26, 1956, Hilario Cruz reported to the Highway District Engineer 
Marcelino Samson, that a roll of barbed wire had been stolen from his office by 
appellant Victoriano Sorio and Agustin Banloa. When Samson investigated Banloa 
about it, the latter admitted his guilt, but claimed to have acted, not only 
with the assistance of, but, also, under pressure from Victoriano Sorio whom 
Banloa characterized as a "tough guy".<br>
</li><li>Appellant was the person directly affected by said report. It was he, 
primarily, who had a motive, therefore, to harbor ill feeling towards Hilario 
Cruz, and, incidentally, Amado Sanchez, who gave Fructuoso Cruz a timely warning 
of the danger to the safety of his brother Hilario Cruz, resulting from his 
aforementioned report.<br>
</li><li>In the morning of Beeember 3, 1956, appellant accompanied his children 
Alfredo and Cesar to the garage or motor pool where'Hilario Cruz was 
working.<br>
</li><li>Appellant and his children were each armed with deadly weapons.<br>
</li><li>Upon arrival at said place, they proceeded to the .structure housing the 
office of Hilario Cruz and, approaching the window near which he was 
working—like Dante Fernandez, another employee, in the same office—Alfredo Sorio 
invited him (Hilario) to converse outside and then ;Winkecbat appellant, wlio 
winked at Alfredo.<br>
</li><li>The invitation having been rejected by Hilario Cruz, ¦Alfredo drew out his 
dagger, and appellant coaxed him to "Go ahead," and "get inside", adding that, 
if he (Alfredo) did not do so, he (appellant) would.<br>
</li><li>As Hilario Cruz locked the door of his office, Victoriano and Alfredo tried 
to force it open, for which reason Perfecto Banoudo, the security guard on duty 
in the compound, ordered the Sorios out of it.<br>
</li><li>Upon leaving the place, they noticed Amado Sanchez aboard a Pantranco bus 
that passed by, whereupon appellant and his sons ran towards the vehicle and 
bade it to stop.<br>
</li><li>With daggers unsheathed, Alfredo and Cesar Sorio placed themselves on each 
side of the bus, whereas Victoriano Sorio took his post behind it. Then Alfredo 
told Sanchez to alight therefrom.<br>
</li><li>When Sanchez jumped from it and ran away pursued by Alfredo and Cesar Sorio, 
appellant cajoled his children, shouting "sigue, sigue".<br>
</li><li>After his sons had overtaken and stabbed Sanchez ten (10) times, appellant 
fled to San Carlos, Pangasinan, where he was arrested. </li></ol>
<p>These facts show beyond doubt that Alfredo and Cesar Sorio acted in concert 
with their father, appellant herein, and that there was, therefore, a unity of 
purpose and action among them, which is the essence of conspiracy. In fact, 
appellant—not his children—was the main source of motivation for the offense, 
which was qualified by. treachery, and, hence, constitutes murder Although there 
are indications of some premeditation, we are not inclined to disturb the action 
of the lower court which seemingly gave the accused the benefit of doubt in 
connection with said aggravating circumstance and, accordingly imposed the 
medium penalty for murder.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
appellant Victoriano Sorio. It is so ordered. </p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
