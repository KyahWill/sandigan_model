				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On September&nbsp; 13, 1950, sis separate informations&nbsp; for robbery&nbsp; were filed in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal against&nbsp; Salvador Poblador, Armando&nbsp; Gustillo and Rene Escares.&nbsp; When these&nbsp; cases&nbsp; were&nbsp; called&nbsp; for&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; on March 2, 1951, Rene Escares&nbsp; was still at large and,&nbsp; by agreement&nbsp; of the parties,&nbsp; they were tried jointly against Salvador Poblador and Armando Gustillo.&nbsp; A decision was thereafter&nbsp; rendered against them finding them guilty of the crimes charged and convicting them accordingly.<br><br>On April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1954, Rene Escares&nbsp; was&nbsp; arraigned&nbsp; and pleaded not guilty in each of the six above-mentioned cases but later he asked permission to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and substitute it for a plea of guilty.&nbsp; The trial court granted the petition and forthwith it rendered a decision&nbsp; of the following tenor:<br><blockquote>''When&nbsp; these cases were called for&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused asked permission to withdraw his former plea of not guilty and substitute it with that of guilty in all these cases. The Court granted&nbsp; said petition, and the accused forthwith freely and voluntarily pleaded guilty in all these cases.<br><br>"Wherefore,&nbsp; the Court finds the accused&nbsp; Rene Escares&nbsp; guilty of the crimes charged&nbsp; in the information in all these&nbsp; cases, and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 70 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; hereby sentences said accused to twelve&nbsp; (12) years, six (6) months, and ono (1) day in all the cases, with all the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>Rene&nbsp; Escares&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; the decision but&nbsp; having taken the case to the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, the latter certified it to&nbsp; us&nbsp; on the ground that the only issue involved is&nbsp; one of law.<br><br>The only question&nbsp; raised&nbsp; in this appeal refers to the penalty imposed&nbsp; on the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; He contends that since he pleaded guilty to all the crimes charged and there is no aggravating circumstance&nbsp; to&nbsp; offset it, the&nbsp; penalty to be imposed on him&nbsp; should be reduced&nbsp; to the minimum.<br><br>It should be noted that the imposable penalty in each of the six cases where appellant&nbsp; pleaded guilty in accordance with&nbsp; paragraph 5, Article 294, of the Revised Penal Code, is <i>prision&nbsp; correctional</i> in its&nbsp; maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its&nbsp; medium period, which should be applied in its minimum period in view of the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty, not offset by any aggravating&nbsp; circumstance, or from 4 years 2 months and 1 day to 6 years one month and 10 days.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the appellant should be&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; for&nbsp; each crime to an indeterminate penalty the minimum of which shall not be less than 4 months and 1 day of <i>arresto mayor</i> nor more than 4 years and 2 months of <i>prision, correctional</i>,&nbsp; and the maximum shall not be less than 4 years 2 months and 1 day of <i>prision correctional</i> nor more than 6 years 1 month and 10 days&nbsp; of <i>prision mayor</i>.&nbsp; But in applying the&nbsp; proper penalty, the trial court imposed upon appellant the three fold&nbsp; rule provided for&nbsp; in paragraph 4 of Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; This is an error for said article can only be taken into account, not in the&nbsp; imposition of the penalty, but in connection with&nbsp; the service of the sentence imposed.<br><br>The penalty&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; upon appellant by the trial court should therefore be modified&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sense that he should suffer in each of the six cases an indeterminate penalty of not less than 4 months&nbsp; and 1 day&nbsp; of <i>arresto mayor</i> and not more than&nbsp; 4&nbsp; years 2 months and&nbsp; 1 day of&nbsp; <i>prision correctional</i>, plus&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding accessory penalties provided for by law.&nbsp; These penalties should be served in accordance with the limitation prescribed in paragraph 4, Article 70, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Modified&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sense above&nbsp; indicated, we affirm the decision of the trial court, with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
