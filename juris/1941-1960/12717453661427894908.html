				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; a judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, finding Epifanio&nbsp; Manabat, guilty of&nbsp; robbery in&nbsp; band&nbsp; in&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-8904&nbsp; and of murder in G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-8905, sentencing him in the first case to 12 years, 5 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, to indemnify Mayor Villaroman in the sum of P17,500, and to pay&nbsp; the costs, and in the second case, to r<span style="font-style: italic;">eclusion perpetua,</span>&nbsp; to indemnify the heirs of Teofila Puno in the sum of P6,000, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; The above cases were heard in a joint trial and upon two separate informations. Only one brief was filed&nbsp; by counsel for accused-appellant in both&nbsp; cases.<br><br>The incidents giving rise to the two criminal actions above-mentioned occurred in&nbsp; the town of Licab,&nbsp; province of Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; soon after&nbsp; liberation,&nbsp; on the 13th day of&nbsp; November,&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; when a period of&nbsp; confusion&nbsp; and chaos still reigned in the provinces, of&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Luzon. According to two witnesses for&nbsp; the prosecution,&nbsp; Alfredo Marquez and Buenaventura Liwag,&nbsp; both members of the Pambansang Kaisahan ng mga&nbsp; Magbubukid&nbsp; (PKM), an association&nbsp; of&nbsp; peasants&nbsp; in Central&nbsp; Luzon allied&nbsp; to the Hukbalahaps, in&nbsp; the afternoon of November 12,&nbsp; 1945, a gathering of members was held&nbsp; in Barrio Villarosa, near an&nbsp; irrigation dam about&nbsp; half a kilometer&nbsp; away from the poblacion&nbsp; of Licab. Among&nbsp; the persons&nbsp; who appeared at the meeting were accused-appellant Epifanio Manabat, known&nbsp; as Malvar, chief of&nbsp; the organization,&nbsp; Faustino de la Cruz, alias Magpayo, Ismael Mafigiduyos alias Monte-negro, another minor leader known as Balagtas, and many others.&nbsp; It was agreed in that meeting that Mayor Ernesto Villaroman&nbsp; of Licab would be robbed as he is an enemy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; PKM and did not like&nbsp; to&nbsp; support Juan Feleo's government. The&nbsp; following&nbsp; evening&nbsp; (November&nbsp;&nbsp; 13, 1945), at about 10:00 o'clock, around 200&nbsp; persons headed by&nbsp; the said Malvar, Magpayo, Balagtas and Montenegro, many of whom carried firearms, surrounded the house of Mayor Villaroman. The house is a two-story edifice and is built beside&nbsp; a road.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this road the Mayor was called&nbsp; to&nbsp; come down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Villaroman&nbsp; peeped through&nbsp; the window and recognized&nbsp; the&nbsp; leaders&nbsp; of&nbsp; the band, among whom was the accused-appellant Malvar&nbsp; and Magpayo.<br><br>He did not, however,&nbsp; heed their call and&nbsp; so various shots were fired at the house.&nbsp; Villaroman&nbsp; took his fire-arm and&nbsp; fired back.&nbsp; Then he&nbsp; ran downstairs&nbsp; to&nbsp; the ground floor of the house and from a hole near a door under the house he watched the door of the ground floor then being forcibly opened.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the door&nbsp; was opened,&nbsp; he recognized three who entered&nbsp; the house, namely, the appellant Epifanio Manabat <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Malvar,&nbsp; and Faustino de la Cruz, alias Magpayo and Balagtas.&nbsp; Villaroman&nbsp; hid himself in the hole and then&nbsp; escaped through an undisclosed door at the back of the house where there was an engine. From there he heard&nbsp; those who had gone up,&nbsp; ransacking the house.&nbsp; He also heard&nbsp; the shouts&nbsp; of his wife, protesting her being brought down.<br><br>The house was ransacked, jewelries were taken.&nbsp; Clothes being sold by Villaroman's wife were also taken, and so were the shoes and clothes of Villaroman, as well as cash that he had in&nbsp; the house,&nbsp; amounting&nbsp; to&nbsp; about P4,000. The jewelries were worth P10,000; his shoes, P200, and the clothes, P300.&nbsp;&nbsp; The booty was put in sacks and carried down and afterwards put inside&nbsp; a carretela and carried away.<br><br>The&nbsp; band that&nbsp; carried down&nbsp; Villaroman's wife conducted her to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fields, with Malvar and others&nbsp; behind her. When they reached the house of one Valdez accused-appellant&nbsp; suddenly gave the&nbsp; order&nbsp; to shoot her, and his men shot&nbsp; her&nbsp; and she fell down dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when MPs were coming, so Malvar ordered his men to run away.<br><br>Upon examination of the dead body of Mrs. Villaroman it&nbsp; was found that there were&nbsp; ten wounds&nbsp; in her chest and in the lower part of the&nbsp; abdomen.&nbsp; The bullet wounds had powdered burns around, which indicate that&nbsp; the shots had been fired at close range.<br><br>There was a military police&nbsp; (MP) detachment&nbsp; in the town of Licab on that occasion, but it&nbsp; was composed&nbsp; of only 15 members.&nbsp; They were closely hidden&nbsp; in their barracks&nbsp; and did not dare to go out.&nbsp; Villaroman,&nbsp; pretending to be one of the members of the&nbsp; band that surrounded his&nbsp; house, was able&nbsp; to&nbsp; pass unidentified among them, and he succeeded in joining the MPs in their barracks. The identity of accused-appellant Epifanio Manabat as the leader of the band was testified to by Alfredo Marquez and&nbsp; Buenaventura Liwag.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was&nbsp; also identified&nbsp; by Mayor Villaroman as the latter peeped through the window,&nbsp; and as Manabat entered the&nbsp; door&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ground floor of the house.<br><br>It is interesting to note&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; was filed by the Chief of&nbsp; Police on November&nbsp; 14, 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint was for robbery with homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, on November 20, 1945, two&nbsp; informations were filed in substitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the first, one&nbsp; for robbery in&nbsp; band&nbsp; and another for&nbsp; murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The information for murder contains no allegation as to the commission of the crime of robbery in band, just as the&nbsp; information&nbsp; for robbery in band contains nothing about the murder which was perpetrated on one of the inmates of the house which was robbed.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; started&nbsp; in February,&nbsp; 1946, but the same was suspended&nbsp; with respect to&nbsp; appellant Manabat because he and some of his co-accused were able to escape from prison,&nbsp; and appellant was not apprehended again until the month of July, 1951, when the hearing was resumed. Separate and independent trials&nbsp; were held with respect to other accused, but&nbsp; as to appellant&nbsp; trial&nbsp; was continued in 1951 and&nbsp; decision&nbsp; rendered on January 13, 1954.<br><br>The&nbsp; defense presented by&nbsp; the defendant-appellant is an <span style="font-style: italic;">alibi.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; He also sought to discredit the testimony of prosecution witness Liwag, who was introduced by the defense to testify that the testimony&nbsp; given by him for the prosecution and against the appellant was false.&nbsp; He declared that his testimony against the appellant was induced by the promise of Mayor Villaroman to give him one sack of rice and P30 in cash.&nbsp;&nbsp; He further stated that on November 13, 1945, a political meeting was held at the "glorietta" of&nbsp; Quezon, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija,&nbsp; on&nbsp; which&nbsp; occasion appellant Manabat&nbsp; was&nbsp; present.&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Jose Cando also testified for the defense and declared that the defendant-appellant attended the political meeting of~his in the municipality of&nbsp; Quezon, province of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija,&nbsp; on November 13, 1945; that witness arrived&nbsp; at the place of the meeting at about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon, and that upon ascending the grandstand he saw accused Manabat&nbsp; among the members&nbsp; of the band; that witness began delivering his speech&nbsp; at about&nbsp; 8:00 o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; evening and was through at about&nbsp; 9:00 o'clock, and at this time he&nbsp; heard shots from a&nbsp; nearby municipality,&nbsp; and&nbsp; while he&nbsp; heard these shots he&nbsp; still saw appellant Manabat at the grandstand; and that Manabat did not leave the grandstand till 9:00 o'clock that evening. <br><br>As to the recanting of the testimony by witness Liwag, we&nbsp; can do nothing&nbsp; better&nbsp; than cite&nbsp; Our decision,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">per&nbsp; curiam</span>, in G. R.&nbsp; No. L-6939, People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ubina, promulgated on August 31, 1955, where we stated that: <br><blockquote>"* * * it&nbsp; would be a dangerous rule for courts to reject testimonies solemnly taken before the courts&nbsp; of justice simply because the&nbsp; witnesses who had given them&nbsp; later on change their mind&nbsp; for&nbsp; one&nbsp; reason or another, for such a&nbsp; rule would&nbsp; make&nbsp; solemn trials a mockery&nbsp; and place the investigation of truth at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses. * * *" </blockquote>Even disregarding the testimony of Liwag, we still have the&nbsp; testimonies of&nbsp; Marquez and&nbsp; Villaroman&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the identity of the accused-appellant as the&nbsp; leader of&nbsp; those who attacked the&nbsp; house of&nbsp; Villaroman on the&nbsp; evening in question and thereafter&nbsp; entered it.&nbsp; As to the testimony of Atty. Jose Cando, which might be&nbsp; believable in view of his&nbsp; position as a&nbsp; lawyer and a political leader in the&nbsp; community, to&nbsp; the effect that&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; present at 9:00 o'clock in the evening of November 13,&nbsp; 1945, at&nbsp; a&nbsp; political meeting in Quezon, a neighboring town, the mere presence of appellant at said meeting does not preclude&nbsp; the possibility&nbsp; and probability of his having joined,&nbsp; after said meeting,&nbsp; the attack on the house&nbsp; of Villaroman, as the attack must&nbsp; have taken&nbsp; place&nbsp; later&nbsp; in&nbsp; the night. Liwag testified that the members&nbsp; of the band were deployed around the house of Mayor&nbsp; Villaroman between 10:00 o'clock and 11:00 o'clock in the evening, on the day in question.&nbsp; For&nbsp; his part,&nbsp; Mayor Villaroman&nbsp; stated that he&nbsp; first&nbsp; heard the&nbsp; defendant-appellant calling&nbsp; for him at about 8:00 or 9:00 o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; In another part of his testimony, he stated that the Huks went away between&nbsp; 10:00 o'clock and&nbsp; 11:00 o'clock in the evening. In view of the attack on the house of Mayor Villaroman, the members of the band could not have stayed in Licab for a&nbsp; long time,&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; possibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; soldiers coming to the rescue of the beleaguered mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Mayor Villaroman&nbsp; the MPs&nbsp; of Guimba in&nbsp; fact arrived at around&nbsp; 11:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the&nbsp; evening when the Huks had gone.&nbsp; The attack must, therefore,&nbsp; have taken place after 9:00 in the evening.&nbsp; The mere fact, therefore, that the appellant attended a political meeting in Quezon up&nbsp; to&nbsp; 9:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the&nbsp; evening did not preclude his presence in Licab after&nbsp; 9:00&nbsp; o'clock, because&nbsp; Licab is only five kilometers from&nbsp; Quezon and is connected thereto by&nbsp; a&nbsp; road.&nbsp; In view of these&nbsp; circumstances, the defense of <span style="font-style: italic;">alibi</span> presented can not be given any weight, especially in view of the positive identification of appellant by two witnesses.<br><br>Objection is made oh this appeal to the procedure of the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; in&nbsp; not having&nbsp; witness&nbsp; ^Ifredo Marquez included in the information as required by the Rules.&nbsp; This is not error; witnesses&nbsp; not included in&nbsp; the information may be called to&nbsp; testify.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Avansado, 37&nbsp; Phil. 658.)&nbsp; It is further argued that the&nbsp; testimony, of said Marquez must have been&nbsp; biased,&nbsp; prejudiced and given with&nbsp; promise of&nbsp; reward.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; assume that such partiality has attended the testimony of&nbsp; this&nbsp; witness for the sole reason&nbsp; that he&nbsp; is not included as&nbsp; one of the accused in the case. If such was the claim or contention of appellant, this matter&nbsp; should have been brought out in the cross-examination to impeach the credibility of witness. In the absence of such impeachment, his testimony&nbsp; must be taken as any other testimony, with the presumption of truthfulness as it was given under oath. <br><br>Another objection against the decision is that the judge who&nbsp; rendered it could not&nbsp; possibly have&nbsp; read all the transcripts&nbsp; of the stenographic notes taken&nbsp; during the&nbsp; hearing, especially those&nbsp; of the testimonies&nbsp; of&nbsp; Alfredo Marquez and&nbsp; Buenaventura&nbsp; Liwag.&nbsp;&nbsp; But contrary to this contention we find that Marquez' testimony&nbsp; was transcribed on March 20, 1947.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; to the&nbsp; testimony of Liwag,&nbsp; the date when the notes were transcribed does not appear&nbsp; in the records, but if it was not filed before the&nbsp; decision was rendered it could not have influenced the mind of the court.&nbsp; If the judge who rendered&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; did not read&nbsp; it,&nbsp; at&nbsp; least his subsequent&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; was heard by him,&nbsp; so&nbsp; no&nbsp; objection can be had against the late&nbsp; filing of the said&nbsp; testimony. <br><br>Claim is&nbsp; made in appellant's brief that there&nbsp; was no evidence as&nbsp; to the property&nbsp; which had been taken away. We believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; these properties were sufficiently identified by the Mayor who&nbsp; testified as to their disappearance after that day.<br><br>The testimony of&nbsp; Liwag that when the wife of Mayor Villaroman and the band led by appellant reached a certain place near&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of&nbsp; Candida Valdez,&nbsp; the appellant gave&nbsp; an&nbsp; order to his men to shoot&nbsp; her, which they did, sufficiently proves the charge of murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; it&nbsp; must have&nbsp; been the accused-appellant who gave&nbsp; the order&nbsp; is inferred&nbsp; from the&nbsp; fact that he was the leader of the assaulting band.&nbsp; The presence of the many wounds also indicates that many persons must have fired at her, and this shows that the order for the shooting must have come from the leader&nbsp; of&nbsp; the group, who was&nbsp; then appellant Manabat.&nbsp; This&nbsp; corroborates Liwag's testimony that appellant gave the order to shoot Mrs. Villaroman.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, we find that the guilt of the accused-appellant&nbsp; in each&nbsp; of&nbsp; the cases presented against him has been&nbsp; proved beyond reasonable doubt. Finding that the penalty imposed in the murder case is within the range prescribed by law, the same is hereby affirmed.<br><br>In criminal case No.&nbsp; 173, for robbery in band, the&nbsp; appellant is hereby found guilty of robbery&nbsp; under Article 294, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code, prior to its amendment by Republic Act No.&nbsp; 18, and not robbery in band, as found by the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the commission of the offense&nbsp; was attended by the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances of nighttime and&nbsp; by a band, the maximum of&nbsp; the penalty should be imposed.upon the&nbsp; defendant-appellant, and as he&nbsp; escaped from jail during the pendency of&nbsp; the proceedings, he is not entitled to the benefits of the&nbsp; Indeterminate Sentence Law. The penalty imposed by&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; is beyond the range provided&nbsp; by law.&nbsp; The sentence&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby modified and the same&nbsp; is&nbsp; reduced to ten (10) years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above modification, the sentence is hereby affirmed&nbsp; in all other&nbsp; respects.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; against the&nbsp; defendent-appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
