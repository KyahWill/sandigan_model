				<H3>COLLECTOR  OF INTERNAL  REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. JUNIOR WOMEN'S CLUB OP THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Junior Women's&nbsp; Club of the&nbsp; Philippines, a subsidiary unit of the National Federation of Women's Club of the Philippines a registered, charitable organization, held a cultural pageant at the Fiesta&nbsp; Pavilion of the Manila Hotel on September 20, 1952. The pageant which was advertised&nbsp; as "Malayan Festival" included as a main feature a benefit dance and as&nbsp; a privilege to take part in its admission&nbsp; tickets were issued to the public at the rate of P5&nbsp; each.&nbsp; The amount&nbsp; collected&nbsp; as&nbsp; admission fees was ¦PI,355 and the Collector of Internal Revenue assessed thereon&nbsp; the sum of P150.42&nbsp; as amusement tax pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph of section 260 of the National Internal Revenue Code, in relation to section 261 of the same Code,&nbsp; as amended by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 586. The Junior Women's Club paid the tax as assessed but later on&nbsp; it requested for the refund of the amount of P82.67 claiming it to be an overpayment.&nbsp;&nbsp; This claim having been denied,, the Junior&nbsp; Women's Club&nbsp; elevated the case to the Board of Tax Appeals (now Court of Tax Appeals), which rendered a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; the club.&nbsp; The Collector of Internal Revenue interposed the present appeal.<br><br>The amusement tax in question was collected under section 260 in relation to&nbsp; section 261, of the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 261 provides that "Where the admission fees or charges are collected by or for and in behalf of a duly registered charitable institution or&nbsp; association, the tax on such admission fees or&nbsp; charges&nbsp; shall be fifty <span style="font-style: italic;">per&nbsp; centum </span>of the rates&nbsp; provided in section two hundred and sixty of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Code."&nbsp; And section 260&nbsp; provides that an amusement tax&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; collected from a proprietor, lessee, or operator of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses,&nbsp; boxing exhibitions and other places of amusement, fixing the rates to be paid upon the amounts paid for admission to&nbsp; said places.&nbsp; Said section also&nbsp; provides for&nbsp; a similar tax to be paid by the proprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets and night clubs, and the rates are to be fixed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the gross receipts&nbsp; from the admission to said places.&nbsp;&nbsp; For ready reference, we are quoting hereunder the pertinent provisions of section 260:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 260. <span style="font-style: italic;">Amusement&nbsp; taxes.</span>—There shall be collected from 'the proprietor,&nbsp; lessee, or operator of theaters,&nbsp; cinematographs, concert halls, circuses, and other places of amusement the following taxes:<br><br>"<i>(i)</i>&nbsp; When&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; paid&nbsp; for admission exceeds&nbsp; ninety-nine centavos, the tax will be thirty <i> per Centum</i>.<br><br>In the case&nbsp; of cockpits, cabarets, and night clubs, there shall&nbsp; be collected from the proprietor, lessee, or operator a&nbsp; tax equivalent to ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per centum,</span> and in the case of race-tracks, twenty <i>per centum</i> of the&nbsp; gross&nbsp; receipts, irrespective of whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not&nbsp; any amount is charged&nbsp; or paid for admission: * * *."<br></blockquote>Appellant&nbsp; contends that when appellee held its Malayan Festival at&nbsp; the Fiesta&nbsp; Pavilion&nbsp; of the Manila Hotel charging certain fees for admission to the show, it became taxable under the aforequoted&nbsp; first paragraph&nbsp; of section 260 because&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; comes within&nbsp; the&nbsp; purview&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; phrase "lessee ... of ... other places&nbsp; of amusement."&nbsp; Appellee on the other hand contends&nbsp; that it comes under the third paragraph of the aforequoted section because&nbsp; in holding such festival it became a lessee of a night club.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Tax Appeals, in upholding the view of&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; went further by saying that it was not merely a lessee but an operator&nbsp; of&nbsp; a night&nbsp; club run in&nbsp; the form of "a&nbsp; cabaret style party"&nbsp; and ordered the refund of the amount claimed.<br><br>We&nbsp; agree with the&nbsp; Secretary of Justice&nbsp; in his&nbsp; opinion on the nature and character of&nbsp; the Manila Hotel rendered on December 10, 1951 to the Administrator of the Economic Cooperative Administration to the effect that "hotel is one which furnishes a traveler&nbsp; with lodging in addition to food and drinks", and that a night club is a "place or establishment selling to the public food or drinks, where the customers are&nbsp; allowed to dance", following the definition given to said club in Executive Order No. 319,&nbsp; series of 1941, issued&nbsp; in connection with the operation of different places of amusement in the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; We also agree ' to the conclusion that the dancing pavilion of the Manila Hotel&nbsp; squarely comes within said&nbsp; definition&nbsp; bec&amp;use it sells food or drinks to&nbsp; the public and its customers are allowed to dance therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we disagree with the&nbsp; contention of appellee&nbsp; that&nbsp; it stepped into the&nbsp; shoes&nbsp; of the Manila Hotel as an operator of a night club&nbsp; when it&nbsp; contracted the use of the Fiesta Pavilion for the&nbsp; celebration of its&nbsp; Malayan Festival and, therefore, at should be&nbsp; considered as a&nbsp; lessee or operator of a night club within the purview of the third paragraph of section 260.&nbsp; Evidently, said paragraph contemplates&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">the&nbsp; operation</span>&nbsp; of a certain place of amusement <span style="font-style: italic;">as&nbsp; of business or for profit</span> and not merely for special occasions more or less casual' or circumstantial.&nbsp; In other words, to come under the purview of said paragraph, the place must be&nbsp; used and operated as a <span style="font-style: italic;">night club in Us true sense and not</span> merely for some&nbsp; occasional celebration.&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of the lease&nbsp; would be merely a place of amusement and in that case it would come under&nbsp; the first&nbsp; paragraph of the same section. In fact, it was&nbsp; only for this specific purpose that the&nbsp; Fiesta Pavilion was leased by appellee, and certainly not for profit . but for charitable purpose.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is therefore erroneous&nbsp; to hold that appellee became the lessee or operator of a cabaret or night&nbsp; club&nbsp; when it leased the&nbsp; Fiesta&nbsp; Pavilion for the celebration of its Malayan Festival on September 20, 1952. The&nbsp; decision appealed from is reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case is dismissed without&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
