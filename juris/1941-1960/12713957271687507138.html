				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Appellant Philippine Packing Corporation is a domestic corporation engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the growing and&nbsp; canning of pineapples&nbsp; in&nbsp; Mindanao for sale&nbsp; locally and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 120,000 tons of pineapple every year&nbsp; are produced by&nbsp; appellant from its plantations,&nbsp; out of&nbsp; which it sells or gives away in fresh state 50,000 tons which&nbsp; are not suitable for canning, for which&nbsp; it is not taxed,&nbsp; and the rest are canned into sliced pineapple, pineapple chunks, crushed pineapple, and pineapple juice.<br><div align="justify"><br>According to the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, the appellant&nbsp; subjects the fresh fruit to the following process :<br><blockquote>"Pineapple fruits are harvested from the plants.&nbsp; After they are washed,&nbsp; peeled&nbsp; and sorted,&nbsp; then sliced, cubed, or crushed, the raw materials are placed in cans.&nbsp; The residual air&nbsp; is&nbsp; removed and heavy syrup, made up&nbsp; from a mixture of juice&nbsp; and sugar,&nbsp; is added.&nbsp; The cans are closed.&nbsp; Heat&nbsp; is applied to sterilize the contents, after which the cans are cooled&nbsp; rapidly.&nbsp; With respect to the&nbsp; canned pineapple juice, no sugar is added.&nbsp; Unless preserved&nbsp; in&nbsp; tin cans, fresh pineapple fruits are very perishable&nbsp; and will not keep longer than two days." (Annex "A" p. 13)<br></blockquote>On October 15, 1948,&nbsp; appellant sent the then Collector of Internal Revenue Bibiano Meer a letter quoted as follows : <br><br>"We wish to&nbsp; refer to your letter dated July 20, 1948 in which you have requested&nbsp; that we file a bond to&nbsp; cover any possible sales of our pineapple products in the Philippines.<br><br>We have&nbsp; recently taken some orders for canned pineapple here in Manila and we will be shipping the goods from Bugo early next. week.<br><br>According to&nbsp; your letter we have to pay 5% tax prior to shipping these goods, however, we are of the opinion it is&nbsp; not necessary for us to pay this&nbsp; tax&nbsp; under Section&nbsp; 188 (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue Code, since our operation is&nbsp; entirely agricultural.<br><br>We will appreciate receiving your decision on the above at your earliest convenience and we&nbsp; would like&nbsp; to&nbsp; take this opportunity to thank you for&nbsp; your kind attention to&nbsp; our matters&nbsp; in the past.** (Exhibit "A")<br><br>to which Collector Meer replied:<br><blockquote>"In reply&nbsp; to your letter dated October 15, 1948, I have the honor to inform you that&nbsp; sales in this country of the pineapple&nbsp; products which you produce&nbsp; herein are&nbsp; exempt from the sales tax imposed in section 186&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code, in accordance with section 188 (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the same&nbsp; code."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit "B")</blockquote>Six years later, on January 13, 1954, appellant received a letter from the appellee&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue through Deputy&nbsp; Collector&nbsp;&nbsp; Silverio&nbsp; Blaquera,&nbsp; demanding payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; P196,060.69 as&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; and&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; taxes and surcharges on its domestic sales of pineapple products since October, 1948 to September, 1953, plus the additional sum of P1,000 as penalty for&nbsp; alleged violation of&nbsp; the Internal&nbsp; Revenue Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the decision of the Collector, appellant appealed to the defunct&nbsp; Board of Tax Appeals, which&nbsp; was succeeded&nbsp; by the Court of Tax Appeals under Republic Act No. 1125.&nbsp; On January 31, 1955,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals affirmed the decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue and on April&nbsp; 11, 1955 denied appellant's motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Wherefore, appellant filed before this Court a petition for review.<br><br>The main issue is whether the domestic sales of pineapples and pineapple products grown and canned by appellants are exempted from tax under Section 188&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the Internal Revenue Code, providing:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 188. <i>Transactions and persons not subject to&nbsp; percentage tax</i>,—In computing the tax imposed in sections one&nbsp; hundred eighty- four, one&nbsp; hundred eighty-five, and&nbsp; one hundred&nbsp; eighty-six,&nbsp; transactions in&nbsp; the following&nbsp; commodities shall be excluded:<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Agricultural products and&nbsp; the ordinary salt when sold, bartered, or exchanged in this country by the producer&nbsp; or owner of the land where produced, as well as fish and its by-products when sold, bartered or exchanged by the fisherman or fishing operator, whether in their original state or not" (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>We find ourselves unable to agree with the Court of Tax Appeals that because the manipulations to which appellant subjects the fresh pineapple fruit grown by it amount to a&nbsp; manufacturing&nbsp; process,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; sale of the&nbsp; canned products becomes a taxable sale of manufactured goods, and not an exempt sale of agricultural products.&nbsp;&nbsp; The very text of&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; in&nbsp; exempting "agricultural products whether in their original state or not," makes it&nbsp; clear&nbsp; that the exemption is not divested merely because the products themselves have undergone processing of some kind.&nbsp; At what particular stage the extent of the manufacturing process extinguishes or&nbsp; supersedes the agricultural&nbsp; character of the product can not be predetermined in advance. But such&nbsp; uncertainties are no obstacle to the application or&nbsp; refusal of the exemption in specific cases.&nbsp; We believe the case before&nbsp; us can&nbsp; be determined&nbsp; following&nbsp; the test set by this Court in Central Azucarera de Bais <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Trinidad, 46 Phil. 492, 499:<br><blockquote>"A planter who devotes himself to the production of sugar cane arid&nbsp; as an&nbsp; incident to such production works his&nbsp; product into a more convenient and valuable form is primarily a planter; his manufacturing is merely an incident to the management of his plantation.&nbsp; His&nbsp; case is manifestly different from that&nbsp; of the plaintiff corporation which, in, effect,&nbsp; buys its raw materials and&nbsp; devotes itself exclusively to converting it into finished merchandise.&nbsp; It may, perhaps, not always be easy to draw the line of demarcation between one business and the other,&nbsp; but&nbsp; difficulties of&nbsp; that sort are frequently encountered in the interpretation of the law."<br></blockquote>The facts on record in the case&nbsp; before us clearly indicate that the canning of appellant's products is a mere incident and consequence of its&nbsp; large scale production of pineapples.&nbsp; Appellant perforce&nbsp; had to&nbsp; resort to a&nbsp; preserving process, for the volume of its products&nbsp; (170,000 tons) made it impossible to dispose of the same in&nbsp; the local market.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; pineapples could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be sold&nbsp; in the open market unless properly ripened; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand, once ripened, the fruit would&nbsp; quickly deteriorate, and become unsalable, unless the&nbsp; deterioration was arrested by some preservative process, which thus becomes an essential part of&nbsp; the production and&nbsp; disposition of the fruit.&nbsp; We believe&nbsp; that the legislature, in providing&nbsp; a tax exemption for agricultural products, "whether in their&nbsp; original state or not", had precisely in&nbsp; mind that&nbsp; fruit crops could not be raised and sold on a large scale without resort to some process to prevent their deterioration.<br><br>The state has not&nbsp; shown&nbsp; that the canned products of appellant corporation have acquired, as a consequence of the processing&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; they are subjected, any use to which the&nbsp; original fruit was&nbsp; not&nbsp; suited,&nbsp; or could&nbsp; not be devoted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is practically admitted (and the Court may well take judicial cognizance thereof)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; nature, qualities and texture of the product are in no way altered, and it distinctly&nbsp; remains an agricultural product.&nbsp; Certainly the canned pineapples as&nbsp; compared to the&nbsp; original fruit&nbsp; have undergone much less change&nbsp; than that&nbsp; found in the case of&nbsp; centrifugal sugar&nbsp; obtained from the sugar cane or of abaca-fiber when compared with the raw plant stalks.&nbsp; And yet&nbsp; the&nbsp; state&nbsp; admits,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the sugar from the cane is exempt from the tax under sec.&nbsp; 188(6)&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue Code.<br><br>That the purpose of the tax exemption now in&nbsp; question was to&nbsp; foster agriculture and the&nbsp; utilization of idle lands was recognized in Molina <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rafferty, 38 Phil. 167.&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing upon this very exemption, the Court said (p. 169-170):<br><blockquote>"The first inquiry, therefore,&nbsp; must relate to the purpose&nbsp; of the Legislative had in mind in&nbsp; establishing&nbsp; the exemption contained&nbsp; in the clause now under consideration.&nbsp; It&nbsp; seems reasonable to assume that it was due&nbsp; to the belief on the&nbsp; part of the law making body that by exempting agricultural products from this&nbsp; tax the farming industry would be favored&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; development of the&nbsp; resources of the country encourage.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a fact, of&nbsp; which&nbsp; we take judicial cognizance,&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; are&nbsp; immense tracts&nbsp; of&nbsp; public land&nbsp; in this country,&nbsp; at present wholly unproductive,&nbsp; which&nbsp; might&nbsp; be&nbsp; made fruitful by&nbsp; cultivation, and that large&nbsp; sums of money go abroad every&nbsp; year&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purchase of food substances&nbsp; which&nbsp; might be grown here.&nbsp; Every&nbsp; dollar's worth&nbsp; of food&nbsp; which&nbsp; the farmer produces and sells in these Islands adds directly to the wealth&nbsp; of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other&nbsp; hand, in the&nbsp; process of&nbsp; distribution of commodities to the ultimate consumer, no&nbsp; direct increase in value results solely&nbsp; from&nbsp; their transfer from one person&nbsp; to another in the course of commercial transactions.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is fairly&nbsp; to be inferred from&nbsp; the statute that&nbsp; the&nbsp; object and purpose of the Legislature was, in&nbsp; general&nbsp; terms,&nbsp; to&nbsp; levy&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax in question, significantly termed the&nbsp; 'merchant's tax,' upon all persons&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; making a&nbsp; profit&nbsp; upon goods produced by others, but to exempt&nbsp; from the tax all persons directly producing goods from&nbsp; the land.&nbsp; In order the accomplish this purpose the Legislature, instead of attempting an enumeration&nbsp; of&nbsp; exempted products, has grouped&nbsp; them all&nbsp; under the general&nbsp; designation of 'agricultural products.'"<br></blockquote>The position of appellant corporation comes squarely under this ruling.&nbsp; It&nbsp; directly&nbsp; produces its&nbsp; goods&nbsp; from the cultivation&nbsp; of land, merely engaging in the suitable preservative processes for the purpose of making the product available at all times, without regard to seasons,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in markets&nbsp; that would not be&nbsp; accessible to the&nbsp; fresh fruit. Appellants does not make its profit&nbsp; upon goods produced by others, and there is no reason why it should not be given the protection that the law affords.<br><blockquote>"Public policy has&nbsp; long&nbsp; favored&nbsp; the&nbsp; exemption of agricultural producers from the taxation&nbsp; of the methods employed by&nbsp; them to put their products&nbsp; upon the market, for the preparation, transportation, and direct sale by the farmer of&nbsp; produce raised&nbsp; by&nbsp; himself is not engagement in a trade, but incident to his business of production.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the exemption or especially favorable classification of farmers, their produce, or their vehicles hauling agricultural products&nbsp; to markets in statutes imposing business occupational, and sales taxes,&nbsp; in statutory trade license provisions,&nbsp; and in highway transportation tax&nbsp; or&nbsp; registration laws, has in a&nbsp; number of cases been held to be based upon&nbsp; a&nbsp; reasonable classification."&nbsp; (2&nbsp; Am. Jur. pp. 399-400).<br></blockquote>The interpretation&nbsp; adopted by the Court of Tax Appeals would limit the benefits of the tax exemption under&nbsp; section 188&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; of the Tax Code to small scale farmers&nbsp; and producers,&nbsp; who can dispose of their products within a short time after the ripening of the fruit.&nbsp; Where this the legislative intent,&nbsp; the exemption&nbsp; for&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; products would have been unnecessary, since the same section already exempts, directly&nbsp; and expressly,—<br><blockquote>"(<i>a</i>) Persons whose gross quarterly sales or receipts do&nbsp; not exceed four hundred fifty pesos.<br><br>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; All persons engaged&nbsp; in public market places exclusively in the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; at&nbsp; retail&nbsp; of&nbsp; domestic meat,&nbsp; fruits,&nbsp; vegetables, game, poultry, fish and other domestic food products.<br><br>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Peddlers and sellers at fixed stands and other similar selling places engaged exclusively in the&nbsp; sale at retail of domestic meat, fruits,&nbsp; vegetables, game, poultry,&nbsp; fish,&nbsp; and similar&nbsp; domestic&nbsp; food products, whose total stock in trade in any one day does not reach a retail value of fifty pesos.<br><br>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; Producers of commodities of all classes working in their own homes, consisting&nbsp; of parents and children living as one family, when the value of each day's production by&nbsp; each person capable of working is not in excess of five pesos."<br></blockquote>With&nbsp; the small producers and merchants already&nbsp; guarded and&nbsp; fostered&nbsp; by the provisions&nbsp; above quoted, we see no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; why&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; further&nbsp; exemption, of&nbsp; agricultural products "whether&nbsp; in their original state or not"&nbsp; should not apply&nbsp; to large scale&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; production and its incidental processes.<br><br>The decision in Bermejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Collector of Internal Revenue, 47 Off. Gaz. (No. 12 Suppl.) p. 292, (upon which the state relies as overruling Central Azucarera&nbsp; de&nbsp; Bais <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Trinidad, 46&nbsp; Phil. 492,&nbsp; and Pampanga Sugar Mills <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Trinidad, 53 Phil. 750), did not consider or discuss the tax exemption under section&nbsp; 188 (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the Internal Revenue Code,&nbsp; and therefore&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; controlling here. Similarly, the American authorities cited for the State refer to manufacturers that are not the growers of the products processed by them;&nbsp; which&nbsp; is precisely the reason&nbsp; why the sugar&nbsp; mills or centrals exclusively devoted to processing the planter's sugar cane, are not exempted from the tax, being, as they are, primarily manufacturers and not producers of agricultural crops.&nbsp; The appellant's situation is just the&nbsp; contrary.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals is reversed, and the domestic sale of pineapple products&nbsp; of appellant,&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Packing Corporation,&nbsp; held exempt from sales tax.&nbsp; Without costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><center><br><i><b>RESOLUTION</b></i><br></center><br><br><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>January 22, 1957</i><br></div><br><b>REYES, J. B.
