Benito Soria there but only Jovito Soria. (1,2 ). A Filipino outaide said, "That 
is the one." Racaza told the witness to stand up and tied him with rope at the 
back near the window. The witness was tied by Campos and other Filipino 
undercovers. The witness Has asced: "Sondaro, sondaro?" to which he answered;

there, Mercado was not there anymore. When Leonilo Mercado and the witness were 
inside the chapel, they were boxed by the accused and others, (4). From the 
chapel they were brought to Inabanga and confined in the municipal jail therein. 
After two or three days, the accused and one Japanese officer brought the 
witness to the Home Economics school building of Inabanga and he was forced to 
surrender arms, and because the witness had no arms he was boxed by the accused. 
(5) The accused whipped him also. The accused was in the <em>Kempei-Tai</em>, 
and used to go armed and with the Japanese to make arrests. (6). Yamagochi 
brought the witness back to Clarin where he was detained for about two weeks.

Leonilo Mercado was also arrested. Her husband was a soldier of the guerrilla. 
Perhaps he was maltreated because the witness heard shouts of pain. The witness 
saw her husband again in the chapel. (18). There she saw also Leonilo Mercado, 
with bruises and bleeding. The accused was arned. She saw her husband when he 
carae back from Inabanga, he was one of the prisoners in the <em>Kempei-Tai</em> 
headquarters in Clarin. (19). One of the prisoners was Leonilo Mercado. (20). 
Her husband cried of pain because he was maltreated among others by the 
accused.</p>
<p>Donato Apricio, 44, married, policeman of Clarin, testified that on the 
morning of July 1, 1944, he saw in the chapel Jovito Soria and Leonilo Mercado 
who were tied, followed by two undercovers and Japanese. The " accused was one 
of the undercovers. The witness saw the accused in the school building of

<p>Jose do la Cerna, married, customs inspector, Cebu City, testified that on 
July 29, 1944, there was a bloody struggle which culminated in the mass arrests 
of people in the vicinity of Doljo, Mambaling, Basak, up to Talisay. The witness 
was arrested in his house in Basak by two Japanese soldiers. He was told by the 
Japanese soldiers to proceed to the schoolhouse immediately as there was a 
meeting there. The two Japanese soldiers left his house and immediately went to 
the other houses. When the witness arrived at the Basak school he saw many 
persons already sitting. The newcomers were segregated from the group. Filemon 
Delgado, an undercover, went with a boy to the witness' group and asked him. to 
tell who are those connected with the guerrilla and those who contributed money. 
The boy pointed to the witness as one of the suppliers of the guerrilla and 
indicated the person who was the messenger of Governor Abellana connected with 
the guerrilla. Delgado dragged the witness from the group and brought him to 
Watanabe who boxed him. The witness fell to the ground, and Antonio Racaza 
stepped on his throat. He became unconscious, and when he recovered 
consciousness he was brought to the school with his hands tied behind his back. 
Roberto Bautista, another undercover, started investigating about Governor 
Abellana and the witness brought Domingo. Roberto Bautista beat him with a 
wooden stick. Other undercovers, unknown to the witness, told Bautista that the 
witness was connected with the Cebu customs house and had firearms. There were 
many who were investigated and were later killed in Toong. (28-31).</p>
<p>Guillermo Ca√±izares, 56, married, farmer, Sibonga, Cebu, testified that he 
knows the accused who is also known as Dodong. On May 7, 1942, the accused, with 
Jesus Campos and Olando confiscated witness' shotgun to be surrendered to the 
Japanese. The accused and companions said that the confiscation was on orders of 
the Japanese. (36) Jesus Campos stated that he was working under the Japanese 
intelligence division and that his companions were under him. (39, 40).</p>
<p>Roberto Lariosa, 1946, single, public school teacher, Sibonga, Cebu, 
testified that on May 5, 1942, on the way to barrio Taloot, Jesus Campos 
accompanied by the accused snatched his revolver. Showing something written in 
Japanese characters, Jesus Campos said that it was the authority given to him by 
the Japanese to confiscate all firearms for the Japanese. (44). And that the 
accused was his subordinate and that both were working for the Japanese. At that 
time the accused did nothing. (45). The incident happened at 4:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon. (46).</p>
<p>Kong Niko, 47, married, merchant, Sibonga, Cebu, testified that he knew the 
accused since he came to the Philippines in 1915. On May 7, 1942, Jesus Campos 
and the accused went to Toong, where the witness was harvesting his corn at the 
time and told him to surrender his revolver, otherwise the Japanese general 
would bring two carloads of Japanese soldiers to the place. Jesus Calapos and 
the accused were both carrying a pistol. 0+9,50). The witness delivered his 
firearm to Jesus Campos. The accused said that the Japanese ordered him to 
confiscate the firearm. ( On cross-examination the witness testified that, 
although he arrived from China since 1915 he came to know the accused in 1925- 
(52).</p>
<p>Tereso Sanchez, 26, married, laborer, Mambaling, Cebu City, testified that on 
July 29, 1944 the civilians in Mambaling were apprehended and grouped together 
and whoever was pointed as a soldier by an undercover named Boy was tied. The 
accused was present and gave blows to the soldiers. Jose de la Cerna was in the 
school building of Basalt where he was tied and beaten with an iron pipe by the 
accused. The witness slept in the school building of Basak. The next morning, 
July 30, those who were apprehended were made to go down from the school 
building. Tsuriyama, the head of the Kempel-Tai, ordered them to be brought to 
the mountain of Toong,where they were killed. Among the undercovers present were 
Antonio Hacaza, Julio Nolasco, Vicente Cobarrubias, Filemon Delgado, (56-59), 
Perfecto Labra, and others, When they reached the mountain, all those 
apprehended were ordered to sit down. Ten minutes later, the witness heard the 
report of a pistol. Then the <em>Kempei-Tai</em> leader ordered them to go to 
the firing line and upon arriving there the witness saw one of his companions 
who was killed, not knowing by whoa. Before the witness was shot, he saw the 
accused kill Dodong Martinez. Dodong Martinez was made to turn his back. The 
undercovers took their pistols and asked Dodong where his arms were. Dodong 
could not tell because he was not a soldier. He was shot. (60). The accused used 
a revolver. There were about 17 who were killed. What they did to the witness 
was similar to what they did to Dodong Marti- nez. He was shot by Fileraon 
Delgado. "I was hit on the back of my neck on the left side and the bullet went 
out on my choek under the left eye." As a result, the witness lost the sight of 
his left eye. The witness showed a scar on the left side of the neck but no scar 
was found below the left eye. (61l). The bullet hit him on the nape of the neck 
and went out below his left eye. (65). Below the left eye the witness showed an 
elongated scar, about, two centimeters just on the rim of the lobe of the eye. 
(67).</p>
<p>Dionisio M. Flores, 51, married, physician, Cebu City, testified that he 
finished medicine in Santo Tomas University in 1921 and has practiced medicine 
since then. He practiced surgery for three years in the hospital. The scar on 
the left lower naps of Tereso Sanchez is probably due to a bullet wound. It is 
hard to determine whether the scar below the left eye is due to a bullet wound 
or some other weapon. It is possible that a bullet could have made its exit from 
the left eye, and that it is possible for a man to live after having been hit by 
a bullet, entering his lower left nape, and making an egress below the left eye 
if it did not touch any important vessel. (69, 70, 71). The witness said that it 
is quite hard to determine whether the scar below the left eye of Tereso Sanchez 
is due to a bullet wound or to a surface wound. He.did not examine Sanchez at 
the time he received the wound. It is hard to determine if the scar is due to a 
wound which was the egress of a bullet. (78).</p>
<p>Antonio de la Cerna, 28, married, laborer, Cebu City, testified that at 7 
o'clock in the morning of July 29, 1944, he was arrested by undercovers in 
Alaska, Hambaling. He was ordered to group together with others in Mambaling and 
he saw several undercovers, including the accused, who was one of those who 
boxed him. He also maltreated others. (80). The leader of the Japanese Subitai 
arrived. lie went to a house at the plaza in front of the chapel of Mambaling 
and ordered the arrested persons to form a line one by one, and then ordered 
them to walk with their face turned to the left. Behind the Japanese leader 
there were two persons placed in concealment in the house, named Boy and Tirzo, 
who indicated who were soldiers and who were not. Boy told the Japanese that the 
witness was a soldier. Then Campos tied him and asked him where his arms here. 
Because the witness did not reveal his arms and said that he was a civilian, 
Campos "boxed and kicked him. The witness was brought with others to the 
schoolhouse of Basak, where he was tied and linked together with others. (80). 
At 7:00 o'clock the next morning, the witness and others were made to walk 
towards Sandayong "barrio. There they found a man "bathing. He was arrested and 
asked where his soldiers were. Because the man did not tell where the soldiers 
were, he was tied, hanged and beaten. Then they were brought to Toong. (81). The 
Japanese were making sketches of the place where the arrested per- sons were 
going to be killed. They were asked for their arras and those who did not reveal 
theirs were killed by the undercovers and the Japanese. The accused killed 
Dodong Martinez. (82). He tised a revolver. (83).</p>
<p>Before the evidence for the defense, the accused admitted that he is a 
Filipino citizen. (85, 86).</p>
<p>The witnesses for the defense testified in substance as follows:</p>
<p>Bernarda Regodon, 28, married, Sibonga, Cebu testified that she heard that 
the accused was captured by the Japanese together with Jesus Campos. (87).</p>
<p>Mariano T. Jaucian, 35, married, testified that the first time he saw the 
accused he was being held by the Japanese as a military prisoner, the same as 
Jesus Campos and Silvino Centeno. That was way back in 1942 At that time the 
witness was in the Cebu police attached to the Japanese military police. After 
two or three months, the prisoners were forwarded to Manila.(90) The accused was 
investigated by Sergeant Tagashi Yoshida at the Snead dormitory. He was severely 
maltreated with a baseball bat, required to stand with a can full of water on 
his head, and for every drop he allowed to fall he was'beaten, or maltreated. 
(91). The accused fell unconscious three of four times. A Japanese doctor gave 
him injections to revive him. (93).</p>
<p>Antonio Racaza, 25, single, testified that he knew the accused in Bohol, when 
he was sent there by the Japanese. Yoshida entrusted him to Watanabe as a 
prisoner in Clarin on July 25, 1944. The witness was the chauffeur of Watanabe. 
(95). The accused was assigned to the Vuchen and slept in a room used as a 
prison cell. He helped in the cooking of food and taking of water. He remained 
there from the month of June to July 25, 1944 when he went to Cebu. (97).</p>
<p>Margarito Campos, 29, single, the accused, testified that on July 7, 1912, he 
was arrested by the Japanese imputing to him the making of anti-Japanese 
propaganda and espionage. He was arrested with Jesus Campos. They were taken to 
Snead dormitory, served as a Japanese prisoner. Yoshida investigated them as to 
the arms taken by Jesus Campos. (100). The accused was beaten with an indoor 
baseball bat and was forced to lift a can full of water. Whenever he lacked 
enough strength to hold the can, he was beaten. The operation took place for two 
or three hours. The accused said that he took no part in the collection of arms. 
He was confined in the Snead dormitory for more than three months. (101). On 
September 26, 1942, the accused escaped, but three days later, September 29, he 
was recaptured by the Japanese. He was again maltreated On September 29, 1944, 
he was brought to the Japanese Subitai in San Carlos College where he was 
forwarded to the <em>Kempei-Tai</em> which maltreated him. He was boxed, beaten 
with the butt of the rifle by the Japanese officers and soldiers. He was asked 
with regard to his excape. He was kept by the Japanese <em>Kempei-Tai</em> until 
October 7, when he was sent to Manila. (102). He was sent with several 
co-prisoners under heavy guard in a steamship. On arriving in Manila on October 
7, they were brought to the Japanese military administration, at the Marsman 
building. Then they were brought to the Bilibid Prison. (103) In December, 1942, 
he was court-martialed together with lesus Campos and S. Campos for 
anti-Japanese propaganda and espionage. The charge was not true. It was not true 
that the accused is one of those who apprehended Jovita Soria, a school teacher 
of Clarin. The witness was one of the prisoners brought to Clarin under the 
custody of the Japanese Watanabe. it is not true that he arrested Cirilo 
Hercado, mayor of Sibonga. He had not killed Dodong Martinez whom he does not 
even know.. He was not present in the mass arrest in Basak on July 29, 1944, 
because he was sent back to the normal school building where he was imprisoned 
again. It is not true that he maltreated and tortured Jose de la Cerna. While 
the accused was in Basak, the Japanese asked him whether he knew de la Cerna, 
and he answered that he did not know him. (38). De la Cerna was asked if he knew 
the accused and he answered no. The Japanese ordered them to push each other. It 
is not true that the witness was present during the Basak roassacre or that he 
had beaten de la Cerna with an iron pipe. (105). After the accused was 
court-martialed in Manila, he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and in 
January, 1943, he was sent to Bilibid Prison in Muntinglupa. (106). The 
court-martial was presided over by five Japanese officers. There was an 
interpreter. There was no prosecutor. The interpreter acted at the same time as 
prosecutor. (108). There was no one who tes- tified against the accused. He was 
made to answer the charges against him. Ko defense counsel was assigned to the 
accused. He witnesses were presented against the accused. (110). The accused was 
not allowed to present witnesses in his favor. The court-martial trial lasted 
for half an hour. (111).</p>
<p>Felipe C. Moreno, 41, carried, goIdsmith, Cebu City, testified that the 
accussed was staying with him when Jesus Canipos ordered this arrest. (12C). The 
witness was not present viien the arrest took place. (120, 121).</p>
<p>Cornelio C. de los Santos, 35, single, attorney-at-law, resident of Sibonga, 
testified that on July 16, 1942, when he was taken fron Sibonga to Cebu City, he 
was placed in a cell where the accused and others rere confined. They were 
together from July 16 to August 27 when the witness was transferred to the Cebu 
Provincial Jail, as a prisoner of war. (124, 125).</p>
<p>Margarito Campos, recalled, declared that there was a high ranking officer of 
the Philippine Army who was confined with him in the coll. It was Col. Emanuel 
Baja, who wrote a poem, one dedicated to his wife who was a hostage at Fort 
Santiago and the other "The Rosary" dedicated to Raymunda Guidote, his 
prisonmate in- side the Bilibid Prison. They read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"PRISONER'S SONG (Dedicated to Mrs. Emmanuel Baja,<br>Fort 
Santiago,Manila</p>
<p>"Resigned to fate and all I hope and pray<br>Throughout the long weary hours 
of the day<br>Thus I measured my time from morn till night<br>Praying and 
hoping for the Division Light.</p>
<p>"A night of waiting is soon passed and gone<br>Hopeless, yet a new hope 
comes with each dawn.<br>Like waves although on shores or crags 
breaking<br>Still keep on surging and keep on coming.</p>
<p>"As each hope dies one much stronger is born<br>Too on the wins in the early 
morn<br>Soaring heavenward and reaching the sky<br>From whence it flies back to 
earth with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Though dreams would wither and hopes fade away<br>Happy I greet the birth of 
a new day<br>With brighter hope each time<br>A prayer sore sacred and more 
sublime.</p>
<p>"However thorny, rough and dark is my way<br>Though cruel and brutal and 
bitter each<br>passing day<br>I do not lose hope till end of my trail<br>Where 
naught prevails and prayer will avail.</p>
<p>"ROSARY (Dedicated to Raymunda Guidote)</p>
<p>"The Rosary your hands have wrought<br>From old rags in your prison 
cell<br>Recalls my good old thoughts of stories Mother used to tell<br>Of 
parables told by Father, pious stories of olden time<br>Of prayer songs sung by 
Mother raid of church bells telling their chimes.</p>
<p>"As the Angelus ushers the night when old folks<br>at home kneel and 
pray<br>The vesper bells in the twilight at the close and end of the 
day<br>Rosary, oppressed's salvation, you have coursed divine life, light and 
love<br>The illumination, true devotion and the glows from high above<br>And in 
my misery I pray a new Rosary day by day<br>Be eternal, everlasting, forever and 
ever<br>Amen.</p>
<p>"My guards may burn your Rosary<br>They may tear cross and beads apart<br>But 
it will remain in my memory<br>For I enshrine it in my heart."</p></blockquote>
<p>The evidence on record has proved conclusively that appellant, a Filipino 
citizen, as an undercover in the service of the Japanese, participated in the 
arrest of Jovito Soria, a teacher who was inducted as civilian soldier and aa 
signal officer, in charge of the telephone of the resistance movement, and that 
he, on July 21, 1944, in the mountains of Toons, killed Dodong Martinez, one of 
the civilians who as guerrillas were arrested in Mambaling on July 21, 1944, and 
gathered first in the schoolhouse of Basak before being brought to the execution 
ground in the mountains. Jovito Soria and his wife Abundia have testified about 
the arrest of the first, and the killing of Dodong Martinez was testified to by 
Tereso Sanchez and Antonio de la Cerna. As regards the alleged arrest of Leonilo Mercado, there is no satisfactory evidence that the accused tool: part in it. 
There is conclusive evidence that he was one of those arrested and later 
confined in the Japanese garrison in Clarin, but there is nothing to show as to 
who actually effected his arrest.</p>
<p>The acts committed by appellant constitute the crime of treason as defined 
and punished by Article 1944 of the Revised Penal Code. The lower court 
sentenced him correctly to suffer life imprisonment, which should be understood 
to be <em>reclusion perpetua</em> with the accessories of the law, and to pay a 
fine of P10,000 and the costs.</p>
<p>The appealed decision is affirmed.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, 
Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason,</em> and <em>Montemayor, JJ.,</em> concur.
