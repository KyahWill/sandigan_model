				<H3>FELIX SANDOVAL, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for certiorari to review a resolution of the 
Commission on Elections not giving due course to the certificate of 
candidacy of herein petitioner, Felix Sandoval, a candidate during the 
last elections for councilor of Binmaley, Pangasinan. At the 
commencement of the proceedings in this Court, a writ of preliminary 
injunction was issued ordering the Commission on Elections to give due 
course to petitioner's certificate of candidacy and to consider and 
count the votes cast in his favor on November 10, 1959.
  <p>    It appearing from the record now before us, however, that the 
petitioner was not elected councilor, the question on whether or not his
 certificate of candidacy was filed in accordance with law has become 
moot and purely academic.</p>
  <p>    In view whereof, the petition should be, as it is hereby 
dismissed. Without costs. </p>
  <p><em>Paras, C .J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Endencia</em>, and <em>Barrera, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
