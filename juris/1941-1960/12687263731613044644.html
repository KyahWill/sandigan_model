				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, ordering him to vacate house No. 207 Gastambide, Manila, and 
to pay the plaintiffs, as reasonable compensation for its use, the sum of P100 
per month from February 5, 1945, until the house shall have been vacated.
<p>The complaint alleges, and the evidence for the plaintiffs tends to show, 
that the defendant on or about February 5, 1945, taking advantage of the 
confusion and disorder resulting from the battle for the liberation of the City 
of Manila, entered and took possession of the house in question without the 
knowledge or consent of its owner, plaintiff Virginia Sta. Maria-Garcia (wife of 
other plaintiff Vitaliano Garcia), and that notwithstanding demands made by said 
owner, through her mother, the defendant has refused to vacate the same. The 
defendant, in his answer and through his evidence, tries to show that he 
occupied the property with the knowledge and upon permission of ono Antonio do 
Zuzuarregui, who was authorized by the plaintiffs to take care of and lease the 
same to anybody; that said defendant saved the house from further looting after 
its former lessee, a Japanese, was killed by the guerrillas on February 4, 1945; 
and that, as a matter of fact, the said Antonio de Zuzuarregui gave him Exhibit 
1 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With reference to the verbal answer given to my note, notifying the owner of 
the house adjoining mine, located at Gastambide Street of the death of the 
Japanese tenant, whereof I was encharged of the vigilance, I hereby authorize 
Mr. Gustavo Sancho to take charge of same to avoid further depredations at the 
premises and if he feels like occupying the house as a tenant he may pay the 
rent in accordance with the law of home rent.</p>
<p>"Otherwise he will be given an adequate time to vacate the building should he 
not be inclined to continue in the premises as a tenant.</p>
<p>"I also told him to fix the slight damages already caused in the 
premises."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court found that Antonio de Zuzuarregui was never authorized by the 
plaintiffs to lease the house in question; that the latter merely entrusted to 
him the task of watching and taking care of said house, with a view to 
protecting the same against looters; and that, even on the assumption that said 
Antonio de Zuzuarregui was authorized to lease it, the lease relied upon by the 
defendant had to be on a month-to-month basis.</p>
<p>We have examined the record and found that the appealed judgment is correct. 
Even under the document invoked by the defendant, there is nothing to show in a 
positive manner that Antonio de Zuzuarregui was ever authorized by the 
plaintiffs to lease the house. At most, it indicates that he was charged with 
its vjgilance. Said document (Exhibit 1) is evidence of the fact that Antonio de 
Zuzuarregui authorized the defendant "to take charge of same to avoid further 
depredations at the premises and if he feels like occupying the house as a 
tenant he may pay the rent," but it cannot serve to prove that he was in turn 
given the power by the plaintiffs to give the house in lease.</p>
<p>Even assuming, however, that Antonio de Zuzuarregui had such authority, we 
agree with the trial court that the lease was monthly. Under defendant's Exhibit 
1, the lease, if any, was not for a fixed or stipulated duration and, according 
to his own testimony, he was ready to pay a monthly rental of P90 or P100. Hence 
by virtue of article 1581 of the Civil Code, said lease, which is deemed 
monthly, may be terminated at the end of every month.</p>
<p>The defendant cannot avail himself of the benefits afforded by the Rental Law 
(Commonwealth Act No. 689) since, as hereinabove stated, he does not hold any 
lease, and since the plaintiffs in this case need the premises for themselves. 
It is thus needless to dwell further on the significance of the circumstances 
that the defendant is actually occupying another house located right in front of 
the premises in question, and that he has been subletting the latter property, 
or a part thereof, to other persons.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment will therefore be, as the same is hereby, affirmed. So 
ordered, with costs against the defendant.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, 
Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Hontiveros, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i>
