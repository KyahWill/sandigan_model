				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LORENZO MINTU, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The trial court found appellant Lorenzo Mintu guilty of the 
crime of robbery with rape and sentenced him to twenty years of <i>reclusion 
temporal</i> and to pay jointly and severally with his co-accused Fernando 
Masikap the offended party in the sum of P270, value of the articles taken.
<p align="justify">There is no question that on September 2, 1946, at about 10 
o'clock in the evening, four persons, one armed with a pistol and the others 
with rifles, entered the house of Andres Zabala in Mulawin, Tanza, Cavite, and 
took and carried away with them several pieces of clothes, jewelry and other 
personal effects valued in all at P270. While the robbery was being perpetrated, 
one of the robbers, Fernando Masikap, raped Maria Zabal, 22, married with German 
Gimenez, daughter of the owner of the house, Andres Zabala, although the rape 
was committed without the assistance of the other malefactors.</p>
<p align="justify">The main question raised by appellant Lorenzo Mintu is whether 
or not he has been sufficiently identified as one of the malefactors. After a 
careful weighing of the testimonies on record, we are satisfied that Andres and 
Maria Zabala, witnesses for the prosecution, have sufficiently identified 
appellant as one of the robbers. Mintu was known to Maria Zabala before the 
crime was committed because she used to see him pass by a small store she had 
when she was still single. At the time the robbery was being committed, there 
was light in the house, and the robbrs did not cover their faces or took any 
other precaution to avoid their being identified by the dwellers.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that when Andres Zabala went the next morning to the 
authorities to denounce the robbery he was unable to mention the name of Mintu, 
but this failure is explained by the fact that he did not know then the name of 
the accused. It is also true that Mayor Eustaquio V. Arayata testified that on 
September 3, 1946, when Andres Zabala reported to him the robbery and he asked 
him as to the identity of the robbers, Zabala said that he did not know them, 
but his answer can easily be interpreted as menaing that Andres Zabala did not 
know the names of the robbers with the exception of one Pando, with whom he used 
to know accused Fernando Masikap.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, when appellant was already arrested he was pointed 
out by Andres and Maria Zabala as among the robbers, and Mintu chose to keep 
silent when he could then express his protest if he was not one of the 
robbers.</p>
<p align="justify">Through his own testimony and that of Marcelino Buctong, Mintu 
tried to show that, in the night when the robbery was being committed, he was at 
his home attending to his wife who was then suffering stomach-ache. To cure her 
he solicited the services of Marcelino Buctong. We found no merit in the alibi. 
According to Marcelino Buctong he has been called may times to treat Mintu's 
wife, but the only date that he could specify in going ot Minut's house for the 
purpose is that the night of September 2, 1946, and no valid reason was given by 
him for not remembering anyone of the other dates. On the other side, there is 
absolutely no showing on record why Andres and Maria Zabala should have accused 
appellant falsely as one of the robbers.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed decision is in accordance with law, paragraph 2 of 
article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, and is affirmed with costs against 
appellant.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
