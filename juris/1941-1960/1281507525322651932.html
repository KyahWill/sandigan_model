</style><div align="justify">After the corresponding trial in the court of first instance of Ifugao, 
Mountain Province, Kimmayong Ballugan, age 48, was found guilty of having 
murdered Dumangeng Pulpog. Accordingly he was sentenced to imprisoned not less 
than 12 years and on day nor more than twenty years, with accessories, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay 
costs.
<p>He took the matter to the Court of Appeals, But said court, believing from 
the testimonial and documentary evidence that he was guilty as charged of 
murder, and that he should be given life Imprisonment, forwarded the record to 
this Court for proper disposition under the law.</p>
<p>There is no question that Dumangeng Pulpog, male, resident of sitio Binalew, 
barrio Cababuyan, Municipal district of Banawe, died in the night of January 20, 
1952 as a result of several incised wounds violently inflicted while he was on 
the way to his residence from a visit to his daughter living in sitio Pagayapi 
same barrio. Said daughter Guimaway Dumangeng was following him on that 
occasion, and she declared, in open court, substantially as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When at dusk we reached sitio Kotowol I saw Balitog Dumangeng and the accused 
Kimmayong coming from Banawe in our direction,, Then they separated, Kimmayong 
going toward his home. My father (Pulpog) who walked ahead of me along the 
trail, met Balitog Dumangeng (to be called Balitog to avoid confusion) , and the 
latter suddenly hurled his spear, missing the mark, because my father stopped 
aside in time. Then in swift retaliation my father thrust his spear at Balitog, 
hitting him in the abdomen. Instantly the two grappled together. They rolled 
down to a lower elevation where the straggle continued. Balitog having got the 
worst, (his intestines were coming out) called for help, yelling "where are you 
Kimmayong, I am hit by the spear of Dumangeng" (Pulpog). My father left his 
antagonist, and climb back to the trail. Suddenly Kimmayong arrived and saying, 
"wait for me and we shall fight", chased my father bolo in hand, and having 
overtaken him, slashed him on the shoulder and on the head. I ran away, 
thoroughly scared, returned to my house and closed the door for fear that my 
neighbors who are relatives of Kimmayong might do me harm. Early the next day I 
reported my father's death to my uncle Dulnuan Dinamling, and to the Mayor of 
Banawe before whom I charged Kimmayong with my father's demise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ugnayon Dapdapol, 36, policeman of Banawe gave corroborative testimony to the 
effect that a telephone report was received at the municipal building that 
Pulpog had killed' Balitog, so the policemen went to arrest Pulpog, but found 
him dead under his own house. His widow informed them her husband had been 
killed by Kimmayong. (33 s. n.)</p>
<p>Other evidence proved that the police and the constabulary then went to the 
house of Kimmayong to arrest him. He was not there, but his wife was, She gave 
them permission to search the house. Examining a palay stack in the house they 
discovered safely hidden therein a scabbard and the bolo Exh. B which was 
stained with blood, which must have been recent because it smelled like fish. 
The wife admitted that it was her husband's bolo. Dapdapol also positively 
identified it was Kimmayong's bolo, because he saw it once in the latter's 
possession.</p>
<p>The defendant denied having fought with or wounded Pulpog, whose death, 
according to him, was due to wounds inflicted by Balitog when Balitog was 
attacked by Pulpog with the assistance of Tolac Dakkawe, Dulnuan Dinamling, and 
Natocla Dinamling on that same occasion.</p>
<p>His version, in short, is that that night he heard Balitog shouting "Where 
are you Kimmayong, because I am speared by Dumangeng (Pulpog) and some 
companions"; that he called for their neighbors, Dapolon Lupai, Bantian 
Dinamling and Ballugan Kindipan; that they all went to render help to Balitog, 
and found him lying on the ground, mortally wounded; that explaining his wounds 
Balitog said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was following the path I was speared on the side of my abdomen and I 
saw it was Dumangeng. I was speared again on the other side of my abdomen and I 
turned my head and I saw it was Tolac Dakkawe who speared me. I was again 
speared on the back and when I turned around I saw Dulnuan Dinamling and Natocla 
Dinamling who speared me from behind, x x x Seeing that my enemies were many I 
saw Dumangeng whom I grabbed and we rolled down together until we came to a 
level spot. Upon reaching that level spot we both stood up, then I drew my bolo 
and gave him a blow on the neck. I gave him a second blow on his head and when 
he was trying to ran away I gave him again a blow at his back"</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial judge, Hon. Jose R, de Venecia and the Court of Appeals rejected 
defendant's story because it was highly improbable that with the mortal wounds 
inflicted on Balitog by Pulpog (and companions, according to defense) said 
Balitog could still have sufficient strength and courage to inflict five serious 
wounds on Pulpog. According to a defense witness, Balitog said (p. 98) "when 
Dumangen Pulpog was trying to go away I continued to follow him and gave (him) 
another blow on the back". With intestines out, Balitog could net possibly do 
that, We agree that the story is inherently implausible<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>. Besides, it does not tally with the 
undeniable fact that when the police were notified the next day of the death of 
Balitog, Pulpog alone was mentioned as the killer. (See pages 134, 136 and 148 
s.n.)</p>
<p>And so far as the record shows, no action has even been filed against 
Pulpog's companions for Balitog's death. Furthermore, if the events developed as 
defendant narrated, why did his party hide the bolo, supposing it was Balitog’s? 
Anyone, even a non-Christian, knows that Balitog was not to blame under the 
circumstances.</p>
<p>Finally it appears from defendant's story that <u>before</u> <u>going</u> to 
help Balitog, Kimmayong and companions prepared a stretcher and brought it with 
them. This shows they knew, or Kimmayong knew, that Balitog was already dying or 
mortally wounded, could not walk and would have to be carried. Which suggests 
that what really happened was this: after retaliating for Balitog and downing 
Pulpog, (as told by the People’s witness) Kimmayong looked for companions to 
help him carry Balitog home. They made the stretcher, and carried Balitog home. 
Such central fact, was subsequently embroidered and tailored to fit defendant's 
story, which would paint Balitog as a native superman, even as it frees 
Kimmayong from criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>We entertain no reasonable doubt that to avenge the defeat of Balitog, his 
companion, Kimmayong pursued Pulpog and hacked him to death. However, we do not 
believe there was treachery, the assault not being sudden, because he warned 
Pulpog of his purpose, shouting, "wait for me and we will fight", and the latter 
having had a chance to prepare for the attack<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>.</p>
<p>The crime was homicide punishable with reclusion temporal. (Art. 249 Revised 
Penal Code.) The medium period (applicable in the absence of modifying 
circumstances) is 14 years 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in view of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, this appellant should 
be, and is hereby sentenced to be in prison not less than 8 years nor more than 
17 years, plus accessories, and to pay P2,000 indemnity and the costs. The 
appealed judgment is modified accordingly. So ordered.</p>

Balitog said is admissible as part of <u>res</u> <u>gestae</u>. Surely it was
