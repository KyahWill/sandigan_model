				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; sentencing&nbsp; defendant and appellant to pay plaintiff and appellee&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; P46,093.77, with&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of&nbsp; 6 per cent on P30,000 thereof from&nbsp; September 27,&nbsp; 1949 and on P16,093.77 from December 8,&nbsp; 1949 until the amount is fully paid, (2) 20 per cent of&nbsp; the full amount thereof as damages by way of attorney's fees,&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; the costs of the suit.<p>On June 29,&nbsp; 1948 plaintiff and appellee&nbsp; undertook to construct for defendant and appellant the building known as the Zulueta&nbsp; or&nbsp; Antonio Apartments,&nbsp; a four-story re-enforced concrete edifice at the north corner of Mabini and Arquiza Streets, City of Manila.&nbsp; Construction&nbsp; was to be in accordance with plans&nbsp; and specifications prepared by Manalac Construction Co., which&nbsp; acted as defendant and appellant's architects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner was to furnish&nbsp; the re-enforcing steel, the cement, the steel windows, and the plumbing fixtures and accessories.&nbsp; The contract price was P286,755.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was expressly agreed that should any change in the construction be agreed&nbsp; upon and made, the cost of the same shall&nbsp; be an addition to the contract price. Two&nbsp; hundred and&nbsp; fifteen&nbsp; days was agreed upon&nbsp; as the period for&nbsp; the construction and&nbsp; termination of the edifice, but that said period was to be automatically extended for delays occasioned by late deliveries&nbsp; of the materials, and by fortuitous cases like, earthquakes&nbsp; and bad weather.</p><p>As to acceptance, the following&nbsp; terms and&nbsp; conditions ,appear in the contract:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Article 7.â€”<em>Acceptance&nbsp; and final payment</em>&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; final&nbsp; payment shall be due and&nbsp; payable&nbsp; ten (10)&nbsp; days after the essential completion of the work provided the. work be then&nbsp; fully completed and the contract&nbsp; fully performed and provided&nbsp; further that the&nbsp; Contractor&nbsp; shall have&nbsp; delivered to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Architect&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; Owner&nbsp; such Final Certificates as may be required by&nbsp; the public&nbsp; authorities.&nbsp; </p><p>"The&nbsp; contractor shall be under obligation to repair hidden defects and leaks in the construction which may&nbsp; be discovered within six (6) months after final completion and acceptance&nbsp; of the construction.&nbsp; </p><p>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; Upon receipt of written&nbsp; notice that&nbsp; the work is ready for final inspection and acceptance,&nbsp; the&nbsp; architect shall promptly make such inspection, and when&nbsp; he finds the work acceptable&nbsp; under the contract and&nbsp; the contract fully performed, he shall&nbsp; promptly issue a final certificate over his own signature, stating that the work provided for in this contract has been completed and is accepted by him under the terms and conditions thereof, and&nbsp; that the balance found to be due the contractor except the final ten per cent (10 per cent) as noted in said final certificate,&nbsp; is due and payable.&nbsp; </p><p>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; Before issuance of final certificate, the contractor shall submit evidence&nbsp; satisfactory to the&nbsp; architect that all payrolls, material bills,&nbsp; and&nbsp; other indebtedness connected with the&nbsp; work have&nbsp; been paid.&nbsp; </p><p>"Should&nbsp; for&nbsp; any reason beyond the contractor's control or responsibility, due&nbsp; to any&nbsp; reasons as&nbsp; set forth in. these contractual documents, the contractor be unable to supply&nbsp; the final certificate of acceptance by the city authorities due to portions of the work being incomplete which are not a part of the contractor's work, then said final payment shall be&nbsp; made to the contractor notwithstanding the final certificate of acceptance being not&nbsp; issued: Provided, however, that the contractor shall certify to the satisfaction of the owner that all the&nbsp; work,&nbsp; terms and&nbsp; conditions described in this contract have been performed according to specifications."&nbsp; (Exhibit "A".)</p></blockquote><p>The&nbsp; original contract price was paid&nbsp; in full and the action&nbsp; seeks&nbsp; to recover the additional cost of constructing&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) a swimming pool and changes on the fourth floor, (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; a&nbsp; recreation room, and&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; electric wiring for the swimming poll and an additional pump Exhibits "C"&nbsp; and "N").&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important defenses&nbsp; set up against the claim&nbsp; are abandonment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction and delay&nbsp; in its completion and failure of plaintiff and&nbsp; appellee to secure a final&nbsp; certificate from the public authorities, and defects in the construction, such as leaks, unevenness of the terrace filing,&nbsp; cracks on the walls of the building, etc.&nbsp; The trial court found that the building was completed in accordance with the contract, that the delay in completion was caused by delays in furnishing&nbsp; the building materials and by additional work agreed upon by the parties&nbsp; and substantial changes in the original&nbsp; plan, and that the alleged defects were waived in&nbsp; advance by defendant&nbsp; and appellee, who had&nbsp; insisted on the construction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; swimming pool against the advice of plaintiff, etc.</p><p>On this appeal defendant and appellant contends that there was no completion and acceptance,&nbsp; as required in Article 7 of the contract, and hence plaintiff and appellant is not entitled to the payment of the amount of P46,093.77 demand in the&nbsp; action.</p><p>There is no question that the work had been completed, but it is&nbsp; also undisputed that&nbsp; there were leaks in some parts of the edifice, same defects in the drainage,&nbsp; and the contractor had&nbsp; not, at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; of the action, delivered the final certificate from the public&nbsp; authorities required of him&nbsp; by the provision of the contract above&nbsp; quoted.&nbsp; But against these objections, we have the following facts:&nbsp; (1) On September 8, 1949 the owner's&nbsp; architects&nbsp; made a certificate of final&nbsp; acceptance as regards the&nbsp; work&nbsp; (Exhibit "B"); (2) there was the occupation of the edifice by the owner, without objection to the manner of the construction, and as to the absence of the certificates of inspection required of the&nbsp; public authority;&nbsp; (3) the&nbsp; contractor had asked the owner to exempt&nbsp; him from inability to secure final certificate&nbsp; of acceptance&nbsp; because the original&nbsp; plans and specifications were&nbsp; not followed and deviations from building permit plans were&nbsp; made,&nbsp; thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * there is still one additional subject which must be clarified and that is your&nbsp; instructions to construct the building according to the plans which we estimated from and <em>not from the plans issued</em> by the&nbsp; City Engineer's Office."&nbsp; (Exhibit "FF-1")&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)</p></blockquote><p>and Zulueta,&nbsp; upon recommendation of his architects, expressly agreed thereto, thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"In acknowledgment of your letter of&nbsp; May 19, 1949, requesting me not to hold G.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; Koster, Inc.&nbsp; for&nbsp; any&nbsp; civil liability due to structural&nbsp; failure that may arise from the construction of the swimming&nbsp; pool on the roof of my Antonjo Apartments, kindly inform Messrs. G. E. Koster, Inc., that <em>I am expressly waiving&nbsp; what ever rights the law&nbsp; recognize in my favor as owner of the&nbsp; newly constructed Apartment.</em>&nbsp; Be it known to them, also,&nbsp; that I will hold them&nbsp; responsible for any defects that may arise due to&nbsp; faulty construction and for any leakage&nbsp; in the swimming&nbsp; pool due to faulty waterproofing."&nbsp; (Exhibit "II-2")</p></blockquote><p>(4) the cracks in some parts of the buildings were due to&nbsp; the installation of the swimming pool in&nbsp; the fourth floor, which increased the weight of the building and the load on its beams, and the leaks on the walls were caused by the&nbsp; use of concrete blocks,&nbsp; but the specifications did not call&nbsp; for the use of waterproofing&nbsp; materials and construction was according&nbsp; to the specifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note that the leaks did not come from the swimming pool, which was not waived.)&nbsp; The objections&nbsp; against the building&nbsp; were not due, therefore, to defects in the form and manner of the construction or to a faulty construction, original and as&nbsp; modified, but to defects in the plans and the materials called for therein.&nbsp; There is another reason for dismissing the owner's objections.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; expressly agreed that as to&nbsp; hidden defects and leaks,&nbsp; the&nbsp; contractor&nbsp; was to&nbsp; be responsible&nbsp; only for those which&nbsp; may be discovered within six months after&nbsp; the final acceptance of the construction. The final acceptance was made on September 8,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp; The action was brought&nbsp; on August&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; and&nbsp; only&nbsp; then did the defendant and appellant raise his objections.&nbsp; The objections to&nbsp; the construction must also, therefore, be considered filed&nbsp; out of time and name must be overruled.</p><p>We have carefully reviewed the evidence and the analysis and appraisal thereof by his honor, the trial&nbsp; judge, and we find nothing that can justify&nbsp; a modification or reversal of&nbsp; the trial judge's&nbsp; findings and of his legal&nbsp; conclusions as to the main issues involved&nbsp; in the case.&nbsp; But we&nbsp; are not entirely in accord with his&nbsp; honor in the&nbsp; grant of attorney's fees as damages in favor of plaintiff and&nbsp; appellee. He says:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The Court has, however, found that plaintiff has presented evidence to show that in filing this suit it has retained counsel whom it has agreed to pay a fee of the sum of P9,218.75, and that the filing of this case&nbsp; should not&nbsp; have been necessary if only the&nbsp; defendant paid his just and lawful obligation"</p></blockquote><p>At common law,&nbsp; the successful&nbsp; party usually has no right to have&nbsp; the fees&nbsp; of his attorney, as&nbsp; such, taxed against&nbsp; his opponent (14 L. ed. 181).&nbsp; The court will not ordinarily allow counsel fees to the successful party Each party&nbsp; to the&nbsp; action must pay&nbsp; his&nbsp; own&nbsp; lawyer * * *. Counsel fees paid in&nbsp; prior action have been&nbsp; allowed *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * (where) the conduct of the party against whom they allowed, so directly and certainly caused the expenditure for this purpose, that the loss of the amount so paid was easily within&nbsp; such casual relations to&nbsp; the defendant's wrong as to warrant the assessment of the damages in compensation fdr it.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sears <em>vs. </em>Inhabitants of Nahant, 102 N.&nbsp; E. 491.) Our rulings before&nbsp; the New&nbsp; Civil Code took effect&nbsp; (the present&nbsp; case having arisen before)&nbsp; have been as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It is&nbsp; not sound public policy to&nbsp; place a penalty on&nbsp; the right to litigate.&nbsp; To&nbsp; compel the defeated&nbsp; party&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; fees of counsel for his successful opponent would throw wide the door of temptation to the opposing party and his counsel to swell the&nbsp; fees to undue proportions, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; apportion them arbitrarily&nbsp; between those pertaining properly to one branch of the case from&nbsp; the other.&nbsp; </p><p>"This court has already placed&nbsp; itself on record as favoring the view taken by those courts which hold that attorney's fees are not a proper element of damages."&nbsp; (Tan&nbsp; Ti <em>vs</em>. Alvear, 26&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 566; The&nbsp; Borden&nbsp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Doctors Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 90 Phil., 500.)&nbsp; </p><p>"* * * Counsel fees, other than&nbsp; those fixed in the&nbsp; rules as costs, are not an element&nbsp; of recoverable damages."&nbsp; (Jesswani <em>vs. </em>Massaram Dialdas, G. E. No. L-4651, May 12, 1952.)</p></blockquote><p>We are satisfied from a review of the evidence that the refusal&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendant and appellant, although the case is finally decided against him, can not be said to have been caused by&nbsp; mere bad faith.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defects in the building were proved at the trial and certainly he can not&nbsp; be blamed for entertaining the&nbsp; belief that they were caused by faulty construction.&nbsp; To sentence him to pay plaintiff's lawyer's fees would be imposing&nbsp; a penalty on his right, to litigate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even under the New Civil t!ode (Article 2208, par. 5) plaintiff and appellee would not be entitled to recover the fees paid to his attorney as damages, as no bad faith on the part of defendant and appellant was shown, in his refusal to pay plaintiff's claim.&nbsp; The part of the judgment&nbsp; sentencing&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; and "appellant&nbsp; to pay P9.218.75 must be reversed&nbsp; and defendant and appellant absolved from said demand.</p><p>Wherefore, with the modification above indicated, the judgment is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against defendant and appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista,&nbsp; Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia,</em> and <em>Felix,&nbsp; JJ., </em>concur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><p></p><p align="center"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">RESOLUTION</span></p><p align="center"><br></p><p><strong>LABRADOR, J.:</strong></p><p> This has reference to the motion for reconsideration filed by&nbsp; defendant and appellant,&nbsp; wherein claim is made that no&nbsp; sufficient evidence to sustain the court's finding that the leaks and&nbsp; defects of which defendant complains were due to&nbsp; the modification of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plans by the&nbsp; building of a swimming pool on the third floor, which swimming pool was not in the original plan.&nbsp; It is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant's own&nbsp; expert&nbsp; witness Gregorio P. Gutierrez could not assert that the construction&nbsp; and the materials were not in accordance with the specifications called for in the contract (t.s.n. pp. 233-235, Vol. IV).&nbsp; On the other hand, during the, period of construction&nbsp; no objection was ever registered by defendant's engineer to the manner in which the construction was being undertaken or to the materials used therein.&nbsp; And when delivery was made the construction was accepted without any objection being registered at all.&nbsp; Again at the ocular inspection, it was explained that the sinking of&nbsp; the floor was caused by the added weight of the building caused by the addition of the swimming pool and other additions, not given in the original plans.&nbsp; These are sufficient evidence to support our conclusion that the defects found were not shown to be due to faulty construction but to the&nbsp; additions to the original plan.</p><p>It is to&nbsp; be noted that a contractor's engagement is to build according to plans and specifications; the designs are made by the architect, and as to the sufficiency or adequacy of the structure carrying the weight of the building, the builder may not be held to account.&nbsp; The foundation was designed to carry a&nbsp; specified load, the building&nbsp; without the swimming pool. As the owner insisted on putting additions&nbsp; without a change&nbsp; in&nbsp; the foundation, the fault does not lie in the builder-contractor, but&nbsp; in the&nbsp; owner himself, and in the failure of his architect to provide the adequate foundation to take care of the new weight caused by the additions.</p><p> There is no need to consider the other ground for the reconsideration as the same is sufficiently answered&nbsp; in the decision.</p><p> The motion for reconsideration is denied.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.</p><p> <em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes J. B. L., Endencia,</em> and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
