				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">This case was begun in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga&nbsp; (Civil&nbsp; Case No. 170)&nbsp;&nbsp; by Insa&nbsp; Abdulhaman against&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; Steamship&nbsp; Co., owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; M/S "Bowline&nbsp; Knot", and Lim&nbsp; Hong To, owner&nbsp; of the&nbsp; M/L "Consuelo V",&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover damages&nbsp; for the death&nbsp; of his (plaintiff's)&nbsp; five children and loss&nbsp; of personal&nbsp; properties on board the M/L "Consuelo V" as a result of a maritime collision between said vessel and the M/S "Bowline Knot" on May 4, 1948, a few kilometers distant from San Ramon Beach, Zamboanga City.<p>On appeal, the&nbsp; Court of Appeals found the&nbsp; following facts to&nbsp; have been established:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"From 7:00 to 8:00 o'clock in the evening of May 4, 1948, the M/L "Consuelo V",&nbsp; laden with cargoes and passengers&nbsp; left the port of Zamboanga City&nbsp; bound for Siokon under the command of Faustino Macrohon.&nbsp; She was then towing a&nbsp; kumpit, named&nbsp; "Sta. Maria Bay". The weather&nbsp; was good and fair.&nbsp; Among her passengers were the plaintiff Insa Abdulhaman, his wife Carimla&nbsp; Mora and their&nbsp; five children already&nbsp; mentioned. The plaintiff&nbsp; and his wife paid&nbsp; their fare&nbsp; before the voyage started.&nbsp; </p><p>On that same night the&nbsp; M/S&nbsp; "Bowline Knot" was&nbsp; navigating from Maribojoc towards Zamboanga.&nbsp; </p><p>Between&nbsp; 9:30 to 10:00 in the&nbsp; evening the dark&nbsp; clouds&nbsp; bloated with rain&nbsp; began to fall and the gushing strong wind began to blow steadily harder,&nbsp; lashing the waves into a choppy and roaring sea.&nbsp; Such weather lasted for about&nbsp; an hour and then it&nbsp; became fair although it was showering and the visibility was good enough.&nbsp; </p><p>When some of the passengers of the&nbsp; M/L "Consuelo V"&nbsp; were then sleeping and some&nbsp; were lying&nbsp; down awake,&nbsp; all of a sudden they felt the shocking collision&nbsp; of the M/L&nbsp; "Consiuelo&nbsp; V" and a big motorship, which later on was identified as&nbsp; the M/V "Bowline Knot".&nbsp; </p><p>Because the: M/L&nbsp; "Consuelo&nbsp; V"&nbsp; capsized, her crew and&nbsp; passengers,&nbsp; before realizing&nbsp; what&nbsp; had happened,&nbsp; found&nbsp; themselves swimming and floating on the&nbsp; crest&nbsp; of the waves and as a result of which nine (9)&nbsp; passengers wege&nbsp; dead and missing and all the cargoes carried on said boat,&nbsp; including those of the plaintiff as appear in the list, Exhibit "A", were also lost.&nbsp; </p><p>Among the dead&nbsp; passengers found were&nbsp; Maria, Amlasa, Bidoaya and Bidaila, aH surnamed Inasa, while the body of the child Abdula Inasa of 6 years of age was never recovered. Before the collision, none of the&nbsp; passengers were warned or informed of the impending danger as the collision was&nbsp; so sudden and unexpected. AH those rescued at sea were brought by the&nbsp; M/V "Bowline Knot" to Zamboanga City/'&nbsp; (Decision of C. A., pp. 5-6).</p></blockquote><p>As&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause of the&nbsp; collision, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals affirmed&nbsp; the findings of&nbsp; the Board of Marine Inquiry, that the commanding officer&nbsp; of the&nbsp; colliding&nbsp; vessels&nbsp; had both been&nbsp; negligent in operating their respective vessels. Wherefore, the&nbsp; Court held&nbsp; the owners&nbsp; of both vessels v&nbsp;&nbsp; solidarily liable&nbsp; to plaintiff for&nbsp; the damages&nbsp; caused to him by the&nbsp; collision, under Article&nbsp; 827&nbsp; of the Code of Commerce; but exempted defendant Lim Hong To from liability by reason of&nbsp; the sinking and total&nbsp; loss&nbsp; of his vessel, the M/L&nbsp; "Consuelo&nbsp; V", while the other defendant, the Manila Steamship&nbsp; Co., owner of the&nbsp; M/S&nbsp; "Bowline Knot", was ordered to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; all of plaintiff's&nbsp; damages in the amount of P20,784.00 plus one-half of the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is from this judgment that defendant Manila Steamship Co. had appealed to this Court.</p><p>Petitioner Manila Steamship&nbsp; Co. pleads&nbsp; that it is exempt from any&nbsp; liability to plaintiff under Article 1903 of the Civil Code because it had exercised the diligence of a good.father of a family in the&nbsp; selection of its employees, particularly&nbsp; Third Mate Simplicio&nbsp; Ilagan, the officer in command ol its&nbsp; vessels, the&nbsp; M/S "Bowline Knot", at the time of the&nbsp; collision.&nbsp; This&nbsp; defense&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is true that plaintiff's action&nbsp; against petitioner is&nbsp; based on a tort or quasi-delict, the tort in question is not a civil tort under the Civil Code but a&nbsp; maritime tort resulting in a collision&nbsp; at sea, governed by Articles 826-939 of the Code of Commerce.&nbsp; Under Article 827 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce, in case of collision&nbsp; between two&nbsp; vessels imputable to&nbsp; both of them, each vessel shall suffer&nbsp; her own damage and both shall&nbsp; be <em>solidarity</em> liable for the&nbsp; damages occasioned&nbsp; to their cargoes.&nbsp; The characteristic language of the law in making the "vessels" solidarity liable for the&nbsp; damages&nbsp; due&nbsp; to the&nbsp; maritime collision&nbsp; emphasizes the direct nature of the responsibilities on account of the collision&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; by the shipowner under maritime law, as distinguished from the civil law and mercantile law in general.&nbsp; This direct responsibility is recognized in Article 618&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Commerce&nbsp; under&nbsp; which&nbsp; the captain shall be civilly liable to the ship agent, and the&nbsp; latter is the one liable to third persons, as pointed out in the collision case of Yueng Sheng Exchange &amp; Trading Co <em>vs</em>. Urrutia &amp; Co., 12 Phil. 747,&nbsp; 753:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The responsibility&nbsp; involved in the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action is that derived from the management of the vessel, which was defective on account of lack of skill, negligence, or fault, either&nbsp; of the captain&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the crew, for which the captain is responsible to&nbsp; the agent,'who in his turn is responsible to the third party prejudiced or damaged. (Article&nbsp; 618, Code of Commerce)."</p></blockquote><p>In fact,&nbsp; it is a&nbsp; general principle, well established maritime law and custom, that shipowners and ship agents are&nbsp; civilly liable&nbsp; for the acts&nbsp; of the&nbsp; captain (Code of Commerce, Article 586) and for the indemnities due the third persons (Article&nbsp; 587); so that injured parties may. immediately look for reimbursement to the&nbsp; owner of the ship, it being universally&nbsp; recognized that the&nbsp; ship master or captain is primarily the representative of the owner (Standard&nbsp; Oil Co. <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Lopez Castelo, 42 Phil. 256, 260). This direct liability, moderated and limited by the owner's right of abandonment of the vessel and earned freight (Article 587), has been declared to exist, not only in&nbsp; case of breached contracts, but also in cases&nbsp; of tortious&nbsp; negligence (Yu Biao Sontua <em>vs</em>. Osorio, 43 Phil. 511, 515):&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"In the&nbsp; Second assignment of error, the&nbsp; appellant contends that the defendant ought not to be held liable for the negligence of his agents and employees.&nbsp; </p><p>It&nbsp; is proven that the agents and employees, through whose negligence the explosion and fire in question occurred, were agents, employees and mandataries of the defendant.&nbsp; Where the vessel is one Of freight, a public concern or public utility, its owner or agents is liable for&nbsp; the tortious&nbsp; acts of his&nbsp; agents&nbsp; (Articles 587, 613, and 618 Code of Commerce; and Article 1902, 1903, 1908, Civil Code). This principle has been repeatedly upheld&nbsp; in various decisions of this&nbsp; court.&nbsp; </p><p>The&nbsp; doctrines cited by&nbsp; the appellant in support of&nbsp; his theory have&nbsp; reference to the 'relations&nbsp; between&nbsp; principal&nbsp; and agent in general, but not to the relations between ship agent and his agents and employees; for this reason they cannot be applied in the present case"</p></blockquote><p>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; easy&nbsp; to see that to admit the defense&nbsp; of due diligence of a <em>bonus paterfamilias</em> (in&nbsp; the&nbsp; selection and vigilance of the officers and crew)&nbsp; as exempting the ship-owner from any&nbsp; liability for&nbsp; their&nbsp; faults, would render nugatory the&nbsp; solidary&nbsp; liability established by&nbsp; Article 827 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce&nbsp; for&nbsp; the greater&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of injured&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; Ship owners would be&nbsp; able to escape liability in practically every case, considering that the qualifications and&nbsp; licensing of ship masters&nbsp; and&nbsp; officers are determined&nbsp; by the State,&nbsp; and that vigilance is practically impossible to&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; over&nbsp; officers and&nbsp; crew of vessels at sea.&nbsp; To compel&nbsp; the parties prejudiced to&nbsp; look to the crew for indemnity and redress&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; an&nbsp; illusory remedy&nbsp; for&nbsp; almost always its members&nbsp; are, from captains down, mere wage&nbsp; earners.</p><p>We, therefore,&nbsp; find&nbsp; no reversible&nbsp; error in&nbsp; the refusal of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals to consider the defense of the Manila Steamship Co.,&nbsp; that&nbsp; it is exempt from&nbsp; liability for the collision with the&nbsp; M/L "Consuelo V" due to&nbsp; absence of negligence on its parts in the&nbsp; selection and supervision of the officers and crew of&nbsp; the&nbsp; M/S "Bowline Knot".</p><p>The case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Walter&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Smith &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>&nbsp; Cadwallader Gibson&nbsp; Lumber Co.,&nbsp; 55 Phil. 517, invoked by petitioner, is not the point.&nbsp; Said case treated of a civil tort, in that the vessel of the defendant, allegedly negligently managed by&nbsp; its captain&nbsp; in the course of its maneuvers to&nbsp; moor at plaintiff's&nbsp; wharf,&nbsp; struck&nbsp; the&nbsp; same and partially&nbsp; demolished it, causing damage to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the tart allegedly committed&nbsp; was civil, the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article 1903 of the Civil Code were correctly applied.&nbsp; The present case, on the other&nbsp; hand, involves&nbsp; tortious conduct resulting in a maritime collision; wherefore, the liability of the shipowner is,&nbsp; as&nbsp; already&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; governed by&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the Code of Commerce and not by the Civil Code.</p><p>We agree, however, with petitioner-appellant, that&nbsp; the Court of Appeals was in error in declaring the respondent Lim Hong To, owner of the M/L "Consuelo V", exempt&nbsp; from&nbsp; liability to&nbsp; the original plaintiff,&nbsp; Abdulhaman, in view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; total loss of his own&nbsp; vessel, that sank as a result of the collision.&nbsp; It is to be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; that both&nbsp; the&nbsp; master&nbsp; and the engineer of&nbsp; the&nbsp; motor&nbsp; launch "Consuelo&nbsp; V" were not duly licensed as such (Exh.&nbsp; 2).&nbsp; In applying for permission&nbsp; to&nbsp; operate,&nbsp; despite&nbsp; the lack of properly trained&nbsp; and experienced, crew, respondent&nbsp; Lim Hong To gave&nbsp; as a&nbsp; reason—&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"that the income&nbsp; derived from&nbsp; the vessel is&nbsp; insufficient to&nbsp; pay licensed officers who demand high salaries",</p></blockquote><p>and expressly declared:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"That&nbsp; in case of any&nbsp; accident, damage&nbsp; or loss, I shall assume full&nbsp; risk&nbsp; and&nbsp; responsibility&nbsp; for&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; consequences thereof."&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 2).</p></blockquote><p>His permit to operate, in fact, stipulated—&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"that in case of any accident, damage&nbsp; or loss, the&nbsp; registered owner thereof shall assume full risk and responsibility for all the consequences thereof, and that&nbsp; said vessel shall be held answerable for any negligence, disregard or violation of any of the conditions herein imposed&nbsp; and for any&nbsp; consequence arising from such neglicence, disregard or violations."&nbsp; (Exhibit 3.)</p></blockquote><p>The Court of Appeals held that neither the letter&nbsp; (Exhibit 2j nor the permit (Exhibit 3)&nbsp; contained any waiver Of the&nbsp; right&nbsp; of respondent&nbsp; Lint Hong&nbsp; To to limit his liability to the value of his motor launch and that he did not lose the statutory right to limit his liability by abandonment of the vessel,&nbsp; as&nbsp; conferred by Article 587 of the Code&nbsp; of Commerce..</p><p>We find the ruling untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disregarding the question whether, mere inability to meet the salary demands of duly licensed masters&nbsp; and engineers&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; non-availability thereof that would excuse noncompliance with the law and authorize operation without licensed&nbsp; officers under Act 3553, the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; remains that by operating with an unlicensed master, Lim Hong To&nbsp; deliberately increased the risk to which the&nbsp; passengers and shippers of cargo aboard the "Consuelo V"&nbsp; would be subjected.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; his desire to reap greater&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; in the maritime trade, Lim Hong To&nbsp; willfully augmented the dangers and hazards to his 'vessel's unwarry passengers,&nbsp; who would normally assume that the launch officers&nbsp; possessed the necessary skill and experience to evade the perils of the&nbsp; sea.&nbsp; Hence, the liability of said respondent can not be&nbsp; the identical&nbsp; to that of a&nbsp; shipowner Who bears in mind the&nbsp; safety of the passengers and&nbsp; cargo by employing duly licensed officers. To hold, as the Court of Appeals has done, that&nbsp; Lim Hong To may limit&nbsp; his liability&nbsp; to the value of&nbsp; his vessels,&nbsp; is to erase all difference between compliance with law and the deliberate disregard thereof.&nbsp; To such proposition we can not assent.</p><p>The international rule is to the effect&nbsp; that the right of abandonment&nbsp; of vessels, as a legal&nbsp; limitation of a ship-owner's liability, does not apply to cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; the injury or the average is due to shipowner's own fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; Farifia (Derecho&nbsp; Comercial&nbsp; Maritimo,&nbsp; Vol.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; pp. 122-123), on the authority of judicial precedents from various nations,&nbsp; sets the rule to be as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Esta generalmente admitido que el propietario del buque no&nbsp; tiene derecho&nbsp; a la Hmitacion legal&nbsp; de resppnsibilidad si&nbsp; los&nbsp; danos o averias que&nbsp; dan&nbsp; origen&nbsp; a la&nbsp; limitacidn provienen de sus propias culpas.&nbsp; El&nbsp; Convenio de&nbsp; Bruselas de&nbsp; 25&nbsp; de agosto de 1924 tambien invalida la limitacion en el caso de culpa personal en los accidentes o averias sobrevenidos (Art. 2°)." </p></blockquote><p>To the same effect, a noted French author states:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"La limitacion&nbsp; de la responsabilidad maritima ha sido admitida para proteger a&nbsp; los armadores contra&nbsp; los actos&nbsp; abusivos de sus encargados&nbsp; y no dejar&nbsp; su&nbsp; patrimonio entero&nbsp; a la&nbsp; discrecion del personal de&nbsp; sus buques, porque&nbsp; este&nbsp; personal cumple sus obligaciones en condiciones especiales; <em>pero&nbsp; los armadores no&nbsp; tienen por sobre&nbsp; los demds derecho a&nbsp; ser&nbsp; amparados contra ellos&nbsp; mismos ni a ser&nbsp; protegidos contra&nbsp; sus propios actos."</em>'</p></blockquote><p>(Danjon,&nbsp; Derecho Maritimo, Vol. 2, p. 332).&nbsp; (<em>Italics suuplied</em>.)</p><p>That Lim&nbsp; Hong To&nbsp; understood that&nbsp; he would incur greater liability than that normally borne by shipowners, is clear&nbsp; from his assumption of "<em>full</em>"&nbsp; risk and responsibility for all&nbsp; the&nbsp; consequences'" of&nbsp; the operation of the M/L&nbsp; "Consuelo V"; a responsibility expressly assumed&nbsp; in his letter&nbsp; Exhibit 2, and&nbsp; imposed in his&nbsp; special permit, in&nbsp; addition to the&nbsp; vessel&nbsp; itself being&nbsp; held&nbsp; answerable. This&nbsp; express assumption of "full risk and. responsibility" would be meaningless unless intended to broaden the liability&nbsp; of respondent&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; Hong&nbsp; To beyond the&nbsp; value of his vessel.</p><p>In&nbsp; resume, we hold:</p><p>(1)&nbsp; Thatlhe Manila Steamship&nbsp; Co., owner of the M/S "Bowline Knot",&nbsp; is directly and primarily responsible&nbsp; in tort for the injuries caused to the plaintiff by the collision of said vessel with the launch "Consuelo V", through the negligence&nbsp; of the crews of&nbsp; both vessels,&nbsp; and it&nbsp; may not escape liability&nbsp; on the ground that it&nbsp; exercised due&nbsp; diligence in the selection and&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; of the officers and crew of the "Bowline Knot";</p><p>(2)&nbsp; That Lim Hong To, as owner of the motor launch "Consuelo&nbsp; V",&nbsp; having caused&nbsp; the same to sail without licensed officers, is&nbsp; liable for the injuries&nbsp; caused by&nbsp; the collision over and beyond the value of said launch;</p><p>(3)&nbsp; That&nbsp; both vessels being at fault, the&nbsp; liability of Lim Hong To and Manila&nbsp; Steamship Co. to the plaintiff herein is <em>in solidum,</em> as prescribed by&nbsp; Article 827 of&nbsp; the Code of Commerce.</p><p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Court of Appeals is modified, and that of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance affirmed, in&nbsp; the sense of&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; both original defendants solidarity liable to&nbsp; plaintiff Insa Abdulhaman in the sum of&nbsp; P20,784.00&nbsp; and the cost of the litigation, without prejudice to the&nbsp; right of the one who should pay the&nbsp; judgment in full&nbsp; to&nbsp; demand&nbsp; contribution&nbsp; from&nbsp; his co-defendant.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
