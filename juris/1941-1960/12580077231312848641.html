<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Eleuterio Beltran y Angeles was charged in the Municipal Court of
Manila with a violation of Rule IX, paragraph 2, Ordinance No. 2646,
known as the Traffic Code (jaywalking) in an information couched in the
following words:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The undersigned accuses Eleuterio Beltran y Angeles of a violation of Rule  IX-2 of  Ordinance 2646, committed as follows:</p>
  <p>That
on or about the 24th day of May, 1956, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully and
unlawfully jaywalk along the South approach of Jones Bridge, in said
city, by then and there crossing the street at said place outside of
the pedestrian lane designated thereat, in violation of said ordinance.
(Crim. case No. X-9263.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After trial, the Municipal Court found him guilty as charged and
sentenced him to pay a fine of P15 and costs, with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency. The defendant appealed to the Court
of First Instance of Manila, and there the appeal was docketed as crim.
case No. 36853. Upon arraignment in the latter court the defendant
entered a plea of not guilty. After the prosecution had rested its
case, counsel for the defendant prayed that he be granted five days
within which to submit a motion to dismiss. The Court granted the
motion with the understanding that should the motion be denied, the
case would be deemed submitted for decision on the question of law.</p>
<p>On 12 December 1956 the Court rendered judgment holding "that the
act complained of and admitted by the accused constitutes a violation
of Rule IX, paragraph 2, in relation with the second part of paragraph
3 of Ordinance No. 2646," and sentencing "him to pay a fine of P15.00,
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the
costs." The defendant has appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>The trial Court foundâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * * that at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon of
May 24, 1956, the accused Eleuterio Beltran, who came from the Southern
approach of the Jones Bridge, crossed Magallanes Street from point
Exhibit 1 of the aforesaid approach to point Exhibit 2 of Island No. 2
on the sketch Exhibit A, a path not marked as a pedestrian lane. It is
admitted that there were no sign-posts in the vicinity of the two
points. The evidence further shows that right in front of the
pedestrian lane across the street to Island No. 1 in the sketch Exhibit
A, and that between the Post Office Building and the Southern approach
there is likewise a properly marked pedestrian lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rule IX,  Municipal  Ordinance No.  2646,  of the City of Manila, otherwise known as the Traffic Code, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>PAR. 2. Pedestrians should cross the streets as
nearly as possible at right angles preferably at the regular crossings,
or at places designated and marked by the police department in order to
insure their own safety, facilitate the movement of traffic and make it
easier for the drivers to stop.</p>
  <p>PAR 3. Crossing at
intersections and safety zones, Duty of the Police Department to mark
safety zones. It shall be unlawful for any person to cross the Escolta,
Rosario, Plaza Goiti, Plaza Moraga, Rizal Avenue from Echague to Lope
de Vega, Carriedo, Echague from Plaza Goiti to Norzagaray, Taft Avenue
and all sections of streets bordering" public markets where safety
zones are marked and signposted; Provided, That persons crossing at
these places shall follow safety lines marked thereat. Vehicles when
stopped on the street on account of congestion of traffic or for other
purposes shall stop in such a manner so as not to block any safety zone
marked for the use of pedestrians.</p>
  <p>It shall be the duty of
the police department to mark safety zones at street intersections and
other places where need for the convenience and safety of pedestrians:
Provided, however, That until such safety zones have been properly
marked and signposted as in this paragraph provided, no prosecutions
shall be instituted against any one for violation of the provisions of
this paragraph. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the safety zone marked on Magallanes Street in front of the Post
Office Building is 45 meters away from the end of the southeastern
approach of the Jones Bridge where the appellant started to cross the
Magallanes Street towards the nearest point of Island 2 on the sketch
Exhibit A, according to the brief of the prosecution, or 75 meters as
written in ink on the sketch Exhibit A, and the crossing by pedestrians
of Magallanes Street as nearly as possible at right angle is allowed,
as provided for in paragraph 2 of the Municipal Ordinance under which
the appellant is charged, because the Magallanes Street is not among
the streets named in the first part of paragraph 3 of the Municipal
Ordinance, the crossing of which by pedestrians is prohibited or made
unlawful, the judgment finding the appellant guilty of violation of the
Municipal Ordinance for crossing Magallanes Street, alleged in the
information, cannot be sustained and upheld.</p>
<p>The  judgment  appealed  from  is  reversed   and  the appellant acquitted, with cost <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p><em>Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo,  Labrador, Concepcion,   Endencia,  Barrera</em>,  and  <em>Gutierrez  David,  JJ.</em>, concur.<br>
  <em>Montemayor, J</em>., did not take part.
