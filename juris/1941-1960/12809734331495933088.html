				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On November 20, 1944, respondent TEODORA MERRERA with the 
assistance of her guardian <i>ad litem</i> Natalia Merrera filed a 
complaint in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan against 
petitioners Dalmacio Vinluan, Agaton Vinluan and Ciriaco Vinluan to 
declare herself exclusive owner of one-half (½) portion of a fishpond 
located at Malindong, Binmaley, Pangasinan, with an area of 8,128 sq. m.
 declared under Tax Declaration No. 46558, and to recover possession of 
the property belonging to her, including damages for her having been 
deprived of possession since 1933.  The defendants therein claiming to 
have bought the whole fishpond from PEDRO C. MERRERA moved that their 
vendor be notified of the complaint by means of summons in accordance 
with the provisions of Art. 1482 of the Civil Code.  Defendants later 
filed a third party complaint against him.  After hearing, the trial 
court found that one-half (½) of the fishpond in question really 
belonged to plaintiff Teodora Merrera, having inherited it from her 
father ARCADIO MERRERA; that the defendants surnamed Vinluan acted in 
bad faith in buying the fishpond from Pedro C. Merrera fully knowing the
 rights and interests of plaintiff in the same.  The court declared 
plaintiff the owner of ½ of the fishpond <i>pro indiviso</i> and ordered
 defendants to deliver possession to her and to pay her damages in the 
sum of P100.00 yearly from the year 1933.  On appeal to the Court of 
Appeals, said tribunal affirmed the decision of the lower court.  The 
case has been brought here for review of the decision of affirmance.
  <p>    The facts of the case as found by the Court of Appeals and 
which are conclusive according to law are as follows.  Rufino Merrera, 
grandfather of respondent Teodora Merrera was the exclusive owner of the
 whole fishpond in question.  Rufino married Dominga Castro and the 
couple had three children-Pedro, Arcadio and Natalia, all surnamed 
MERRERA.  Rufino died on March 29, 1920.  Thereafter, the three children
 entered into an agreement on the partition of the property left to 
them, namely, that the two brothers Arcadio and Pedro would divide 
equally the fishpond while their sister Natalia would get two urban lots
 left by their father.  Arcadio, one of the brothers, died on August 16,
 1932, leaving respondent Teodora as his only child.</p>
  <p>    On June 6, 1929, that is, about nine years after the death of 
her husband Rufino, Dominga Castro and her son Pedro C. Merrera sold the
 whole fishpond to one Santiago Fernandez with right to repurchase for 
the sum of P650.00.  The vendors repurchased the fishpond on June 2, 
1933 but on the same day Pedro C. Merrera executed a deed of sale of the
 fishpond in favor of the herein petitioners surnamed Vinluan for 
P1,000.00.  The annual net products of the property is valued at 
P200.00.  The Court of Appeals further found that Arcadio never 
authorized his brother Pedro to sell his undivided ½ share in the 
fishpond nor did he make any representation to that effect to any 
person; that neither did he cede his rights and interests in the 
fishpond in question; that the defendants had always been residents of 
the same locality where the Merreras lived and that they actually owned a
 fishpond adjoining the fishpond in question, so, they knew the rights 
and interests the Teodora had on the same; and that when they purchased 
said fishpond Atty. Celestino Palma advised them to have the property 
surveyed and registered right away because he had some doubts as to the 
title of the same.</p>
  <p>    Under the facts as found by the Court of Appeals and which we 
accept as conclusive, because there is nothing in the record to show 
that its conclusions of fact find no support whatsoever in the evidence,
 the appellant petition for certiorari has no merit.  Petitioner invoke 
the principle of estoppel on the theory that when the entire fishpond 
was first sold by Dominga Castro and her son Pedro in 1929, Arcadio 
filed no objection and led the petitioners to believe that he had no 
interests in the said fishpond and so they bought the said fishpond in 
1933 with the understanding that it belonged to the vendor PEDRO C. 
MERRERA.  On at least two grounds, this claim cannot be accepted.  In 
order to established estoppel against Arcadio it must be proven that (1)
 he was present at the sale of the fishpond in 1929 or that he knew of 
the said sale and that he cannot only kept silent but led other parties 
to believe that he had no right or interest in the property sold, and 
(2) that the vendees were ignorant of the truth or of the facts and were
 misled into buying the fishpond.  These two requisites are lacking in 
the present case.  On the contrary, as found not only by the trial court
 but also by the Court of Appeals, the petitioners herein were living in
 the same place as Arcadio and they actually owned a fishpond adjoining 
the fishpond in question and they knew that ½ of the said fishpond 
belonged to Arcadio and it was later inherited by his daughter Teodora, 
the respondent herein.</p>
  <p>    It is also contended by appellants that the widow Dominga 
Castro under right of usufruct should be alloted a portion of the 
products of the fishpond, in which case, the P100.00 found by the court 
as net yearly product to be given to respondent should be reduced.  This
 claim, if at all meritorious, should not be made by the petitioners but
 by the proper party.</p>
  <p>    We deem it unnecessary to pass upon the other points raised in 
the petition.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, 
with costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Reyes,
 Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
