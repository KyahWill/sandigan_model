				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to 
set aside an order of the Court of Industrial Relations.
<p align="justify">On May 21, 1946, petitioners asked the Court of Industrial 
Relations to mediate in an industrial dispute existing between them and 
respondent labor union.</p>
<p align="justify">After hearing, the court rendered decision on June 16, 1946, 
ruling on the numerous allegations and mutual demands of the litigants. In its 
decision, among other findings, the industrial court sustained the dismissal by 
petitioners of four of its employees, one of them being Ramon Honorico. 
Respondent labor union filed a motion for reconsideration which was granted.</p>
<p align="justify">In its original decision, the industrial court found that the 
dismissal of Ramon Honorico was for just cause and not because of union 
activities. In its order of reconsideration, the industrial court found the 
dismissal to be too severe a penalty, considering the long and faithful record 
of service rendered by said Honorico who has not been given an opportunity to 
defend himself before his final dismissal. Thus, the industrial court authorized 
a penalty of suspension for Honorico, to be counted from the time he was 
dismissed by petitioners up to the time the court rendered its decision.</p>
<p align="justify">Discipline is, indeed, essential to the smooth running of a 
public service such as that of the petitioners. But the stern rules of 
discipline must be applied with fairness and justice. This means that a laborer 
should not be dismissed for unimportant infractions and that before he is 
deprived of his job he should be given a fair hearing.</p>
<p align="justify">Under the circumstances of this case, we find no ground for 
disturbing the order of the court of industrial relations which acted within the 
ample bounds given it by law. There is no srhowing that said court has committed 
an error of law in the selection of a specific measure for the solution of the 
particular conflict submitted to it. It merely modified the penalty imposed in 
its original decision in view of a circumstance it had previously failed to 
consider.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of all the foregoing, the petition is dismissed with 
costs against petitioners. It is so ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b><br></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PERFECTO, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">In its decision of June 16, 1946, the Court of Industrial 
Relations found that petitioning companies dismissed employee inspector Ramon 
Honorico, not for his connection with a labor union, but for due cause, it 
appearing that the labor union was registered only in 1946, ten months after 
Honorico was dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">According to the lower court, Honorico "admitted the truth of 
the acts complained of in his record" although he alleged that he did not 
believe that said acts justify his dismissal. From the decision of the lower 
court we quote: "his several records show abandonment of his post during hours 
of duty (Exhibit A-1), interfering with the route and time of trucks on two 
occasions (Exhibits H, N, and V), and negligence in the performance of his 
duties."</p>
<p align="justify">This notwithstanding, on July 25, 1947, more than a year after 
the decision was rendered, the Court of Industrial Relations issued an order 
reversing the decision of June 16, 1946, and declaring that dismissal of 
Honorico would be too severe and that his suspension, from the time he was 
dismissed up to the time the order was issued, is deemed sufficient to correct 
him.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioning companies complain of this reversal as a grave 
abuse of discretion.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners' contention is correct, and the order of July 25, 
1947, should be set aside and the decision of June 16, 1946, made to stand.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no quarrel that wide bounds have been set by law in 
the powers granted to the Court of Industrial Relations, but no matter how wide 
these bounds are, they cannot transcend sound principles of justice.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court transcended the limits fixed by those 
principles when it decided that the offenses committed by Honorico are not 
serious enough to deserve dismissal from service.</p>
<p align="justify">We yield to no one in upholding just rights and privileges of 
employees and laborers. At the same time, we are not to relieve them from their 
responsibilities to themselves and to society. Employees and laborers have 
duties to perform, and they should perform them conscientiously, if they are to 
preserve their own rights and privileges and not to disrupt the orderly 
processes that are essential to keep society a going concern. Violation of those 
duties would impair the welfare of the community.</p>
<p align="justify">Success of industries and public services is the foundation 
upon which just wages may be paid. There cannot be success without efficiency. 
There cannot be efficiency without discipline. Consequently, when employees and 
laborers violate the rules of discipline, they jeopardize not only the interest 
of the employer, but also their own. In violating the rules of discipline, they 
aim at killing the hen that lays the golden eggs. Laborers who trample down the 
rules set for an efficient service are, in effect, parties to a conspiracy, not 
only against capital, but also against labor. The high interests of society and 
of the individuals demand that we should insist in requiring everybody to do his 
duty. That demand is addressed not only to employees but also to employees.</p>
<p align="justify">We vote to set aside the order of July 25, 1947 as prayed for 
by petitioners.</p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, J.:</p> I concur in this dissent.</div>
