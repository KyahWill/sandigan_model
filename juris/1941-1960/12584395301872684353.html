				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The present appeal originated from a petition for a writ of mandamus
to compel respondent mayor to sign the payroll and approve the salaries
accruing to petitioners, and to reinstate petitioners to their former
positions.<p></p>
<p>Petitioners were civil service eligibles appointed by the then Mayor
of Ronda, Cebu, Fortunato Villalon, on December 1 and 12, 1955,
petitioner Maribao as Chief of Police, and petitioners Cui, Yusores and
Beynosa as patrolmen of the said municipality. On January 16, 1956, the
newly elected mayor, above respondent, served notice to petitioners
advising them of the termination of their service. In that very month,
respondent appointed a new Chief of Police and three new policemen to
take the place of petitioners. He also sent a telegram to the President
of the Philippines withdrawing the appointments of petitioners.
Petitioners after said date of January 16, 1956, continued in the
service by reporting to the PC detachment at Damangug, Cebu.</p>
<p>The trial court rendered judgment ordering the incumbent mayor,
respondent, to approve the payment of petitioners' salaries from
January 16, 1956 to July 18, 1956, but kept silent as to the
reinstatement, which the court evidently did not deem proper.</p>
<p>Both petitioners and respondents appealed from the aforesaid
decision, petitioners insisting in their reinstatement and accrued
salaries until reinstatement; respondents assigning as error the
payment of salaries from January 16 to July 18, 1956.</p>
<p>Section 14, Ex. Order No. 175 series of 1938 governs the appointments to the police force of the municipality. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"14. Hereafter, appointments to and promotion in the
municipal, city and provincial police service shall be made in
accordance with Civil Service Rules and Regulations by the respective
city or municipal mayor or governor, with the approval of the President
of the Philippines pending" designation of the Department Head who is
to exercise supervision over local police force, except in cases of
Chief of Police of Chartered cities which is governed by special
provisions of law. The selection of appointees shall be made whenever
possible from the list of eligibles in the corresponding city or
municipality, if there are any, and in the negative ease, from the
general list of eligibles in the province. Pending approval of the
appointment by the President, the appointee may assume office and
receive salary for services actually rendered until the appointment is
finally acted upon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners' appointments on December 1 and 12, 1955 by the then
mayor of the municipality were legal and in order, the appointing power
still in possession of his right to appoint. For such appointments to
be complete, the approval of the President of the Philippines is
required. The law provides that pending approval of said appointment by
the President, the appointee may assume office and receive salary for
services actually rendered. Accordingly therefore, in that duration
until the appointment is finally acted upon favorably or unfavorably,
the appointees may be considered as "de facto" officers and entitled to
salaries for services actually rendered.</p>
<p>Petitioners' appointments when respondent took office were not
complete. Their recall and withdrawal having been based on lack of
residence in the municipality concerned is proper. Respondent cannot be
charged with discriminate removal of petitioners in view of their
incomplete appointment to the office.</p>
<p>It is of record that the office of the President disapproved
petitioner Maribao's appointment on July 18, 1956. It is in fact
liberal construction for this Court (as for the lower court) to
consider said date of July 18, 1956 as the final disapproval of
appointments of the other petitioners.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed without costs,.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, Barrera</em> and <em>Gutierrez  David, JJ.</em>,  concur.</p></div>
