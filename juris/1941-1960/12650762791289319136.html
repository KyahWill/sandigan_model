				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Marinduque Iron Mines&nbsp; Agents&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; questions&nbsp; by certiorari the order of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner confirming the referee's award of compensation to the heirs&nbsp; of Pedro Mamador for&nbsp; his accidental death. Only&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to compensation is disputed; not&nbsp; the amount.<p>"It appears," says&nbsp; the award, "that on August&nbsp; 23, 1951, at 6:00 a.m. in Bo. Sumangga,&nbsp; Mogpog, Marinduque,&nbsp; the deceased Mamador&nbsp; together with other laborers of&nbsp; the respondent-corporation,&nbsp;&nbsp; (Marinduque Iron Mines Agents Inc.)&nbsp; boarded a truck belonging to the&nbsp; latter, which was then driven&nbsp; by one Procopio Macunat,&nbsp; also&nbsp; employed&nbsp; by the corporation, and&nbsp; on its way to their place&nbsp; of work at the mine camp at Talantunan, while trying to overtake another truck on the company road, it turned over and&nbsp; hit a coconut tree, resulting in the&nbsp; death of said Mamador and injury to the others."</p><p>Procopio Macunat was prosecuted, convicted&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentenced to indemnify the heirs of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 1491).&nbsp;&nbsp; He has paid&nbsp; nothing however, to the latter.</p><p>In his first proposition petitioner challenges the validity of the proceedings&nbsp; before the Commission, asserting it had not&nbsp; been given&nbsp; the opportunity&nbsp; to cross-examine the opposing witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to&nbsp; respondents,</p><blockquote>"The records show that pursuant&nbsp; to a request made by.this&nbsp; Commission on March 28,&nbsp; 1953 to investigate the above entitled case, the Public Defender of fioac, Marinduque, notified respondent Geronimo Ma.&nbsp; Coll&nbsp; and the general manager of the respondent company, Mr. Eric Lenze,&nbsp; to appear before&nbsp; him in an investigation, first on May 12, 1953,&nbsp; when neither of them appeared, and the second on May 29, 1953, when only Mr. Geronimo Ma. Coll appeared.&nbsp; The sworn&nbsp; testimony of Mr. Ma. Coll&nbsp; was then taken down in a question and answer .method.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August&nbsp; 18, 1953, thru Referee Ramon Villaflor, this Commission&nbsp; wrote the respondent company to comment&nbsp; on the enclosed copy of the sworn declaration ,of Ma. Coll.&nbsp; The respondent company, thru its Vice&nbsp; President, denied&nbsp; its liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, as&nbsp; amended. In an investigation conducted on February 8, 1954&nbsp; by the undersigned referee, the respondent company thru Mr. Lenze&nbsp; who was assisted by counsel, was allowed to&nbsp; examine the&nbsp; records of the case including the sworn declaration of Ma.&nbsp; Coll and was given all the opportunity to rebut the same by&nbsp; additional evidence."</blockquote><p></p><p>In our opinion,&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; grievance does not rest on any sound&nbsp; basis, because it was given notice, and therefore had the chance, to examine&nbsp; (and cross-examine)&nbsp; the witnesses against it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; statute even permits the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; (or his referee)&nbsp; to take testimony without notice (section 48&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 3428&nbsp; as amended)&nbsp; provided of&nbsp; course such ex parte evidence&nbsp; is reduced to writing, and the adverse party is&nbsp; afforded&nbsp; opportunity to examine and rebut the same which was done in this instance.</p><p>Anyway we are not&nbsp; shown how its&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; cross-examine the witnesses prejudiced the petitioner's position.</p><p>In its second&nbsp; proposition, petitioner maintains that this claim is barred&nbsp; by section 6 of the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Law, because (a)&nbsp; Macunat&nbsp; was prosecuted and required to indemnify the heirs of the deceased and (b)&nbsp; an amicable settlement was concluded between "said heirs and Macunat. </p><p>Section 6 provides as follows: </p><blockquote>"Sec:&nbsp; 6. Liability&nbsp; of third&nbsp; parties.—In case an employee&nbsp; suffers an injury for which compensation is&nbsp; due&nbsp; under this Act&nbsp; by any other person besides&nbsp; his employer, it&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; optional with such&nbsp; injured employee either&nbsp; to claim compensation&nbsp; from his employer,&nbsp; under this Act, or&nbsp; sue such other person for damages, in accordance with&nbsp; law; and&nbsp; in case compensation&nbsp; is claimed and&nbsp; allowed in&nbsp; accordance with this Act, the&nbsp; employer who paid such compensation or was found liable to pay the same, shall&nbsp; succeed the injured employee to the right of recovering from&nbsp; such person&nbsp; what he paid:&nbsp; Provided, That in case the employer recovers from such third&nbsp; person damages&nbsp; in excess of those paid or allowed&nbsp; under&nbsp; this Act, such excess shall be delivered to the injured employee or any other&nbsp; person&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; thereto, after deduction of the expenses of the employer and the&nbsp; costs of the&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp; The sum paid by the employer for compensation or the amount of compensation to&nbsp; which the employee or his dependents are entitled, shall not be&nbsp; admissable as evidence in any damage&nbsp; suit&nbsp; or action."</blockquote><p></p><p>It is&nbsp; the petitioner's contention that Criminal&nbsp; Case No.</p><p>1491 and its outcome constituted&nbsp; an election by the employee (or his heirs)&nbsp; to sue the third&nbsp; person,&nbsp; such election having&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; of releasing the&nbsp; employer.&nbsp; However, Criminal Case No. 1491 was not a&nbsp; suit for damages against the third person, it&nbsp; being alleged, without contradiction that the heirs did&nbsp; not intervene&nbsp; therein and&nbsp; have not&nbsp; so far received the indemnity ordered by the court.&nbsp; At any rate,&nbsp; we have already decided in&nbsp; Nava vs. lnchausti Co.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that the indemnity granted the heirs&nbsp; in a criminal prosecution of the "other person" does not affect the liability of the&nbsp; employer to&nbsp; pay compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>As to the alleged "amicable settlement," it consists of an affidavit&nbsp; wherein,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of 150 pesos,&nbsp; Mamador's widow promised "to forgive&nbsp; Macunat for the wrong committed and not to bring him before the authorities for prosecution."&nbsp; Upon making such promise—petitioner argues —she elected one of the remedies, (against the third person) and&nbsp; is barred from the&nbsp; other&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; (against the&nbsp; employer).&nbsp; The contention&nbsp; may not be sustained, inasmuch as all&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow&nbsp; promised was to&nbsp; forego the offender's criminal&nbsp; prosecution.&nbsp; She did not promise to waive&nbsp; the civil action for&nbsp; damages. Note further that&nbsp; a question may be raised whether she could bind the other heirs of the deceased.</p><p>The most important aspect of this appeal, is the effect of the deceased's having violated the employer's&nbsp; prohibition against laborers riding&nbsp; the&nbsp; haulage trucks.&nbsp; Petitioner claims such violation was the laborer's&nbsp; "notorious negligence" which,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; precludes&nbsp; recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission has not declared that the prohibition&nbsp;&nbsp; was known to Mamador.&nbsp; Yet the employer does not&nbsp; point out in the record evidence to that effect.&nbsp; Supposing Mamador knew the prohibition, said the referee, "can we truthfully say that he boarded the fatal truck with&nbsp; full apprehension of the existence of the danger,&nbsp; if any at&nbsp; all, that an ordinary prudent man would try to avoid?&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe so, and even in&nbsp; the presence of doubt, the same must be resolved in his favor.&nbsp; Unless of course, we can&nbsp; attribute to him a&nbsp; desire to end his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowhere in&nbsp; the records of this case can we find&nbsp; the slightest insinuation of&nbsp; that desire."</p><p>There&nbsp; is no doubt that mere&nbsp; riding on a haulage truck or stealing a ride thereon is not negligence, ordinarily. It couldn't be, because transportation by truck is not dangerous<em> per se</em>.&nbsp; It is argued that there was&nbsp; notorious negligence&nbsp; in&nbsp; this particular&nbsp; instance because there was the employer's&nbsp; prohibition.&nbsp; Does&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp; order constitute negligence?&nbsp; Many courts hold that violation of a&nbsp; statute&nbsp; or&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; negligence<em> per&nbsp; se.</em> Others consider the&nbsp; circumstances.</p><p>However there is practical unanimity in *the proposition that violation of a rule promulgated&nbsp; by a Commission or board is not negligence<em> per se</em>; but it may be evidence of negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (C. J. S., Vol.&nbsp; 65, p. 427.)</p><p>This order of the employer (prohibition rather) couldn't be of&nbsp; a greater obligation than&nbsp; the rule of a&nbsp; Commission or board.&nbsp; And the referee correctly considered this violation as possible evidence of negligence; but it declared that under the circumstances, the laborer could not be&nbsp; declared to have&nbsp; acted with negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Correctly, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; believed,. since the prohibition had nothing to do with personal safety of the riders.</p><p>Such finding is virtually a finding of fact which we may not overrule&nbsp; in this certiorari proceeding.</p><p>Nevertheless,&nbsp; even&nbsp; granting there&nbsp; was negligence, it surely was&nbsp; not&nbsp; "notorious" negligence,&nbsp; which&nbsp; we have interpreted to mean the same thing as "gross" negligence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; —implying "conscious indifference to consequences" "pursuing&nbsp; a course of&nbsp; conduct which would naturally&nbsp; and probably result in&nbsp; injury" "utter&nbsp; disregard&nbsp; of&nbsp; consequences."&nbsp; (38 Am.&nbsp; Jur., 691.)&nbsp; Getting&nbsp; or accepting a free ride on the company's haulage truck couldn't&nbsp; be gross negligence, because as the referee found, "no danger or risk was apparent."</p><p>There being no&nbsp; other material&nbsp; point raised in the petition for review, the award of&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner.</p><p><em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Reyes, A., J.,</em> concurs in the result.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 57&nbsp; Phil., 751.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><em> See</em> Balajadia <em>vs</em>.
