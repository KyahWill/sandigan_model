				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a complaint, twice amended and. supplemented, filed against Foster Wheeler 
Corporation and Caltex (Phil.) Inc., in the Municipal Court of Manila (Civil 
Case No. 40789), Felix Abe and 393 others (pp. 97-111; 118-120, Record on 
Appeal) claiming to have been employed by the named defendants on various 
occasions from 1952 to 1954 in the "Batangas Refinery Construction Project" at 
Danglaya, Bauan, Batangas, and discharged from employment in 1954 without 
notice, each demanded recovery of separation pay, value of sick and vacation 
leaves, and overtime compensation, allegedly due them, computed at the rate 
ranging from P4.00 to P16.80 daily, with interest thereon.
<p>Defendant Foster Wheeler Corporation, in its answer, alleged among others, 
that the action was improper for a class suit, the claim of each plaintiff being 
separate and distinct from the others; that under their written contract of 
employment, plaintiffs could be separated from the service without notice or 
separation pay; that plaintiffs were, fully compensated for any overtime service 
rendered; and that it was not obliged, under the law, to grant vacation and sick 
leave privileges to its employees. As counterclaim, defendant demanded from each 
of them the sum of at least P100.00 for attorney's fees and costs. For its part, 
Caltex (Phil.) Inc., disclaimed having anything to do with the employment of any 
worker in said project, although it also advanced the same defenses as those set 
up by its co-defendant.</p>
<p>Thereafter, defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint for lack of 
cause of action, it being claimed that plaintiffs were employed after Article 
302 of the Code of Commerce on "mesada" was repealed, .and they were separated 
from the service before Republic Act 1052,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> reviving the said privilege, went into 
effect. It was thus contended that for the duration of plaintiffs' employment, 
there was no law imposing on the employer the duty to give 1-month advance 
notice or payment of the separation pay before terminating the services of an 
employee. Defendants also cited the opinion of the Chief of the Wage 
Administration Service, dated June 21, 1954, issued in answer to their query, to 
the effect that Republic Act 1052 is not applicable to construction workers as 
the ones involved herein. These motions were opposed by plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Allegedly for failure to prove their respective allegations, the Municipal 
Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint as well as defendants' counterclaim. 
Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 
34601), wherein both parties reiterated their respective allegations presented 
in the inferior court.</p>
<p>In its decision of September 11, 1958, copy of which was received by counsel 
for plaintiffs on September 15, 1958, the court said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * What the Court has found very difficult to resolve is the debate on 
the termination pay. All the contracts were executed prior to June 12, 1954, 
when Republic Act 1052 was approved; and by decision of the Supreme Court in the 
case of Lara <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario, 94 Phil., 778; 50 Off., Gaz., 1975, which 
was promulgated less than two months before the approval of that law, it was 
held that the right of employees to the <em>Mesada</em> provided by Article 302 
of the Code of Commerce had been repealed by the New Civil Code; and as the New 
Civil Code became effective on August 30, 1950, technically from August 30, 
1950, up to June 12, 1954, there was no law on mesada existing in the 
Philippines; * * *. It is contended for the defendants that since all the 
contracts entered into with plaintiffs were executed before June 12, 1954, when 
Republic Act 1052 became effective, said Act cannot be given such effect as to 
make it applicable even to contracts already existing upon its approval as were 
the contracts here for if that were the case, the law would become 
unconstitutional under the rule prohibiting impairment of contract. The trouble, 
however, is that the law, Republic Act 1052, makes it clearly effective 
beginning June 12, 1964; that was an indication of the Legislative will that it 
was to be made effective even as to contracts executed before but not yet 
terminated at the time of its approval; and the presumption is always in favor 
of constitutionality." </p></blockquote>
<p>And holding that plaintiffs' employment was not for a definite period, the 
court declared them<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> entitled to 
separation pay on the basis of their daily salaries, computed at 26 working days 
a month, plus intereat thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint, and 
costs. Defendants Foster Wheeler Corporation and Caltex (Phil) Inc. perfected an 
appeal to this Court, docketed as G.R. No. L-14785. On the other hand, the 
twenty (20) plaintiffs excluded from the decision for having, according to the 
trial judge, been already paid their "mesada", likewise, interposed an appeal 
docketed as G. R. No. L-14923.</p>
<p>Prior to August 30, 1950<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the 
workers' right to separation pay or "mesada" was secured by Article 302 of the 
Code of Commerce. However, in a decision promulgated on April 20, 1954, this 
Court declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As to the month's pay (mesada) under Article 302 of the Code of Commerce, 
Article 2270 of the new Civil Code (Republic Act 386) appears to have repealed 
said Code of Commerce governing Agency. This repeal took place on August 30, 
1950, when the new Civil Code went into effect, that is, one year after its 
publication in the Official Gazette."</p></blockquote>
<p>As a consequence thereof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the 
legislature enacted Republic Act 1052 which, in full, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE MANNER OF TERMINATING EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT A 
DEFINITE PERIOD IN A COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, OR AGRICULTURAL ESTABLISHMENT OR 
ENTERPRISE.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>"SECTION 1. In cases of employment, without a definite period, in a 
commercial, industrial or agricultural establishment or enterprise, neither the 
employer nor the employee shall terminate the employment without serving notice 
on the other at least one month in advance.</p>
<p>"The employee, upon whom no such notice was served, shall he entitled to one 
month's compensation from the date of termination of his employment.</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. Any contract or agreement contrary to the provisions of section one 
of this Act shall be null and void.</p>
<p>"Sec. 3. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.</p>
<p>"Approved, June 12, 1954."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no controversy as to the fact that herein appellees were employed 
after the repeal of Article 302 of the Code of Commerce and before the 
effectivity of Republic Act 1052. But, it is not also denied that they were 
separated from the service (with the exception of a few) "after said Act went 
into operation. Appellants, however, in contesting the decision of the lower 
court ordering them to give the employees separation pay, contend that as the 
contracts of employment were entered into at a time when there was no law 
granting the workers said right, the application as to them of the subsequent 
enactment restoring the same right constitutes an impairment of their 
contractual obligations. We incline to the contrary view.</p>
<p>The freedom of contract, under our system of government, is not meant to be 
absolute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The same is understood to be 
subject to reasonable legislative regulation aimed at the promotion of public 
health, moral, safety and welfare<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>. In 
other words, the constitutional guaranty of non-impairment of obligations of 
contract is limited by the exercise of the police power of the State, in the 
interest of public health, safety, moral and general welfare.</p>
<p>By its very nature, Republic Act 1052 is a measure intended to provide 
protection to the workingmen, and, in a way, the employers as well, specifically 
in cases of employments with indefinite period or duration, by requiring the 
employer or employee, as the case may be, before terminating the employment, to 
give unto the other notice thereof 30 days in advance, non-observance of which 
by the employer, subjects him to payment (to the employee concerned) of a sum 
equivalent to the latter's compensation for one month. The logical question that 
may be raised concerns the nature of Republic Act 1052, i.e., whether it is a 
regulatory measure, not a substantive law so that its enactment may properly be 
considered a valid exercise of the police power of the State. The answer is in 
the affirmative.</p>
<p>It may be observed that the Act prescribes the manner of terminating 
employment without a fixed or definite period, by requiring the employer or 
employee, before terminating such employment, to notify the other party of such 
fact. Evidently, the purpose of the regulation is to give the other party 
opportunity to find replacement or substitute, in the case of the employer, and 
other place of employment or source of livelihood, in the case of the employee. 
The right to be thus notified can hardly be considered substantive, nor does the 
provision requiring the employer to give the employee, dismissed without such 
advance notification, the equivalent salary of the latter for 1 month, bestow 
upon said employee any substantive right or interest immediately upon execution 
of the contract of employment. Actually, the enactment of the law merely makes 
an employment subject to the requirement that the same would not be terminated 
without notifying the other party of the impending termination, 30 days in f 
advance. And, in case of non-compliance therewith, the employer shall be liable 
for payment to the employee of an amount Equivalent to the latter's compensation 
for 1 month. It is clear therefrom that this provision on payment may only be 
availed of in case of failure to comply with the regulation on the giving of 30 
day advance notice; that it partakes more of a penalty for violation of the 
requirement which is within the power of the legislature to impose (See Thorpe 
<em>vs</em>. Ruthland &amp; Burlington R.R. Co., 27 Vt. 140). The application, 
therefore, of Republic Act 1052, which was enacted in the exercise of the police 
power of the State, to dismissal effected after June 12, 1954, is with legal 
sanction.</p>
<p>Neither can it be successfully argued that ine herein involved workers do not 
fall within the ambit of operation of the law (Rep. Act 1052) in view of the 
condition contained in their contract, thus worded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2. The refinery construction is a project of temporary duration and, hence 
your employment term shall also be temporary dependent upon the needs and 
requirements, as determined by this Company, of the particular phase of the 
construction work to which you may presently or hereafter be assigned. The 
necessary consequences of your temporary employment term are:</p>
<p>"(a) Your employment may be terminated at any time without obligation to the 
Company, upon-payment of wages earned through the date of such 
termination."</p></blockquote>
<p>As observed by the trial court, it appears from the stipulation of facts 
entered into between the parties that almost all of the employees hired under 
the uniform contract containing the above condition, were employed in 1952 and 
worked continuously until their dismissal in 1954. The work can not thus be 
considered of temporary duration, but more or less permanent. It would not then 
be difficult for the employers (herein appellants) to know the approximate date 
when the services of the employees would no longer be necessary for the purpose 
of giving them the necessary 30 day advance notice of dismissal. Under the 
circumstances, the aforequoted condition in the contract, while probably proper 
when the contract was executed, became, nevertheless, inoperative upon the 
enactment ef Republic Act 1052.</p>
<p>Defendants-appellants similarly raise the jurisdictional question regarding 
the sufficiency of the allegations of the complaint to vest original 
jurisdiction in the Municipal Court and appellate jurisdiction in the Court of 
First Instance. The pertinent part of the second amended complaint (R. A. p. 55) 
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3-a. That a substantial compliance with the desire of this Honorable Court, 
as can be gleaned from the order of dismissal, plaintiffs hereby attached Annex 
'A'; and made an Integral part of this second amended complaint, showing the 
dates plaintiffs were hired, the dates they were discharged without previous 
notice, the agreed salary computed so much daily; and <em>that the separation 
pay, amounting to one month or thirty-days at leant together ivith the claims 
for vacation and sick leaves and overtime as the case may be, of each, and every 
one mentioned in Annex 'A', and which each and every one claims, will not exceed 
ranging from P120.00 to P1500.00</em>, * * *." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no question that a complaint must contain the ultimate facts 
constituting plaintiff's cause or causes of action (Sec. 1, Rule 6, Rules of 
Court). For purposes of said Rule, however, it was said that a complaint would 
be sufficient if it contains sufficient notice of the cause of action even 
though the allegations may be vague or indefinite, or in the form of 
conclusions, in which event, the proper recourse would be, not a motion to 
dismiss, but a motion for a bill of particulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In the case at bar, the allegations of the 
complaint, taken with Annex "A", to our mind, give the necessary information 
sufficient enough to enable defendants to plead and prepare for trial, 
considering that they are the ones keeping record of the facts of the appellees' 
employment and are in the best position to know the extent of the latter's 
claims. And, even assuming that they have no such records, defendants should 
have moved for a bill of particulars. Failing to do so, they can not now be 
heard to complain against the alleged insufficiency or ambiguity of the 
complaint. </p>
<p>G.R. No. L-14923</p>
<p>With respect to the appeal of the twenty (20) employees who were excluded 
from the judgment, it is contended that the lower court gravely abused its 
discretion in disapproving their record on appeal and denying their motion for 
relief. The facts regarding this incident are not disputed. </p>
<p>Herein appellants received copy of the decision on September 15, 1958. Their 
motion for partial reconsideration of the decision, praying for their inclusion 
therein and filed on October 9, was denied on October 18, of which counsel for 
plaintiffs was notified on October 21. From September 15 to October 9, 24 days 
had elapsed. The remaining 6 days started to run again from October 21 and would 
end on October 27, when the decision should become final.</p>
<p>On October 24, counsel for plaintiffs filed a motion for extension of time 
within which to perfect an appeal, mentioning therein the fact that they were 
still trying to raise the necessary amount to cover the appeal bond and 
incidental expenses. By order of October 25, 1958, copy of which was received by 
plaintiffs on October 31 (after the 30-day period had already expired on October 
27), the court granted them up to November 8, 1958, within which to file the 
record on appeal only, but denied the extension with respect to the filing of 
the bond. Although the said record on appeal as well as the bond were actually 
filed on November 7, the lower court, nonetheless, disapproved the appeal in its 
order of November 12, 1958, by reason of their alleged failure to pay the appeal 
bond on time. Plaintiffs did not appeal from this order of denial. However, on 
November 25, 1958, counsel for plaintiff's filed a motion for relief from the 
judgment, under Rule 38, which was denied. It is this order, as well as that 
disapproving their appeal, that plaintiffs-appellants want us to nullify and set 
aside.</p>
<p>We see nothing abusive or irregular in the actions taken by the lower court. 
It is true that the motion for extension of time to perfect the appeal was filed 
before the expiration of the reglementary period, and that, although the order 
extending the period to file the record on appeal was issued on October 25, copy 
thereof was received by counsel for the plaintiffs only on October 31, or after 
the original period had already lapsed. However, we can not subscribe to the 
proposition that the payment of the appeal bond on November 7 constitutes 
substantial compliance with the Rules.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the granting or denial of a motion for extension of time is 
discretionary on the court. Counsel for the plaintiffs, therefore, should not 
have presumed that his motion for extension of the period to file the record on 
appeal and pay the appeal bond would be granted, but should have taken upon 
himself the duty to inquire, before the original period has lapsed, what action 
the court took on his said motion. In this case, the order partly denying 
the-requested extension was issued on October 25, or the day after the motion 
was filed. Counsel could have easily informed himself of such fact, had he only 
tried to do so, considering that his office (in the Dona Mercedes building, 
Plaza Miranda, Quiapo, Manila) is practically only a few blocks away from where 
the court is housed. This he could have done before the deadline, October 27. 
Instead, he waited for the delivery of the notice to him on October 31, which is 
too late. Even then, it took him another seven (7) days before he filed his 
appeal bond on November 7.</p>
<p>There is, similarly, no basis for the granting of the relief prayed for by 
the plaintiffs-appellants. The motion for relief was based on the alleged 
excusable negligence of counsel, consisting of the latter's failure to know of 
the existence of the Opinion of the Secertary of Justice, dated July 28, 1958 
(Op. No. 149, series of 1958), interpreting the 1-month salary provided under 
Republic Act 1052 to mean 30 working days. The finding of the aforecited Opinion 
by chance, to our mind, does not partake of the nature of "discovery" of 
evidence as contemplated under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. It must be 
remembered that aside from the acknowledged doctrine that the Opinion of the 
Secretary of Justice is not binding upon the Courts, the matters expressed 
therein are <em>not evidentiary facts</em>, but dissertations or discussion of 
the nature, extent and effect of a given legal issue.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the main decision, insofar as it relates to those of the 
plaintiffs-employees who were dismissed after June 12, 1954, is hereby affirmed, 
as well as the orders of November 12, and 27, 1958, appealed from. Costs are 
taxed in G.R. No. L-14785 against appellants Foster Wheeler Corporation and 
Caltex (Phil.) Inc., and in G.R. No. L—14923, against appellants Felix Abe, et 
al. So ordered.</p>

<p><strong>BARRERA, J.: </strong></p>
<p>In case G.R. No. L-14785 (Felix Abe, et al vs. Foster Wheeler Corp., et al.), 
defendants-appellants filed separate motions for reconsiderations of the 
decision herein rendered, on the ground that (1) the employment of the workers 
involved in this case was for a definite period, and (2) Republic Act No. 1052 
should not be given retroactive effect.</p>
<p>There is no question that the Batangas Refinery Project is for a specific 
duration, which is, until it is completed. Too, the different phases of the 
construction work, e.g., masonry, painting, plumbing, etc., may also be 
considered with definite duration, which is, until they are finished. Still 
under the terms of the contract entered into by the workers, the period or 
duration of their employment was indefinite. As far as pertinent, the contract 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2. The refinery construction is a project of temporary duration and hence, 
your employment terms shall also be temporary dependent upon the needs and 
requirements, as determined by this Company, of the particular phase of the 
construction work to which you may be presently or hereafter be assigned . . 
."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the aforequoted provision of the contract, the worker's term of 
employment is made subject to two conditions: (1) upon the needs and 
requirements (<em>not duration</em>) of the particular work to which he (the 
worker) is assigned and (2) that such needs and requirements are to be as so 
determined by the employer. In other words, the duration of the employment of a 
worker assigned to a particular kind of work is not necessarily co-existent with 
the duration of such work, because the employer could, at any stage of the work, 
determine whether his services are needed or not. Likewise, the employer could, 
even after the termination of a particular work, assign the employee to another 
phase of the construction work, if the employer determines that the needs of the 
work so require. Clearly, the worker is without any means to know when his 
services would be considered by his employer still necessary or not.</p>
<p>As to the other ground relied upon in the motion, the same was already fully 
discussed in the decision.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs-appellants in case G. R. No. L-14923 (Abe, et al. <em>vs</em>. 
Foster Wheeler Corp., et al.,) also filed a motion for reconsideration raising 
issues which are already fully considered in the decision.</p>
<p>The motions filed in both cases are, therefore, denied for lack of merit.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Motions denied.</em></p></div>
