				G.R. No. L-879, October 02, 1946</h4>
				<H3>EDUARDO GOMEZ, Petitioner, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Director of Prisons 
as respondent. The petitioner is Eduardo Gomez, who has filed the petition in 
behalf of Eliseo Gomez, at present confined in the new Bilibid Prison, in the 
municipality of Muntinglupa, Province of Rizal, as a detention prisoner.</p>
<p>The petition and the return of the writ disclose that Eliseo Gomez was 
committed to the new Bilibid Prison on May 27, 1944, by the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, by virtue of a judgment of conviction for rape, sentencing 
him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from 6 years and (1) day of 
<em>prision mayor</em> to (14) years and (8) months of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>, to pay the offended party P500 as indemnity, and to pay the 
costs. The commitment, addressed to the Director of Prisons, was signed by Judge 
Buenaventura Ocampo, of the Court of First Instance of Manila.<br>Certified copy 
thereof is attached to as part of the return.</p>
<p>The prisoner appealed, to tho Court of Appeals in due time but before the 
case disposed of, the record was completely destroyed or lost.</p>
<p>Section 4 Rule 102, of the Rules of Court provides that "If it appears that 
the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of en 
officer under process issued by a court or judge, or by virtue of a judgment or 
order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to 
issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the "writ shall not 
be allowed; * * *. Nor shall anything in this rule be held to authorize the 
discharge * * * of a person suffering imprisonment under lawful judgment."</p>
<p>The petition does not make out a case. The Director of Prisons is holding the 
prisoner under process issued by a competent court, in pursuance of a lawful, 
subsisting judgment. The prisoner himself admits the legality of his detention. 
The mere loss or destruction of the record of the case does not invalidate the 
judgment or the commitment, or authorize the prisoner's release.</p>
<p>The prisoner's remedy, for the time being at least, lies in having the record 
of his case, reconstituted. Steps in this direction have already been started; 
the record is in process of reconstitution before a commissioner. If the 
proceeding has been suspended, it was on motion of the prisoner's attorney for 
extension of time.</p>
<p>The delay which the prisoner's case suffers has been due to circumstances 
beyond the control of the officials in charge of the prosecution. This delay we 
have to consider as reasonable and is not a good ground for the granting of the 
petition.</p>
<p>We agree with the Solicitor General that at best the petition is premature. 
The petitioner should have waited for the result of the efforts being exerted to 
reconstitute the record. Should reconstitution or new trial turn out to be 
impracticable, then that will be the time when appropriate action may be taken 
to do justice within the law to the prisoner.</p>
<p>The petition is denied without costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, </em>and 
<em>Padilla, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>PERFECTO J.</strong>, 
dissenting:</p>
<p>I dissent on the ground that, in my opinion, the judgment of conviction 
rendered in 1944 by the Japanese-sponsored Court of First lnstance of Manila 
against petitioner is null and void. My reasons are (1) those set forth in my 
dissent, both from the main decision and from the resolution on the motion for 
reconsideration, in Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh, and Dizon(75 Phil., 
113, 371); (2) those set forth in my concurring opinion in Peralta <em>vs.</em> 
Director of Prisons, (75 Phil., 285); (3) those set forth in my concurring 
opinion in People vs. Jose (75 Phil. 612); (4) those set forth in my dissent in 
Alcantara <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, (75 Phil., 494); (5) those set forth 
in my concurring opinion in De Castro <em>vs.</em> Court of Appeals (75 Phi., 
824) and (6) the doctrine in Jones<em> vs.</em> United States (137 U. S. 202; 34 
Law ed. 691, 696) and in the cases therein cited, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who is the sovereign, de jure or de facto, of a territory is not a judicial, 
but a political, question, the determination of which by the legislative and 
executive departments of any government conclusively binds the judges, as well 
as all other officers, citizens and subjects, of that government. This principle 
has always been upheld by this court, and has been affirmed under a great 
variety of circumstances. (Gelston <em>vs.</em> Hoyt, 16 U. S. 3 Wheat, 246, 324 
[4:381; 401]; United States<em> vs.</em> Palmer, Id., 610 [471]; the Divina 
Pastora, 17 U. S. 4 Wheat., 52 [4:5l2]; Foster <em>vs.</em> Neilson, 27 U. S. 2 
Pet., 253, 307, 309 [7:415, 433, 434]; Keene <em>vs.</em> M'Donough, 33 U. S. 8 
Pet., 308 [8:95]; Garcia vs. Lee, 37 U. S., 12 Pet. 511, 520 [9::1176]; Williams 
<em>vs.</em> Suffolk Ins. Co. 38 U. S. l3 Pet., 415 [10:226]; United States 
<em>vs.</em> Yorba, 68 U. S. 1 Wall., 412; 423 [17:635, 637]; United States vs. 
Lynde, 78 U. S. 11 Wall., 632, 638 [20:230, 232]. It is equally well settled in 
England. The Pelican, Edw. Adm. Appx. D; Taylor<em> vs.</em> Barclay, 2 Sim. 
213; Emperor of Austria vs. Day, 3 DeG. F. &amp; J., 217, 221, 233; Republic of 
Peru <em>vs.</em> Peruvian Guano Co., L. R., 36 Ch. Div. 489, 497; Republlc of 
Peru <em>vs.</em> Dreyfus, L. R., 38 Ch. Div. 348, 356, 359) (137 U. S., 213, 34 
Law ed., 696).</p></blockquote>Finally, this dissent is also based on the 
considerations stated in my dissenting opinion in Iba√±ez <em>vs.</em> Hernandez 
(775, <em>post.</em>)
