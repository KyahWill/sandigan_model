				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a&nbsp; judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; ordering the defendant corporation&nbsp; to pay to the Administrator of the estate&nbsp; of the late Mariano A. Albert, who died during the pendency of the case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P23,000,&nbsp; interest thereon from the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of the complaint, and&nbsp; costs, and dismissing the defendant's&nbsp; counterclaim, certified- to this . Court by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason&nbsp; that the total&nbsp; amount sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be recovered by&nbsp; the defendant corporation exceeds P50,000.<br><br>On 19 July 1948&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff and the&nbsp; defendant corporation&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into a contract whereby,&nbsp; for&nbsp; and&nbsp; in consideration of the&nbsp; exclusive right to publish or&nbsp; cause to be published a manuscript containing commentaries on " 'The Revised Penal&nbsp; Code of the Philippines,' as amended until July 15, 1948," written by the plaintiff,&nbsp; for&nbsp; a period of five years from the date of execution of the contract; of the liquidated balance&nbsp; due the&nbsp; plaintiff as his share in the sale of the reprinted copies of the book as stipulated in a contract executed on 21 May 1946 by and&nbsp; between him&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 1); and&nbsp; of the&nbsp; liquidated share of the plaintiff&nbsp; in the sale&nbsp; of 1,500 reprinted&nbsp; copies of the&nbsp; book,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; corporation undertook to&nbsp; pay- the&nbsp; plaintiff the sum of P30.000 in eight quarterly&nbsp; installments of P3,750 each, beginning 15 July 1948&nbsp; (Exhibit A).&nbsp;&nbsp; The most&nbsp; important&nbsp; stipulations&nbsp; of the contract are&nbsp; the following:<br><blockquote>1. That the tarty of the&nbsp; first part is the&nbsp; author&nbsp; and sole proprietor&nbsp; of a&nbsp; manuscript&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; his&nbsp; revised&nbsp; commentaries&nbsp; of "'The&nbsp; Revised Penal Code of&nbsp; the Philippines" as amended until July 15, 1943;<br><br>2. That&nbsp; the party of the first part hereby grants to the party of THE&nbsp; SECOND&nbsp; PART the exclusive&nbsp; right&nbsp; to publish&nbsp; or&nbsp; cause&nbsp; to&nbsp; be published&nbsp; the said manuscript within a period&nbsp; of 5 years from the execution&nbsp; of this&nbsp; document, provided that&nbsp; the total number of&nbsp; copies to be&nbsp; printed within said period shall not he more than 4,000 copies;<br><br>4. That&nbsp; the party of the second fart hereby agrees&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; to the party of&nbsp; the first&nbsp; part, for the exclusive right, to publish&nbsp; the manuscript,&nbsp; object" of&nbsp; this contract, for a&nbsp; period of 6 years counted from&nbsp; the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; document; for the liquidated balance&nbsp; due&nbsp; him&nbsp; as his share in the sales of&nbsp; the&nbsp; reprinted&nbsp; copies of the first edition of&nbsp; this book as per contract between both parties dated&nbsp; May 21,&nbsp; 1946;&nbsp; and for Ms liquidated share in&nbsp; the sales&nbsp; of another&nbsp; 1,500 reprinted&nbsp; copies in&nbsp; 1948 of said&nbsp; book, now in&nbsp; the press: the total&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; <p30,000 payable="" in ="" 8 ="" quarters="" at ="" the="" rate="" of ="" p3,750="" a ="" quarter,="" first="" quarter="" to="" begin="" from="" july="" 15,="" 1948. ="" it="" is ="" also="" agreed="" that ="" should="" faety ="" of="" second="" pakt="" fail="" pay="" party ="" part="" any="" one ="" the ="" eight="" instalments="" referred="" when="" due,="" rest="" shall="" be="" deemed="" due="" and="" payable,="" whether="" there="" is="" judicial="" or ="" extra-judicial ="" demand="" made="" by="" tarty="" fart. ="" in="" this ="" event,="" farty ="" pakt ="" take="" charge="" publication="" this="" book, ="" case="" has ="" already="" been="" published,="" will="" over="" sale="" distrbution ="" printed ="" without  ="" any ="" right="" on="" part ="" party="" second ="" participate ="" its="" proceeds:<br="">(P30,000 payable in 8 quarters at the rate of P3,750 a quarter, the first quarter to begin from July 15, 1948. It is also agreed that should the PARTY OF THE SECOND PART fail to pay to the PARTY OF THE FIRST PART any one of the eight installments referred to when due, the rest of the installments shall be deemed due and payable, whether there is judicial or extra-judicial demand made by the PARTY OF THE FIRST PART. In this event , the PART OF THE FIRST PART shall take charge of the publication of this book, and in case it has already been published, will take over the sale and distribution of the printed book, without any right on the part of the PARTY OF THE SECOND PART to participate in its proceeds:<br><br>7. That&nbsp; the party of the&nbsp; first part obligates himself to deliver to the PARTY OF THE SECOND&nbsp; PART the manuscript in its final form not&nbsp; later&nbsp; than December&nbsp; 31, 1948;&nbsp; provided,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the party of the second&nbsp; part shall&nbsp; have no right&nbsp; to make any change in the manuscript as prepared by the party of the first fart who, if the circumstances&nbsp; do&nbsp; permit,&nbsp; must stamp his&nbsp; approval in&nbsp; the printer's final proof.<br></p30,000></blockquote>In the event of the&nbsp; impossibility for the party of the&nbsp; first part to deliver&nbsp; the manuscript complete by December 31, 1948, the&nbsp; party of the&nbsp; SECOND part&nbsp; shall no longer be&nbsp; under&nbsp; obligation to pay the installments&nbsp; remaining payable by virtue of the provisions&nbsp; of the Contract, unless the party op the&nbsp; second part undertakes&nbsp; to complete the same by inserting the latest decisions of the Supreme Court as&nbsp; digested and/or commented upon by the PARTY&nbsp; OF THE FIRST PART.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; paid P1,000 to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff on&nbsp; 31 July&nbsp; 1948&nbsp; (Exhibits&nbsp; E&nbsp; and 2) ;&nbsp; Pl,000&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 September 1948&nbsp; (Exhibit 2-A) ; P2,000 on 10 November 1948&nbsp; (Exhibits C, C-l and 2-B) ; P2,000 on 29 November 1948&nbsp; (Exhibit S) ;&nbsp; and Pl,000 on 24 December 1948 (Exhibit 3-A),&nbsp; or a&nbsp; total of&nbsp; P7,000.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant corporation made no other or further payment to the plaintiff on&nbsp; account of the contract.<br><br>The evidence for the plaintiff shows that on 16 December 1948 he&nbsp; wrote&nbsp; a letter advising the defendant corporation that "The manuscript of&nbsp; my Commentaries on the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; subject&nbsp; matter of our&nbsp; Contract&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on the 19th of July this&nbsp; year, is now at your disposal."&nbsp; (Exhibit D.)<br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; corporation breached the contract when it failed to pay the full amount of&nbsp; the installment for the first quarter on&nbsp; or before&nbsp; 15 October&nbsp; 1948, the&nbsp; last day within&nbsp; which to pay it.&nbsp; The defendant corporation contends that 'the plaintiff failed to deliver to it the manuscript in its final form not later than 31 December 1948 as stipulated in paragraph&nbsp; 7 of&nbsp; the contract (Exhibit A).<br><br>The first point then to determine&nbsp; is whether the 'plaintiff had performed his part of the contract as stipulated in paragraph 7 of the aforesaid contract.<br><br>Upon plaintiff's demand and defendant's failure to produce and exhibit the original of the letter dated 16 December 1948 already referred to, the plaintiff read in evidence the contents of a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of said letter (Exhibit D).&nbsp; Concepcion&nbsp; K. de Vera, the stenographer who took down by shorthand the dictation of the plaintiff, identified it as&nbsp; the carbon copy of the original and testified that the original was sent to&nbsp; the defendant corporation.&nbsp; On cross-examination she exhibited and&nbsp; read&nbsp; to the Court the notes from which she typed the original letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The President of&nbsp; the defendant corporation denies having received not only&nbsp; the original of the letter dated 16&nbsp; December 1948 but also&nbsp; the original of a letter dated 27 April 1949 (Exhibit E) written by the plaintiff to the defendant corporation. In&nbsp; the last letter reference to the preceding letter of 16 December 1948 (Exhibit D) was made and a demand for payment of the installments due and unpaid was also made.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant corporation&nbsp; admits, however,&nbsp; the receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original of the&nbsp; letters dated 15 August 1949 (Exhibit&nbsp; F) and 6 June 1949 (Exhibit G).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first letter (Exhibit F) the plaintiff reminded the defendant corporation of its promise to settle the installment&nbsp; due on 15 April and&nbsp; 15 . July and the balance of the&nbsp; installment due and unpaid of 15 December (January) ; and in the second&nbsp; (Exhibit G)&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff reminded the defendant of its due and unpaid installments and stated that, in view of the&nbsp; apparent inability of the&nbsp; defendant corporation to fulfill&nbsp; its part of&nbsp; the contract, he would consider the contract rescinded and would publish the&nbsp; revised edition next&nbsp; month (July) at his expense.&nbsp; The defendant corporation has not answered these two letters.<br><br>The mere denial&nbsp; by the President&nbsp; of the defendant corporation is not&nbsp; sufficient to outweigh&nbsp; and&nbsp; overcome&nbsp; the evidence showing that the plaintiff&nbsp; advised the&nbsp; defendant corporation that the manuscript&nbsp; of&nbsp; the commentaries on the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the contract executed on 19&nbsp; July 1948, was ready for&nbsp; delivery to, and at the disposal&nbsp; of,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant corporation for publication.&nbsp; The defendant corporation failed to pay&nbsp; on&nbsp; or&nbsp; before&nbsp; 15 October 1948 the first installment due,&nbsp; because it had paid only Pl,000 on 31 July 1948 and another&nbsp; P1,000 on 10 September 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the&nbsp; defendant corporation paid P2.000 on&nbsp; 10&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was after the last day fixed&nbsp; for the payment of the first installment. But that delay in the payment of the first quarterly installment may not amount to a breach&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify the enforcement of the stipulation set forth, in paragraph 4 of the contract (Exhibit A) because the plaintiff accepted&nbsp; the payment of P2,000 on 10 November 1948, which completed and paid the lull amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; first installment due&nbsp; and left&nbsp; a, balance of P250 to be credited to the&nbsp; second&nbsp; installment due&nbsp; on 15 January 1949.&nbsp; On this last mentioned&nbsp; date the total amount paid by the defendant corporation, including the sum of&nbsp; P250 in&nbsp; excess of the amount paid for the first quarterly&nbsp; installment, was P3.250 or&nbsp; P500 short of&nbsp; the total&nbsp; amount&nbsp; due&nbsp; on&nbsp; such date&nbsp; corresponding to the&nbsp; second quarterly installment.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the&nbsp; defendant corporation&nbsp; has made no further payment, the stipulation in paragraph&nbsp; 4 of the contract has to be enforced.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; corporation argues that the fact that the mimeographed copies of plaintiff's book or commentaries on. the Revised Penal Code&nbsp; published&nbsp; by the PHILAW Publishing Company does not contain cases decided by the Supreme Court up to 1948 is proof that contrary to plaintiff's&nbsp; claim the manuscript which&nbsp; the plaintiff bound himself to write and finish on or before 31&nbsp; December 1948 was not ready&nbsp; for publication&nbsp; on 16&nbsp; or 31 December 1948. There is no evidence, however,&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the mimeographed copies of the book published and sold in November 1949 by the plaintiff or the PHILAW Publication Company were the same as that&nbsp; offered for delivery by the plaintiff to the defendant corporation on 16 December 1948.&nbsp; Besides, there is no stipulation&nbsp; in the contract that&nbsp; the commentaries would include cases decided by the Supreme Court up to 1948.&nbsp; Nowhere in the&nbsp; contract may such&nbsp; stipulation be found.<br><br>The action brought by the plaintiff is not for recission of a&nbsp; contract, under which theory or belief both&nbsp; parties seem to have&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; and labored, but for a resolution of reciprocal obligations&nbsp; because one of the obligors failed to comply with that which was incumbent upon him.&nbsp; The injured party&nbsp; could choose between requiring specific performance of the obligation or its resolution with indemnity for losses&nbsp; and payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; interest.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[1]</font></sup>&nbsp; The&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; in paragraph&nbsp; 4&nbsp; of&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; (Exhibit A)&nbsp; may be&nbsp; considered as liquidated damages to be paid in case of breach of the contract.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2] </sup></font>The defendant corporation has not&nbsp; paid the share of&nbsp; the plaintiff in the proceeds of the sale&nbsp; of the first 1,000 copies of' the&nbsp; book printed&nbsp; and sold by the defendant corporation as agreed upon&nbsp; in the contract entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; by and&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties on&nbsp; 21&nbsp; May&nbsp; 1946 (Exhibit A).&nbsp; In the original and&nbsp; amended&nbsp; answers&nbsp; of the defendant corporation it&nbsp; is alleged&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; copies remained unsold,&nbsp; but on the witness stand Jose M. Aruego, President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant corporation, admitted that 800 copies thereof had been sold.&nbsp; There is also a share due the plaintiff&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sale of 1,500 reprinted&nbsp; copies of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; But how much that share amounts to, the evidence does not throw any light, in like manner that there&nbsp; is no evidence to show&nbsp; how much is due the plaintiff as his share in the sale of 800 copies of the book.<br><br>The counterclaim of the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; was&nbsp; correctly dismissed by&nbsp; the trial court, because it found that the one who had breached the contract is the defendant corporation. Such&nbsp; being the&nbsp; case, the defendant&nbsp; corporation cannot claim any damage against the&nbsp; plaintiff. Aside&nbsp; from that, it is difficult to believe that&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1946 to the&nbsp; time&nbsp; when the contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; 16&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1948 was signed, the defendant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corporation could not and had not disposed of the&nbsp; 1,000&nbsp; copies of the book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the import of the letter&nbsp; of 18 June&nbsp; 1948 written by the plaintiff to&nbsp; Jose M. Aruego, President of the defendant corporation&nbsp; (Exhibit H).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also difficult to believe that not a single copy of the&nbsp; 1,500 copies of the&nbsp; book subsequently reprinted was sold, because of the publication&nbsp; and sale&nbsp; by the&nbsp; PHILAW&nbsp; Publishing Company of the mimeographed copies of the book.&nbsp; From 1948 to November 1949 when the mimeographed copies&nbsp; of the book were sold, there was sufficient time for the sale and disposition of the 1,500&nbsp; reprinted copies of the book. There is no evidence that long before November 1949 there had been&nbsp; an announcement or publication that copies&nbsp; of commentaries on the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code by the plaintiff would&nbsp; be&nbsp; mimeographed and ready for distribution and sale.<br><br>Although&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; breached&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract, as found by the trial court, and&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no&nbsp; reason which may find support in the evidence for disturbing such finding, yet&nbsp; we believe that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of&nbsp; evidence to show the, amount that should&nbsp; accrue to the plaintiff&nbsp; as his share in the proceeds of the sale of&nbsp; 1,000 copies of the book and of&nbsp; 1,500 copies of the reprinted book that were in press when&nbsp; the contract of 19 July 1948 was entered into, and&nbsp; the amount of&nbsp; profits&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiff would derive&nbsp; from the sale of the books to be1 printed, as&nbsp; agreed upon in the&nbsp; contract of&nbsp; 19 July 1948, the amount of&nbsp; liquidated damages is rather excessive, because even if the books&nbsp; were&nbsp; sold&nbsp; at P40, P35 or P30, as hinted by&nbsp; Jose M. Aruego, the president of the defendant corporation,&nbsp; in his testimony, the cost of paper,&nbsp; printing, binding, advertising,&nbsp; sales&nbsp; promotion and other incidental&nbsp; disbursements should&nbsp; be deducted from&nbsp; the gross proceeds..&nbsp; For&nbsp; that reason&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of&nbsp; article 2227 of the&nbsp; new&nbsp; Civil Code, the&nbsp; reasonable amount of&nbsp; liquidated damages that must&nbsp; be&nbsp; awarded to&nbsp; the plaintiff as a result of the breach by the&nbsp; defendant corporation of the contract is- equitably reduced&nbsp; to f 15,000.<br><br>With this&nbsp; modification as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of liquidated damages, the judgment appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.

It&nbsp; is only the acceptance by the appellee of the sum of P2,000 paid by the appellant on 10 November 1948&nbsp; (Exhibits C, C-l, 2-B) that prevented the appellee from enforcing the stipulation in the contract already referred to, to wit: that "the rest of the installments&nbsp; shall be deemed due and payable, whether there is judicial or extrajudicial demand made by the PARTY&nbsp; OF THE FIRST PART"&nbsp; (appellee).&nbsp;&nbsp; The payment&nbsp; of P2,000 made on 10 November 1948 accepted by the appellee completed&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of the first&nbsp; installment due&nbsp; on 15 October 1948 with an&nbsp; excess of P250 credited to the second quarterly installment due on 15 January 1949.&nbsp; But, in the opinion of this Court,&nbsp; the delay in&nbsp; the payment of the first quarterly installment may not amount to a breach of contract&nbsp; to&nbsp; justify the&nbsp; enforcement&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; set forth in paragraph 4&nbsp; of the contract.&nbsp; The appellant justifies its&nbsp; refusal to complete&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment of the second quarterly installment because of the failure of the appellee to deliver the manuscript on or before 31&nbsp; December 1948. But&nbsp; the evidence shows that on&nbsp; 16 December&nbsp; 1948&nbsp; the appelleee&nbsp; wrote a letter advising the appellant that—<br><blockquote> The manuscript of my&nbsp; Commentaries&nbsp; on the Revised Penal Code, subject&nbsp; matter of our Contract executed on the&nbsp; 19th of July&nbsp; this year, is&nbsp; now at your disposal. It is ready to go to the printer should you desire to&nbsp; publish&nbsp; the&nbsp; same next&nbsp; month. I am keeping&nbsp; the manuscript in the office because I am afraid that it&nbsp; may be copied by others,&nbsp; spoiled or lost in your&nbsp; possession.&nbsp; Besides, I desire to add new decisions of the Supreme Court&nbsp; that may be published from time to&nbsp; time before the manuscript is actually sent to the printer. Should you insist in keeping the manuscript, make me know and&nbsp; I shall deliver it to you.&nbsp; (Exhibit D.) </blockquote>Although the appellant's&nbsp; President denies&nbsp; having received the letter, yet&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; such letter was written and delivered&nbsp; to the appellant, a finding supported by a preponderance of evidence.&nbsp; The appellant also denies having&nbsp; received the original&nbsp; of a letter&nbsp; dated&nbsp; 27 April 1949 (Exhibit&nbsp; E) where reference to the previous letter of 16 December 1948&nbsp; was made and&nbsp; demand&nbsp; for payment of installments due and unpaid was&nbsp; also made.&nbsp; However, the appellant&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; admits&nbsp; having&nbsp; received&nbsp;&nbsp; the original of the letters dated 15 August 1949&nbsp; (Exhibit F) and 6&nbsp; June 1949&nbsp; (Exhibit G).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first&nbsp; letter&nbsp; the appellee reminded the appellant corporation&nbsp; of its promise to&nbsp; settle the quarterly installments&nbsp; due&nbsp; on&nbsp; 15&nbsp; April and ] 5&nbsp; July and the unpaid balance of the second installment due on 15&nbsp; January,&nbsp; and in the&nbsp; second, the appellee&nbsp; reminded the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; due&nbsp; and&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; quarterly installments, and warned that in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the apparent inability of the appellant corporation to&nbsp; fulfill its part&nbsp; of the contract he&nbsp; would&nbsp; consider&nbsp; it&nbsp; rescinded and&nbsp; would publish the&nbsp; revised&nbsp; edition next month&nbsp; (July)&nbsp; at&nbsp; his expense.<br><br>The appellant's contention and claim that&nbsp; it did not pay the balance of&nbsp; P500 due on 15 January&nbsp; 1949, because the appellee failed&nbsp; to deliver the manuscript on or&nbsp; before 31 December 1948 cannot be true.&nbsp; The appellant would have answered the&nbsp; two&nbsp; letters it received from the appellee and stated that its refusal to&nbsp; pay the unpaid balance&nbsp; of the second installment&nbsp; was due to the failure of the appellee to deliver the manuscript on or before 31&nbsp; December 1948, and&nbsp; that for that reason it was&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; under obligation to pay the unpaid balance of the second installment&nbsp; and the subsequent installments.&nbsp; Yet&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant never answered the two letters.<br><br>Delivery of the manuscript&nbsp; does not necessarily mean physical or material delivery&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; his&nbsp; letter&nbsp; of 16&nbsp; December 1948&nbsp; (Exhibit D) the appellee advised the appellant that&nbsp; the&nbsp; manuscript&nbsp; was&nbsp; then at its disposal, ready to go to the printer&nbsp; should the appellant desire&nbsp; to publish it next&nbsp; month; that he was keeping the manuscript in his office, because he was afraid that it might be copied by&nbsp; others, spoiled&nbsp; or&nbsp; lost in its&nbsp; possession; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was his desire to add new decisions of the Supreme Court that might be published from time to&nbsp; time before the manuscript was&nbsp; actually sent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the printer, but&nbsp; that&nbsp; if the appellant would&nbsp; insist&nbsp; on having the manuscript,&nbsp; it should let&nbsp; him know, because&nbsp; he would&nbsp; deliver it.&nbsp; This constitutes&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; of the manuscript.&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that in&nbsp; spite&nbsp; of the&nbsp; receipt of&nbsp; that letter by&nbsp; the appellant,&nbsp; as found&nbsp; by the trial court,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant did&nbsp; not insist on the delivery of the manuscript on&nbsp; or before 31&nbsp; December 1948,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; further&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; on&nbsp; 24&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1948 after the receipt of that&nbsp; letter the&nbsp; appellant made another payment of Pl,000 was a clear indication that it accepted the appellee's suggestion because it was&nbsp; not&nbsp; then&nbsp; ready to&nbsp; print&nbsp; the manuscript.<br><br>As Manrosa says:<br><blockquote>La jurisprudencia&nbsp;
