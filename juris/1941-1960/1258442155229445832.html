				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Plaintiff brought this action against defendant before the Court of
First Instance of Rizal to recover the sum of P35,000.00, plus the sum
of P3,500.00 as attorney's fees, and in default of payment, to have the
mortgage executed by defendant foreclosed in accordance with law.<p></p>
<p>Defendant, in his answer, set up the defense that even if the
obligation which plaintiff seeks to recover was actually incurred, he,
however, is entitled to not more than P500.00, Philippine currency,
under the Ballantyne schedule, considering that in December, 1944, when
the loan was obtained, the value of the Japanese currency in relation
to the Philippine peso was 70 to 1.</p>
<p>The case having been submitted on a stipulation of facts, the trial
court rendered judgment ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of
P35,000:00, Philippine currency, without interest, plus the sum of
P1,000.00 as attorney's fees, with the admonition that, in default of
payment within 90 days from date of notice, the property mortgaged
shall be sold at public auction in accordance with law.</p>
<p>Defendant having appealed to the Court of Appeals, the case was
certified to us because it only raises the legal issue of whether,
considering the time and the circumstances under which the loan was
contracted, appellant may settle the obligation in conformity with the
Ballantyne schedule.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that on December 29, 1944, defendant received
from plaintiff the sum of P35,000.00 in Japanese war notes as a loan
and that to guarantee its payment defendant executed a real estate
mortgage in favor of plaintiff wherein one of the conditions
stipulated, particularly that which refers to the manner of payment of
the loan, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(a) That the said loan of P30,000.00 will not earn
interest; that the mortgagor bound himself not to redeem during the war
the property mortgaged, so that the term of one (1) year to redeem,
should be counted from the date of the termination of the war and the
peace actually restored in the Philippines, and the new civil
government is already functioning; that the loan should be paid with
Philippine Currency of the new civil government established in the
Philippines." (Translation of condition one (1) appearing in said "Deed
of Mortgage' Annex "A" of the complaint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it would appear, under the agreement of the parties, defendant
could not redeem or pay the loan during the war but only within the
term of one year to be counted from the date fit the termination of the
war, when peace has actually been restored in the Philippines, and
after a new civil government has been established, in which case the
loan shall be paid in the currency to be issued by the new government.
This case, evidently, comes within the purview of our decision in the
case of Berg <em>vs.</em> Theus,  96 Phil., 102,  wherein we made the following pronouncement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Invoking equity, defendant insists that he should be
allowed to settle his obligation in conformity with the Ballantyne
schedule <em>Equity demands, however, that he live up to  the terms of his contract</em>, which clearly contemplates payment of  P80,000.00 <em>in genuine Philippine Currency</em>,
not only because his promisory notes specifically provide that payment
shall be made in Philippine Treasury Certificate' but also, because
under the terms of the deed of mortgage, <em>payment of said promisory
notes shall not be demandable, prior to the declaration of the
armistice between Japan and the United States</em>."  (Italics  supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant, however, contends that in view of the facts and
circumstances prevailing in the Philippines at the time the obligation
was contracted and the fact that there was no clear and express
understanding between the parties as to the currency in which the loan
was to be paid by the debtor to the creditor when said loan becomes due
and payable, it is but fair that he be allowed to pay obligation in
accordance with the Ballantyne schedule. This contention is untenable,
for it runs counter to the clear and express terms contained in the
deed of mortgage executed by him in favor of plaintiff. There is no
pretense that this document does not represent the real intention of
the parties.</p>
<p>In this connection, we find it fitting to quote what we have said in
a similar case where we stressed that when the parties stipulate that
the payment of a loan may not be made within a fixed period after the
termination of the war they enter into a speculative transaction and as
such they must suffer the consequences. The following is what we said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is not the first time that this question has
been raised. On two previous occasions this Court had been called upon
to rule on a similar question and has decided that when the creditor
and the debtor have agreed on a term within which the payment of the
obligation should be paid in the currency in which payment should be
made, that stipulation should be given force and effect unless it
appears contrary to law, moral or public order. Thus, in one case this
Court said: 'One who borrowed P4,000 in Japanese military notes on
October 5, 1944, to be paid one year after, in currency then
prevailing, was ordered by the Supreme Court to pay said sum after
October 5, 1945, that is, after liberation, in Philippine currency
(Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez, et al., 83 Phil., 890; 46 Off. Gaz. [11]
839). In another case, wherein the parties executed a deed of sale with
<em>pacto de retro</em> of a parcel of land for the sura of P5,000 in
Japanese military notes agreeing that within 80 days after the
expiration of one year from June 24, 1944, the aforementioned land may
be redeemed sa ganito ding halaga, (at the same price) the Court held
that the phrase <em>sa  ganito ding halaga</em> meant the same price
of P5,000 in the currency prevailing at the time of redemption and not
the equivalent in the Philippine currency of P5,000 in Japanese war
notes'. The Court further said, 'The parties herein gambled and
speculated on the date of the termination oi the war and the liberation
of the Philippines by America. This can be gleaned from the stipulation
about redemption, particularly that portion to the effect that
redemption could be effected not before the expiration o£ one year from
June 24, 1944. This kind of agreement, is permitted by law. We find
nothing immoral or unlawful in it' (Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia, 84  Phil., 269; 47 Off. Gaz.,  641)." (De Leon <em>vs.</em> Santiago Syjuco, Inc.,  00  Phil.,  311.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the  decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs  against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Montemayor, Labrador,  Concepcion,  Endencia</em>, and  <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.<br>
  <em>Paras, C.J., Padilla</em> and <em>Barrera, JJ</em>., took no part.
