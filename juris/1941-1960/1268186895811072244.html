				<H3>FILOMENO O. GANA, MARIA PAZ GANA, BELEN GANA, JOSE G. GANA, FILOMENA GANA, AND TELESFORO L. GANA, FOR HIMSELF AND AS GUARDIAN OF THE MINOR BENJAMIN GANA, PETITIONERS, VS. HONORABLE GAVINO S.

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 2 July 1947, the petitioners as heirs of the late Maria A. Gana brought an 
action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal against the respondent Maria 
Luisa P. Vda. de Gana for reconveyance to, them as such heirs of four parcels of 
land together with the buildings and improvements erected thereon (case No. 
244). On 8, November 1947, the Court denied the motion to dismiss the complaint 
and directed the respondent to file her answer within the reglementary period. 
On the same date, upon motion, the Court allowed respondent's counsel to retire 
as attorney from the case. On 14 February 1948, upon motion of the petitioners, 
the respondent was declared in default for failure to file her answer within the 
period prescribed by the rule; and trial of the case proceeded in her absence. 
On 20 July 1948 the respondent learned for the first time that she had been 
declared in default. On 28 July 1948 the Court rendered judgment as prayed for 
in favor of the petitioners and against the respondent. On 31 August 1948 the 
respondent filed a petition dated 29 August 1948 for relief from the order 
declaring her in default. On 26 May 1949, the Court, presided over by Judge Jose 
F. Letargo, denied the petition. On 8 July 1949, the Court, presided over by 
Judge Gavino S. Abaya, reconsidered the order of 26 May 1949, set aside the 
order of default of 14 February 1948 and the judgment on the merits rendered on 
28 July 1948, allowed the respondent to file her answer to the complaint within 
five days from receipt of the order, and (greeted the case set for trial at the 
earliest date available.
<p>Claiming that the respondent Judge acted without or exceeded his jurisdiction 
in issuing the last order of 8 July 1949, because the petition for relief from 
the order of default was filed beyond the period of six months from the issuance 
of such order pursuant to section 3, Rule 38, the petitioners pray for a writ of 
certiorari with preliminary injunction. On 28 July 1949, a writ of preliminary 
injunction was issued by this Court.</p>
<p>The hearing of this case was delayed due to the agreement of the parties not 
to set the case for hearing until further move by either of them, for 
negotiation was being undertaken to settle the case amicably.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The petition was heard on 29 April 
1955.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>On 14 February 1948 the respondent Gana, defendant in the action brought in 
the respondent court, was adjudged in default. On 31 August 1948, or six months 
and seventeen days after the order of default had been entered, she filed a 
petition for relief from such order. A petition to set aside a judgment, order, 
or other proceedings must be filed within 60 days after the petitioner learns of 
such, judgment, order or proceeding to be set aside,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and not more than six months after such 
judgment or order had been entered, or such proceeding had been taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> These periods are not extendible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Her petition for relief from the order of 
default should have been denied, because although it was filed within sixty days 
after the respondent had learned of the order, as claimed by her, still it was 
beyond the six-month period provided for in the rule. The first period of six 
days is subject to the six-month period provided for in the rule, so that even 
if the petition for relief be filed within six days after he or she had learned 
of the judgment, order, or proceeding, if it is filed beyond, the period of six 
months after entry of such judgment, order, or proceeding, the relief provided 
for in Rule 38 is no longer available.</p>
<p>The writ prayed for is granted. The orders of 8 and 16 July 1949 entered by 
the respondent court are set aside and the writ of preliminary injunction 
heretofore issued is made final.</p>
