				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div align="justify">The central issue in this litigation concerns the validity of the Romulo-Snyder Agreement (1950)&nbsp; whereby the Philippine Government undertook to return&nbsp; to the United States Government in ten&nbsp; annual installments, a total of about 35-million dollars advanced by the United States to, but unexpended by, the National Defense Forces of the Philippines.<br><br>In October 1954, the Usaffe Veterans Associations Inc., hereafter called Usaffe Veterans, for itself and for&nbsp; many other Filipino veterans of&nbsp; World War II, ex-members of the United States Armed Forces in the Far&nbsp; East (USAFFE) prayed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its complaint before the Manila court of first instance that said Agreement be&nbsp; annulled, that payments thereunder be declared illegal and that defendants as officers of the Philippine Republic&nbsp; be restrained from disbursing any&nbsp; funds in the National Treasury in pursuance of said Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Usaffe Veterans further asked that the moneys available, instead of being remitted to the United States, should be turned over to the Finance Service&nbsp; of the Armed Forces of the Philippines for the payment of all pending claims of the veterans represented by plaintiff.<br><br>The complaint rested on plaintiff's&nbsp; three propositions: first, that J;he funds to be "returned" under the Agreement were&nbsp; funds appropriated by the American&nbsp; Congress for the Philippine Army, actually delivered to the Philippine Government <i>and actually owned</i> by the said Government; second, that U. S. Secretary Snyder of the Treasury, had no authority to retake such funds from the&nbsp; P, I, Government; and third, that Philippine Foreign Secretary Carlos P. Romulo&nbsp; had&nbsp; no authority to&nbsp; return or promise&nbsp; to&nbsp; return the aforesaid sums of money through the so-called Romulo-Snyder&nbsp; Agreement. <br><br>The defendants moved to dismiss, alleging Governmental immunity from&nbsp; suit.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the court required an answer, and then heard the&nbsp; case on the merits.&nbsp; Thereafter,&nbsp; it dismissed the complaint, upheld the validity of the Agreement and dissolved the preliminary injunction it had previously issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff appealed.<br><br>On July 26,1941, foreseeing the War in the Pacific,&nbsp; President&nbsp; Franklin&nbsp; D. Roosevelt, called into&nbsp; the&nbsp; service&nbsp; of the Armed&nbsp; Forces of the United States, for the duration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; emergency, all&nbsp; the organized&nbsp; military&nbsp; forces&nbsp; of the Philippine Commonwealth.&nbsp;&nbsp; His order was published here&nbsp; by Proclamation No. 740&nbsp; of President Quezon&nbsp; on August 10,&nbsp; 1941.&nbsp; In&nbsp; October 1941, by two special orders, General Douglas MacArthur, Commanding&nbsp; General of the United&nbsp; States Army&nbsp; Forces&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Far East (known&nbsp; as USAFFE)&nbsp; placed&nbsp; under his&nbsp; command&nbsp; all&nbsp; the Philippine Army units including the Philippine Constabulary,&nbsp; about 100,000 officers and soldiers.<br><br>For the expenses incident to such incorporation, mobilization and&nbsp; activities,&nbsp; the Congress of the United States provided in its Appropriation Act of December&nbsp; 17, 1941 (Public Law No. 353, 77th Congress) as follows:<br><blockquote>"For all expenses necessary for the mobilization, operation&nbsp; and maintenance of&nbsp; the Army&nbsp; of the Philippines, including expenses connected with calling into&nbsp; the service of the armed forces of the United States the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines,&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; but shall be expended and&nbsp; accounted for&nbsp; in the manner prescribed by the President of the United States,&nbsp; $269,000.00; to remain available&nbsp; until June 30, 1943, <i>which shall&nbsp; be available for payment to the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines upon its written request,&nbsp; either in advance of or in reimbursement for all or any part of the estimated or actual costs, as authorized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commanding General, United States Army Forces in the Far&nbsp; East,</i> of necessary expenses&nbsp; for the purposes aforesaid, *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." (Italics Ours.)<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; subsequent Acts,&nbsp; the U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; appropriated moneys in language identical to the above: $28,313,000.00 for the fiscal year ending June 30,&nbsp; 1943; and $100,000,000 each year, for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1944, June 30, 1945, and&nbsp; June 30, 1946<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The last pertinent appropriation was Public Law No. 301 (79th Congress)&nbsp; known as the&nbsp; Rescission Act.&nbsp; It simply&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside 200 million dollars&nbsp; for the&nbsp; Army&nbsp; of the Philippines for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1946. <br><br>Now,&nbsp; pursuant to&nbsp; the power reserved to&nbsp; him under Public Law 353 above-quoted,&nbsp; President Roosevelt issued on&nbsp; January 3,&nbsp; 1942,&nbsp; his&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Order No. 9011 prescribing partly as follows:<br><blockquote>"2. (<i>a</i>) Necessary expenditures from&nbsp; funds in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Treasury for the purposes authorized by the&nbsp; Act of December 17, 1941, will be made by disbursing&nbsp; officers of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Army of&nbsp; the Philippines <i>on the&nbsp; approval of authority of the Commanding General, United States Army Forces in the Far East,</i> and such purposes as he may deem proper, and his&nbsp; determination thereon shall be final and conclusive upon the accounting officers of the Philippine Government, and such expenditures will be accounted for in accordance with procedures established by Philippine Commonwealth Laws and regulations."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics Ours.)<br></blockquote>Out of the total&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; thus&nbsp; appropriated by&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States Congress as above itemized, P570,863,000.00 was transferred directly to The Philippine Armed&nbsp; Forces by&nbsp; means of&nbsp; vouchers&nbsp; which stated "Advance of Funds under Public Law 353-77th Congress and Executive Order No. 9011".&nbsp; This amount was used (mostly) to discharge in the Philippine Islands the monetary obligations assumed by the&nbsp; U. S. Government as a&nbsp; result of the induction of the Philippine&nbsp; Armed Forces into the U. S.&nbsp; Army, and of its operations beginning in 1941. Part of these obligations consisted in the claims of Filipino&nbsp; USAFFE soldiers for arrears&nbsp; in&nbsp; pay and&nbsp; in the charges&nbsp; for&nbsp; supplies used&nbsp; by them and the&nbsp; guerrillas.<br><br>Of the millions so transferred,&nbsp; there remained unexpended and uncommitted in the possession&nbsp; of the Philippine Armed Forces&nbsp; as&nbsp; of December&nbsp; 01, 1949,&nbsp; about 35 million dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp; As at that time, the Philippine Government badly needed funds for its activities, President Quirino, through Governor Miguel&nbsp; Cuaderno&nbsp; of the Central Bank proposed to the corresponding&nbsp; officials of the U. S. Government the retention of the&nbsp; 35-million dollars as a loan, and for its repayment in ten&nbsp; annual installments. After protracted negotiations the deal was concluded, and the Romulo-Snyder Agreement was signed in Washington on November 6,&nbsp; 1950, by the then Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs,&nbsp; Carlos P. Romulo, and the then American Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Snyder. Principal stipulation therein was this paragraph:<br><blockquote>"3. The Government of the Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; further agrees to pay the dollar amount payable hereunder to the Secretary of the&nbsp; Treasury of the United States in ten&nbsp; annual installments, the first nine payments to be in&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of P3,500,000.00 and the&nbsp; final residual&nbsp; payment' to be in the&nbsp; amount determined by deducting the&nbsp; total&nbsp; of the previous&nbsp; principal payments from the total&nbsp; amount of dollars to be paid to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the latter amount to be determined as provided in Article II hereof.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>It should be&nbsp; added that the&nbsp; agreement, made&nbsp; on the basis of the parties'&nbsp; belief that 35-million was the&nbsp; outstanding balance, provided in its&nbsp; article II for an audit by appropriate officers to compute&nbsp; the exact amount&nbsp; due.<br><br>In compliance with the Agreement,&nbsp; this Government has appropriated by law and paid to the United States up to and including 1954, yearly installments totalling P33,187,663.24.<br>There is no reason to doubt that subsequent budgets failed to&nbsp; make&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; appropriations&nbsp; for other installments.<br><br>In this appeal, the&nbsp; Usaffe Veterans reiterated with extended arguments, their&nbsp; basic propositions.&nbsp; They insist: first, the money&nbsp; delivered by&nbsp; the U. S.&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Armed Forces of&nbsp; the Philippine Island&nbsp; were straight payments for&nbsp; military&nbsp; services; ownership thereof&nbsp; vested&nbsp; in the Philippine&nbsp; Government upon&nbsp; delivery, and consequently, there was nothing to return, nothing to consider as a loan; and&nbsp; second, the Romulo-Snyder Agreement was void because there was no loan to be repaid and because it was not&nbsp; binding&nbsp; on the Philippine&nbsp; Government for lack of authority of the officers who concluded the same.<br><br>With regard to the first point, it must be remembered that the first Congressional Act&nbsp; of December&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1941 (Public Law&nbsp; No. 353) appropriating $269-million-expressly said the amount "shall be available for payment to the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines upon its written request, either <i>in advance of or in reimbursement</i> for all or any part of the estimated or actual costs" of operation, mobilization and maintenance&nbsp; of the Philippine Army.&nbsp; Note carefully, the money is to be handed to the Philippine Government either&nbsp; in advance of expenditures or <i>in reimbursement thereof</i>.&nbsp; AH the vouchers signed upon receipt of&nbsp; the money state clearly,&nbsp; "Advance of funds under&nbsp; Public Law 353-7th Congress and Executive Order No.&nbsp; 9011".<br><br>In any system of accounting, advances of funds&nbsp; for expenditures&nbsp; contemplate disbursements to be reported,&nbsp; and credited if approved,&nbsp; against such advances, the unexpended&nbsp; sums to be returned later.&nbsp; In fact, the Congressional law&nbsp; itself required accounting "in the manner prescribed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the President of the U.S." and said President in his Executive&nbsp; Order No. 9011, outlined the procedure whereby advanced funds shall&nbsp; be accounted for.&nbsp; Furthermore, it requires as a&nbsp; condition <i>sine qua non</i>&nbsp; that all expenditures&nbsp; shall first be approved by the&nbsp; Commanding-General, United States Army Forces in the Far East.<br><br>Now, these ideas of "funds&nbsp; advanced" to meet&nbsp; such expenditures&nbsp; of the Philippine Army as may be&nbsp; approved by the USAFFE Commanding-General, in connection with the requirement of accounting therefor evidently contradict appellant's thesis that the moneys represented <i>straight payments</i> to the Philippine Government for its armed services, and&nbsp; passed into the absolute control of such Government.<br><br>In fact,&nbsp; the respective army officers&nbsp; of&nbsp; both nations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> who are presumed to know their business, have consistently regarded the money as funds <i>advanced</i>, to be subsequently accounted for—which&nbsp; means&nbsp; submission of expenditures, and if approved, return&nbsp; of unexpended balance.<br><br>Now then, it is undeniable that upon a&nbsp; final rendition of accounts by the Philippine&nbsp; Government, a superabit resulted of at least 35 million dollars in favor of the U.S. Instead of returning such amount in&nbsp; one lump sum, our Executive Department arranged for its&nbsp; repayment in ten annual installments. <i>Prima facie</i> such arrangement should raise&nbsp; no valid&nbsp; objection, given the obligation to return— which we know exists.<br><br>Yet plaintiff attempts&nbsp; to block such repayment because many alleged&nbsp; claims of veterans&nbsp; have not been processed and paid,&nbsp; December 31,&nbsp; 1949, having been fixed as the deadline&nbsp; for the presentation and/or payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; such claims.&nbsp; Plaintiff obviously calculates that&nbsp; if&nbsp; the return is prevented and the money kept here,&nbsp; it&nbsp; might&nbsp; manage to persuade the powers-that-be to extend the&nbsp; deadline anew. Hence the two-pronged attack: (<i>a</i>)&nbsp; no obligation to repay; (<i>b</i>) the officers who promised to&nbsp; repay&nbsp; had no authority to bind this Government.<br><br>The first ground&nbsp; has proved untenable.<br><br>On&nbsp; the second, there is no doubt that&nbsp; President Quirino approved the negotiations.&nbsp; And he had&nbsp; power to&nbsp; contract budgetary&nbsp; loans&nbsp; under Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 213, amending Republic Act No. 16.&nbsp; The most important argument, however, rests on&nbsp; the lack&nbsp; of ratification of the&nbsp; Agreement by the Senate of the Philippines to&nbsp; make it binding on this Government.&nbsp; On this&nbsp; matter, the defendants explain as follows:<br><blockquote>"That the agreement is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a 'treaty' as that term is&nbsp; used in the&nbsp; Constitution,&nbsp; is conceded. The agreement was never submitted to the Senate for concurrence (Art. VII, Sec. 10 (7).&nbsp; However, it must be noted that a treaty is not the&nbsp; only form that an international agreement&nbsp; may assume.&nbsp; For&nbsp; the&nbsp; grant&nbsp; of the&nbsp; treaty-making power to the&nbsp; Executive and&nbsp; the Senate does&nbsp; not&nbsp; exhaust the&nbsp; power of the government over international relations.&nbsp; Consequently, executive agreements may be entered into with other" states and are&nbsp; effective even&nbsp; without&nbsp; the&nbsp; concurrence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Senate (Sinco, Philippine Political Law, 10th ed.,&nbsp; 303; Tañada and Fernando,&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines, 4th ed., Vol. II, 1050).&nbsp; It is observed in this connection&nbsp; that&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; point&nbsp; of&nbsp; view&nbsp; of international law, there is&nbsp; no difference&nbsp; between treaties and executive agreements in&nbsp; their binding effect upon&nbsp; states concerned as long as the&nbsp; negotiating functionaries&nbsp; have remained within their powers (Hackworth, Digest&nbsp; of International Law, Vol. 5, 395, citing U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Belmont,&nbsp; 301 U. S.&nbsp; 342, State of Russia&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> National City Bank of New York, 69 F. (2d)&nbsp; 44; United States <i>vs.</i> Pink, 315&nbsp; U. S.&nbsp; 203;, Altman &amp;&nbsp; Co., <i>vs.</i> United States, 224 U.&nbsp; S. 583. See also McDougal and Lans, "Treaties and&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Agreements 54 Yale Law Journal 181,&nbsp; 318,&nbsp; et seg.;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Sinco;&nbsp; Op. cit. 305) 'The distinction between so-called executive agreements' and 'treaties' is purely&nbsp; a constitutional one&nbsp; and has no international legal significance' (Research in International Law, Draft Convention&nbsp; on the Law of Treaties&nbsp; (Harvard Law School),&nbsp; Comment, 29 Am. J. Int.) Law Supp. 653, 897.&nbsp; See also Hackworth, op/cit. 391).<br><br>"There are now various forms&nbsp; of such pacts&nbsp; or agreements&nbsp; entered into by and between&nbsp; sovereign states which do not necessarily come under&nbsp; the&nbsp; strict&nbsp; sense&nbsp; of' a&nbsp; treaty and Which do&nbsp; not&nbsp; require ratification or consent of the legislative body&nbsp; of the State, but nevertheless,&nbsp; are&nbsp; considered&nbsp; valid international&nbsp; agreements.&nbsp; In a survey&nbsp; of the&nbsp; practice of&nbsp; States&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; Harvard&nbsp; Research in the Draft&nbsp; Convention in the&nbsp; Law&nbsp; of Treaties (1935, pp. 711-713) it has been shown that there had been more executive&nbsp; agreements entered&nbsp; into by States than treaties&nbsp; (Hudson, International&nbsp; Legislation,&nbsp; I, p. ixii-xcvii). <br><br>"In the leading case&nbsp; of Altman <i>vs.</i> U. S., 224, U. S. 583,&nbsp; it was held&nbsp; that Jan international&nbsp; compact negotiated between the&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; two&nbsp; sovereign nations and made in the name&nbsp; and or behalf of the contracting parties and dealing with important commercial&nbsp; relations between the two countries, is a treaty both internationally although, as&nbsp; an executive agreement it&nbsp; is not technically a&nbsp; treaty requiring the advice and consent of the&nbsp; Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Herbert Briggs, The Law of Nations, 1947 ed., p.&nbsp; 489). "Nature of Executive Agreements"<br><br>"Executive&nbsp; Agreements fall&nbsp; into&nbsp; two classes:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; agreements made purely as executive acts&nbsp; affecting external relations and independent of or without legislative authorization, which may&nbsp; be termed as presidential agreements, and (2) agreements entered into in pursuance of acts of Congress, which have&nbsp; been&nbsp; designated&nbsp; as Congressional-Executive Agreements&nbsp; (Sinco, supra, 304; Hackworth, supra, 390; McDougal and&nbsp; Lans,&nbsp;&nbsp; supra,&nbsp; 204-205;&nbsp; Hyke,&nbsp; International Law, 2nd ed., Vol. II, 1406;&nbsp; et seq.)<br><br>"The Romulo-Snyder Agreement may fall under any of&nbsp; these two classes, for precisely on September 18, 1946, Congress of the Philippines specifically&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; the. President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; to obtain such loans&nbsp; <m incur="" such="" indebtedness="" with ="" the ="" government="" of="" the="" united="" states,="" its="" agencies ="" or="" instrumentalities ="" (republic="" act ="" 16,="" september="" 18,="" 1946,="" amended="" by="" republic="" act="" no.="" 213,="" june="" 1, ="" 1948). ="" * ="" *=""><br><br>"Even granting, arguendo,&nbsp; that there was no legislative authorization, it&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; maintained that&nbsp; the Romulo-Snyder Agreement was&nbsp; legally and validly entered into&nbsp; to conform to&nbsp; the second category, namely, 'agreements entered&nbsp; into purely as executive acts without legislative authorization/ This&nbsp; second category usually includes money agreements relating to the settlement of&nbsp; pecuniary claims of citizens.&nbsp; It may be&nbsp; said that this&nbsp; method of settling such claims has come to be the&nbsp; usual way of dealing with matters of this kind&nbsp; (Memorandum of the&nbsp; Solicitor of the Department of State (Nielson) sent to Senator Lodge by the&nbsp; Under-Secretary of State (Philip), August 23,1922, MS Dept. of&nbsp; State, file 711.00/98a)."</m><br></blockquote>Such considerations seem persuasive; indeed, the Agreement was not submitted&nbsp; to the&nbsp; U.S. Senate either; but we&nbsp; do not stop to check the authorities&nbsp; above listed nor test the&nbsp; conclusions derived&nbsp; therefrom in order to render a definite pronouncement, for the reason that our Senate Resolution No. 15<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> practically admits the validity and binding&nbsp; force of such Agreement. Furthermore, the acts&nbsp; of Congress Appropriating funds&nbsp; for the yearly&nbsp; installments "necessary to&nbsp; comply&nbsp; with such Agreements&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; a ratification thereof,&nbsp; which places the&nbsp; question of validity out&nbsp; of the Court's reach, no constitutional principle having been invoked to restrict Congress' plenary power to appropriate funds—loan or no loan.<br><br>In conclusion, plaintiff,&nbsp; to say the least,&nbsp; failed to make a clear case&nbsp; for the&nbsp; relief&nbsp; demanded; its petition was, therefore, properly denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgment affirmed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
