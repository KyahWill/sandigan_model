				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a&nbsp; decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated December 15, 1956, assessing a tax of P5,639.17, on the&nbsp; gross receipts in the&nbsp; mixed&nbsp; sales&nbsp; and&nbsp; installation amounting to P1,021,600.44, received by the Eternit Corporation, from January,&nbsp; 1951 to June,&nbsp; 1955, which gross receipts&nbsp; is&nbsp; itemized&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%">"For asbestos products.</td> <td width="29%"><div align="right">P772,244.88</div></td> <td width="21%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>For accessories</td> <td> <div align="right">98,970.63</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>For Labor</td> <td><div align="right">149,044.63</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>For delivery charges</td> <td><div align="right">1,340.30</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><center>(p. 12, Brief for Appellant-Appellee<br>Eternit Corporation)<br></center><br>The Eternit Corporation is engaged in the manufacture of asbestos cement products, particularly asbestos&nbsp; corrugated&nbsp; sheets for roofing.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; its petition, it&nbsp; had been granted exemption from tax by reason of the fact that it is an essential and necessary industry, in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act&nbsp; Nos. 35 and 901.&nbsp; The&nbsp; exemption granted by the Secretary of Finance was extended until December 31, 1958&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; said&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 901,&nbsp; as per&nbsp; letter dated&nbsp; July 1,&nbsp; 1954, of the said Secretary.<br><br>The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed&nbsp; a&nbsp; tax of 3 per&nbsp; cent on the&nbsp; Eternit&nbsp; Corporation as contractor on the&nbsp; total&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P1,021,600.44, as above&nbsp; set forth.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this assessment Eternit Corporation appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals, claiming that no tax on&nbsp; the above amount is&nbsp; collectible for the same is free from any tax in accordance&nbsp; with the above-mentioned laws&nbsp; (Rep. Act Nos. 35&nbsp; and 901).&nbsp; The Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals held that the sum of P772,244.88, which represents the selling price&nbsp; of the&nbsp; asbestos products delivered, as well as&nbsp; the item of P98,970.63 for accessories, should be&nbsp; exempt from tax, but held that contractor's tax of 3 percent be&nbsp; assessed on the amount of&nbsp; P149,044.63.&nbsp; The tax assessed in accordance&nbsp; with this&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; is&nbsp; P5,639.17.&nbsp;&nbsp; Against&nbsp; this decision,&nbsp; both parties have&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to this Court.<br><br>The Collector of Internal Revenue argues that the gross receipts of&nbsp; the Eternit Corporation in the mixed&nbsp; sales-installation represents only&nbsp; 11.3 per cent of its total sales, so that the&nbsp; installation of the&nbsp; asbestos&nbsp; roofing manufactured by said corporation&nbsp; is not necessary to encourage the sale of its products and is not a&nbsp; part of such sales. It is further&nbsp; argued on behalf of the Collector that if the installation of the asbestos roofing were&nbsp; to be undertaken by another contractor, not the&nbsp; Eternit&nbsp; Corporation,&nbsp; the contractor would&nbsp; be required to pay a 3 per cent tax&nbsp; on the gross receipts as required&nbsp; by Section 191 of&nbsp; the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; finally argued&nbsp; that to exempt the Eternit Corporation from paying 3 per cent contractor's tax&nbsp; on&nbsp; its gross&nbsp; receipts&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; so-called mixed sales and&nbsp; installation is&nbsp; a violation of the rule of equality and&nbsp; uniformity of&nbsp; taxation&nbsp; and of the further rule that a statutory grant of&nbsp; exemption from taxation is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; strictly&nbsp; construed.<br><br>In answer&nbsp; to the above&nbsp; contentions, the Eternit Corporation claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; difficulty&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of its corrugated asbestos&nbsp; sheets&nbsp;&nbsp; is encountered because of&nbsp; difficulty&nbsp; in their installation; that to&nbsp; overcome this difficulty, it&nbsp; has been necessary to organize its&nbsp; own force of&nbsp; employees or laborers to make the&nbsp; installation of its&nbsp; sheets,&nbsp; especially for all customers who cannot afford to pay for competent engineers, or&nbsp; whose constructions&nbsp; do not justify&nbsp; the employment of&nbsp; such&nbsp; competent engineers.<br><br>The Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals adopted a middle ground, holding that the exemption&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Eternit&nbsp; Corporation should extend up to the end of the process of the manufacture and sale; that asbestos sheets can be&nbsp; manufactured without installation, and, on&nbsp; the other hand, installation is&nbsp; distinct and separate from&nbsp; manufacture.&nbsp; It ruled&nbsp; that to extend the exemption up to installation would be to&nbsp; unduly strain or stretch the idea of&nbsp; manufacture and also unduly extend the exemption granted under the law. It, therefore, held that the contractor's tax should&nbsp; be assessed on the amount of P149,044.63.<br><br>But it also refused to give validity to the&nbsp; contention of the Collector&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, reasoning that&nbsp; to impose the&nbsp; contractor's tax on the&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of the sheets installed, and not on the installation cost alone, would frustrate&nbsp; the exemption granted to petitioner Eternit&nbsp; Corporation from the&nbsp; payment of the "percentage tax on the sales&nbsp; of the manufactured&nbsp; products in respect to&nbsp; which exemption is granted."&nbsp; The exemption of the Eternit Corporation was, therefore,&nbsp; extended to the sale and delivery, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; asbestos&nbsp; roof manufactured.&nbsp;&nbsp; In such&nbsp; sale, the court&nbsp; said,&nbsp; the Eternit&nbsp; Corporation was engaged&nbsp; in the manufactured thereof, which is tax&nbsp; free; but in installing the same in the houses of&nbsp; its customers, it engages&nbsp; in another occupation, that of&nbsp; installation,&nbsp; which should be subject to tax.<br><br>We agree to the above reasoning and&nbsp; conclusions&nbsp; of the Court of Tax Appeals, in holding that the cost of the products installed should be free from tax&nbsp; under the exemption granted by&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 901,&nbsp; but&nbsp; refusing the claim of the corporation for exemption&nbsp; from paying the contractor's tax&nbsp; on the&nbsp; cost of the installation of sheets they had sold and delivered, because in this latter respect it is performing the work of a contractor, which is subject to another tax provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; law granting the exemption does not state exemption for the act of installation of its manufactured products, and under&nbsp; the rule of strict interpretation&nbsp; of laws granting&nbsp; tax exemptions, the sums received for installation can not&nbsp; be included in the general exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such sums, therefore, must be held subject to contractor's tax.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
