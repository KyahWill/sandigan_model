				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the court of first instance of Leyte, Gaudencio Nodalo, his 
father Leon, and his brothers Conrado and Atilano, were prosecuted for 
the murder of Fortunato Mareto.  Leon was discharged, at the request of 
the Fiscal, after the first witness had testified.  Conrado and Atilano 
were acquitted after the trial.  But Gaudencio was found guilty of 
homicide, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 14 yrs.,
 8 months and one day and to indemnify the heirs of the dead man in the 
amount of P2,000.00.  He appealed to the Court of Appeals.
  <p>  That court, believing the crime was murder punishable with life 
imprisonment, forwarded the record to us pursuant to statutory 
provisions.</p>
  <p>  After reviewing the expendiente, we also believe the offense was 
murder, the facts being as follows:</p>
  <p>  In the night of June 8, 1949, Dolores Mareto, 18, single, went to
 fetch water from the well near the house of her uncle Cipriano Iñon in 
barrio Dakhay, Dulag, Leyte.  There she was accosted by Gaudencio 
Nodalo, who lived nearby and who had been courting her.  Seizing her 
arms he pleaded with her to follow him.  But she struggled and screamed,
 calling her brother Fortunato who was in the house of Iñon.  Fortunato 
hurried down with a penknife but was intercepted by Atilano Nodalo who 
stabbed him, with a bolo, on the right breast.  Meanwhile, releasing 
Dolores, Gaudencio faced Fortunato and slashed him with a bolo on the 
left side of the head, inflicting on him a wound four inches long, one 
inch wide.  Conrado Nodalo joined the attack by cutting Fortunato's left
 shoulder with a big bolo known locally as dipang (American bolo).  As a
 consequence of the wounds Fortunato fell, and died soon after, that 
very evening.</p>
  <p>  Assuming full responsibility for the occurence to exclude his two
 brothers (who asserted they were in another town that night) Gaudencio 
claimed self-defense and swore that he met Fortunato at the well; that 
he demanded payment of Fortunato's one peso debt; that Fortunato 
resenting the demand opened a knife and attacked him (defendant); that 
he grappled with Fortunato, and succeeded in wrestling the weapon but 
found it necessary to stab the latter repeatedly to death.</p>
  <p>  Gaudencio's version is rather incredible, in view of the large 
wounds found on the cadaver by Eleno Martinez, sanitary inspector, who 
swore they could not have been inflicted with a penknife.  Besides it is
 unlikely that being smaller than Fortunato this appellant could finish 
the fight without a single scratch.  True, he said he was wounded on the
 right temporal region, and that the wound was treated by Martinez the 
next morning; but the sanitary inspector on rebuttal, affirmed that 
Gaudencio had not been treated by him for a wound on the head.</p>
  <p>  Consequently the story of the prosecution witnesses Dolores 
Maroto and Cipriano Iñon must be accepted, and the declaration made 
that, armed with bolos, the three brothers assaulted Fortunato that 
evening of June.  It was murder qualified by abuse of superior strength 
and the aid of armed men<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>. 
 Needless to say, in this instance the findings of the trial judge 
exonerating the other two brothers are not binding because the whole 
record is open for revision.  Nevertheless under the rules of jeopardy 
the said brothers of Gaudencio, are now beyond the reach of the 
prosecution and may not be punished for the same offense, they having 
been acquitted in the court below.</p>
  <p>  It appears that Gaudencio voluntarily surrender to the 
authorities.  That mitigating circumstance compensates the aggravation 
of night time.  Life is therefore indicated by Art. 248 and other 
provisions of the Revised Penal Code regarding application and 
graduation of penalties.</p>
  <p>  WHEREFORE, having committed murder, this appellant Gaudencio 
Nodalo, should be, as he is hereby, sentenced to reclusion perpetua, and
 to pay the indemnity prescribed in the appealed decision, which is 
affirmed with modification.  So ordered.</p>
