				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of Batangas the appellant opposed 
unsuccessfully the probate of what purports to be the last will and testament 
(Exh. "A") of Don Sixto Lopez, who died at the age of 83 in Balayan, Batangas, 
on March 3, 1947, almost six months after the document in question was executed. 
In the court below, the present appellant specified five grounds for his 
opposition, to wits (1) that the deceased never executed the alleged will; (2) 
that his signature appearing in said will was a forgery; (3) that at the time of 
the execution of the will, he was wanting in testamentary as well as mental 
capacity due to advanced age; (4) that, if he did ever execute said will, it was 
not executed and attested as required by law, and one of the alleged 
instrumental witnesses was incapacitated to act as such; and it was procured by 
duress, influence of fear and threats and undue and improper pressure and 
influence on the part of the beneficiaries instituted therein, principally the 
testator's sister, Clemencia Lopez, and the herein proponent, Jose S. Lopez; and 
(5) that the signature of the testator was procured by fraud or trick. 
<p>In this instance only one of these objections is reiterated, formulated in 
these words: "That the court <em>a quo</em> erred in holding that the document 
Exhibit 'A' was executed in all particulars as required by law". To this 
objection is added the alleged error of the court "in allowing the petitioner to 
introduce evidence that Exhibit 'A' was written in a language known to the 
decedent <em>after</em> petitioner rested his case and over the vigorous 
objection of the oppositor."</p>
<p>The will in question comprises two pages, each of which is written on one 
side of a separate sheet. The first sheet is not paged either in letters or in 
Arabic numerals. This, the appellant believes, is a fatal defect.</p>
<p>The purpose of the law in prescribing the paging of wills is to guard against 
fraud, and to afford means of preventing the substitution or of detecting the 
loss of any of its pages. (Abangan <em>vs.</em> Abangan, 40 Phil. 476) In the 
present case, the omission to put a page number on the first sheet, if that be 
necessary, is supplied by other forms of identification more trustworthy than 
the conventional numeral words or characters. The unnumbered page' is clearly 
identified as the first page by the internal sense of its contents considered in 
relation to the contents of the second page. By their meaning and coherence, the 
first and second lines on the second page are undeniably a continuation of the 
last sentence of the testament, before the attestation clause, which starts at 
the bottom of the preceding page. Furthermore, the unnumbered page contains the 
caption "TESTAMENTO", the invocation of the Almighty, and a recital that the 
testator was in the full use of his testamentary faculty, all of which, in the 
logical order of sequence, precede the direction for the disposition of the 
maker's property. Again, as page two contains only the two lines above 
mentioned, the attestation clause, the mark of the testator and the signatures 
of the witnesses, the other sheet can not by any possibility be taken for other 
than page one. Abangan <em>vs.</em> Abgangan, <em>supra</em>, and Fernandez 
<em>vs.</em> Vergel de Dios, 46 Phil., 922 are decisive of this issue.</p>
<p>Although not falling within the purview and scope of the first assignment of 
error, the matter of the credibility of the witnesses is assailed under this 
heading. On the merits we do not believe that the appellant's contention 
deserves serious consideration. Such contradictions in the testimony of the 
instrumental witnesses as are set out in the appellant's brief are incidents, 
not all of which every one of the witnesses can be supposed to have perceived, 
or to recall in the same order in which they occured.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyday life and the result of investigations made in the field of 
experimental psychology show that the contradictions of witnesses generally 
occur in the details of a certain incident, after a long series of questionings, 
and far from being an evidence of falsehood constitute a demonstration of good 
faith. Inasmuch as not all those who witness an incident are impressed in like 
manner, it is but natural that in relating their impressions they should not 
agree in the minor details; hence, the contradictions in their testimony." 
(People <em>vs.</em> Limbo, 49 Phil. 99.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The testator affixed his thumbmark to the instrument instead of signing his 
name. The reason for this was that the testator was suffering from "partial 
paralysis". While another in testator's place might have directed someone else 
to sign for him, as appellant contends should have been done, there is nothing 
curious or suspicious in the fact that the testator chose the use of mark as the 
means of authenticating his will. It was a matter of taste or preference. Both 
ways are good. A statute requiring a will to be "signed" is satisfied if the 
signature is made by the testator's mark. (De Gala <em>vs.</em> Gonzales and 
Ona, 53 Phil. 108; 28 R. C. L., 117.)</p>
<p>With reference to the second assignment of error, we do not share the opinion 
that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in allowing the appellant 
to offer evidence to prove knowledge of Spanish by the testator, the language in 
which the will is drawn, after the petitioner had rested his case and after the 
opponent had moved for dismissal of the petition on the ground of insufficiency 
of evidence. It is within the discretion of the court whether or not to admit 
further evidence after the party offering the evidence has rested, and this 
discretion will not be reviewed except where it has clearly been abused. (64 C. 
J., 160.) More, it is within the sound discretion of the court whether or not it 
will allow the case to by reopened for the further introduction of evidence 
after' a motion or request for a nonsuit, or a <em>demurrer to the 
evidence,</em> and the case may be reopened after the court has announced its 
intention as to its ruling on the request, motion, or demurrer, or has granted 
it or has denied the same, or after the motion has been granted, if the order 
has not been written, or entered upon the minutes or signed.(64 C. J., 164.)</p>
<p>In this jurisdiction this rule has been followed. After the parties have 
produced their respective direct proofs, they are allowed to offer rebutting 
evidence only, but, it has been held, the court, for good reasons, in the 
furtherance of justice, may permit them to offer evidence upon their original 
case, and its ruling will not be disturbed in the appellate court where no abuse 
of discretion appears. (Siuliong &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Ylagan, 43 Phil. 393; U. 
S. <em>vs.</em> Alviar, 36 Phil. 804.) So, generally, additional evidence is 
allowed when it is newly discovered, or where it has been omitted through 
inadvertence or mistake, or where the purpose of the evidence is to correct 
evidence previously offered. (I Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 2nd ed., 
545; 64 C. J., 160-163.) The ommission to present evidence on the testator's 
knowledge of Spanish had not been deliberate. It was due to a misapprehension or 
oversight.</p>
<p>Although alien to the second assignment of error, the appellant impugns the 
will for its silence on the testator's understanding of the language used in the 
testament. There ?is no statutory requirement that such knowledge be expressly 
stated in the will itself. It is a matter that may be Established by proof 
aliunde. This Court so impliedly ruled in Gonzales <em>vs.</em> Laurel, 46 Phil. 
781, in which the probate of a will written in Tagalog was ordered although it 
did not say that the testator knew that idiom. In fact, there was not even 
extraneous proof on the subject other than the fact that the testator resided in 
a Tagalog region, from which the court said "a presumption arises that said 
Maria Tapia knew the Tagalog dialect."</p>
<p>The order of the lower court ordering the probate of the last will and 
testament of Don Sixto Lopez is affirmed, costs.</p>
